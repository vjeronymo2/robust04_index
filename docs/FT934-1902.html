			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sweb freezes domestic prices South Western Electricity yesterday pledged to freeze its prices for domestic consumers until April 1995 as it announced a 28 per cent increase in profits and a 19 per cent dividend rise. The Bristol-based distributor made Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 23.9m) before tax in the six months to September 30 - in line with market expectations. Turnover for the period rose slightly from Pounds 381.4m to Pounds 385.8m. Mr John Seed, chief executive, described the outcome as 'a sound set of results'. One of the main contributors was the continuing drop in costs, which are targeted for a 10 per cent reduction - a further 250 jobs are to go over the next four months. There was also a 2.1 per cent rise in electricity units distributed. However, the company emphasised that profits were boosted by a Pounds 2.8m drop in net interest, thanks to the large positive cash balance resulting from changes in the timing of coal contract payments. There was also a Pounds 1.3m contribution from Sweb's share in the newly-completed Teesside power station. The retailing business reduced operating losses from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 1m, and Mr Seed said he expected it to be breaking even by the end of the financial year. The price freeze, which follows a Pounds 9 rebate for household customers earlier this autumn, will mean that Sweb will effectively hold charges level for three years. Earnings per share improved to 19.9p (15.1p). The dividend rise, which takes the payment from 5.9p to 7p, was lower than that of some other recs, but Mr Seed said it was 'reasonable'. COMMENT The headline profit rise is misleading, as the company took some trouble to point out yesterday, thanks largely to fortuitous changes in coal contracts. The underlying growth is closer to 15 per cent, which makes this a steady, middle-of-the-road set of results underpinned by cost cutting and improvements in associated activities such as retailing. The dividend increase was the standard for the sector. The prospective yield of just under 4 per cent puts Sweb in the middle of the field.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ONE WATCHES U.S. DEFEAT BERMUDA  </P> <P> With no advance word or publicity about the game and no fans, the United States  played a surprise soccer match against Bermuda Tuesday and won, 2-1, as Hugo  Perez returned to the lineup.  </P> <P> The Americans, preparing for Sunday's World Cup qualifier at Trinidad and  Tobago, got second-half goals from John Doyle and Eric Eichmann to take a 2-0  lead.  </P> <P> Perez, who tore a groin muscle on Sept. 29 while playing for Red Star 96 of the  French second division, missed the last two World Cup qualifiers, both  scoreless ties. Perez, a 26-year-old midfielder from San Diego who was born in  El Salvador, is considered the most creative offensive player on the team.  </P> <P> The United States (4-3-3 in 1989), is 3-1-3 in World Cup qualifying, tied for  second place with Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago would advance in the  event of a tie against the United States because of a better goal differential.  </P></p>

"I was told as I was  planting grass that I did an OK job," Quayle said.  </P> <P> "There's a job after the vice presidency."  </P> <P> * Disclosure: Marvin Liebman, a founder of the modern conservative movement,  announced his homosexuality Tuesday, hoping to counter what he calls the  homophobia in right-wing politics. Liebman, 67, made the announcement in  William F. Buckley's conservative National Review and in the Advocate, a gay  magazine. Liebman helped found the National Review and the Young Americans for  Freedom and worked for the American Conservative Union.  </P> <P> * Miles to Go: Gov. John Ashcroft signed legislation Tuesday in Springfield,  Mo., that made his state the first to give nostalgic Route 66 historic status.  U.S. 66 was made famous by the 1960s television show "Route 66" and by a song  performed by the Rolling Stones. The narrow road carried thousands of  Midwestern job-seekers to Southern California.  </P> <P> * Higher Calling: Watergate conspirator Jeb Stuart Magruder has been  recommended for senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Lexington,  Ky. Magruder is a pastor in Columbus, Ohio. "I would be able to preach more and  play the principal leadership role," he said. Magruder served a prison term for  directing the wiretapping of the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate  building and other crimes.  </P></p>

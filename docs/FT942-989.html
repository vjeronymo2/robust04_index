			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Slow progress on women's earnings Women may have to wait until the year 2025 before they earn the same pay as men, says a report today from the Labour Research Department, a union-funded body. In 1970, before the first Equal Pay Act, women earned 63 per cent of men's hourly pay. The proportion increased to 79 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan profits plunge 30% JP Morgan, the US bank, reported a 30 per cent slide in third-quarter after-tax profits from the record level of a year before. Weaker profits from trading in financial markets, a steep fall-off in underwriting fees and a loss on foreign government bonds held as investments were behind the decline. The fall-off in earnings at JP Morgan, while in line with market expectations, highlights the continuing difficult trading conditions in financial markets around the world. The volatile and unexpected price movements of the first half of the year, particularly in worldwide bond markets, have given way to thin and erratic trading in more recent months. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, who steps down as chairman of the US bank at the end of this year, said market conditions continued to be difficult in the latest period, but he was pleased with the bank's overall performance. The biggest dent to JP Morgan's earnings came from a decline in trading revenues to Dollars 282m from Dollars 464m the year before. This was, however, an improvement on the Dollars 228m of the second three months of 1994. The greatest contributions to profit came from swaps and bonds, particularly in the emerging markets. Earlier this year, losses in the emerging markets had been a significant factor in the decline in trading profits. The bank's trading revenues so far this year are running 40 per cent below their level of 1993, when soaring bond markets bolstered the profits of many commercial and investment banks. Movements in the financial markets also led Morgan to report a net investment loss of Dollars 27m, principally resulting from the sale of non-US government bonds. A year before, it had reported investment gains of Dollars 98m. However, trading in interest-rate instruments added Dollars 73m to the bank's net interest income, up from Dollars 10m the previous year. Largely as a result, net interest income was up 20 per cent at Dollars 526m. The uncertainties in financial markets also hit Morgan's underwriting fees in the three months to the end of September: these totalled Dollars 22m, down from Dollars 56m a year before. As a result, corporate finance fees as a whole dropped by 23 per cent, to Dollars 108m. Overall, non-interest income dropped by almost a quarter, to Dollars 906m. With expenses growing by 7 per cent, due largely to higher staffing levels, the bank's net profits fell to Dollars 327m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from Dollars 468m or Dollars 2.30 a year before.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, who has  been visiting Okinawa, held a news conference on 12 April at the  U.S. Consulate in Urasoe City, Okinawa, and commented on the  issue of the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield. He indicated  a bright outlook, saying: "I have the impression that progress  will be made in bilateral negotiations. We should see some kind  of results in the future." However, he failed to comment on  such points as the specific period of return of the airfield and  how the issue is being handled in bilateral talks.    About a recent U.S. military aircraft mishap, municipal  government authorities from areas surrounding Kadena Air Base  have demanded public disclosure of outcome of investigations  into the cause of the accident. In this regard, Mondale kept  his comments short, saying: "As the ambassador, I am hoping that  a disclosure will be made." He thus indicated the matter would  be left for further consideration by authorities concerned,  including the military. The ambassador departed Okinawa after  the news conference.    On the U.S. military base issues, Mondale told reporters:  "Since this is my first visit to Okinawa, I cannot answer in  detail." He then stressed: "The United States and Japan are  continuing to make efforts toward improving the situation,  including such problems as aircraft noise."    On the concentration of U.S. military bases on Okinawa,  Mondale said: "The scale of military bases and activities here  remain the sole responsibility of the United States." However,  he added: "As a signatory of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the  United States bears a serious responsibility to defend Japan and  the surrounding area." He thus reiterated the traditional U.S.  stance, stressing the importance of U.S. military presence to  respond to possible tension in the Asian region and making other  similar references.    Although the ambassador failed to make in-depth comments on  the issue of the scaling down of U.S. military bases on Okinawa,  he did comment on the issue of the return of Yomitan auxiliary  airfield, which was discussed at last month's Japan-U.S.  security talks. Mondale said: "Although it will require  persistence, some kind of results should appear in the future."  He thus gave a strong impression the airfield would be returned.    U.S. Consul General for Okinawa Richard Christenson, who was  present at the news conference, said: "Negotiations are being  continued between the United States and Japan, but it will take  more time."</p>

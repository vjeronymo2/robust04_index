			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Stakes are raised in the card game / Analysis of two moves into a saturated market The US credit card market is gearing itself for a season of stiff competition, spurred by the arrival over the past two weeks of two non-bank contenders with potentially enormous financial and marketing clout. General Motors, the leading US carmaker, and General Electric Capital, the conglomerate's financial services arm, have jumped into the credit card market with specially tailored MasterCards aimed at stimulating their product sales and competing with bank issuers of plastic cards. Credit card industry analysts say the market is taking seriously the challenge from companies such as GM and GE, respectively the first and fifth ranking Fortune 500 US corporations. However, the decision to join a fairly saturated national market with already more than 1bn cards in circulation is a curious move, especially in light of the US economy. Given the crisis of American consumer confidence - caused partly by recession and partly by the indebtedness of many individuals - it would seem at first glance there has rarely been a worse time for entrants in the crowded and competitive US credit card market. The reason is summed up by Mr David Robertson, president of The Nilson Report, a leading credit card industry newsletter: 'What you have in a nutshell is the realisation that the market in the US is saturated. There aren't that many new customers coming in who are creditworthy. Issuers therefore have to identify what will be successful in marketing, what will make consumers change cards. The answer is the offering of value by way of incentives, discounts and partnerships.' The GE Rewards card, launched two weeks ago, offers discounts on GE appliance purchases and rebates from 24 retailers, airlines, hotel chains and other corporate partners. But it comes with a Dollars 25 (Pounds 12.60) annual fee and an interest rate a percentage point higher than the national average of 17.5 per cent. The GM Card is potentially more attractive to the middle market because it carries no fee and is priced with an adjustable interest rate of 10.4 percentage points above the prime, which means the present rate is 16.4 per cent. Like the GE card there are also airline and hotel partners. The GM card's most important feature, however, is that it offers consumers a 5 per cent rebate on purchases - for use against the purchase of a new GM car or truck - that could total Dollars 3,500 over seven years. 'The credit card we are unveiling,' said Mr Ron Zebeck, GM's head of card operations, 'is designed to put people into new GM vehicles.' Nor is GM sparing any cost. It is mailing to some 30m consumers pre-approved card applications and is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising. Mr Robertson says GM may generate up to 2m card accounts over the next 18 months, while GE, which already has a card business with Dollars 2.4bn of receivables through its outstanding Visa and MasterCard base, should get about 500,000 accounts. These are big numbers, but then so is the number of cards achieved by another non-bank - American Telephone &amp; Telegraph - since launching its Universal credit card in March 1990: AT&amp;T now has 14m cardholders, with Dollars 4.7bn of receivables outstanding. So what is behind the new surge in non-bank credit cards? One answer is that, saturated or not, the US credit card market remains profitable. The average return on assets on credit card operations is 2 per cent to 3 per cent, better than the average 1 per cent return most banks achieve on their primary lending business. Another question raised by the arrival of groups such as AT&amp;T, GM and GE is the impact on bank issuers. Mr Don McWhorter, president of Banc One, the Ohio-based bank with several million card-holders around the US, says more competitors will mean increasing consolidation of the market. Marginal players will lose out and the biggest issuers will do best. As for the GM and GE cards, Mr McWhorter admits they could garner market share: 'Clearly, when somebody like GM or GE decides they want to get into the business, they will have an impact because of their size. We ourselves had many discussions with General Motors and we opted not to do the card with them.' At Salomon Brothers, Ms Diane Glossman, a vice-president and banking analyst, forecasts lower fees and lower interest rates in future, leading to a narrowing of margins for issuers. At American Express, whose Optima credit card division has struggled with heavy losses over the past year, Mr Ken Chenault, president of the consumer card business, says GM-style cards will cause cost-conscious customers to switch away from bank issuers. The bottom line comes from Nilson's Mr Robertson: 'The more cards you dump into the market the more you affect the usage of existing cards. So the existing players will have to add new incentives to their cards. The name of the game will be to add bells and whistles to cards.' It is not clear, however, how much the US consumer will be motivated by the incentives, rebates and discounts. If nothing else, the GM and GE cards will offer an acid test of the degree to which Americans are prepared to switch in search of value.  -----------------------------------------------------------             TOP 10 US ISSUERS OF CREDIT CARDS                   (ranked by outstandings)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Issuer                              Outstandings       Cards                                     (Dollars bn)        (m)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Citibank                                34.01          30.0 Discover Card                           15.46          41.2 Chase Manhattan                          9.86          13.7 MBNA America                             8.29           7.0 Bank of America                          7.64           9.6 First Chicago                            7.05          11.0 Chemical Banking                         5.53           6.6 American Express Optima                  4.95           3.6 AT&amp;T Universal                           4.70          14.0 Bank of New York                         4.16           4.8  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: 1992 The Nilson Report, Santa Monic, Calif.  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

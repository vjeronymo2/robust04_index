			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (17): Lessons for today - Labour's beacon of hope would seem to have all the promise of a Cornish wrecker's lantern / Unemployment policy 'IDLE HANDS, THE EXPERIENCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, 1790 TO 1990' By John Burnett Routledge, Pounds 14.99, 384 pages If the Labour party insists on clinging to its goal of full employment when it compiles its manifesto at the time of the next general election it will inevitably fall back on a single historical example to convince a sceptical electorate that it is anything more than a pipe dream. The two golden decades of virtually full employment after the second world war, are Labour's beacon of hope and, as such, would seem to have all the promise of a Cornish wrecker's lantern. The period was exceptional, historically atypical, and unlikely to be repeated, concludes John Burnett in Idle Hands, a social history of unemployment in the 200 years up to 1990. After reading this comprehensive and thoughtful work it is difficult to disagree. Unlike the cyclical nature of many of the economic factors associated with unemployment in much of this study, the problems of a post-industrial economy, he argues, differ from those of the past when a large manufacturing base survived through periods of depression. That said, there are many lessons in this work of relevance to today, not least his finding that reductions in unemployment relief as a deterrence in response to a suspicion that the unemployed were workshy or scroungers, did nothing to create jobs. Burnett examines the underlying reasons for and conditions surrounding unemployment. He focuses on the experience of the handloom weavers, a large and successful semi-skilled elite of the 18th and early 19th century, and considers their plight in the light of today's socio-economic conditions. The handloom weavers enjoyed social prominence and comparative wealth among the working classes for a brief period towards the end of the 18th century. Developments in power-loom weaving emerged when the Napoleonic wars were coming to an end. Thus, just as the working population swelled, the number of available jobs was declining. Ironically it was the very success and efficiency of handloom weaving, speeded even further by the appearance of Kay's flying shuttle, that created the incentive to mechanise spinning. This led to large supplies of cotton yarn. Finding themselves in short supply, the handloom weavers briefly prospered as technologies struggled with the more difficult task of mechanising weaving. The very developments that made weaving easier, however, also increased the use of cheaper unskilled labour to fill demand. Jobs were taken by farm labourers often working alongside women and children. As the Napoleonic wars ended, releasing thousands of servicemen into an already squeezed labour market, it seems hardly surprising that outbreaks of farm machinery burning and Luddism became commonplace. Some 390 threshing machines were smashed in 1830-31. Rioting was widespread. More than a thousand rioters were convicted; half of them were imprisoned and half transported - and 19 were hanged. The period coincided with the new political philosophy of laisser faire. There was to be no employment protection from parliament. As French blockades cut down supplies of raw cotton during the war years, the handlooming industry plunged into depression. In the early days of Luddism, Burnett notes, power looms were still in their infancy and he sees them more as a focus of discontent rather than its chief cause. While Luddism itself was only part of a much broader unrest, it was brought to prominence by the intensity of its violence associated with attacks on mills. The weavers became the backbone of a politicised movement that culminated in an armed rising in the West Riding and an attempt to capture Huddersfield in 1820. Further insurrection occurred in Scotland. Military intervention, arrests, hangings and transportations were repeated in many industrial towns. As depression spread some communities faced famine, Chartism began to flourish as a quasi-revolutionary movement and mill attacks became more organised and intensified across the Lancashire cotton belt and into the Yorkshire Wollen mills. The unrest precipitated the first large debate on the economic and social consequences of technological change. The debate polarised on familiar lines, one side arguing that mechanisation increased demand for labour and was essential to remain competitive, the other side arguing, somewhat nostalgically, that it would lead to the break-up of the family unit and moral decline. Unemployment today, writes Burnett somewhat bleakly, has become a continuing feature of social and economic life. We cannot expect other sectors to compensate for the dramatic decline in Britain's industrial base, he says. The Labour party may yet be reminded of Sir Keith Joseph, the former Conservative minister's words in 1978. He said: 'Full employment is not in the gift of Government. It should not be promised and it cannot be provided.'</p>

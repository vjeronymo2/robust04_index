			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, SPORTING NEW LOOK, BEATS TEXAS A&amp;M, 19-6  </P> <P> Don James unveiled his new one-back, short-passing offense Saturday, and things  went well for his Washington Huskies.  </P> <P> With Cary Conklin doing the passing and Greg Lewis doing most of the running,  the Huskies defeated 15th-ranked Texas A&amp;M, 19-6.  </P> <P> "It was fun to see our offense move up and down the field," said the  56-year-old James, who is in his 15th year with Washington.  </P> <P> "It's amazing to think we could run with the one-back offense and do to A&amp;M  what they did to LSU last week," he said, referring to A&amp;M's 28-16 victory  over the Tigers last week.  </P> <P> The Huskies scored only one touchdown, on a 22-yard pass play from Conklin to  Mario Bailey in the opening quarter, but their new-look offense was a major  success.  </P> <P> John McCallum kicked four field goals for Washington, from 35, 36, 36 and 37  yards.  </P> <P> "We knew they'd throw the ball more than they have in the past, but we didn't  think it would be like this," Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum said. "They kept  us off balance with short passes and did a good job of running the ball."  </P> <P> Washington's defense, last in the Pacific 10 against the run last season when  it gave up an average of 201 yards, held Texas A&amp;M without a touchdown.  </P> <P> Layne Talbot kicked a pair of field goals, from 32 and 27 yards, for the  Aggies' points.  </P> <P> Conklin completed 23 of 37 passes for 224 yards with no interceptions.  </P> <P> "I just went out there and played catch with the receivers," he said.  </P> <P> Lewis had 29 carries for 133 yards.  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M was held to 266 yards, only 77 on the ground.  </P> <P> Aggie quarterback Lance Pavlas completed 18 of 32 passes for 189 yards with one  interception. Highly-touted Darren Lewis led Texas A&amp;M's running attack  with 52 yards in 15 carries.  </P> <P> "I'm getting discouraged," Lewis said. "There wasn't a whole lot of running  opportunity that I could see."  </P> <P> Washington linebacker Martin Harrison said: "I think we accomplished more than  we expected to, shutting down a Heisman Trophy candidate running back and  holding them to 77 yards. We heard a lot about being the worst defense in the  league and we decided to go out and prove differently."  </P> <P> Washington's switch to a ball-control, spread-out passing offense with no  fullback, was a dramatic change from James' first 14 seasons in Seattle, when  he relied primarily on a power-I formation.  </P> <P> Former Idaho coach Keith Gilbertson, added to James' coaching staff since the  end of last season, is somewhat responsible for the new look.  </P> <P> "I was very pleased with our offensive balance," Gilbertson said. "But I know  that we can play a lot better, particularly with our productivity inside the  20."  </P> <P> Conklin said there are adjustments going from an I formation to a short passing  attack.  </P> <P> "Instead of a five-to-seven step drop, I had to get the ball off quicker," he  said.  </P> <P> The Huskies used some power-I plays against Texas A&amp;M, but they went mainly  with short passes from Conklin and Lewis runs. Conklin's longest pass  completion of the day was his 22-yarder to Bailey.  </P> <P> Washington led 13-3 at halftime, getting a pair of McCallum field goals in the  final 2:11.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Argentina returns to syndicated loan sector 10 years on Argentina has tapped the syndicated loan market for the first time in more than 10 years by signing an 18-month Dollars 500m credit with banks led by Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank. The deal is being seen by the Argentine finance ministry as a vote of confidence in the three-year-old economic stabilisation plan which has combined rapid growth with Latin America's lowest inflation rate. Mr Domingo Cavallo, finance minister, said conclusion of the deal made Argentina the first Latin American country to return to this segment of the international financial market. The loan, signed in New York on Tuesday, will have an interest rate of 150 basis points above Libor and will cover revenue shortfalls prompted specifically by delays in the privatisation of several gas distribution companies. Final documentation should be signed early next week. However, the deal comes against the background of recent economic indicators that show a widening trade deficit, falls in tax collec-tion and the edging up of monthly inflation to 0.7 per cent. Provisional figures released last week showed the trade deficit for August swelling to Dollars 620m, bringing the eight-month gap to a record Dollars 3.84bn. Although exports are likely to rise by 20 per cent this year, imports have surged still faster and last month broke the Dollars 2bn barrier. Mr Cavallo says he is unconcerned because capital goods, imports of which have risen 60 per cent this year, account for the bulk of the increase. Capital goods would help to sharpen competitiveness, feed into higher exports and head off any balance of payments problems. The government has reiterated its rejection of calls from some business quarters for an export-boosting devaluation of the peso. This week, President Carlos Menem said: 'There is no possibility of changing any part of the (economic) model, especially the exchange rate.' Referring to Latin America's past experience with devaluation and resulting inflationary pressures, Mr Menem said: 'We have already watched that movie.' Mr Cavallo also dismissed suggestions that spending pressures before next May's presidential election would lead to fiscal deficits for the first time since the launch of his economic reforms. 'The accounts for the third quarter do not see the surplus of the first two quarters, but this had already been forecast.' Budgets would be balanced this year and in 1995, he said. Inflation too, up in September because of seasonal factors and a recent one-off rise in transport fares would beat this year's 4 per cent target, Mr Cavallo said. Other international banks participating in the deal are Banco Santander, Dresdner Bank, Bank of Boston, UBS and ING. Local banks participating are Banco Roberts, Banco Rio de la Plata, Banco Frances Rio de la Plata, Banco de Credito Argentino, Banco General de Negocios and Banco de Quilmes.</p>

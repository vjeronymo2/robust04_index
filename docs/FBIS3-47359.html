(NTT) will begin within a year a multimedia  experiment with ordinary families using an optical fiber network  system, the telecommunications giant said Wednesday [12 January].    Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, said at a press conference  that Japan should boost such optical fiber network-based  multimedia business as the United States has already launched an  information superhighway project.    Kojima said, "we can't be a loser in the global competition  in the telecommunications field."    U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration has begun  setting up optical fiber network systems linking universities  and institutional bodies.    NTT will start an experiment with an interactive information  network using a cable television system. With the system,  audiovisual information can be picked up through 250 channels.    The experiment will be carried out with ordinary families  which will be equipped with necessary devices as well as optical  fiber terminals.    NTT has announced a project envisaging that every family  will  have an optical fiber network system by 2015.</p>

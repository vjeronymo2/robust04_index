			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Key Chernomyrdin adviser quits: Illarionov warns 'old guard' now in power has Yeltsin in its sights One of the last remaining radical reformers in the Russian government quit yesterday, warning that President Boris Yeltsin was next on the wanted list for the 'old guard' of bureaucrats and industrial lobbyists now in power. Mr Andrei Illarionov said he had resigned as chief economist to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, because he had 'joined the government to conduct economic reforms, not to bury them'. He said that since President Yeltsin launched radical reforms in January 1992 Russia had been in the throes of 'a hidden civil war' and that the old guard, resentful of its loss of power, 'did everything' to squeeze out reformers like Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister. '1994 is the year during which they will try to overthrow Yeltsin,' he said. However, Mr Illarionov reserved his sharpest criticism for Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, whom he accused of a long list of 'crimes' - top of which was last summer's highly unpopular monetary reform - designed to discredit and eventually overthrow Mr Yeltsin. He said Mr Chernomyrdin had saved Mr Gerashchenko 'four times' in the past six months. The new government, he claimed, wanted to pursue 'a different vision of the future of Russia', which basically involved restoring a Soviet-style military and industrial power with 'some changes'. Meanwhile, Mr Fyodorov, yesterday elected head of parliament's sub-committee on central banking reform, vowed to investigate 'an excessive number of unanswered questions' about the central bank's activity under Mr Gerashchenko's stewardship. Mr Illarionov's decision to quit virtually completes a wholesale shift of radical reformers into opposition to the government. The exception is Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, who has stayed on to complete his mass privatisation programme. Tomorrow, the Russian parliament, which is also dominated by critics of radical reforms, is due to discuss two new programmes that have been put forward as alternatives to the government's existing blueprint, but which offer little by way of new policies. These programmes lend credence to Mr Illarionov's charge that the the government 'has knelt to the blackmail of sectoral and regional lobbyists', a claim which a group of veteran economists also made earlier this week. 'The lobbying will be stronger than ever before,' said Prof Stanislav Shatalin, author of the ill-fated 500-day programme. Dr Leonid Abalkin, former deputy prime minister under President Mikhail Gorbachev, said: 'This government will opt for the worst of all options, cobbling together bits of different programmes so that reforms don't happen at all.'</p>

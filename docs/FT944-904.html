			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Zedillo's programme in question after three weeks - Mexico's problems with the floating peso Popocatepetl, the snow-capped volcano overlooking Mexico City, was suddenly on the brink of eruption yesterday, spewing smoke and ash over surrounding towns and villages. But the country's economic stability and rock-solid monetary policy, and confidence among foreign investors, were also threatening to go up in flames. Just three weeks into President Ernesto Zedillo's term, serious questions have been raised about the direction the new administration is taking the economy and the country. Floating the exchange rate and freezing prices for at least 60 days could have a largely negative short-term impact on many companies and individuals and extend uncertainty into the areas of political reform and social policy. The financial crisis casts a retrospective pall over the six-year term of office of President Carlos Salinas and his finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe. Both had pursued an exchange rate policy that outlived their administration by less than three weeks. The devaluation was a surprise because most people had not realised how far foreign exchange reserves had fallen over the previous few months. Despite this, the most immediate problem is one of confidence in the new economic team. 'Investors just don't know what direction the government is going to take,' said Mr Sergio Sarmiento, an economic commentator. 'Even when we had more serious problems at the beginning of the year, the markets stayed relatively tranquil because people knew what was going on. Now they don't' 'This is a big test for Zedillo,' said Professor John Bailey, director of Latin American Studies at Georgetown University in Washington. 'He needs to show leadership. . . and send a clear message about what steps are being taken.' Finance Ministry officials admit that Tuesday's announcement of a 15 per cent devaluation was not handled well. 'It's going to take a while for us to restore confidence. But just wait a couple of weeks until the irrational pressure leaves the market and people will come around and see that the fundamentals of the our economy are still quite sound,' said a senior official. But two weeks is a long time in an unfolding financial crisis, and the government runs the risk that by the time it regains control of the situation investor confidence could be seriously damaged. Analysts are predicting that despite the price freeze, prices could jump 3 per cent in January as a result of the devaluation, and inflation for 1995 settle at around 18 per cent. Under this scenario, interest rates will stay high and economic growth could fall to as low as 1.5 per cent, well under the government's projection of 4 per cent for the year. To maintain a balanced federal budget with reduced tax revenues and increased debt-service payments, social spending and government investment - stated priorities of the new administration - would have to be cut, undermining Mr Zedillo's domestic political credibility. 'We haven't reached complete meltdown, but most of the conditions for our worst-case scenario exist,' said one foreign broker. The impact on the country's financial system and its most important companies will be enormous. At yesterday's exchange rate, the peso will have fallen by 40 per cent on the year, significantly increasing the debt load of those companies with dollar loans. The already overextended banking system, itself with significant levels of dollar debt, will be stretched even further. In addition to this, the government's bank insurance fund is undercapitalised after two important payouts in the past six months. The recently authorised foreign banks are unlikely to be much help in this area. 'We were going to be very active in exchange rate coverage, derivatives and the like. Now it's virtually impossible to price those things, so our operations are basically on hold. The last thing we are going to do is risk money or lend dollars in this kind of market,' said one foreign banker. With the threat of economic instability looming, the administration faces a decision about how to proceed on political reform, which was supposed to be the government's main priority for 1995. Mr Zedillo committed himself during his election campaign to reform of the judicial system and easing the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's grip on the country's levers of power. Mr Zedillo could follow the lead of his predecessor Mr Salinas and argue that a political opening is unwise while economic stability must be procured. 'That would be a mistake,' said Prof Bailey. 'Salinas had to deal with structural problems. Zedillo has to deal with psychological questions about his leadership ability. Political reform and solving the Chiapas problem will give people a good signal that he is moving forward. This time economic and political questions go together.' The continuing political crisis in the southern state of Chiapas, scene of an uneasy military stand-off since an armed peasant rebellion in January, is another thorn in the new government's side. Yet in order to keep inflation in check and maintain control over unions and wages, Mr Zedillo will almost certainly need to use some of the old, albeit slightly rusty, levers of authoritarian control. Giving up those mechanisms, while tempting, may prove too risky.</p>

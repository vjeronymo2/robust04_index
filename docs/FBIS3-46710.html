			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and opposition  parties have begun to strengthen their organizations and select  possible candidates in preparation for introduction of an  across- the-board local autonomous government system.    The system, under which members of provincial and city  councils and heads of autonomous governing bodies will be  elected, will be introduced in the first half of 1995.    Both the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the main  opposition Democratic Party (DP) regard the local elections as a  "prelude" to parliamentary elections in 1996 and the  presidential poll in 1997.    Consequently, sources expect the parties to come out with  strategies to win the local elections following their national  conventions in mid-1994.    The DLP, especially, believes that the local elections will  be a referendum on President Kim Yong-sam's administration.    DLP insiders said Tuesday that senior party officials have  already decided to solidify the leadership and select candidates  for local elections without fanfare while trying to prevent  overheating of the election atmosphere.    Prior to its national convention in May, the DLP will  undertake the reorganization of 95 local party chapters,  replacing some chairmen and strengthening organizational works.    In addition, the government and ruling party plan to replace  city mayors and county chiefs with "reform-minded" officials in  a large- scale reshuffle so that some of them can be DLP  candidates in the local elections.    The opposition party, meanwhile, plans to form an election  planning board this month to undertake a study, and to select  and educate possible candidates for the elections.    The DP will launch a committee to strengthen party  organizations by replacing the chairmen of its local branches  and taking other measures.    The DP is slated to convene a national convention in May  1995, but there is a possibility that it could be called sooner  as a result of competition for the national leadership prior to  the convention.    In this connection, Chairman Yi Ki-taek's private political  group plans to complete a nationwide organization by the end of  next month before beginning active recruitment for support of  the leader.    Among Yi's challengers are Rep. Kim Won-ki, a member of the  party's Supreme Council, and Rep. Chong Tae-chol. both plan to  campaign for support regardless of when the national convention  is held, according to DP sources.    But the DP believes that it is undesirable to enter the  preparatory stage for local elections at this time as it is  trying to force the National Assembly to convene an  extraordinary session in January.    Nevertheless, the party is quietly proceeding with plans to  select candidates for local elections and educate them while  developing party strategies, the sources said.</p>

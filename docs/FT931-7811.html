			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UN war crimes court for Bosnia THE United Nations security council decided yesterday to establish an international court to try those accused of war crimes since 1991 in former Yugoslavia. It would be the first such court since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals judged Nazi and Japanese war criminals at the end of the second world war. In its resolution, the security council called for a report by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, 'on all aspects of this matter, including specific proposals and where appropriate options for the effective and expeditious implementation of the decision'. There was no mention of how to round up suspects. Nor is it anticipated the prosecutors will seek the death sentence for those charged, as they did at Nuremberg and Tokyo. No war crimes suspects have been officially indicted, although the US has prepared a list of alleged Balkan war criminals. It names Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, who was given a restricted visa limiting his movements to the UN headquarters neighbourhood while in New York recently for talks with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the international conference on former Yugoslavia. They were among the first to recommend the creation of a special war crimes court. Last October, the council established a commission to analyse Balkans war crimes data. A French committee of jurists recommended in a report to the council earlier this month that a tribunal comprise 15 judges, along with a separate panel to name suspects and prosecute them. In its resolution, the council expressed 'grave alarm' at widespread mass killings and 'ethnic cleansing' in the former Yugoslavia. Among the data cited was a recent EC report of mass rapes and other atrocities against Moslem women in Bosnia Hercegovina. Declaring the violations of humanitarian law to be a threat to international peace and security, the council 'determined to put an end to such crimes and to take effective measures to bring to justice the persons who are responsible for them'.</p>

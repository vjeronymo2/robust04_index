			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Volodymyr Dupak report from Zaporizhzhya: "The </F> Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Electric Power Plant [AES] Will Not Be  Halted?"]    [Text] Thanks to this week's delivery from Novosibirsk of  nuclear fuel to the 61st-assembly Zaporizhzhya AES [nuclear  electric power plant], the problem of fuel provision has been  resolved for about one year.    As reported by the Information Center of the Zaporizhzhya  AES, in summer, each one of the operating power units will be  halted for a scheduled overhaul involving the reloading of fuel.  This work will be started with Power Unit 1, which is presently  under repair.    However, do not hasten to answer in the affirmative to the  question posed in the heading. Under the pressure of the  "Greens," sessions of the local councils of people's deputies of  Kamyanka Dniprovska in Zaporizhzhya Oblast and of Nikopol in  Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, adopted a decision to hold, on 26 June,  local referendums on building storage facilities for dry used  nuclear fuel on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya AES.    We hope that residents of these towns and adjacent rayons  will trust the conclusions made by atomic specialists -- not  only ours, but also those from the United States, Germany,  Sweden, and Canada, where the system for dry-storing used  nuclear fuel is already used. If the construction work takes one  or one and one-half years longer, the Zaporizhzhya AES will have  to start closing down power units next [1995] summer.    The reasons are that used nuclear fuel has not been  evacuated  from the plant for a long time, but accumulates in the  reservoirs inside the sealed shells of the units. They cannot  stretch indefinitely.</p>

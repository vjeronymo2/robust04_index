			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: Australia joins EC network Australia has become the first non-European member of BC-Net, the agency that links companies in different countries so they can conduct cross-border business. The move should make it easier for European companies to penetrate the Australian market by forging alliances with commercial, technical or financial partners there, and vice versa. BC-Net (Business Co-operation Network) was set up by the EC in 1988 and later expanded to include members of the European Free Trade Association. Companies connect with the system via business consultants, who enter descriptions of the companies and what links they want. BC-Net, based in Brussels, tells the consultants when it has found a match, and the consultants liaise with each other before introducing their clients. Under the deal signed last week by Gareth Evans, the Australian minister for foreign affairs and trade, and Frans Andriessen, the EC vice-president, Australia will pay the EC Ecu 35,100 (Pounds 25,100) to gain access to the network. In addition, Australian companies will pay ADollars 100 (Pounds 44) to the EC for each profile entered, and the consultant's fee. Fayle says it is 'a cheap way of exploring the opportunities' of forming alliances, which might take the form of licensing agreements for manufacturing, distribution or sales deals. But he admits that few Australian companies have heard of it. Jon Finlay of Sydney-based management consultants Abacus says Australian companies often try to expand abroad because the home market of 17m people is small. 'Every client we've talked to about it will put a profile on,' he says. 'Any way of shortening the process of forming trade alliances is attractive.' A six-month pilot programme begins at the end of April, when BC-Net manager Eric Hamelinck visits Australia to train interested consultants. Finlay expects the network to be used mostly by companies of 300-400 employees, with a minimum of 100. But, he adds: 'We're not relying on BC-Net to produce the goods. We're looking at it as getting into a network of business advisers in the EC. It's just a tool to set up the business link.'</p>

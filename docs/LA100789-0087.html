			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> TIES TO SUNUNU HELP BLOCK NOMINATIONS;  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVES WIELDING INFLUENCE IN WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> The conservative lobby, often at loggerheads with President Bush in the past,  today enjoys easy access to the White House, likes the Administration's  positions on most domestic issues and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability  to veto presidential nominations it finds objectionable.  </P> <P> Indeed, in quietly preventing the nomination of former Rep. M. Caldwell Butler  (R-Va.) to head the Legal Services Corp., militant conservatives demonstrated  that they could block the appointment of even a popular conservative with a  long record of supporting Bush because they did not like his views on a single  issue -- abortion.  </P> <P> The key to the conservative lobby's influence is its close links with White  House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. The former New Hampshire governor, in  addition to consulting with conservatives on presidential appointments, has  been readily accessible for consultations on legislation and has arranged for  several meetings with Bush at the White House, according to David A. Keene,  chairman of the American Conservative Union, and other conservative leaders.  </P> <P> "There've been about a half dozen meetings," said Keene, who called Sununu the  conservatives' "primary champion in the White House."  </P> <P> "Sununu has been terrific. He has handled himself better than any chief of  staff I've seen in the 23 years I've been in the White House, and I've known  them all," said Paul M. Weyrich, chairman of Coalitions for America. "I don't  always get the answer I want, but he's extremely accessible."  </P> <P> In the case of Butler, who was to have been nominated as chairman of the  11-member board of the Legal Services Corp., which Congress created to provide  legal help for the poor, Sununu decided at the last minute that he should  undergo an interrogation session with conservative activists. When they  objected to Butler's answers on abortion-related issues, the conservatives  persuaded the White House to back away from the nomination.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't believe they were that powerful," said Butler, who has known  Bush since serving in the House during 1973-83.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Nominations Blocked  </P> <P> The Butler case is not unique.  </P> <P> Earlier, conservative activists had blocked several other nominations,  including those of Robert B. Fiske Jr., a prominent New York lawyer, to be the  No. 2 Justice Department official; Drew E. Altman, New Jersey human services  commissioner, to head the Medicare and Medicaid program of Health and Human  Services; and Robert Fulton, Oklahoma's cabinet secretary of social services,  to head the HHS welfare program.  </P> <P> In addition to those cases, "there have been lots of others that haven't been  so public," said Weyrich, who would not elaborate.  </P> <P> In interviews, several leaders of the conservative movement, reflecting on the  scuttling of Butler's nomination, said that, in some ways, they have more clout  with Bush than they did with President Ronald Reagan despite the fact that they  have been much closer politically and ideologically to Reagan.  </P> <P> "Except in the area of public policy, we have at least as much, if not more,  impact on the Bush Administration than we had on the Reagan Administration,"  Weyrich said. "The Bush Administration has a reputation for being more  pragmatic, and, in a way, that's actually helpful. You explain an issue that  would impact on them and they take it seriously and listen to you. That's  unlike the Reagan Administration, which did everything they did because of the  image it would project on the 6 o'clock news."  </P> <P> Even in the area of public policy, conservative leaders have been in agreement  with most of Bush's domestic programs. They generally support his tax policies  (no new taxes and a reduction in capital gains taxes), his enforcement-oriented  drug program and his strong stands opposing gun controls and favoring a  constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of the American flag.  </P> <P> Only on foreign policy has the conservative lobby marked out substantial  differences with Bush. Even there, in most instances they have not been overly  critical.  </P> <P> Militant conservatives fault Bush for not moving forcefully to oust Panamanian  leader Manuel A. Noriega and for not being more supportive of the Nicaragua  rebels. They are unhappy with the Administration's scaled-back support for  "Star Wars." And they think Bush has been too supportive of Soviet leader  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform programs, but they were even more critical of  Reagan on that point.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact on Appointments  </P> <P> On the surface, at least, the conservatives' biggest impact with the Bush  Administration has been on presidential appointments.  </P> <P> In an article written for the Washington Post, Fulton said that he, Fiske and  Altman were victims of aggressive lobbying by the "hard right-wing" and a White  House personnel appointment process that is "potentially poisoning relations  with the mainstream of the Republican Party."  </P> <P> Fulton, who describes himself as having "a solid Republican background" with  more than 33 years' experience in federal and state government, wrote that  "Sununu, himself far to the right of the Republican mainstream, has created a  substantial network of right-wing 'transition' staff and other insiders whose  lifeblood is politics rather than government. Having little appreciation of the  difficult challenge of running government, they believe appointments should  provide political rewards and always be made with an eye to the next election."  </P> <P> The Butler case is a prime example of how the conservative leaders' ties to  Sununu can give them veto power even when the candidate for nomination is  eminently qualified, has strong conservative credentials and has substantial  congressional support. A letter signed by 32 members of a conservative bloc in  the House, including Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), endorsed the  nomination.  </P> <P> Butler, who supported legislation that created the Legal Services Corp. in 1974  during the Richard M. Nixon Administration and helped it survive an attack by  conservative activists in 1981 in the first year of the Reagan Administration,  did not seek out the nomination. He was asked by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) to  be a candidate for the job.  </P> <P> McCollum said he thought Butler was highly qualified for the post but that  several conservative activists "who were historically unhappy with him when he  was in Congress had doubts about him. So I reported that to Sununu, and he  wanted to make everybody as happy as he could, so he said there should be a  meeting to dispel their doubts.  </P> <P> "Sununu was not willing to proceed without having that meeting. He wanted all  the bases covered," McCollum said. "And it seemed the logical thing to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Met With Coalition  </P> <P> At McCollum's request, Butler traveled to Washington from his home in Roanoke,  Va., to meet with the National Legal Services Reform Coalition, a group formed  by conservative leaders who, having been unsuccessful in trying to abolish the  agency, have been lobbying to control its board and therefor its operations.  </P> <P> About 10 persons attended the session, including Weyrich, Keene and Howard J.  Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus. Phillips is such a hard-line  conservative and still so strongly favors abolishing the Legal Services Corp.  that he has not joined the reform coalition.  </P> <P> In answer to their questions, Butler said he thought a pregnant woman would be  entitled to receive advice on her legal rights to an abortion from a Legal  Services attorney, a view they declared was "totally unacceptable."  </P> <P> They also found unacceptable his statement that Legal Services could sue a  hospital that refused to provide a Medicaid-financed abortion to a poor person,  a view they insisted conflicts with a provision of the Legal Services law that  bars most abortion legal action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Had Abandoned Me'  </P> <P> The White House, said Butler, subsequently "notified me that the nomination was  politically undoable, which is a euphemism for saying they had abandoned me."  White House officials confirmed his account.  </P> <P> Butler, a widely respected attorney and former five-term congressman, said he  was "offended" by the way he had been rejected and by the obvious power the  conservative lobby enjoys at the White House.  </P> <P> "I really shouldn't have gone to that meeting," said Butler, who found  Phillips' questioning particularly "hostile."  </P> <P> "What really upset me was they seemed to be looking for a chink in my armor to  exploit," he added.  </P> <P> Phillips, who has been so sharply critical of Bush in the past that the  President refuses to meet with him even though he has met with the other  conservative leaders, said he opposed Butler because he would use "taxpayer  funds to advance the pro-abortion cause."  </P> <P> Keene said that "Butler's a gentleman, and a lot of us liked him personally"  and that during the questioning of him Butler "sympathized with many of the  concerns we expressed about the way the program is operated. But he made it  fairly clear that, as chairman, he wouldn't see it as his business to do much  about it, that Congress should address it."  </P> <P> And it "created outrage" among some members, Keene said, when Butler expressed  his views on Legal Services and abortion matters.  </P> <P> Later, Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), a champion of the Legal Services Corp.  who supported the nomination, said he told Sununu, a friend and former New  Hampshire governor, he thought it was "bad form to drop the nomination in light  of all the support Butler had."  </P></p>

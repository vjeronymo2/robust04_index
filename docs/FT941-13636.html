			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Tribunal awards mother Pounds 760 A woman turned down for a job after having her CV posted back to her with the words 'four-year-old son' written across it won Pounds 760 compensation at an industrial tribunal in Southampton yesterday. The tribunal ruled that Miss Julie Crosbie, 26, a secretary, was sexually discriminated against by the Wilky Group, a construction and civil engineering concern, when she went for a job interview last year. At the interview Mr Adrian Smith, a divisional director of the company, was said to have formed a 'stereotype view' of the unmarried mother and muttered: 'This may have a bearing on your application,' when she first told him about her son. Miss Crosbie, of Farnborough, Hants, was interviewed for a secretarial post at the Wilky Group headquarters in Farnborough but she said the interview took a downward trend when she said she had a young child. Mr Smith denied asking her if she had children. He said: 'I asked her if she could work late. It was then that she said she could but that she would have to check each time to make sure her son could be sufficiently looked after. 'It made no difference to her application as long as she could assure me it would not impinge on her ability to do the job.' He insisted he was unable to build up 'any rapport' with an 'aggressive' Miss Crosbie during the interview and instead offered it to one of the other 11 candidates. He said the woman who eventually took the job was also a mother. The tribunal said it accepted Miss Crosbie's version of events and awarded her the money for 'hurt feelings'. The amount was limited as the tribunal decided 'that on the balance of probability' she would not have have been successful in getting the job.</p>

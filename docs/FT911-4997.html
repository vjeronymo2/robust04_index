			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Soviet expert denies Chernobyl death toll runs to hundreds of thousands Dr Leonyd Ilyin, director of the Institute of Biophysics in Moscow and an internationally-respected authority on radiation sickness, yesterday denied reports that the death toll in the Chernobyl disaster ran to hundreds or thousands, rather than the 30 officially admitted, writes David Fishlock in Paris. He assured a joint conference in Paris organised by the Nuclear Energy Societies of the Soviet Union and France that there was no increase in registered numbers of cancer cases and no increase in the cases of acute leukaemia and other blood diseases. Some 145 people had suffered from acute radiation sickness as a result of the nuclear accident five years ago this month, while the death toll remained at 30, he said. The latest official Soviet estimate of its cost is Rbs20bn-25bn.</p>

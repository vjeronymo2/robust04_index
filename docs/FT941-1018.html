			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A can of air and some pebbles, please People often send me things. Items of leisure clothing. Baskets of tropical fruit. Commemoration puddings. Aluminium place mats. Atlases and guidebooks. Blue and red balloons. Golf balls and sweatbands. Tickets to the opera. Glassware and standing clocks. I do not keep any of this product. It is passed on to colleagues' children, such as Rhys James, a magpie-child from Essex. Or it is donated to the annual raffle for charity organised, bossily, by elements on the foreign desk. On a good day, when things are going well, I pass this product on speedily to its next destination. But on a bad day - colleagues proving bothersome, testing my mettle - my eye sometimes settles ungenerously on the latest gift or object to have arrived upon my desk. It happened this week. An irksomely tiring day. My patience fully exhausted. I had almost reached the point of screen-faxing a significantly rude message to someone (the Malaysian ambassador, most probably) when my eye alighted on a press release sent to me, impertinently, by a person called Chris Horwood from an outfit dubbed M S Marketing &amp; Management (MSM&amp;M) on behalf of a new product named O-PUR. At the sight of this press release I flew into a temper. At the end of a bad day, unsolicited press releases written by people for whom English appears to be a second or optional language have that effect on me. The phrase that sent me reeling may sound innocuous, but it assaulted my tired brain with the force of an ice-pick. This was the phrase: 'The finest oxygen.' Now then. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that oxygen is an element. Nor do you have to be a rocket scientist or a pioneer of cold fusion to guess that by sending out a press release which implies that your type of oxygen is finer than somebody else's oxygen is - oxymoronic: calculated, without doubt, to send some snotty journalist, at the end of a bad day, into the sort of tantrum in which he rolls on the floor, ululating horribly and attempting to stab, with a pair of Sheffield-sharpened scissors, anyone who approaches him. This is not good for your product. It is not good marketing. The textbooks are clear on this point. As it happens, O-PUR is about the stupidest new product I have ever encountered. It is an aerosol manufactured by Newpharm in Switzerland and filled with 'eight litres of 99 per cent pure oxygen' which is stored as a vaporised gas and contains 'no expellant, additives, preserving agents or aromas, just pure unadulterated oxygen'. O-PUR is designed to embellish our lifestyles, to revitalise us in office or in gym. The canister comes with a cheap plastic attachment that is supposed to act like a face-mask. According to MSM&amp;M's dreadful press release: 'The O-PUR marketing strategy will only target potential purchasers in the personal fitness/health, sports aids, and air quality/pollution concerns market places.' Price: a colossal Pounds 7.99 per can. 'To conform to the British Medicine Controls Agencies guidelines it must be pointed out, and there is a note on all promotional materials, that O-PUR is not, and should not be used as, a medicinal or life saving device; nor is it a substitute for prescribed oxygen.' In a letter from the Chris Horwood person, MSM&amp;M claims that the 'O-PUR bandwagon is about to roll'. Many people may scoff, it says, but they are 'probably the same individuals that laughed at the idea of bottled water sales. I think you will agree that most people have far more realistic worries about their own atmospheric environment, than by what comes out of their taps.' I will be amazed if O-PUR succeeds at that - or any - price. But perhaps it is a sign of the way things are headed. As the population of the world spins past 7bn, 10bn, 15bn, 25bn - perhaps even higher - I have little doubt that marketing people, almost all of whom are directly descended from Attila the Hun and other pillagers, will rack their brains to sell us more and more things that used to be freely ours. Not just oxygen and water, but little patches of grass. Flowers from the hedgerow. Birdsong. Sunlight. Moonlight. Starlight. Stones. Pebbles. Rain. Snow. Sleet. Wind. Hot. Cold. Light. Dark. Even our own reflections, I shouldn't be surprised.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 January (PL) -- Students of junior high  schools, high schools, and universities have begun debating the  country's urgent economic topics and have joined the Cuban  parliament, which is meeting to discuss financial and economic  topics.    In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino,  first  secretary of the Union of Young Communists (UJC), has announced  that stemming from the grassroots organizations of the  respective student federations, this segment of the population  is also expressing its concerns and proposals regarding complex  aspects of Cuba's economy.    He said a large part of the 500,000 members of the UJC  belong  to the worker and peasant sector. They are participating in  this analysis in response to an appeal by the Cuban Workers  Federation (CTC).    Contino said it is incredible to see the diversity of  opinions that emerge in these forums and how youths between the  ages of 14 and 25 (approximately pre-university and university  level) state opinions on ways to reduce money in circulation  based on experience in their own fields. Their views are then  submitted to group analysis.    Contino said disagreements do occur but do not pose  antagonizing views, because they stem from an identity of  principles and actions of historic generations of the revolution  and the younger generation.    With the integration of students into these debates, the  national consensus is expanded to promote decisions that permit  balancing the fiscal deficit of some $4.2 billion pesos  (equivalent to dollars at the official rate of exchange) and  cutting excessive money in circulation by 10 billion pesos.    The youth leader said although the Federation of Midlevel  School Students (FEEM) and the University Students Federation  (FEU) are autonomous and independent organizations, youths who  belong to these organizations are more attracted by UJC  activities.    He said adolescents and youths between the ages of 25 and 30  require more attention. The former because they are at that age  between childhood and adolescence, full of complications, and  the latter because they are not interested in big parties or  large gatherings,    This is reflected in recreation, he explained, where though  discotheques in the country have increased to 37 and though  there are 100 recreational facilities in the country, the  particular demands of the different age groups of a population  of 5.7 million residents from 0 to 30 years have yet to be met.    The 33-year-old economist, together with the person heading  the UJC in lieu of current Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, has  the assessment of recreational facilities, given that the last  congress was positive, despite the fact that resources were  drained by the country's difficult economic situation.    He said, nonetheless, approximately 2 million people have  enjoyed recreational activities sponsored by the youth  organization.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The opposition Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] displayed willingness  Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the ruling coalition, from  which it split in April, by presenting a policy outline at the  outset of crucial realliance talks.    The SDP put forth its platform on forming a new government  during separate talks with the ruling coalition, the leading  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party Sakigake  [Harbinger].    In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority  coalition, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo expressed strong  interest in returning to the ruling camp, party officials said.  "We feel responsibility for destabilizing the government," he  said in a meeting with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] secretary general and the coalition's key strategist, and  other coalition officials.    The SDP broke off from the coalition in April immediately  following Hata's election as premier after its partners moved to  create a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP. The party  interpreted the step as an effort to put it in the backseat in  policy-making.    In Wednesday talks, the SDP and the coalition agreed on an  early summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to  iron out key policy differences. The main issues on the  negotiation table are the timing of submitting bills to redraw  electoral districts for the House of Representatives, a proposed  consumption tax hike and the manner of policy-making within the  coalition. The two sides will hold the second round of talks  Thursday morning.    The SDP made clear its primary target is rapprochement with  the coalition, at least for now, rather than an alliance with  the LDP, the SDP's longstanding rival, the officials said.    The SDP turned down the LDP's overture for immediate talks  to  create a stopgap cabinet for a snap election.    The LDP, which formally decided the same day to submit a  no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the budget  is passed, readily embraced the SDP policy blueprint and pressed  the socialists to join hands with the party. The SDP response  was noncommital.    The coalition also greeted the SDP's proposals with  eagerness, and Ozawa expressed hope for cooperation with the SDP  to create ''a government with a strong foundation.''    The coalition also showed a compromising posture on the key  issue of a consumption tax hike, a touchy issue for the SDP, by  deciding in an executive meeting to delay a final decision on  the size of the hike.    The coalition's solo exception to the SDP plan concerned  bills to redraw electoral maps for the lower house in line with  political reform bills enacted in January.    Ozawa called for such bills to be submitted to the current  Diet session, which ends next Wednesday, while the SDP wants  them submitted in the next session to avoid an extension of the  current term.    The apparently smooth start of realliance talks  notwithstanding, the fate of the two-month-old Hata cabinet  remains unclear, political analysts said.    The SDP leadership is under pressure from party members who  are leery about their leaders' readiness to return to the  coalition, according to the analysts.    Kubo, a pro-coalition leader, underscored awareness of the  skepticism by telling Sakigake [Harbinger] officials that the  SDP still wants Hata's resignation.    Kubo said the SDP blueprint ''doesn't indicate acceptance of  the current government. The role of the Hata cabinet will come  to an end when the budget passes the Diet.''    Ruling and opposition parties agreed the same day to pass  the  budget bills through the House of Councillors Thursday evening  to making them law. The spotlight will then be cast on the SDP,  which holds a key in the nation's political course.    Failure of the SDP-coalition talks would certainly lead to  passage of a no-confidence vote against the Hata cabinet,  leaving Hata with an unpalatable choice of stepping down with  his ministers or dissolving the lower house for snap polls.    Even if the talks prove successful and pave the way for the  SDP's reentry into the ruling camp, Hata may still be forced to  leave office, bowing to a possible SDP demand, SDP sources said.    It is also possible that some SDP lawmakers will break ranks  with party leadership and support the LDP plan for a  no-confidence vote, the sources said.    In any course, the Hata administration will face a critical  test of survival in the days following the expected passage of  the long- overdue budget Thursday, political analysts said.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Lauda Air lands right to fly into Paris Nikki Lauda, Austria's former Formula One racing champion, came up against some tough opponents in his career on the world's racing circuits. But few have rivalled his latest adversary - the French transport ministry. Yesterday, after months of wrangling, a last minute agreement allowed the founder and chairman of Lauda Air to pilot his airline's first services to Paris. The agreement, however, represents an uneasy compromise rather than a long-term solution. Mr Lauda touched his Boeing 737 down at Charles de Gaulle airport in northern Paris, not his preferred destination of Orly to the south of the capital. Nor is the battle over. 'We want and expect approval to fly to Orly very soon,' says Mr Derek Jewson, commercial director of Lauda Air. The launch of Lauda Air's services is the latest test of strength between foreign airlines seeking access to French air routes and destinations, particularly to Orly, which is closer to the centre of Paris and more convenient for internal French connections. In June, France was forced to allow British carriers to fly to Orly from London after a confrontation with the British government and the European Commission and a threat by the airlines that they would take off for Paris without landing authorisation. France says it is committed to liberalising routes to Orly but argues that it needs time prepare for the introduction of competition. The French transport ministry yesterday confirmed that it it planning to open the airport to EU carriers from the beginning of next year. But several EU airlines including Lufthansa of Germany, which holds a 39 per cent stake in Lauda Air, and KLM of the Netherlands, have pushed for quicker access. As with the British carriers, the launch of services by Lauda Air was a case of brinksmanship. As late as Monday evening, the Austrian airline was planning to fly to Orly, despite warnings that its aircraft could be impounded and that passengers would not be allowed to disembark. The Austrian airline said that it had awarded landing slots for Orly in the summer. Six weeks ago, however, Lauda Air claimed it had been informed by the French government that it could not start services as planned. Instead, the airline says that it was offered landing slots at Charles de Gaulle, but the timings were inconvenient. A compromise was finally reached after the French government made available better slots, which allowed Mr Lauda's aircraft to take off from Vienna at 8.40 am yesterday rather than 5.55, as was previously offered. For Lauda Air, however, it is not the end of the matter. Before heading back to Vienna, Mr Lauda held meetings with French officials to press his case. 'If we don't get access to Orly soon we will pursue a legal course,' said Mr Jewson.</p>

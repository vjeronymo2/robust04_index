			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLISTS DRAW STARES ALONG THE SILK ROAD  </P> <P> A startled peasant on his rickety, horse-drawn cart stared in disbelief as  several dozen high-powered motorcycles sped by. This was something he'd never  seen before, and he was not sure what to make of it.  </P> <P> With a roar, the shiny, high-tech world of Western prosperity had suddenly  crossed paths with the rough, homespun simplicity of the Ukraine.  </P> <P> It was like that throughout the first leg of our motorcycle odyssey across the  southern Soviet Union. Present met past. New met old. West met East.  </P> <P> In sleepy villages all across the countryside, people stopped whatever they  were doing to watch the remarkable sight. For many, we foreigners, dressed at  times like spacemen in shiny silver rainsuits, were the first people they had  ever seen from such exotic places as Canada, France and Australia.  </P> <P> Our visits, no matter how brief, kept villagers talking for days.  </P> <P> Certainly, we must have seemed an unusual sight -- 110 people in a motorcycle  caravan flying foreign flags and roaring along the pot-holed, two-lane roads  that once were trade routes leading to the famed Silk Road.  </P> <P> The caravan had started out in Paris on a journey via Lyon, Munich, Vienna and  Budapest to Chop, a small Ukrainian town just across the Hungarian border. Once  in the Soviet Union, we rode from Uzghorod to Chelmitski to Kishinev and on to  Odessa.  </P> <P> At Odessa, we had boarded a boat to travel across the Black Sea to Yalta, Sochi  and Novorossisk, before disembarking and continuing, on to Krasnodar,  Stavropol, Elista and finally to Astrakhan, where the Volga empties into the  Caspian Sea.  </P> <P> The two-week, 3,100-mile trip, aimed at increasing cultural understanding and  interchange, was sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization (UNESCO), several Soviet organizations and BMW of France.  </P> <P> It was an eye-opening experience for both the riders and the people we met  along the way.  </P> <P> At first, in places like Chop, the faces of the people who came out of their  homes to watch us zoom by were familiar and European-looking. But, as we roared  eastward, they became more and more exotic.  </P> <P> The first Asian-looking well-wishers appeared on the 160-mile stretch between  Stavropol and Elista, from which an offshoot of the Silk Road once ran south to  the Mediterranean. In Elista and Astrakhan, many people had the dark complexion  and oval eyes of Mongols and Tartars.  </P> <P> The terrain also changed. Once into the Soviet Union, the well-planned,  productive fields and vineyards of the Ukraine and Moldavia were replaced first  by occasional farms and then by the great steppe -- a vast prairie stretching  endlessly to the horizon. In some places, camels trotted along the road,  unperturbed by the motorbikes flashing past.  </P> <P> "There are treasures in the south that no one knows about -- most tourists just  go to Moscow," said Jeff Brinkert, a Toronto journalist and the only North  American on the trip.  </P> <P> Outside Astrakhan, traditional tepees, called kibitki, had been erected by the  local residents, mostly Kazakhs and Turks, who entertained us with dances in  folk costume and camel-riding displays.  </P> <P> Understandably, there was considerable interest along our route in the  motorbikes themselves.  </P> <P> "How much would a motorcycle like that cost?" asked Vyacheslav, a first-year  student at Krasnodar Polytechnical Institute and a motorcycle rider himself.  When told that one of the BMWs sold for $6,000 to $8,000, he quickly converted  the sum into rubles and said he would buy one.  </P> <P> As the caravan moved east, the food changed from typically Russian tourist fare  -- fried meat and potatoes -- into the diverse ethnic dishes of the Soviet  south. The local costumes and dances also changed along the way.  </P> <P> In Elista, an area populated by Kalmyks of Mongolian descent, young people  dressed in rich-colored silks with sequins and fur hats interpreted through  dance the flight of birds, daily chores and their people's history.  </P> <P> "Under Communism it was a problem to support our traditions, but now, on the  contrary, it is easy," said Nikolai Konstantinovich Serenov, the mayor of  Elista. "In schools today, Russian and Kalmyk children are learning the Kalmyk  language."  </P> <P> Despite the new attention paid to local custom, there were many signs of Soviet  uniformity, like the statues of Lenin that stood in cities from Chop to  Astrakhan. Communist Party slogans, painted on buildings and road billboards,  read: "Glory to the Working Class -- Builder of Communism" and "Bread Forever,  Our Life, Our Motherland, Our Mother!"  </P> <P> Under Soviet rule, various ethnic minorities lived and worked together largely  without strife, perhaps bound together by a common fear. But an unfortunate  side-effect of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's social and economic reforms has  been ethnic unrest, and sections of the route we traveled had at times been  flash points for conflict.  </P> <P> As a result, a police helicopter accompanied the caravan on the road from the  Black Sea to Krasnodar, where local authorities were concerned about  "extremists." In Kishinev, the capital of Moldavia, the caravan was diverted  from the city center, where a weekly Sunday protest meeting was in progress.  </P> <P> Several hundred years ago, hired warriors guarded the Silk Road's merchants and  their wares. Our caravan was provided full police protection for its 69  motorcycles, 10 cars and a truck toting the 20 tons of precious gasoline. For  the full 1,860 miles, three or four police cars, sirens roaring and lights  flashing, escorted the group through the countryside and into the towns.  </P> <P> "It makes us feel as if we are in prison," said a Swiss rider. "Even though we  are on our motorbikes, we feel enclosed."  </P> <P> Authorities' fears notwithstanding, there were always exuberant supporters who  waved at the motorcyclists, clasped their hands together in a victory sign or  rode in their cars for miles just to follow the group.  </P> <P> And each night, Soviet hosts were eager to treat the travelers to the best they  had.  </P> <P> Although the participants, mostly students from France, West Germany, Canada,  Japan, Australia, Austria, Italy and Switzerland, had some complaints, the  overall experience did expose them to a part of the world few foreigners see.  </P> <P> "This was not something I would expect from the Soviet Union," said Kristen  Ritchard, a photography student from Australia. "What we know of the Soviet  Union is what we learn in school or read in the papers. This is quite a  different place."  </P> <P> The journey did not end in Astrakhan; instead, it merely paused for a while.  The trip's organizers plan to cover the entire Silk Road, but in annual stages.  </P> <P> Next summer, the motorcyclists will resume the trip at Astrakhan and ride  through Kazakhstan and Soviet Central Asia to the Chinese border. In 1992,  they'll ride the third and last leg from the Sino-Soviet border to the sea.  </P> <P> For more information on the second two stages, contact either BMW France by  writing to Patrick Mage at 3 Avenue Ampere, Montigny le Bretonneux, 78886  St-Quentin-Yvelines cedex; or UNESCO by writing to Nikita Dergat, at 7 Place de  Fontenoy, Paris, France 75700.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg extends its correction South African shares extended Monday's downward correction, ignoring more positive fundamentals and attracting little buying interest, Reuter reports. Dealers said steady selling in small blocks had impacted on price levels and gold's rally above Dollars 382 an ounce had done little to reverse the softer trend. Shares have been making strong gains recently following the country's transition to all-race rule. The overall index was 41 lower at 5,457, industrials fell 74 to 6,633 and the gold shares index lost 19 at 1,835. Among the actives, De Beers eased 25 cents to R109 and Minorco declined R2 to R102. Pockets of strength included a R2.50 gain to R95 for JCI, a R3 advance for Anglovaal to R138 and a 25-cent rise to R32.50 for Remgro. Independent banker Investec Bank made a strong R3 climb to R58 after reporting a 48 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R80m for the year to March 31. Parent company Investec Holdings posted earnings per share of 164.7 cents, up from 122.4 cents, and was bid R1 higher to R45. Investec also said it would proceed with a R180m rights issue, terms of which are yet to be announced, to fund further expansion. South African Breweries receded R2.50 to R100 and Iscor softened 6 cents to R3.36, while gold issue Vaal Reefs slipped R7 to R373.</p>

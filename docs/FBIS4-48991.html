			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- The Chinese National  Federation of Industries (CNFI) and the Confederation of  Industry of the Czech Republic Wednesday [27 April] signed a  cooperation pact.    CNFI Deputy Secretary-General Chen Ching-nang and Stepan  Popovic of the Czech Confederation signed the agreement, the  first of its kind between Taiwan and an East European country.    Under the nine-point agreement, the two sides will increase  trade, manufacturing and service industry ties.    Chen said the Czech confederation was the 23rd  foreign-industry association that has entered into cooperative  ties with CNFI. He added that CNFI is vigorously seeking to  establish similar ties with industrial federations in Latin  American and South Africa.    Popovic is leading a 18-member delegation of the Czech  Confederation on a week-long visit to Taiwan.    Two-way trade between Taiwan and Czech Republic totaled  US$150 million in 1993, with the latter enjoying a trade surplus  of US$60 million.</p>

Vasilyev] </F>   [Text] The idea of creating a European defense system first  emerged in the late 1940's. The first step toward making it a  reality was the formation of the Western Union in 1948, which  included France, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and  Luxembourg. Later, after Italy and West Germany were accepted  into this military-political organization, it was renamed the  Western European Union [WEU].[.sup]1[/] However, the  disagreements between France and Great Britain that had emerged  already at that time, the main one being the growth of power of  the NATO bloc created in 1949, for more than 30 years relegated  the WEU to the background in resolving issues of the collective  security of West European countries.    In the 1980's, they again turned to the idea of creating a  so-called "Eurodefense" in Western Europe. The initiators of  this were France and the FRG, playing a leading role in building  a "unified Europe." A most important practical step toward  creating a "European defense" system was the WEU council's  adoption of a document in October 1987 at The Hague that was  given the name "The Platform of Interests of European Security."  It defined the goals, tasks, and basic directions of military  organizational development in Europe.    In accordance with the document, a "Eurodefense" system was  to be built taking into account the following basic principles:  Keeping an American military presence in Western Europe,  including a nuclear presence; maintaining the powerful armed  forces of West European states at a level ensuring deterrence of  any aggressor; improving the nuclear forces of France and Great  Britain and maintaining them at an "impressive level."    The document placed special emphasis on the fact that the  Western European Union is assigned the role of a "European  mainstay" of NATO. Thus, the planned "European defense" system  was to be created in close coordination with the North Atlantic  alliance and help to strengthen its military positions.    The process of West European integration in the military  area  was stepped up noticeably in the early 1990's. This was largely  helped by the signing of a treaty in Maastricht in late 1991 by  leaders of countries of the European Community (previously the  EEC or Common Market) on plans for creating the European Union,  the component elements of which, as is expected, will be  military-political and currency-economic alliances.    The main function of the new organization is to be to work  out a unified foreign policy course of the states of Western  Europe, including questions of defense and security. A leading  role in carrying out these tasks is allotted to the WEU--the  only purely European organization today possessing powers in the  area of defense.    In recent years, as the integration process in Western  Europe  developed, the WEU's role grew noticeably, and the number of its  members increased. Spain and Portugal joined in 1988, and Greece  joined at the WEU council session held in Rome in October 1992.  Turkey, Norway, and Iceland were accepted as associate members,  and Denmark and Ireland as observers. Thus, the WEU today unites  all European NATO countries and all member-states of the  European Community. In the assessment of western experts, the  necessary conditions are thereby created for the Western  European Union to fulfill the role both of a "European mainstay"  of NATO and the military nucleus of the future European Union.    The question of forming military structures within the WEU  framework is now actively being studied. Thus, at the WEU  council session in Bonn in July 1992, the decision was made to  create its standing armed forces. Participants in the forum  expressed a readiness to place at the disposal of the WEU troop  contingents for accomplishing such missions as joint defense,  supporting actions for humanitarian assistance, and settling  crises, including measures to restore peace. It was proposed to  man WEU forces through multinational formations, units, and  subunits of the member-states' armed forces. In addition, it was  decided that troop contingents from the NATO allied armed forces  could be transferred to the command of the Western European  Union to carry out special combat missions.    Today, France and the FRG play a leading role in formation  of  the WEU armed forces. Already in May 1992, the decision was made  at the Franco-German summit to create by 1995, on the basis of a  Franco-Germany brigade, a joint army corps of up to 40,000  servicemen. Its basis is to be France's 1st Armored Division and  Germany's 10th Tank Division. It is planned to deploy the  headquarters of the "Eurocorps" already in October 1993 in the  city of Strasbourg, France. It will number about 300 operational  and technical staff. A number of WEU partners of Paris and Bonn,  Belgium, Luxembourg, and Spain in particular, expressed the  intention to assign their own troop contingents to this corps.  Later on it is planned to create on its basis European "rapid  deployment forces," which will have air and naval components in  their composition.    Formation of military command and control bodies of the  Western European Union has begun. A military planning group has  been functioning since October 1992. It has been decided to  conduct meetings of the chiefs of general staffs on a regular  basis. It is also planned to form a transport air command.    In addition, it is planned to form within the WEU framework  a  so-called "West European arms group." In this regard, they are  considering the question of including as part of the Western  European Union the Independent European Programming Group  [IEPG][.sup]2[/] by the end of 1993 and transferring its  secretariat from Lisbon to Brussels, which, it is believed, will  help create a unified arms market in Europe. Possibly, the NATO  Eurogroup, which includes the ministers of defense of the bloc's  European member-states, will also be integrated into the WEU in  the near future, together with its sub-groups involved in  matters of cooperation in the area of military  telecommunications, logistic support, and long-term planning.    A space reconnaissance center of the Western European Union  has begun operating at Torrejon Air Base, Spain. It is planned  to be used to gather intelligence information and monitor  fulfillment of disarmament treaties and observation of crisis  areas in Europe. Today the center has only one-third the  necessary equipment. About 50 specialists and analysts from  various WEU countries are working here today. They are tasked  with monitoring observance of the embargo declared against  Serbia and Chernogoria. On the whole, in the opinion of WEU  leadership, the beginning of the center's functioning is an  important stage in resolving the issue of deployment of an  autonomous European space reconnaissance system.    At the initiative of Paris, the question of creating nuclear  forces of Europe based on French and British arms and developing  a general nuclear strategy has been placed on the agenda. On the  whole, this idea received approval of the WEU leadership, whose  experts began a comprehensive study of the possibility of its  implementation. Thus, in 1992, the WEU's Institute of Security  Problems conducted research to draw up general recommendations  on a European nuclear policy. Some of the results of this  research was reflected in the work "European Integration and  Nuclear Deterrence After the Cold War." In particular, it  concludes it is necessary to safeguard the defense and security  of WEU countries not possessing nuclear weapons by means of the  "nuclear umbrella" of Great Britain and France and thus creating  an "intra-European expanded system of nuclear deterrence."  Experts proposed two variants of such a system.    One of them called for creating a classic system of nuclear  deterrence based on three components: A nuclear strategy, a  structure of European nuclear forces, and a system of command  and control of them. Implementation of this variant assumes the  development of a WEU nuclear strategy, creation of a unified  body for consultations on employment of nuclear forces and a  nuclear planning group, and deployment of French and British  nuclear arms on the territory of certain nonnuclear WEU states.  The second project differs from the first primarily by the fact  that it does not call for stationing British and French nuclear  forces on the territory of other WEU countries.    In the opinion of the French leadership, a European nuclear  strategy could be prepared by 1995 based on the corresponding  principles of the French military doctrine ("deterrence and  intimidation"), taking into account changes in the  military-political situation in Europe. At the same time, for  the time being most West European countries have not officially  expressed their attitude toward the idea advanced by Paris of  creating nuclear forces of Europe. The British leadership,  without completely rejecting it, so far is responding to it  quite reservedly and regards its own potential, first of all, as  national and not part of the European potential.    A trend of an all-round drawing together of the Western  European Union with NATO is developing. To improve coordination  of actions between the two organizations, the WEU headquarters  has been transferred from London to Brussels. A bilateral  agreement has been signed providing for an exchange of  information and conduct of meetings of the governing bodies. The  first joint session of the NATO and WEU councils was held in May  1992. The decision made by Paris and Bonn on the possibility of  transferring the Franco-German corps to the NATO command to  accomplish missions for repelling aggression, should it be  undertaken with respect to countries of the alliance, or to  carry out peacekeeping actions (as a result, the corps was given  the status of dual operational subordination) largely served  this drawing together.    This subordination of forces and assets of the Western  European Union is becoming a characteristic trait of the  interaction of the two military-political organizations. Thus,  at the joint session of NATO and WEU councils held by the  permanent representatives in Brussels on 8 June 1993, the  decision was made to transfer to a single command the naval  groupings of NATO and the WEU operating in the area of the  Yugoslav conflict. Operational command and control of the joint  grouping while conducting operations in support of the embargo  in the Adriatic Sea has been entrusted to the commander of the  NATO allied naval forces in the Southern European Theater of  Military Operations.    The question of dual subordination was also reflected in the  May 1993 session of the Western European Union council in Rome,  where they discussed problems associated with assigning special  operations forces to the WEU to settle crises. The importance of  this problem involved the need to increase the role of the WEU  in preventing and settling conflict situations both in and  outside of Europe. It has been proposed to include as part of  the special operations forces a multinational airmobile division  of NATO's "rapid deployment forces," created from troop  contingents of Great Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and  also a Anglo-Dutch marine brigade. In doing so, the participants  of the meeting emphasized that the airmobile division and the  marine brigade, like the "Eurocorps," should be given dual  subordination status--NATO and WEU. It is quite obvious that the  goal of all the measures is to give the Western European Union  at this stage functions of a "bridge" between NATO and the  European Community. At the same time, advocates of creating  independent European military structures and pursuit of an  independent course by Europe in the area of security and defense  believe that the WEU's status as a connecting link between NATO  and the European Community will be a temporary phenomenon. In  the future, they allot it the role of the military nucleus of  the planned European Union. In doing so, in their opinion, the  new European military-political organization will have complete  operational freedom, which will enable it to act, if necessary,  independently of NATO.    However, such an approach to creating a "Eurodefense" evokes  an unequivocal reaction in NATO. The U.S. administration and the  leadership of the North Atlantic Alliance express a negative  attitude toward plans of creating independent European  structures. They see this as an aspiration to decrease  substantially the influence of the United States in Europe and  its role in NATO, which in the end can lead, in the American  leadership's assessment, to the disintegration of the alliance.  Today, work continues on the optimal model of the future  "European defense" system that takes into account the real  military-political conditions and eliminates the ambiguity that  today characterizes the relations between NATO and the WEU.    Thus, the process of creating a "European defense" system at  the current stage is beginning to enter the stage of practical  decisions, which indicates the serious intention of the  leadership of West European countries to achieve greater  independence from the United States in forming and pursuing a  military-political course. It is becoming obvious that the bases  of the "Eurodefense" system will be formed primarily around the  WEU, which is gradually turning into the base military-political  structure for uniting Europe.

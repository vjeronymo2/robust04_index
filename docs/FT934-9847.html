			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / More rail link tunnels urged EXTRA TUNNELS and other route changes that would add Pounds 125m, or 5 per cent, to the Pounds 2.5bn cost of the Channel tunnel rail link are proposed in a Kent County Council report which was published yesterday. The 90-page report will be put to a special meeting of the council on Thursday and, if approved, will be submitted to the Department of Transport. The department is considering a study by Union Rail, the company set up to develop the high-speed rail link. The Kent study confirms the county's support in principle for the 70-mile link - 45 miles of which will be in the county - but calls for changes to reduce its environmental impact. Mr Allan Mowatt, the county's director of highways and transportation, said: 'This is not an enormous extra amount in relation to the total sum of money to be spent.' The report supports only half of the improvement proposals that were suggested by local environmental and residents' groups, but could conflict with Union Rail's desire to keep costly tunnelling to a minimum.</p>

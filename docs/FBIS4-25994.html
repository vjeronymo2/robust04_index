			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP) -- China rejected Thursday a  U.S. draft resolution calling for UN sanctions against North  Korea over the nuclear issue, saying it was still not too late  to return to the negotiating table. "China in principle doesn't  subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions  to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told  journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China  believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct  dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly  news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a  return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead  to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the  possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said.    The United States presented UN Security Council members  Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased  sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has  veto powers as a permanent member of the Security Council, has  consistently opposed calls for sanctions against its communist  ally. Despite reiterating this stance, Shen avoided questions  on whether China would vote against the UN resolution or simply  abstain. China has abstained, rather than use its veto power in  past admonishments of Pyongyang's failure to live up to its  commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it  signed in 1985. Last week, China abstained from an IAEA vote to  suspend technical assistance to North Korea in response to its  refusal to allow inspectors access to its nuclear facilities.    The spokesman said that, "we regret the action the IAEA took  on June 10 and the consequences that action has already caused,"  warning of the dangers of further heightening tensions. "At the  present time, none of the parties involved has evidence showing  that North Korea has developed nuclear arms," the spokesman  said. "Before this is clarified, it would not be advisable to  take action that might lead to the intensification of the  confrontation and even to the outbreak of war. It would be  ridiculous that, before an atomic bomb is completed, a war has  broken out. That would not be good for any of the sides," he  said.    Shen acknowledged that a 1961 agreement of friendship and  mutual assistance between China and North Korea remained in  force, but would not be drawn on whether the treaty obliged  Beijing to give military assistance to its ally in case of war.  "It is our hope that the parties concerned will chose not to  talk about war but talk about ways of solving the nuclear  issue," he said.</p>

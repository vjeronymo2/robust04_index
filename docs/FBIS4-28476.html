			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Have a Debate on the Rights and Wrongs of </F> Becoming a Permanent Member"]    [Text] There is a theme which we would like Prime Minister  Hata and Foreign Minister Kakizawa to explain concretely at a  resumed session of the Diet without fail. It is the theme of why  Japan must become a permanent member of the UN Security Council  [UNSC]. At his talks with French and German leaders, the prime  minister expressed Japan's strong desire to become a permanent  member and said that "Japan will fulfill its responsibilities  (in the United Nations)." His utterances are an extension of  "Our Country's Opinion on the Equitable Distribution and  Expansion of Security Council Seats," a document worked out by  the Foreign Ministry.    At its General Assembly meeting last year, the United  Nations  inaugurated a work team to deal with the "Security Council  reorganization issue." The work team is scheduled to finalize a  report around June and July and then present it to the 49th UN  General Assembly this fall. The work team appears to be desiring  to draw a conclusion on this issue in next year when the United  Nations greets the 50th anniversary of its founding.    Whether Japan has to decide to join the rank of permanent  members or not is a question to be discussed fully among the  people. It is not the kind of question on which a government  office is allowed to work out "our country's opinion"  arbitrarily to show it externally.    Becoming a permanent member is not a goal, but merely a  means  for Japan. What matters is to what Japan will say yes and to  what Japan will say no. In other words, the important thing is  what functions the United Nations should carry out for the  security of the world. If the United Nations does not intend to  assume the shape that Japan wants it to, Japan should decline to  become a permanent member no matter how eagerly it is asked to  do so.    It is said that with the end of the cold war, the United  Nations has revived as a dispute-settling organization. There  are now as many as 17 PKO [peacekeeping operations] conducted by  the United Nations.    However, the United Nations is not omnipotent. While Prime  Minister Hata was visiting Europe, the U.S. Government announced  a policy through which to decrease U.S. participation in the PKO  and to limit the PKO to cases directly connected with national  interests. The United States became disgusted with the deaths  and injuries caused to its soldiers in Somalia. The activity in  Somalia was clearly a failure because the United Nations ceased  to be a mediator in the dispute and became a disputing party.    Yet the United Nations is not totally powerless either. A  democratic election was carried out successfully in Cambodia  under the guidance of UNTAC (UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia), and the minds of the people there are stabilized  compared with one year ago.    Moreover, As a result of a failure in Somalia, there is a  growing view that the United Nations should put emphasis on the  prevention of disputes and on political solutions. This view is  based on the notion that permanent members should not only  discuss the appropriateness of military actions, but also study  what is called overall security, which combines economic and  technical assistance, humanitarian aid, election management, and  cease-fire supervision.    What do we expect from the United Nations? Some think that  we  should become a permanent member and be willing to take military  actions for collective security while some others view that we  should carry through our position of not intervening in any  disputes at all. No consensus has been established among the  people. In addition, no full understanding seems to have been  developed among them as for the meaning of joining in the  Security Council as well.    We are not objecting to becoming a permanent member itself  from the beginning; however, we feel it dangerous that, in the  course of time, a grave issue determining Japan's external role  has been turning into a kind of established policy before we  become aware.</p>

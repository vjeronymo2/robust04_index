			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur by On </F> Levi; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Levi] Was the latest katyusha  shelling a violation of the agreement reached after Operation  Accountability?    [Gur] The latest katyusha shelling was apparently carried  out by one of the Palestinian organizations which broke away  from the PLO in the wake of the peace accord.    [Levi] We seem to be lenient toward those Palestinian  organizations since it was the second katyusha attack in the  past month.    [Gur] We are not tolerant with anybody who shells us. I do  not wish to go into all the operational, intelligence, and  political problems, but you can be sure about one thing -- that  we make every effort to locate them and reach them immediately  and effectively, and I am certain we will do so.    [Levi] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] required more than  20 hours to defeat four terrorists in Hebron.    [Gur] That is because of the tactics used, because of the  fact we operated in a built-up area, since we want to reduce to  a minimum the number of civilians harmed and to reduce to zero  the risk to our fighters. It does not point to any reduction in  the IDF's offensive capability. We have already stormed,  conquered, and blown up much larger installations. The two  constraining factors I mentioned above were very important, and  that is why those tactics were used. They are special tactics  for a built-up area of that type against a very defined target.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- Officials and relatives  of the victims who died in the March 31 Qiandao Lake boat  disaster Monday [18 April] said they were skeptical of Beijing  reports that three men involved in the killing of 24 Taiwan  tourists had been arrested.    Beijing's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY said Sunday that Wu Lihong, 22,  Yu Aijun, 23, and Hu Zhihan, 24, all from Zhejiang Province,  robbed the tourists and then killed everyone on board the ship.    This is the first time that Beijing has admitted that the  deaths were not the result of an accident, but resulted from  foul play.    Mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng said Monday in Beijing that  the boat disaster was a major criminal case. He said that those  arrested would be dealt with according to the law.    Li also offered his condolences to those killed in the boat  disaster. He made the remarks in a news conference before his  departure for a visit of the Central Asian States and Mongolia.    Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said Beijing failed  to provide any details of the accident other than the names of  the three men arrested. They urged Beijing authorities to  disclose the reason and method behind the murder in written  statements.    They said that the lifting of a Taiwan ban on cross-strait  cultural and other exchanges imposed in the wake of Qiandao  disaster would hinge on whether these details were released.    Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary-General  Li  Ching-ping, also said that Beijing's report that three men were  arrested in connection with the case was not enough, he demanded  a detailed report on the investigations. The foundation is  Taipei's conduit for unofficial dialogue with Beijing.    He said that Beijing's summary report through XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY only bred more doubts and misgivings about the case.    Ko Chen Hui-mei, mother of victim Kao Yu-lan, said she did  not believe three men could overwhelm all 32 people on board.  She suspected the three were scapegoats.    Meanwhile, Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei Association  of Travel Agents, said Monday that a planned boycott of mainland  travel starting May 1 would continue.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife has no liability Concerning your reply (August 27/28) about charging council tax against the earnings of a wife required to work at home. My wife also had to work from home during her job as a salaried employee of a charity from May 1989 to last month. She used one room exclusively for this. During this period, three different methods of local taxation have been in operation - domestic rates, the community charge and the council tax. Our house is in my name. 1. Can a proportion of council tax in principle be charged against her earnings? 2. If so, can she claim retrospectively for 1993/94? 3. Can similar claims be made for domestic rates and community charge for earlier years? The answer to all your questions is no. Since the house is exclusively yours, your wife had no liability either for rates (under the system which preceded the community charge) or for council tax in respect of the room which you allowed her to use for her work. The community charge was a personal tax, not a tax on property, so her community charge liability had no connection with her work. The reply published on August 27 was based upon the fact that (so far as we could deduce from the reader's letter) his wife was joint owner of the house; thus, she had a council tax liability in her capacity as tenant-in-common or possibly as joint tenant (it was not clear which type of joint ownership existed). The answer to question 3 would have been 'no' in any event, as you will see from the free pamphlet on owner-occupied houses, CGT4, which is obtainable from your tax office. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

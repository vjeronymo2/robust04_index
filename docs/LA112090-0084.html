			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> New Corcoran Director: The Corcoran Gallery of Art, rocked by controversy over  homoerotic art and censorship, Monday named art historian David C. Levy as its  president and director, effective Jan. 1. Levy, 52, succeeds Christina  Orr-Cahall, who resigned earlier this year after an uproar involving a Robert  Mapplethorpe exhibit of photographs, which was canceled following pressure from  members of Congress and conservative activists. Trying to put the Mapplethorpe  controversy behind it, the Corcoran issued a statement affirming artistic  freedom, saying that the museum "is committed to the preservation and  enhancement of freedom of speech, thought, inquiry and artistic expression  through its exhibition and educational activities. . . ."

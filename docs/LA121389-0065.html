			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESS CHALLENGED IN CROSS-BURNING CASE  </P> <P> The credibility of a key witness in a hearing for two fired deputies accused of  burning a cross in Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail about two years ago  was challenged Tuesday in the third day of testimony before a Civil Service  Commission hearing officer.  </P> <P> Attorney Richard Shinee, who represents former jailers Brian Kazmierski and  Richard Bolks in the appeal of their discharge, produced testimony alleging  that a departmental witness, Deputy Frank Plass, once said that he hated  Kazmierski and was out to get him. Two sheriff's deputies testified about the  alleged remark.  </P> <P> Plass testified earlier in the hearing that Kazmierski admitted that he had set  fire to a cross in a section of the jail where members of the Crips, a black  street gang, were housed. Plass was the senior deputy assigned to the floor  where Kazmierski and Bolks worked.  </P> <P> Floor Sgt. Patrick Weeks, who supervised Plass and the two accused deputies,  said that when he investigated the cross-burning report he decided that a cross  probably had been burned, and he transferred Kazmierski and Bolks. Now, he  said, he is "not certain" a cross was burned.  </P></p>

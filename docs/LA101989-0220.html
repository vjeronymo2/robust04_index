			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> B OF A POSTS 33.7% PROFIT GAIN  </P> <P> BankAmerica Corp., the nation's third-largest bank, said today that its  third-quarter profits jumped 33.7% due in part to strong growth in consumer and  residential mortgage loans and more effective control of expenses.  </P> <P> As many analysts expected, the San Francisco-based bank did not make a large  addition to its reserve to cover loan losses to Third World countries, which a  number of other large banks have done in the third quarter, leading to large  losses.  </P> <P> BankAmerica said profits in the third quarter were $254 million, contrasted  with $190 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. Per-share profits  rose 19.6% to $1.16 a share from 97 cents in the 1988 third quarter, the bank  said.  </P></p>

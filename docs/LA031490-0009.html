			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TEACHERS DELAY VOTE ON CONTRACT  </P> <P> Ventura Unified School District teachers delayed a vote Tuesday on a proposed  three-year contract that could have ended nearly 11 months of negotiations in  Ventura County's third-largest school district.  </P> <P> District and union negotiating teams reached a tentative agreement March 1, and  teachers were set to vote Tuesday.  </P> <P> But a problem with a computer delayed printing and distribution of the contract  proposal, said Dr. Richard Averett, district manager of personnel services, at  a board meeting Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Unless we have the contract in front of us, there is really no reason to go  ahead and vote on it," said Pam Mortensen, a teachers union representative.  </P> <P> Officials refused to discuss specifics of the contract affecting about 660  teachers in the 15,000-student district. However, in what appears to be a major  concession, union representatives have apparently agreed to have teachers pay  part of the cost of health benefits for retired teachers. KEN McALPINE  </P></p>

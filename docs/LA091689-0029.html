			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SURPRISING YOUNG ORIOLES HANG TOUGH AND DEFEAT ROYALS, 5-2  </P> <P> The surprising young Baltimore Orioles continue to hang on in the American  League East.  </P> <P> Craig Worthington singled home the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning at  Baltimore and rookie Gregg Olson came to the rescue again Friday night as the  Orioles beat the Kansas City Royals, 5-2.  </P> <P> The victory kept Manager Frank Robinson's club just 1 1/2 games behind the  Toronto Blue Jays.  </P> <P> The Royals, who have moved into contention in the West, blew an opportunity to  close in on the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> In five of the first seven innings, the Royals put two runners on base against  Bob Milacki (11-12). They had 11 hits before Olson took over after a leadoff  single in the ninth, retired three batters in a row and earned his 26th save.  </P> <P> "Early in the game, I really struggled with the strike zone," Milacki said. "I  just made good pitches when it was absolutely necessary."  </P> <P> The Orioles know they have to face the two Kansas City pitchers, Mark Gubicza  and Bret Saberhagen, in the last two games with the Royals.  </P> <P> "We needed this one," Robinson said. "I really like the way Milacki battled  them. The next two games we have to play two of the best. Maybe Gubicza and  Saberhagen will bring out the best in this club.  </P> <P> "I'm really proud of the way this team has battled after what we went through  last year."  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Cleveland 2 -- At Toronto, left-hander Jimmy Key (12-13) and the  bullpen sparkled and George Bell and seldom-used Ozzie Virgil hit home runs as  the Blue Jays ended a three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Key gave up six hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings. Tom Henke, the third  reliever, pitched a perfect ninth inning to get his 17th save.  </P> <P> Bell hit his 18th home run with two out in the first. After Fred McGriff drew  his 102nd walk, Virgil, who spent most of the season in the minors, hit his  first home run in more than a year.  </P> <P> "It's always nice to come home," Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston said. "Not that  the road trip was a disappointment. Anytime you go 6-4 on the road, you can't  be too upset."  </P> <P> His lineup changes involved Virgil and Tom Lawless at third. Lawless had a hit  and scored a run.  </P> <P> "I was glad to get a chance to play," Virgil said. "The Blue Jays gave me a  chance first at Syracuse. Up here, Gaston isn't afraid to use his bench."  </P> <P> Boston 7, Oakland 2 -- It has not been an outstanding season for Roger Clemens,  but the Red Sox right-hander can still be tough.  </P> <P> Clemens (15-10) gave up a first-inning home run to Jose Canseco but not much  else as the Red Sox ended their eight-game losing streak with a victory at  Boston.  </P> <P> Canseco, who has played less than one-third of a season because of a wrist  injury, hit his 15th home run.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody on this team is lying down," Clemens said. "We have to  go out and prove it against teams such as the A's."  </P> <P> The Athletics lead the West by 3 1/2 games over both Kansas City and the  Angels.  </P> <P> Seattle 3, New York 1 -- Rookie Erik Hanson pitched a two-hitter at New York as  the Mariners handed the Yankees their fifth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> One of the hits off Hanson (7-5) was Roberto Kelly's ninth home run in the  eighth inning.  </P> <P> Darnell Coles' 10th home run in the fifth inning started the Mariners on their  way to their fourth win in a row.  </P> <P> Minnesota 8, Detroit 4 -- Greg Gagne homered, doubled and drove in two runs at  Minneapolis to hand the Tigers their 14th road loss in 15 games. Kirby Puckett  had two hits for the Twins, raising his average to .336.  </P> <P> The Twins won their fourth in a row and moved into fourth place in the West.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 6, Texas 2 -- Charlie O'Brien hit his fifth home run to open the  third inning at Milwaukee and it triggered a six-run rally that led the Brewers  to their seventh win in the last eight games.  </P> <P> Rookie Jaime Navarro (6-7) held the fading Rangers to five hits and an unearned  run through eight innings, but he needed help in the ninth.

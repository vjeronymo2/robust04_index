			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GETTYSBURG MANUSCRIPT ON VIEW  </P> <P> An original manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was put back on  public display today because tests determined the document has suffered no  apparent damage from its years on exhibition.  </P> <P> Officials from the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency removed the document  in August, 1989, to test it for decay and to evaluate the risk of theft. Gov.  James R. Thompson protested the action and said the state would find a means to  return the document to public viewing.  </P> <P> The historic manuscript is one of only five remaining original handwritten  copies and has been valued at $5 million.  </P> <P> Preservation agency officials timed the re-display of the speech to coincide  with special exhibits marking the 125th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination  Saturday, Blanchette said.  </P> <P> "A fine balance must be struck between the public's right to view that document  and our duty to protect it for future generations," agency spokesman David  Blanchette said.  </P></p>

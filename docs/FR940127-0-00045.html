Ten comments were received and are addressed below in the section entitled Discussion of Comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, the FAA proposed amending and extending the termination date of Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 36, which allows authorized certificate holders (domestic repair stations, air carriers, air taxi operators of large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft) to approve aircraft products and articles for return to service after accomplishing major repairs using data developed by the holder that have not been approved by the FAA. Currently, more than 40 air carrier and domestic repair station certificate holders currently have SFAR 36 authorizations that will terminate on January 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the SFAR was initially adopted in 1978, some of the regulatory language has received differing field interpretation. As a result, some repaired products have been returned to service by SFAR 36 authorization holders that did not have return to service authority. These interpretations are the result of changes in the repair industry since the initial adoption of the rule. The original SFAR 36 did not foresee that some repair stations would be authorized only to perform maintenance on parts or components of articles without authorization to return them to service. These interpretations of eligibility have allowed several SFAR 36 authorizations to be issued and used inconsistently with the original intent of the SFAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An aircraft ``product'' is an aircraft, airframe, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance. An aircraft ``article'' is an airframe, powerplant, propeller, instrument, radio, or accessory. Although some repair stations are authorized only to perform maintenance on parts of articles or products, some SFAR 36 authorizations were used by these repair station certificate holders to approve the articles and products for return to service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has found that while repair stations that specialize in the repair of parts or components of aircraft articles or products may have the technical capability and scope sufficient for the individual repair, they do not necessarily possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service. Only repair stations and air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product should be authorized to approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair. Furthermore, one must understand the form, fit, and function of the article or product in order to fully evaluate the ramifications of a major repair being developed for that article or product. When the FAA finds that a repair station or air carrier has that necessary understanding, the FAA issues it a certificate and operations specifications commensurate with that finding, and the repair station or air carrier is granted return to service authority. This higher level of certitude by the FAA in the work and knowledge of the repair station or carrier that is authorized to approve the rated article or product for return to service is the basis for the SFAR 36 authorization to develop and use data for major repairs without FAA approval of the data. The preamble to the original SFAR 36 reflected this intent to limit the authorization to these repair stations and carriers when it discussed the need to have damaged aircraft repaired and returned to service as quickly as possible. The SFAR 36 system was never intended to support repairs accomplished further up in the repair stream. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the adoption of SFAR 36, certificate holders that were qualified to make repairs were required to obtain FAA approval on a case-by-case basis for data they had developed to perform major repairs. The only alternative to the time-consuming, case-by-case approval method was to petition for and obtain an exemption granting relief from the regulation. The number of exemptions being granted indicated that revisions to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) were necessary, and SFAR 36 was adopted on January 23, 1978, as an interim rulemaking action. Adoption of the SFAR eliminated the requirement for authorized certificate holders to petition for exemption from the regulation, and allowed the FAA additional time to obtain the information necessary to develop a permanent rule change. Most of the affected certificate holders, however, did not use the provisions of SFAR 36 until it was well into its second year and nearing its expiration date of January 23, 1980. Since the FAA did not yet have sufficient data upon which to base a permanent rule change, the termination data for SFAR 36 was extended to January 23, 1982. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the FAA has considered consolidating certain authorizations along with those issued under SFAR 36 to make them permanent parts of the regulations, no rulemaking action has been undertaken, and SFAR 36 has been extended three times. Currently, permanent regulatory action is under consideration by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

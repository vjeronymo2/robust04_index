			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to modifying and expanding some of the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability standards, and making others explicit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary proposes to expand the administrative capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards to include the general areas that SPREs will review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they become operational. The Secretary realizes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPRE review standards must be developed in consultation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions located in the State and will apply only to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that trigger reviews; therefore, those standards may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differ greatly from those proposed here for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary believes that these areas of review have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant bearing on an institution's administrative capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and therefore should be incorporated in the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary's overriding concern is that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have sufficient information on which to make a determination that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a new or currently participating institution is administering or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is capable of administering the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiently, effectively, and correctly. With this in mind, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary solicits comments on specific ways to quantify these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions (for example, what a ``significant number of students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with special needs'' is) and whether each of these added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements should be made applicable to all institutions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether these provisions should be made applicable only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions with short-term programs, a history of high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal rates, high default rates, student complaints, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the Secretary is proposing to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that enroll significant numbers of students with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special needs to have and implement a plan that provides access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adequate support services for those students. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that an institution that cannot provide adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> peripheral support should not enroll those special-needs students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in significant numbers. In evaluating administrative capability,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary has looked historically at withdrawal rates. High  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal rates often result in refund and default problems in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL programs. Some institutions have high withdrawal rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they have recruited students who were not able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the program. Student withdrawal for academic reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been addressed by changes to the ability-to-benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions: students who do not have a high school diploma or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized equivalent now need to pass an independently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered, approved examination. However, other students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been admitted have had the academic capability to succeed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but have been unable to complete the program because of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors, such as lack of child care, or changes in child care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements, or lack of adequate transportation. Some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators provided the Secretary with examples of students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not complete a course of study because of a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about how to access adequate support services, who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise may not have enrolled in those programs if accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about the restricted availability of those services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been disclosed. For example, if a school enrolls a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant number of students who have small children and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, need someone to look after their children while they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are in classes and studying, or students who have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation of their own, it is incumbent upon the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to work with these students to ensure they have access to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ancillary services required in order for them to complete their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education or training. The institution may, but need not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually provide the specific services, such as child care, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must, at a minimum, provide adequate guidance and access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable their students to overcome barriers to attendance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is proposing that affected institutions have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan, which they may be asked to submit, to demonstrate that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet this provision. However, the Secretary is interested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving suggestions about other ways to address the problem of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that recruit and enroll significant numbers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who need support services without informing those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students about access to the support services. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comments regarding how to determine what constitutes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant number'' of students with special needs and what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special needs should be included. Further, the Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> like to receive proposals for alternate means of addressing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

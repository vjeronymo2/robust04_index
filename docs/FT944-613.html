			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Precocious intelligence MORNING GLORY: MEMOIRS FROM THE EDGE OF HISTORY Somerset de Chair Cassell Pounds 20, 397 pages Somerset de Chair, the son of Admiral Dudley de Chair, was born in 1911. At 17 he interviewed Mussolini, at 18 published a book on the future of Europe, The Impending Storm - 'England has no need to worry for its future so long as it can produce such a prodigy as Somerset de Chair' wrote a Hungarian newspaper. At 21 he married Thelma Arbuthnot (the first of his four wives), who resembled the film star Norma Shearer: they visited Hungary, where they were treated like royalty; at 23 he was adopted as Conservative candidate for south-west Norfolk, and was elected the following year. On the outbreak of war he joined the Household Cavalry, was quartered in Palestine, and was the intelligence officer of the force that took Baghdad and, later, Palmyra, in 1941. During the latter campaign he took a bullet from a French fighter plane through the ankle, and Morning Glory ends with him convalescing in a hospital in Jerusalem. This is not a new book: it was first published privately in 1988, and the second half, describing the campaigns in the Middle East, is a reprint of two earlier books, The Golden Carpet and The Silver Crescent. On their appearance in 1943 these were hailed as equal to Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Though de Chair shares some of Lawrence's characteristics - Sir Ronald Storrs described the books as 'a pleasurably egocentric narrative of events'  -this is an overstatement; they are, however, full of youthful vitality and effective descriptions. Though not a regular soldier, de Chair was a resourceful and unorthodox intelligence officer, and took iconoclastic pleasure in the illogicalities of military life. He was particularly amused by the fact that the RAF had mistakenly designated the municipal brothel in Palmyra as a munitions store: 'the vicious attempts of our pilots to bomb it were attributed by the French to jealousy or puritanical instincts.' By contrast, the first half of Morning Glory, written much later, reads at times like an odd blend of Dornford Yates and Frank Harris. The overblown lyricism of the descriptions of the countryside or of the author's houses is Yatesian; Harrisian, on the other hand, is the author's egregious self-satisfaction, his praise of his own writings, and his frank account of his sexual progress. He lost his virginity at 18, not to the New York hooker he had engaged for the purpose, but the following day, to a middle-aged Norwegian hotel maid. As an undergraduate he would drive up to London two or three times a week in his 1921 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (bought for Pounds 50), to hunt for tarts. Thelma took a dim view of this, as she did of his affair with Vivienne Wooley-Hart (who gave a party featuring a live pink elephant), consummated on the floor of her flat in Prince's Gate, he dressed as Lord Nelson, she in a leopard skin. Carmen, the second wife, was more accommodating, giving him a tart for a birthday present in Paris. But he gave tarts up after they vanished from the streets, remarking 'I think that the decline of the British Empire coincided with the removal of these healthy distractions from the heart of London's West End.'</p>

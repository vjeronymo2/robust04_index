Their children are dying by the  hundreds, dozens of others are fleeing to Zaire, and secondary  schools are engulfed in violence. The president is calling on  everyone to return to reason, and Burundian Catholic bishops are  appealing to the Christian conscience of their followers. But  first of all, here is the head of state's address to the nation:    [Begin Ntaryamira recording] Dear compatriots, it is almost  unnecessary to remind you that the security problem has become a  real headache for our government, and that the future of this  country depends on solving it. As you know, the insecurity  prevailing in our country since [words indistinct] assassination  of the late President Ndadaye is being demonstrated by the mass  destruction of property, houses, and human beings. Just as we  thought that tragedy had ended, our dear country is once again  experiencing a deadly folly, especially in Bujumbura, in the  case of which the relevant departments have not yet informed us  of the sinister death toll, the number of those mutilated and  injured, or the amount of the damages. Nevertheless, we already  know that the toll is very heavy. [passage omitted]    Given the prevailing situation, it is not hard to believe  that certain actors are not play acting, that they are talking  with forked tongues and adopting dishonest and duplicitious  behavior, which is likely to shake the confidence vested in them  by the nation.    Thus, it is urgent that all those who have adopted such  behavior return to reason and immediately put an end to this  criminal strategy in order for the country to recover its true  face and return to the proper path. To all those fishing in  troubled waters masterminding the current tragedy, I say:  Enough, that is enough, enough is enough, and let this be the  last warning.    I take this occasion to call solemnly on every citizen of  this country to come out of this trance, and to involve himself  or herself resolutely in national reconciliation and in the  reconstruction of the country. [passage omitted]    On my part, I reiterate my solemn commitment to do  everything  I can to act decisively to reconcile all the Burundians. In  this regard, I will assume all my responsibilities decisively to  help our country return to the path of peace, unity, democracy,  and development. I thank you. [end recording]</p>

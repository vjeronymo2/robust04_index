			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WARNER RIDGE 'EYESORE'  </P> <P> Your article (April 23) regarding the "Warner Ridge Debate" leads me to applaud  this paper and all media in general for exposing the corruption that exists in  government and elsewhere. It amazes me that Joy Picus would state such a  bold-face lie that the lawsuit is "about developers who didn't get everything  they wanted through the city's planning process, the same fair and open process  that everybody else has to go through."  </P> <P> This "shoot from the hip" comment is the best example of the half-truths that  one has come to expect from Picus during her years in office. The fact is that  Spound Co. and Johnson Wax have earned approvals from every city and state  agency during the five years of public hearings, since the inception of the  project. This includes the city Planning Commission, the Citizens Advisory  Committee, and so on.  </P> <P> This project was disapproved at the City Council level without any background  evidence, ignoring the recommendations of their experts such as city planners,  engineers, attorneys, as well as a good percentage of the general public who  live in the area and who supported the project after years of attending public  hearings and listening to the proposals put forward by the developers.  </P> <P> Now the taxpayers must pay for this by the lost dollars in property and  licensing taxes, as well as the cost of defending a $100-million lawsuit and  the exposure of a $100-million-plus judgment which they will ultimately have to  pay.  </P> <P> This valuable, undeveloped piece of land will remain an eyesore as long as our  politicians oppose worthwhile projects purely for political reasons and do not  act in the best interest of the public.  </P> <P> WILLIAM J. ZUMWALT  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

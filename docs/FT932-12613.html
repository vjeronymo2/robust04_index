			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / E German steel aid faces EC barrier CONTROVERSIAL plans to pump more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) of state subsidies into the Ekostahl steel plant in eastern Germany are likely to be turned down by the European Commission today. The decision will take the form of a proposal to member states rather than a binding ruling, and will be subject to ministers' unanimous app-roval, but is still likely to cause a storm in Germany. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, yesterday defended the Ekostahl plans in a last-minute attempt to influence the decision. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is recommending that the Eko-stahl plan should not be exempt from strict rules on state aid for steel producers. The Commission is under pressure from Germany, Spain and Italy to approve steel aid, but Mr Van Miert has repeatedly stressed that the Commission will adopt a tough attitude, to avoid a damaging 'subsidy race' among European governments when the whole industry is under pressure. An ambitious plan worked out by the Treuhand - the state agency responsible for privatising the east German economy - would involve modernisation of Ekostahl's cold steel works for DM310m. In a second phase, Ekostahl would be turned into a mini-mill at a cost of DM750m. The Commission, which has already expressed doubts about Spanish plans to subsidise its steel industry, is gradually piecing together an overall rescue plan for the sector. Last week it approved measures to protect the EC industry from unfairly cheap imports of Czech and Slovak steel. The Commission today will also discuss a package of social measures, including funding of at least Ecu240m (Pounds 187.5m), to help cover redundancy and closure costs in the industry.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Chancellor attempts to calm currency markets The UK Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, yesterday tried to calm currency markets by confirming government policy on the pound. 'We have had a difficult past few days which has been due to the strength of the D-Mark and the weakness of the dollar,' he said. 'Sterling has actually appreciated very considerably against the dollar. But. . . . there are going to be no devaluations, no leaving the ERM. We are absolutely committed to the ERM. That is our policy. It is at the centre of our policy. 'We are going to maintain sterling's parity and we will do whatever is necessary. And I hope there is no room for any doubt about that at all, that the government is determined to maintain our position.'</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile market closes at day's high THE UK equity market put on one of its more bewildering performances yesterday, moving going through a 21-point range, before rising strongly late in the session. Poor official retail sales figures for December were followed up by hopes that a faltering economic recovery could trigger a further cut in UK interest rates. A relatively good showing by gilts, which ended with gains of half a point at the long end, was a further encouragement to the equity market. Dealers also took heart from the trend in the Footsie future, which dipped below a crucial support level at 2,740 but suddenly reversed and raced up, taking the cash market with it and closing at a modest premium. Worries of a sizeable rights issue hitting the market proved wide of the mark but there a strong conviction remained that a big cash-raising operation, possibly the first of many, was being prepared. Share prices gave ground at the opening of business, still pressured by rights issue worries, but quickly recovered their initial losses in the absence of the much-rumoured cash call, helped by a small programme trade said to be weighted on the buy side. More selling developed in mid-morning but was well absorbed by the market which moved into positive territory during the lunchtime period before stalling and then closing with a flourish of strong support, mostly prompted by the Footsie future. The erratic performance of the market was illustrated by the FT-SE 100 which touched the day's low of 2,727.6, down 10 points, within two hours of the opening and closed at the day's high of 2,748.7, for a net gain of 11.1. The Footsie Mid 250 closed 4 higher at 2,889.9, having been down some 8 points in mid-morning. After a slow start, volume in equities picked up markedly finishing at 599.3m shares, compared with Tuesday's 557m and Monday's 488m. After dropping to Pounds 899m on Monday, the value of equity business in the market on Tuesday once again topped Pounds 1bn to reach Pounds 1.1bn. There was widespread initial dismay at the retail sales figure for December, which showed a 0.7 per cent month-on-month decline, against forecasts of a rise of between 0.2 and 0.4 per cent. Dealers chopped share prices as the news appeared but the weakness, especially in the big retailers, was short-lived after the central statistics office said overall sales for the big retailers were up seven per cent and the small retailers down five per cent. Marks &amp; Spencer shares, initially weakened by the news, quickly rallied and ended the day on a firm note. Big dollar earners were boosted by the weakness of sterling, with SmithKline Beecham aggressively bought. Bank shares provided two of the market's best performing FT-SE 100 stocks in Standard Chartered and Barclays, the former lifted by diminished fears of a right issue and buy recommendations from a couple of brokers, while the latter gained ground as the dividend debate swung in favour of those suggesting the payment will be held. Today's FT-Actuaries All-Share Index includes a gross dividend for HSBC Holdings instead of the net dividend previously applied. The new total dividend amount is 18.93p up from 14.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ino Afendouli: "A Simple Acquaintance </F> Meeting"]    [Text] He went, saw, and left. This phrase is suitable to  describe the outcome of the prime minister's visit to the United  States. Anyone who expected miracles was probably not  satisfied. The "uncle from America" cannot do miracles any more.  And if he could, he would do them for himself... [punctuation  as published]    So, was this a customary visit? Or better, an acquaintance  meeting for one to find out the language that the other speaks?  There is, however, one question: If we assume that we know the  language that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou speaks, then  what language does the U.S. President speak?    Lately, the U.S. press is full of analyses signed by the  "elite" of U.S. journalism on Bill Clinton's inconsistent  foreign policy. The examples are several: Haiti, Somalia, North  Korea, and surely Bosnia-Herzegovina. What accusations do the  top U.S. journalists make against the U.S. President? That he  has no foreign policy and that he makes his choices based on  public opinion polls. As a result, the only remaining  superpower is being continuously exposed.    The Greek prime minister's visit to Washington was held  within this unstable atmosphere. Therefore, we must not be  surprised that it did not achieve any specific results.    This does not mean that anyone can blame the prime minister  for paying an official visit to Washington. At the same time,  we must wonder which acts or omissions were made at a foreign  policy level so that this "transition" to better relations would  become possible.    A country like ours, that geographically belongs to a  sensitive and unstable region, does not have the luxury to  reject alliances. Good relations with the United States, the  great European countries, and Russia are useful. This is one  issue. The more substantive one is on which axes, other than  circumstantial alliances, a country like Greece must base its  foreign policy. It could be said that this issue has been  solved because the axes on which the Greek foreign policy moves  are already established: the Atlantic Alliance and the European  Union [EU].    We know very well that things are not so simple after the  end  of the Cold War. In the past three years Greece has faced  problems that its partners and allies have not faced, at least  directly. This has led to some misunderstandings that have  isolated Greece (let us not forget the country's reference to  the European Court).    So, the question is what would be the best way to get out of  isolation? The current government chose to cultivate privileged  relations with the United States to overcome some of its  problems with the EU. There would be nothing reprehensible in  this if the United States had a similar desire. However, this  was not seen during Papandreou's visit to Washington. It is  reasonable to assume that the United States would have wanted  such relations if Greece played some important role in the  Balkans. But today, when Greece has burned almost all of its  bridges, what would be the substance of privileged relations?    The United States has no need to mediate in countries such  as  Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM]. It has direct access. In the former  Yugoslavia, the United States is playing with the large European  countries. What services can Greece offer the United States  when it is isolated in the EU?    If we had some role to play in the Balkans--and we certainly  had--it would have depended on a strong position in the EU.  Then maybe we could have taken advantage of the competition  that often characterizes the relations of the United States with  some European countries. But what about today?    Today our relations with the community are ruined and our  hopes of "privileged" relations with the United States are  futile. To whom shall we send the bill?</p>

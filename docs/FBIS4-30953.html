			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for </F> Rights and Freedoms, by Mehmed Hodjov; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, by what formula can the  government survive today?    [Dogan] This is the first time since the DPS [Movement for  Rights and Freedoms] assumed the mandate to form a government  that the government has faced such an extremely tricky situation.    Last week, the main thing that worried us was that the BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party] was doing everything possible to get  its own representative into the government. We rejected this on  principle, because the situation on the basis of which the  so-called government of experts was formed at the end of 1992 is  quite different from the present political realities.    In our view, the fact that the BSP has 100 deputies in  parliament does not constitute a position in the political  sense. This party was in power for half a century; it is  affrontery, to say the least, for it to make claims for power  now, when we are making a transition and want to change the very  thing that the BSP created.    Professor Berov, who has very great power and has to bear  the  responsibility for a definite program that parliament approved,  should not try to be a balancing force in the National Assembly  and exert pressure on parliament. In my opinion, this is where  his mistake lies.    At present we are really considering a parliamentary  agreement between the different political forces inside and  outside parliament.    [Khodzhov] This agreement is in the context of the proposal  made by the president in his address to the nation, is it not?    [Dogan] First, I support the proposal the president made to  the nation, but I would naturally like to point out that I am  not convinced that this parliamentary agreement is possible,  given the extremely complex situation that exists in the country  at present. Second, if, on the basis of this agreement,  parliament approves a government that is authorized by the  president to act as a caretaker cabinet, this will be a new  precedent in our Constitution. [passage omitted]    [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, when you were in Kurdzhali you said  that elections will most likely be held in October. What sort  of representation does the DPS count on having in the next  parliament?    [Dogan] The DPS will have a very decent representation in  parliament. One does not comment on the predictions, but if you  write down what I tell you, you will see that we may even get  more seats. A party should have untapped reserves, and we are  working on them. Naturally, we will have a completely different  platform, updated to take account of the social problems arising  from unemployment and the economic program. The great  disadvantage of our cadres is that many lightweight people have  taken key positions. We are starting right now to select cadres  for the next elections, on the basis of certain criteria.  [passage omitted]    [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, do you believe that the Turks are  united in Bulgaria? I am thinking of [ex-Chief Mufti] Nedim  Gendzhev's DPS [Democratic Party of Justice, with the same  initials as the Rights and Freedoms Movement] and of Mehmed  Hodja leaving your movement.    [Dogan] It would be stupid for the Turks to be united. I  would not agree to represent an organization formed on an ethnic  basis. We do not need armed soldiers, but we do need thinking  people with similar ideas. If Nedim Gendzhev is such clever  fellow, why is he forming a Democratic Party of Justice instead  of calling it the Party of Free Democrats or some other name?  Everyone hovers around the DPS, because it is very important  as a symbol. However, whereas earlier it was the former  repressions that united us, what must unite us now is our  economic interests -- this is the great change in the DPS  program. The people will sense this transformation from now on.  One cannot create a party only on the basis of rights and  freedoms. The man in the street is now banging the table and  saying: I am out of work, I have nothing to eat. Previously, we  did not appreciate this fact, but it is already knocking and  even hammering on our door. It seems that from now on the  market mechanism even postulates a fragmentation of society, but  let us not discuss this issue now.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK buy-out deal with McDonnell Douglas A BRITISH-OWNED information technology company is to be created through a buy-out of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems from the US aerospace group. The deal is worth at least Pounds 200m, although the price is not being disclosed. McDonnell Douglas said yesterday it had agreed to sell the UK-based business to investors led by Baring Capital Investors. The deal could be completed by the end of this month. Mr Jeremy Causley, MDIS chief executive, and the rest of the existing British management team will stay with the company. Some 16 senior managers will have a stake in the buy-out. MDIS is one of the top 10 UK-based information technology groups. It sells computer hardware and software for a range of industries and constructs and manages integrated systems. The company employs about 1,800 people, 1,300 of them in the UK. It is a leading supplier to the National Health Service, central and local government and the police. Among its recent contracts was a deal worth Pounds 6m to supply St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, with hardware, software and facilities management. McDonnell Douglas is selling the group as part of a strategy to concentrate on its core aerospace business. Only a handful of large corporations now maintain partial or total ownership of information technology companies, once seen as a promising diversification into a high growth sector. General Motors, for example, retains ownership of Electronic Data Systems, one of the world's largest computing services companies, which it bought from EDS's founder, Mr Ross Perot. McDonnell Douglas had been preparing MDIS for flotation on the London stock exchange, but the offering had been postponed. The US company is understood to have accepted it would get better value for MDIS through a private sale rather than flotation, given present market conditions. Last year, MDIS had revenues of about Pounds 180m although profits will not be disclosed until the parent company publishes its results at the end of this month. Some 30 per cent of MDIS sales are made outside the UK. In 1991, MDIS made pre-tax profits in the UK of Pounds 14.2m on sales of Pounds 139.8m. Mr Causley said profits in 1992 would be a substantial advance. Profitable British information technology companies, such as Istel and Butler Cox, have changed hands in the past two years for up to 1 1/2 times annual turnover.</p>

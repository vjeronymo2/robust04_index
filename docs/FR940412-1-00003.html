			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These services and processes include, among other things, interviewing applicants, determining validity of documents, conducting background checks, verifying information, providing assistance to complete application forms, issuing the appropriate documents, and the administrative and support activities associated with providing these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The appropriate fee for each application was primarily based on an assessment of the amount of inspector direct labor devoted to processing each type of application. To arrive at this assessment, the Inspections Program obtained work hour information directly from various INS field offices. The estimate derived from this survey was then applied to the estimated volume of each type of application to determine the total estimated inspector direct labor required for each application. The number of supervisory inspector hours required was determined by applying a standard ratio to the inspector direct labor estimate. Resource levels for training, management, and administrative support were determined based on the current ratio of these functions to the areas to which they normally provide support. The associated costs were calculated based on the level of support that would be required to process each application. Other identifiable costs related to a specific application, such as card production costs, were calculated and applied to the specific application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the increase in transborder traffic, the demand for additional resources at land border POEs has become critical. The collection of fees will allow the Service to support the secondary application-processing services provided at land border POEs without depending on appropriated resources. Unlike appropriated funding, fluctuations in fee revenues will correspond directly to fluctuations in workload. Consequently, in the event workload increases, the level of fee resources available to fund the processing of applications would increase commensurately. It is anticipated that the imposition of the fee-for-service charge will enable the Service to improve inspection services at the land border. Once the fee revenues are available, appropriated resources formerly allocated to provide these services may be redirected to augment staffing of vehicle and pedestrian traffic lanes. The resulting benefit would be improved facilitation of traffic through the POE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific forms for which fees are being proposed are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forms I&hyph;94 and I&hyph;94W are issued to record the entry of many nonimmigrant aliens and serve as a form of alien registration. These forms document the benefits of admission and permit the alien to travel anywhere within the United States for a designated purpose and period of time. Payment of a fee will not be required when an I&hyph;94 is issued for the purpose of paroling an alien into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form I&hyph;44 is issued in conjunction with presentation of a Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card (BCC) or nonimmigrant visitor's visa by a Mexican national requesting entry as a visitor for business or pleasure (B&hyph;1/B&hyph;2). This form is issued in lieu of, and serves a similar purpose to, Form I&hyph;94, and is issued only to Mexican nationals when they are traveling to the five-border-state area of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, or Texas for a period not to exceed 30 days. Current procedure allows the inclusion of several persons on one Form I&hyph;444. The proposed regulation will require a separate form with fee for each individual; however, there is a family fee cap applicable to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form I&hyph;68 may be issued to eligible United States and Canadian citizens and residents to allow pleasure boaters, who have been previously inspected and issued the form, to enter the United States by small boat from Canada without the necessity of reporting for inspection upon each entry. Considerable personnel resources and work hours are spent each year in its issuance, including record checks and INS outreach activities at boat shows, recreational clubs, and other similar gatherings to facilitate registration in the program. This rule also provides for the issuance of a Form I&hyph;68 for each individual, rather than for each family group, although a family fee cap is applicable to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Earlier, the two leaders held their first round of talks in  a  "narrow format" at the Green Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.    Reliable sources told reporters that Clinton and Yeltsin  discussed results of the December elections in Russia, political  and economic reforms in the country and issues of world security  and nuclear non-proliferation.    In addition, the two sides stressed the importance of  Ukraine's readiness to sign, together with Russia and the United  States, an agreement withdrawing nuclear weapons from its  territory. The accord will be signed in Moscow on Friday [14  January] by leaders of the three nations.    Clinton and Yeltsin also discussed the radar station problem  between Russia and Latvia.</p>

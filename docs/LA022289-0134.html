			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT OVER IRVINE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR;  </P> <P> WHEN SMOKE CLEARS IN BANKRUPTCY, KATZ HOLDS HELIONETICS REIN  </P> <P> Helionetics Inc. has emerged from bankruptcy after a bitter 2 1/2-year  reorganization battle with former director Bernard B. Katz firmly back in  control of the Irvine defense contractor.  </P> <P> At one time, there were four groups vying for control of the company.  </P> <P> But under a plan approved in bankruptcy court in Santa Ana, Katz and his wife,  Susan E. Barnes, and George de B. Bell, a Katz business associate and chairman  of the Philadelphia investment bank Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., will have  controlling interest in Helionetics.  </P> <P> They will own 3.5 million, or about two-thirds, of the firm's approximately  5.25 million common shares outstanding, said Charles W. Jobbins, a former  Helionetics president.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan on Friday approved the reorganization  proposed by Jobbins and Katz, a Beverly Hills businessman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobbins Chairman and CEO  </P> <P> Jobbins, who retired in 1983, was immediately named chairman and chief  executive officer of the company. Stanley J. S. Emeterio will continue as chief  financial officer, the post he has held during the reorganization.  </P> <P> The reorganized Helionetics is a much-changed company. Since filing for  bankruptcy, Helionetics has divested most of its operations, including a  promising unit that was developing high-energy laser communication systems for  the Navy.  </P> <P> The principal remaining business is Delta Electronic Controls, a manufacturer  of electronic power conversion equipment, primarily for military applications.  </P> <P> Ironically, Delta was Helionetics' predecessor and itself was rescued from  bankruptcy by Katz in 1980.  </P> <P> As part of the Helionetics reorganization, several lawsuits filed after the  company went into bankruptcy in July 1986 have been settled.  </P> <P> The plan calls for Bank of America and Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn.,  Helionetics' largest secured creditors and parties to all of the suits, to  accept $7 million -- about 41 cents on the dollar -- to settle their claims  against the company. The two financial institutions were owed $17 million.  </P> <P> Helionetics' unsecured creditors will receive 500,000 shares of newly issued  stock in the reorganized company. The value of the settlement to those  creditors will depend on the future performance of Helionetics' stock.  </P> <P> Existing shareholders will receive one share of stock in the new company for  every 10 shares they own, said Don Rothman, an attorney for Katz.  </P> <P> Jobbins, who had headed Helionetics in 1980-83, said Tuesday that he is  optimistic about the company's prospects. He predicted sales of $6.8 million in  1989 and $9 million in 1990.  </P> <P> "We have close to a year's business in backlogs, and that's great for a company  coming out of Chapter 11," Jobbins said.  </P> <P> He also said Helionetics "will be on the alert" for buying other companies that  complement its present business.  </P> <P> Jobbins said Helionetics is seeking approval to have its stock relisted on the  Pacific Stock Exchange. The stock had been suspended from trading during the  reorganization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Well-Known Figures on Board  </P> <P> Helionetics gained national attention in the early 1980s when Katz recruited an  impressive list of well-known military and government figures to the company's  board of directors. The list included Edward Teller, the Nobel Prize-winning  physicist and principal developer of the hydrogen bomb; former Treasury  Secretary William Simon, and David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general and  former chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff.  </P> <P> Fueled by its prestigious board and the promise of its laser technology,  Helionetics stock soared to nearly $30 per share in 1983. But the stock fell to  less than $1 a share as the firm's fortunes tumbled in 1985.  </P> <P> Former management blamed an overambitious expansion strategy, undertaken in  1984, for the company's downfall.  </P> <P> But much of the attention was focused on Katz, not the company. The investor is  a controversial figure who was the target of a 1977 Securities and Exchange  Commission inquiry into his stock promotion activities.  </P> <P> Katz ran into problems at Helionetics in 1984, when Wendell Sell, a former  Helionetics chairman, and Marvin Stern, a former consultant, accused him of  violating federal securities laws and state fraud statutes.  </P> <P> Katz, who denied the accusations in court filings, agreed to settle the suit in  May, 1988, by paying $475,000 to Sell and Stern.  </P> <P> Under the reorganization plan, several major shareholders, including Teller,  who resigned as a director in 1986, will have their stock, which was being held  as collateral by the company's creditors, returned to them.  </P> <P> Teller will receive 33,700 shares, less than 1% of the total shares  outstanding.  </P></p>

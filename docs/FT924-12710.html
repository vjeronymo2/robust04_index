			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Expanding Volex expects sharp profits advance SIX MONTHS of search and negotiation have paid off for Volex, said Mr Howard Poulson, chairman of the electrical interconnection products and systems company, when he announced the acquisition of a 60 per cent stake in Mayor, a Singapore-based manufacturer of data and power cord assemblies, for SDollars 18m (Pounds 6.5m). Mr Poulson said the acquisition was 'a further and important step in Volex's strategy of becoming a global supplier of cable assemblies to the computer, medical and instrumentation markets'. Volex also forecast that its pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 would be about Pounds 2.8m, a rise of 86 per cent over the Pounds 1.5m of last time, and 'a very conservative' estimate in the view of Mr Poulson. He said the order book was 'very strong' at Pencon, where sales had already been boosted by expected safety legislation to make compulsory in the UK the fitting of plugs (moulded where possible) to electrical appliances. He added that the two data cable assemblies makers - Cable Products of Massachusetts, acquired in January for up to Pounds 14.6m, and Icontec of California, bought in July for up to Pounds 4.31m - 'were operating at good activity levels'. Mr Poulson said Mayor also had record order books, 'bursting at the seams'. In the 33 weeks to August 22, it made pre-tax profits of SDollars 1.86m (Pounds 690,000) on sales of SDollars 22.3m and in the year to December 31 had profits of SDollars 2.3m on sales of SDollars 22.7m. At that date net assets were SDollars 5.2m. The acquisition was financed mostly by a bought deal with SG Warburg Securities - a vendor placing of 1.91m new ordinary Volex shares of 25p each. Most were taken up by existing shareholders.</p>

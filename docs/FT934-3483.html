			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend increases lift Recs A bumper interim dividend from Midlands Electricity saw the company's shares outpace the rest of a regional electricity sector - itself the best performing area of the market yesterday - which has attracted heavy buying interest since the November 30 Budget. Midlands' 20.5 per cent dividend increase saw the company nudge its way to the forefront of the Recs' interim 'dividend race', previously headed by Eastern Electricity, which boosted its interim by 20 per cent last week. Many analysts had expected Midlands' payment to top the 7p mark but the actual figure of 7.85p took even the market optimists by surprise. Midlands' shares touched a record 677p at one point before edging off the top to close a net 22 higher at 675p. It was pointed out, however, that the increase in Midlands' interim was an attempt to equalise the interim and final dividends, similarly to Eastern's move. Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Hoare Govett, said Eastern's move would lead to an annual dividend rise in the region of 14.6 per cent and Midlands' to an increase of 14.8 per cent. Hoare forecast similar moves by Southern, Seeboard and London. South Wales Electricity, which announced its interims yesterday, was totally overshadowed by Midlands' dividend performance, the shares easing to 699p in spite of lifting its payment by 14 per cent. East Midland, up 7 at 616p after 623p, is due to report this morning with a dividend increase of at least 12 per cent said to be on the cards. Seeboard, 12 higher at 695p, reports tomorrow. Northern Ireland Electricity forged ahead a further 15 to a closing peak of 241p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Bakina and Veronika </F> Romanenkova]    [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- For the first time in the  history of Russian cosmonautics a space crew will miss one  back-up astronaut when it blasts off on January 8 for a  rendezvous with the orbiting stations Mir.    The state commission has removed German Arzamazov from the  stand- by crew in which he was included as a medical researcher,  following his statement opposing the candidature of Valeriy  Polyakov as a member of the main crew. Arzamazov vowed that  Polyakov had not practiced medicine for a long time and  therefore cannot fly as a medical researcher. He offered his  own candidature.    However, Vasiliy Agapov, Russian deputy health minister,  believes that Polyakov is a highly skilled professional who has  been working as a deputy director of the institute of medical  and biological problems for a long time. Additionally, he has  spent 241 days in space.    During the flight, Polyakov will carry out medical  experiments on himself. As for Arzamazov, he has developed some  "psychological problems" in relations with his colleagues.  Besides, he has never been in space before, Agapov said.    The deputy minister said that taking account Arzamazov's  experience -- he has been in the cosmonauts's team for 17 years  and been included in stand-by crews twice, -- he may be included  as a crew member for the future Russian-American joint space  flight.    Agapov stressed that according to the standing rules, the  entire crew has to be replaced if one of its members is removed.  However, in this particular case, because of the extraordinary  nature of the situation, a "reserve cosmonaut" has been prepared  for a flight "in case of emergency."</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: First Pacific posts strong interim growth FIRST Pacific Company, the Hong Kong-based distribution to telecommunications conglomerate, yesterday reported strong first-half profits and an increase in the interim dividend. Net profits before extraordinary items, but after preference share and convertible share dividends, for the first six months of 1993 were HKDollars 252.3m (USDollars 32.58m), up 59 per cent from HKDollars 159.1m. The company is stepping up its interim dividend by 43 per cent to 5 cents a share. The group's Dutch subsidiary Hagemeyer continued to show strong growth, although its contribution was hit by negative foreign exchange movements. In addition, Philippines-listed Metro-Drug, and Australian computer company Tech Pacific, significant loss-makers in 1991, continued to recover. Pacific Link, one of Hong Kong's three top cellular phone operators, further grewits subscriber base. However, Pacific TeleLink, which is building up a CT2 phone and pager network lost money, in line with group projections. The group's property arm benefited from its acquisition of security company Guardforce, and from further investment property sales. Banking operations have been strengthened by the link-up with Mainland Government partners. First Pacific's managing director Mr Manuel Pangilinan, said: 'While it is unlikely that the growth rate in the second half will match what was achieved during the first half of 1993, I expect to be able to report significantly improved results for the full year.'</p>

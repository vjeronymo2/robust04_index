			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] A report indicates that various student groups have  engaged in confrontations with riot police in several  neighborhoods in Quito during the fourth day of demonstrations  to protest a 71.2-percent price increase in fuel prices. The  government announced the increase on 28 January. However,  disturbances began on the eve of the announcement when the media  leaked the news. Between 27 and 28 January at least four  policemen and an undetermined number of students were injured  during riots, while over 20 students were arrested.    Union leaders and other important Ecuadoran leaders  announced  that they will promote a national strike and demonstrations this  week to protest the increase in fuel prices. They have not  specified dates yet. Edgar Ponce, the president of FUT [United  Workers' Front] -- the largest workers' organization in Ecuador  -- said that the government must understand that the people  cannot take any more price increases. Ponce anticipated that  the government's economic policy will trigger social explosions  in Ecuador, such as the recent conflicts in Chiapas, Mexico, and  Santiago del Estero, Argentina.    In the public markets the prices of many basic necessities  have begun to increase as a result of the increase in fuel  prices. The government ordered a 71.2-percent price increase  for the fuel with the highest demand and argued that this  measure was necessary in order to counter the fall of  international oil prices. Oil is the source of half of the  government's revenues. An increase in the prices of basic  necessities was confirmed in the markets yesterday. The price of  milk, for instance, increased by 150 sucres compared to a week  ago. In addition, food stores and supermarkets altered their  prices eight days ago, without any response from Quito's Police  Intendancy.    Meanwhile, union leaders said that Ecuadoran workers unions  were calling for a 24-hour general strike on 3 February to  protest the economic adjustment measures implemented by the  government. Edgar Ponce announced that FUT urged all  organizations to participate in a preventive strike to request  that the government reconsider its decision to increase fuel  prices. On 28 January the government announced a 70.2-percent  increase in fuel prices to counter, according to the government,  a fiscal deficit estimated between $200 and $500 million. Ponce  added that the strike is considered as a preventive measure, but  it could become a progressive one if the government does not  withdraw its decision.    In addition, Gustavo Teran, a teachers union member, said  that the National Union of Teachers, the Ecuadoran Student's  Front, the Federation of Ecuadoran University Students, and  Indian organizations will participate in a 24-hour strike on 2  February. Teran stated that the country's mass organizations  reject the government's economic measures and will ask for  Finance Minister Cesar Robalino to resign and for Congress to  issue a statement repealing the measures.    This morning, (Teresa Minuchet), a government deputy, asked  Finance Minister Robalino to resign. Ponce pointed out that the  workers' strike is being called because Ecuadorans have lost all  hope that they can have a halfway decent standard of living.  Ponce said that they are calling on all organizations to join  the struggle by the country's stategic sectors -- Ecuadoran  State Petroleum Enterprise, public employees, the Confederation  of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, the Agricultural  Coordinating Board, teachers, farmers, drivers, homemakers,  students, and the people in general. Ponce added that all  Ecuadoreans are angry, and this has become increasingly obvious  in the past days. He mentioned that a precedent was set in 1982  when the government yielded to protests and did not increase  fuel prices.    Today, hundreds of students continued protesting against the  measures, and received support from the population, especially  in southern Quito. Since this morning, students engaged in  heavy confrontations with police in both Quito and Guayaquil,  where they blocked several roads and caused traffic jams.  Students in Guayaquil seized a bus, despite the fact that the  drivers unions said they have not increased fares yet. A  student leader said that the students will not allow any  increase in transportation fares. Police responded to rocks  being hurled by students with tear gas.    Student leaders said that during the demonstrations on 28  January, 15 students were arrested while the students kidnapped  a policeman. A student leader suggested an exchange of  prisoners. Police spokespersons said that demonstrations spread  in neighborhoods in southern, central, and northern Quito, most  of them in high schools. The police have not reported any  student arrests during today's demonstrations. Demonstrations  have decreased somewhat due to a heavy rain in Quito and a drop  in temperature, although some are still occurring in southern  Quito.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN TESTIMONY: A COMPARISON  </P> <P> A comparison of some of former President Ronald Reagan's answers to his  interrogators in the case against John M. Poindexter, his former national  security adviser, and what has been said previously on the subject.  </P> <P> QUESTION: "Did you authorize the diversion of funds from the Iran arm sales to  the Contras?"  </P> <P> REAGAN: "I had no knowledge then or now that there had been a diversion . . . .  All I knew was that there was some money that came from some place in another  account and that the appearance was that it might have been a part of the  negotiated sale, and to this day I don't have any information or knowledge that  . . . there was a diversion."  </P> <P> THE RECORD: Congressional Iran-Contra committees reported in November, 1987,  that $3.8 million was diverted from the arms sales to the Contras. Poindexter  has testified that Reagan was never told about the diversion of funds to the  Contras.  </P> <P> QUESTION: "Tell the jury generally about what you knew about what Oliver North  was doing with regard to helping the situation in Central America vis-a-vis the  freedom fighters?"  </P> <P> REAGAN: "You have to have people that can be available to make contact with the  leaders of the Contras and so forth, sometimes closer than just writing a  letter . . . . It was my understanding . . . that that's what he was doing . .  . . I know there was another area too in which he participated. Well, for  example, in the meeting with the Iranians, he was involved in that."  </P> <P> THE RECORD: North has acknowledged that he not only assisted in negotiating the  sale of weapons to Iran, but also directed a supply operation for the  Nicaraguan resistance which raised $34 million from other countries and $2.7  million from private contributors, secured weapons from international suppliers  and arranged for shipments of arms.  </P> <P> QUESTION: "Do you recall being informed generally about that shipment" of U.S.  Hawk missiles to Iran in late 1985 by Israel -- the first of the arms sales to  Iran -- during a 1985 meeting in Geneva with Secretary of State George P.  Shultz and National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane?  </P> <P> REAGAN: "I don't have any recollection of when I was told about that or who  told me . . . . I don't have a clear recollection of what might have been  discussed in that meeting of that kind over there in Geneva, there were so many  meetings and so many different places . . . .  </P> <P> THE RECORD: McFarlane testified he told Shultz and Reagan that Israel was about  to deliver 80 Hawk missiles to Iran from a warehouse in Portugal and that  Israel wanted the United States to replace those missiles. The President  earlier signed documents approving the sale to Iran.  </P> <P> QUESTION: "In a 1985 White House document approving the Iranian arms sale it  says: 'As part of these efforts, certain foreign material and munitions may be  provided to the government of Iran which is taking steps to facilitate the  release of American hostages.' "  </P> <P> REAGAN: "There was no involvement of the government of Iran in this at all and  so, it was private citizens . . . . And our reward to them for taking that  action was to sell them the missile shipment that they had asked for."  </P> <P> THE RECORD: The Iran-Contra committees reported that American officials knew  that the February, 1986, TOW missile shipment to Iran went to the ayatollah's  Revolutionary Guards. The so-called Second Channel, the Iranian with whom they  negotiated later shipments, was identified by the congressional panel as a man  "who had distinguished himself in the ranks of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard  Corps in the war with Iraq."  </P></p>

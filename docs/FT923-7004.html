			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Food and sanity disappear in Somalia: Money is master and the gun is law in a country dying on its feet A COCKY teenager with a bazooka and G-3 machine-gun slung over his shoulder, pushes a wheelbarrow down a dusty street in Kismayu, the southern port city of Somalia. His T-shirt says 'I AM THE BOSS'. Inside the wheelbarrow are two sacks of looted grain marked 'USA'. He passes starving mothers and children in the street and then walks past the Kismayu General Hospital where, yesterday morning, Abdishakur Abdulahi, a 27-year-old worker, was admitted after a bullet had passed through his arm and entered his chest. The hospital has no painkillers, no anti-biotics and no X-Ray machine. 'One guy shot me on the street this morning, I don't know why, maybe because I am a different clan,' said Mr Adbulahi, lying in a hospital bed with flies buzzing around his blood-soaked bandages. 'There is no photo so where the bullet is nobody knows but I am feeling it inside my chest. Many people like me are dying for lack of money to buy medicines in the market.' Kismayu, which has changed hands several times during the 20-month civil war, is under gun law. The hospital receives at least 25 serious bullet wounds a day. The gunfire and looting have stalled efforts to feed at least 175,000 hungry people in the town and a further 100,000 in the surrounding Juba Valley. 'The security situation is very bad for relief efforts,' said Mr Fabio Baiardi, the Kismayu administrator of the Red Cross. 'There are too many guns. I think the only hope is for the UN blue-berets to come and restore order.' At the town's gun bazaar, traders sell bullets, firing pins and grenades, set out on a wooden stall. Prices are up, but 30 rounds of ammunition for a machine-gun cost Dollars 14 (Pounds 7.30) and a grenade goes for Dollars 2.70. 'Money is the master. You can get anything here,' said one gun seller. Vicious internecine clan warfare in Kismayu accounts for many of the town's gun-battles. Yesterday, gunmen from the Habir Gidir clan pointed automatic rifles at Red Cross workers in Kismayu airport as they tried to evacuate 45 members of the Mijeerteen clan on an aircraft flying to Garowe, a northern Somali town controlled by the Mijeerteen tribe. Twelve of the Mijeerteen group were abducted by the Habir Gidir gunmen. By yesterday afternoon, their whereabouts or condition was unknown. Looting is another severe problem. Yesterday, two people were shot dead at the airport in squabbles over food airlifted into Kismayu. On Sunday, off-loading of 3,000 tonnes of sorghum on a UN-chartered ship at the harbour was suspended after gunmen had looted 300 barrels containing 60,000 litres of diesel and up to 600 tonnes of food. 'I hear the merchants don't like it when free food comes into town because it forces the prices down,' said Captain John Sorrenson, the skipper of the UN ship. At least 1600 tonnes of food remain on board, waiting for the UN to reach agreement with the dissolute warlords who control the city. Nearby, more than 12,000 people have constructed a squalid squatter camp known as Hotel Wammo. Up to 100 people a day are arriving at the camp, mostly from the Lower and Upper Juba Valley between Gobweyn and Saco Uen. Most of the new arrivals are bantu people, who used to work on plantations that are now destroyed. Everything they owned has been looted by Somali gunmen. 'They are always the last to get food because they have no allies in the Somali clan war,' said Mr Gean Metenier, Kismayu's Unicef representative. Many have walked up to 300km on foot to the town in search of food. Elders at the camp said seven children were dying a day. Just outside the camp, three men carry the rigid body of a ten-year-old boy to an open graveyard in what was once the city's rubbish dump. Seven scrawny Maribu storks, which feed off carrion, perch on the sandy mounds of graves watching the simple burial ceremony. The boy's father places the body in the grave and then puts oil-drum lids on top of the body to prevent the scavenger birds digging it up. The stomach-wrenching smell of decomposing flesh hangs heavily in the air. Three teenagers with bandoliers of bullets and machine-guns are standing against a crumbling sandstone wall chuckling together. 'That's Somalia,' said a Somali Unicef official. 'We have lost all our morals and even our sanity.'</p>

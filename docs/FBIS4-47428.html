			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. V. Goncharuk, V. V. Minchenko, V. Yu. </F> Tretinnik, Institute of Colloid chemistry and the Chemistry of  Water, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 541.18+621.039]    [Abstract] The use of existing decontamination solutions,  in most cases, does not reduce radiation contamination to a  standard for safe use, repair or removal of equipment from the  30-km zone around the Chernobyl atomic energy plant. This is  because the many colloid chemical and phsicochemical processes  which occur during decontamination have not been sufficiently  studied. This article studies in detail various colloid chemical  processes that occur in decontamination and develops highly  effective decontamination solutions based on domestically  produced industrial reagents. The new decontaminant agents  yielded a factor of 2-10 increase in the coefficient of  decontamination. The best solution consisted of oxalic acid  (0.3-01.0 % by mass), ethylenediaminetetraacetate  (0.2-0.3%),  oxalate of ammonia (0.1-0.2%) and SF-2U (a wetting agent,  0.2-0.3 %) in water. The composition of the wetting agent  is  given. The example of cleaning transmission parts coated with  burnt-on oil is given. Tables 2; references 15 (Russian).</p>

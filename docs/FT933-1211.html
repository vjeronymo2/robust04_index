			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (12): The eleventh hour has arrived - Trade / It remains unclear whether the Uruguay Round can be concluded by December 15, when the US administration's negotiating authority expires PETER Sutherland, the newly appointed director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), has no doubts about the urgency of concluding the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 'We can't allow the process to drift aimlessly. We simply don't have the time,' he said. 'If we are to succeed in December, the eleventh hour is now.' That was in July. Since then, he has set a series of tight deadlines, intended to galvanise progress; he has lobbied shamelessly in support of trade liberalisation; he has ear-bashed leaders directly - ranging from President Bill Clinton, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur. Yet it remains unclear whether the 116-nation round, which is already three years overdue, can be concluded by December 15, when the US administration's negotiating authority expires. There is very little doubt that the price of failure will be high. It would frustrate the ability of leaders of the industrial world to revive the global economy from its current dogged recession. The danger is great that countries may retreat into conflict-creating regional trade blocks; equally, an outburst of trade disputes would be in prospect, ranging from steel and farm trade to pharmaceuticals and procurement. The scores of governments in the developing world that have committed considerable political capital to rapid economic liberalisation will be in danger. At the very least, their plans for further market opening would be in jeopardy. But perhaps most important of all, consumers will continue to carry the heavy - and rising - costs of protection. A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculated that protectionism in agriculture alone cost consumers Dollars 450 a head in the European Community, Dollars 360 a head in the US, and Dollars 600 a head in Japan. In a hard-hitting Gatt study, subtitled The sting - How governments buy votes on trade with the consumer's money, Mr Sutherland recently commented: 'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they pay - in the shops and as taxpayers - for decisions to protect domestic industries from import competition. 'If governments were to announce that they were deliberately keeping prices high, there would be a public outcry - but that, in effect, is what they are doing by failing to conclude the Uruguay Round.' By the end of this month it will be clear whether there is any realistic chance of Mr Sutherland's tough timetable being met. The deadline for agreeing the text of a services agreement passed on September 20. The deadline for agreeing tariff cuts in manufactures and farm products, and opening markets to trade in services, falls in one week's time. The results of this week's critical 'jumbo' meeting of EC farm and foreign ministers, addressing French demands to re-open negotiations with the US on liberalisation of farm trade, will have been properly digested. Re-opening the talks would almost certainly derail hopes of any farm trade agreement this year, and so would at the same time effectively derail the Uruguay round. A 'substantive stock-taking meeting' is planned in Geneva for October 15, and will be a moment of truth for those who hoped the breakthrough in Tokyo in July, where leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries agreed a deal to reduce or eliminate tariffs on 18 categories of goods, would provide a springboard for successful completion of the Uruguay Round. Numerous difficult obstacles to agreement remain. Critical issues, such as market opening for farm products, or tariff cuts across the thousands of categories of traded textiles and garments, face ferocious opposition from powerful lobbies in the EC and the US. In farm trade, farm exporters from Cairns group countries such as Australia, Argentina and Thailand are adamant that the EC in particular must make a significant market access offer. They insist that, if they are to open their markets further to manufactured exports from the US or the EC, then greater opportunities to sell farm products to Europe must be made available. Mr Jesus Seade, the former Mexican Gatt ambassador, talked of textiles as a 'highly unstable dossier'. Many developing countries - prominently India - need better export opportunities to the US and the EC if they are to bow to pressure to open their markets to services, and tighten enforcement of intellectual property protection. At the same time, many developing countries have been alarmed by western demands that they make market opening offers comparable to those made by the G7 countries in Tokyo. They insist that the 'special and differential treatment' granted to poor countries under the Gatt should be protected. This asserts the right of countries to make commitments that match their financial and economic capacities. the Gatt proposal for 'tariffication without exception': the demand that importers remove all non-tariff barriers, and replace them with tariffs which are more transparent, and more easily reduced over time. It is a demand particularly precious to farm exporters, but has been resisted fiercely by countries such as Japan and South Korea, which block all imports of rice on food security grounds, and Canada, which has for decades maintained a supply management system in dairy products which limits imports. Perhaps the last issue to be resolved will be that of proposed amendments to the draft final act, tabled at the end of 1991. This draft may not be carved in stone, but most countries insist that the minimum of changes should be allowed, for fear that the entire balanced package of commitments embodied by it will crumble. Washington caused consternation late last year by calling for extensive changes, linked with concern to protect its sovereign discretion to apply unilateral trade sanctions where it deemed them necessary. Perhaps it was fitting, therefore, that Mr Sutherland challenged this issue head-on during a recent visit to Washington, and warned: 'Any conclusion in this round requires everybody to take into account that they're not the only people in the world.' As EC officials, and the young and uncertain administrations of Mr Clinton in Washington, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo, feel the heat generated by lobbyists who argue just the opposite, they will face a test of statesmanship that predecessors have failed for the past three years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         WORLD EXPORTS OF MERCHANDISE AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES, 1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Value       Share in total                     (Dollars bn)  world exports (%)   Annual change (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1991      1970   1980   1991   1989   1990   1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merchandise           3,506        81     83     79      8     13     2 Commercial services     890        19     17     21    (10)   (21)   (4)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: When making comparisons between merchandise trade in commercial services it is important to keep in mind the generally lower quality of the services data.

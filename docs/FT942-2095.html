			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Ex-directory So you want the number for Heathrow airport? Readers of British Telecom's latest telephone directory are requested to 'see Airports'. On arrival at this page in the directory, they are re-directed to 'see our display advertisement'. Then the trail goes cold. The same fate awaits anyone wanting to discover the number for Gatwick and Stansted airports. Of course, pay 45p to directory inquiries and the number is yours for the asking.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAGLES USE GIZMO TO BEAT BROWNS IN LONDON  </P> <P> In a game filled with errors common to exhibition openers, Philadelphia  quarterback Don McPherson and wide receiver Gizmo Williams came up with a  picture-perfect play that helped the Eagles beat the Cleveland Browns, 17-13,  in the fourth annual American Bowl played Sunday in front of 73,677 at Wembley  Stadium.  </P> <P> An interception by safety Tom Gerhart four plays after McPherson failed to  scored on a fourth-and-goal play gave the Eagles the ball at their 48 and set  up a 34-yard McPherson-to-Williams touchdown pass play that gave Philadelphia a  17-6 lead with 10:31 left.  </P> <P> The loss spoiled the coaching debut of Cleveland's Bud Carson, former Ram  defensive coordinator.  </P> <P> McPherson, a second-year pro from Syracuse, replaced Eagle starter Randall  Cunningham at the beginning of the second quarter with the Eagles leading, 7-0.  </P> <P> After his missed opportunity at the goal line, McPherson made the most of the  second chance that Gerhart's interception gave him. McPherson passed nine yards  to Robert Drummond for a first down. Then after Cleveland was called for  holding, negating a sack, McPherson looped the ball into the right corner of  the end zone.  </P> <P> Williams, who signed with the Eagles in the off-season from the Canadian  Football League, dove for the ball and made a fingertip catch, ending the play  with a forward roll. He tossed the ball to an official, then did a forward flip  in the air -- a move that cost the Eagles five yards on the ensuing kickoff for  showboating.  </P> <P> "He's got to learn to play NFL football. He can get away with that in Canada,"  Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan said. "The jury is still out on Gizmo Williams."  </P></p>

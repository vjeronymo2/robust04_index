			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Technology: Digital's load gets lighter While the price of computers has halved over the past five years, the cost of distributing the finished product has continued to rise. Faced with the need to sell twice as many computers just to maintain revenues, computer companies have begun to focus on how they can reduce the cost of their distribution systems. Digital Equipment, with European sales of Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3bn) in 1989/90, has halved its distribution costs over the past five years. One way it has done this is by cutting the computers in stock, down from 12 weeks' supply to three and a half weeks. Further ways of cutting the costs have been created at Digital's European distribution centre in the Netherlands. Staff at the Utrecht centre no longer carry order papers around the warehouse. Instead, the warehouse is served by fork-lift trucks fitted with small keyboards, visual display units and a miniature laser gun for reading barcodes. The day starts with the driver signing on to the computer and taking note of the first instruction of the day. This information consists of a string of numbers which defines the precise location of the computer to be collected, including the aisle, shelf and position of the computer in its box as well as the order for the computers to be stacked, with the most robust equipment at the bottom. When the driver approaches the box he confirms it is the correct one by reading the barcode label on the side with the laser gun. 'The technique eliminates all possibilities for error,' says Co Berendsen, manager of the Utrecht centre. An attempt by a driver to collect the wrong box generates a warning signal and if he ignores this he will not receive instructions for his next collection. Berendsen says that the introduction of radio communications has cut the time taken by the fork lift trucks to do the job by 40 per cent. 'Accuracy has also increased and the trucks no longer do journeys around the warehouse without a load.'</p>

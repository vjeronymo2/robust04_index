			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / M11 protesters evicted Protesters were evicted from five houses in the path of a planned extension to the M11 motorway at Wanstead, east London, in an operation that saw officials demolishing roofs with sledgehammers. Up to 300 protesters faced 700 police officers, some in riot gear, 300 security staff, and officials and bailiffs in an operation thought to have cost more than Pounds 200,000. Police said six people were arrested. Liberty, the civil rights group, said it was concerned that sledgehammers were swung dangerously close to people's heads. Environmentalists, who have declared the scene to be the independent state of Wanstonia, now plan further stalling tactics along the proposed route of the extension.</p>

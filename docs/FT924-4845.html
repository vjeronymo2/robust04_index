			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Dutch merger to create Europe'ssecond-largest paper group THE TOP three paper and packaging companies in the Netherlands are to merge, creating the second-largest European paper group after Stora of Sweden. The merger of KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG will produce a European paper and packaging company with annual sales of around Fl 12.5bn (Pounds 4.6bn) and a market capitalisation of more than Fl 2.3bn. The announcement comes as profits of all three companies are under pressure from over-capacity and recession. However, Mr Frank de Wit, KNP chairman, said the proposed merger was designed as a way of positioning all three partners for the future. The new company, as yet unnamed, will be a large European force in packaging and have a wide network for distributing graphic equipment. The deal is unlikely to encounter opposition from Dutch authorities but the merger partners will also have to inform the European Commission, which now has power to review mergers and acquisitions. Mr Robert van Oordt, Buhrmann chairman and the proposed chairman of the new company, said he did not foresee 'big problems' from Brussels. The link-up will be effected through an exchange of shares between KNP on the one hand and Buhrmann and VRG on the other. Buhrmann shareholders will receive one share in the new company for every share they own, while VRG shareholders will receive 0.8 share for each of their shares. Shares in all three companies rose on the news. 'Shareholders will gain from the quantum leap in the scale of the new group's operations and the consequent strategic and financial benefits without paying a premium,' the companies said. A prospectus will be published in late January or early February. The deal will reduce the group's exposure to the paper business cycle, as the company will purchase three-quarters of its paper needs from outside suppliers. KNP is mainly a paper and cardboard producer while Buhrmann and VRG are primarily involved in the trade and distribution of graphic paper, graphic systems and information systems. Buhrmann is also active in packaging. Details, Page 24</p>

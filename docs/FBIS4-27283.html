			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- Japan's top computer maker  Fujitsu Ltd. said Saturday [28 May] it will launch Wednesday a  new service for Internet, the world's largest computer on-line  network.    The Tokyo-based company said it will establish access points  in Tokyo and Osaka initially, which will be expanded to six  other major cities such as Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and Fukuoka  in July.    Internet is an on-line network for computers with common  protocol and address architecture. It is linked to about 5,000  government and academic networks in more than 140 countries  around the world.    Customers will have access to a huge volume of information  through electronic mail.    Fujitsu said it plans to further expand its Internet access  service using its own value-added network to cover 52 cities  across Japan in three years.    Company officials said universities and enterprises in local  areas will be able to have access to internet by calling access  points in major cities.    About 43,000 host computers with access to Internet were in  operation in Japan as of October last year, according to  industry sources.    Fujitsu said the initiation fee for subscribers using  telephones or the integrated service digital network will be  30,000 yen, plus 30 yen per minute for access to Internet.    For those with leased closed circuits, the initial cost will  be 50,000 yen, plus monthly charges of ranging from 150,000 yen  depending on transmission speeds.</p>

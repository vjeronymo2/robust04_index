			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Prices are steady in Sweden Sweden's consumer price index was static in July compared with June, the second consecutive month of unchanged prices, according to figures from the national statistics agency. The July figure brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.9 per cent, up from 2.6 per cent the month before but down from the previous July's 4.6 per cent. The agency said that price increases in some areas in July had offset declines elsewhere. Higher interest rates, and higher prices for fresh fruit, vegetables and coffee raised consumer prices by 0.3 percentage points in the month. This had been wholly offset by lower clothing prices. In the first seven months of 1994, Swedish consumer prices rose by 1.8 per cent, the agency said. Spain's producer price index rose 4.3 per cent in June compared with the same month last year, the national statistics institute reported. Prices went up by an accumulated 2.6 per cent since December. Those of chemical products and minerals not used for energy showed the highest rise - 6.3 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier. The same prices rose by 0.5 per cent in June from May.</p>

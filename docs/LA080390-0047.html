			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM  </P> <P> I am deeply saddened at the recent untimely passing of Art Seidenbaum.  </P> <P> So assuredly are the many friends, readers and staff of the Los Angeles Times  -- and the worldwide fraternity of journalism.  </P> <P> Today's media are sometimes labeled hard, arrogant, insensitive and even  malicious; Art Seidenbaum clearly refuted the labels. His rare and beautiful  legacy shall be of a very generous, gracious and gifted man who was so thrilled  with life and so proud of his paper and his profession that he thoroughly  enjoyed challenging and inspiring similar gifts in others.  </P> <P> CARL R. TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

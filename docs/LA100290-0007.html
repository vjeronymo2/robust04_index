			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS  </P> <P> Timothy Curran's suit against the Boy Scouts for denying him the opportunity to  serve as a Scout leader is a prime example of the pernicious discriminantion  lesbians and gays suffer daily. The leadership of Mount Diablo's Boy Scouts has  proved itself to be bigoted against Curran, by basing its assessment of his  suitability to lead on a vicious stereotype rather than on his spotless record  of achievement.  </P> <P> The big lie here is that gay men seduce young boys. It is a stereotype  well-known to legitimate sex researchers to be completely baseless. People who  seduce children are pederasts, a distinct psychological designation for those  individuals who are attracted to children. It has nothing to do with being gay  or lesbian or heterosexual. Those who insist on perpetuating this lie are  themselves unfit role models for the young.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SHERE  </P> <P> Chairperson, Response Committee  </P> <P> Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance  </P> <P> Against Defamation, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Shaking the money tree WHEN MARKETS are quiet, and commissions hard to earn, brokers have a bad old habit of marking prices up or down in an effort to stimulate some buying or selling - a manoeuvre known as shaking the tree. For this reason, prices movements in thin markets are usually unreliable; after a few headlines, and a flurry of activity, prices tend to drift back to their starting point. Cynics might well, then, see no more than a bout of tree- shaking in the apparent dramas of the last week, which saw a sharp Wall Street rally fizzle out, the dollar rise more than 6 per cent against the D-Mark in a couple of days and then fall nearly half way back again, and a sharp rise in London equities yesterday morning turned into a small fall by the end of business. Like the British political opinion polls, which see-sawed for a few days and ended the week recording sharp Labour and Conservative leads on the same day, the figures average out to nothing in particular. However, there are some fascinating issues raised by both these apparent non-events. The political contest in Britain is uninspiring in its early stages, but poses a quite profound question: can voters face unpalatable truths in hard times? They long to hear some good news which they can believe; but the government has greeted too many false dawns to retain much credibility. Most voters do know that their own real incomes are healthily up - if only they could feel sure that this would continue. Grim picture Labour paints a grim picture of the current state of affairs, as oppositions are bound to do, and especially of the rundown in public services; but it also puts in a forbidding estimate for the cost of repairs. Its Treasury spokespeople, Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett, have established an enviable reputation for competence and honesty, but do not appear user-friendly. This amounts to a contest, if such can be imagined, between Micawber and Savonarola. As Mr Walter Mondale found some years ago in his run for the White House, the hair-shirt appeals strongly to some commentators; but it is very hard to turn it into a popular fashion. Unless the economy turns far faster than any forecaster now expects, the opinion polls and the London market will no doubt remain prey to every gloomy statistic and ill-judged speech. The dollar prospect looks a little less volatile (as ministers have no doubt been advised, to their great relief). This is not because the US economy is now recovering, promising high returns to investors; on the contrary, the figures for output, trade and consumer sentiment, which appeared yesterday, and the up-to-date industrial soundings of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, make it clear that nothing is yet stirring. What yesterday did confirm is that it is growth prospects rather than trade flows which now rule the exchanges: the dollar fell on unexpectedly good trade figures, because they were read as evidence of weak demand. Dollar strength The real strength of the dollar is simply that it has fallen so far. Weak US productivity and investment, and the disappearance of America's net earnings from overseas investment, suggest that it will remain weak in real terms for a long time; but thanks to near-zero inflation in the goods market, this is quite compatible with a rising nominal exchange rate. It can at least be said that thanks to low real interest rates and a reduced debt burden, there is now little to prevent a US recovery, if little to trigger it. The long bear run on the dollar may be over. But is the dollar strong, or is it, as some Amsterdam comment suggests, just that the D-Mark is weak? Strong wage pressures in Germany continue; and the turbulent events in the former Soviet Union suggests that Germany, which has provided an eagle's share both of official aid and private investment, may lose a lot of its money. Already every report of trouble for Mr Boris Yeltsin provokes selling of the mark, usually from Tokyo. Japan's own loss of self-confidence was marked by a new low on the Nikkei. So the dollar's appeal may rest simply on the better hole argument. The new trend has relieved for the time being the threat of a forced rise in British interest rates, which seemed so imminent only a week ago. (The building societies have placed a sizeable bet that it will stay away.) There are reported stirrings of recovery in some parts of the retail trade; and on the dollar model, sterling might withstand a consumer-led recovery in the UK, if it promises solid earnings. So the markets are positioning themselves for a future general recovery. Mainstream stocks are up, and yesterday's glamour stocks nearer to reality. The markets are as usual well ahead of events, both here and on Wall Street, and remain suspiciously thin; but surely have their eyes on the right horizon.</p>

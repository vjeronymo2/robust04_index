			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sweden's debt rating faces downgrading Moody's Investors Service, the debt rating agency, yesterday placed Sweden's Aa2 foreign currency rating on review for a possible downgrade. As a result, the Aa2 ratings on the foreign currency denominated bonds issued by the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swedish Export Credit Corporation, Forsmarks Kraftgrupp and Kummuninvest I Sverige, have also been placed under review. Moody's cited its concern about the continuing accumulation of public-sector debt as a key reason for the move. 'Stronger economic growth, lower unemployment and additional fiscal restraint expected from the recently elected government suggest that budget deficits relative to GDP will shrink,' it said. 'Nevertheless, the build-up in public-sector debt will continue,' it warned. Moody's review will focus on the degree to which policies can be forged over the medium term to strengthen the public sector finances and improve the investment climate, it said. Some observers were surprised by the timing of the announcement, coming just days before Wednesday's fiscal statement by Mr Goran Persson, the new finance minister. However, they said the move might serve as a reminder to the government that its top priority should be to get its fiscal house in order. Mr Persson is expected to detail on Wednesday how he plans to undertake the SKr61bn (Dollars 8.59bn) fiscal tightening the Social Democrats announced in the election campaign. Last week he proposed a further 20 per cent cut in government spending over the next four years.</p>

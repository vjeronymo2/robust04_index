			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The joke is on the British voters: Dominic Lawson on the funny story the media are ignoring THE FIRST of April is the day on which the English prove that their famous sense of humour is vastly over-rated. The people who run newspapers, radio and television programmes spend days deciding what rip-roaring uproarious spoof they will perpetrate on their audiences, and come up, inevitably, with humour designed by a committee, which is no fun at all. The front page of The Times last Wednesday had us all in the aisles with an account of secret talks over the future of Belgium. Flanders, said The Times, is to join the Netherlands, while Wallonia is to seek union with France. This April Fool spread rib-achingly on to the leader column: 'The report on our news pages that Belgium may be dissolved as a unified nation comes as a shock.' Only to you, Sir. The Thunderer goes on to conclude that Brussels's Grand Place should be renamed 'Place du 1er Avril 1992'. 'Pon my word] so it was a joke all along. But all this was high class stuff compared with the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. They had a twee little item, which purported to prove that scientists had isolated a humour gene. Guess what? Germans don't have a trace of the humour gene, while we British, apparently, have double rations. Not on the strength of that April Fool prank, we do not. But I am glad to say there was one normally straight faced publisher of news and information, which abandoned its unremittingly high tone to come up with a series of wonderfully absurd April Fools. I am referring, of course to the April 1 issue of the Financial Times. I suppose the FT does have an advantage in this sort of prank. If one is habitually serous and responsible, a sudden outbreak of humour strikes onlookers as that much more funny. Here are just a few of the April Fool stories I spotted in Wednesday's FT. I'm sure there were others which I failed to crack. On the front page, there was a superb spoof item about the International Monetary Fund offering to lend Russia Dollars 4bn after 'close scrutiny by the board of the economic programme presented by a Russian delegation.' The next day the Russian finance minister Yegor Caidar was sacked, presumably when Boris Yeltsin discovered that the FT story was just a brilliant prank, and that the IMF was not after all prepared to lend Dollars 4bn to a non-existent country, which, if it did exist, would have an economy smaller than that of Wales. Then on the home news pages, the FT ran a delightful joke item entitled 'Average family better off than a year ago'. If such a story had appeared in the Daily Mail or the Daily Express one would have immediately known it was invented for the benefit of the Conservative election campaign, but seeing it in these unbiased pages, I experienced the brief frisson of falling for it, before laughing incredulously - the essence of a good April Fool's joke. But the FT's biggest prank - which ran through the entire paper - unfortunately failed to come off. On the back page it was revealed that the Bank of Japan had cut its official discount rate to 3.75 per cent. On the front page it was stated that the US Federal Reserve was discounting at 4 per cent. But right next to that true fact the FT mischievously stated that the London Interbank lending rate was 11 per cent. Eleven per cent, in the middle of a deep recession, while inflation is below 4 per cent and falling] That really is overdoing the spirit of April Fool's Day, even for the new lively FT. What the jokers who thought this spoof up had forgotten, is that humour must be consistent. If our interest rate really were so grotesquely out of line and at such wilfully damaging levels opposition politicians in an election campaign would have been screaming for them to be brought down, and back bench Conservative MPs would be demanding Norman Lamont's resignation. Yet instead the FT gives the impression that in such an implausible situation all the parties are agreed that the British economy should be sacrificed on the altar of the United Germany's money supply figures. That is taking an April Fool's joke too far. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

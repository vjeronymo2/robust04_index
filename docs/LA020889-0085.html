			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 50TH DISTRICT VOTERS CHOOSE TUCKER TO SUCCEED HIS FATHER  </P> <P> The voters of the 50th Assembly District established a political dynasty  Tuesday, sending Curtis R. Tucker Jr. to Sacramento to fill the Assembly seat  held for 14 years by his late father, former Democratic Assemblyman Curtis R.  Tucker of Inglewood.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old Tucker, a legislative aide who emerged from obscurity after his  father died of cancer last October, beat three other candidates in a special  election that drew few voters to the polls.  </P> <P> With all 171 precincts reporting, Democrat Tucker had 12,250 votes or 71.2% of  the total. Republican business consultant Mike Davis ran a distant second with  3,235 votes or 18.8%.  </P> <P> By capturing more than 50% of the votes cast, Tucker avoided a runoff against  Davis. He is expected to be sworn in by Thursday in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Inglewood school board member Lois Hill-Hale, another Democrat on the ballot,  drew 1,125 votes or 6.5%, and Los Angeles Police Officer Carl McGill, also a  Democrat, received 411 votes or 2.4%. Democrat Roderick Wright, who dropped out  of the race too late to be removed from the ballot, had 188 votes or 1.1%  </P> <P> Tucker's name, combined with big-name endorsements from powerful Democrats and  a huge war chest made him the heavy favorite in the race to fill the vacancy  created after his father made California history last November by winning  reelection after his death.  </P> <P> At his storefront headquarters in Inglewood beneath the banner of his father's  earlier campaigns, Tucker said, "the legacy is being passed on," not only to  him but his supporters. "My name helped tremendously, but those people won this  for me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elder Tucker's Wish  </P> <P> The elder Tucker, who rose from being the first black on the Inglewood City  Council to become chairman of the Assembly Health Committee and patriarch of  Inglewood politics, often said he hoped his son would succeed him. Citing that  wish, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) backed the younger Tucker  and placed financial and political muscle at his disposal.  </P> <P> Brown also pressured Gov. George Deukmejian to reschedule the election from its  original date in April to February. Brown's support kept several potentially  strong candidates -- Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, Los Angeles City  Councilman Robert Farrell and Inglewood Councilman Daniel Tabor -- out of the  race.  </P> <P> Tucker's victory gives Brown a crucial 41st vote in the 80-member Assembly.  </P> <P> Throughout the campaign, Tucker was the target of attacks from his opponents  who questioned his credentials and called him an unqualified puppet.  </P> <P> As he savored his victory, Tucker dismissed those charges and said the voters  had ignored them as well. "They insulted the voters' intelligence" he said of  his opponents. "The voters knew who the best candidate was. They saw through  the smoke screens. The people were informed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mostly Democratic  </P> <P> The predominantly black and Latino Assembly district includes Inglewood, El  Segundo, Westchester, Lennox and parts of South-Central Los Angeles. It is 77%  Democratic.  </P> <P> Tucker outspent his rivals by a wide margin, with contributions from the  medical industry and the Democratic establishment totaling nearly $150,000.  </P> <P> Tucker kept a generally low profile during the campaign, missing most candidate  forums. But his well-funded organization, run by political consultants and  workers on loan from Speaker Brown's staff, sent election literature into the  homes of voters and hit the streets and telephones in a concerted  get-out-the-vote drive.  </P> <P> Tucker is on leave from his job as a legislative aide to Assemblywoman Gwen  Moore (D-Los Angeles), for whom he has worked about a year. He previously  worked five years for Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> The other candidates were limited by their resources. Davis, 34, who raised  about $11,000 from Republican leaders, concentrated on conservative voters in  Republican El Segundo and Westchester, hoping low turnout in other areas could  lead to an upset. He was seeking the seat for the third time, most recently  losing to the elder Tucker last November.  </P> <P> Hill-Hale, 52, a former aide to Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), conducted a  feisty grass-roots campaign that relied heavily on precinct walking and  appearances at churches. She raised about $10,000.  </P> <P> McGill, 29, the clear underdog, focused on the issues of gangs and crime, which  he blamed on ineffective political leadership. The police officer and anti-gang  activist drew his main support from South-Central Los Angeles community  organizations.  </P></p>

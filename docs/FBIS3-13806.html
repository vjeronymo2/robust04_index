			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with former Hebron Mayor Mustafa </F> al-Natshah in Hebron by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo, date not  given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. al-Natshah, good morning and  welcome to the Voice of the Arabs.    [Al-Natshah] Good morning, thank you.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the UN Security Council's  resolution concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre?    [Al-Natshah] I can say that the issue of protection is a  just  demand. We welcome the resolution. I hope that it will be  implemented completely and will ensure real protection for the  citizens against the settlers' attacks and the Israeli army's  actions as well.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The resolution failed to refer to the issue  of Jerusalem. How do you explain this?    [Al-Natshah] We regret that the issue of Jerusalem was not  included in the resolution. This, perhaps, is due to U.S.  pressure. It represents a serious shift in the U.S. position.  The United States has often voted in the past in favor of  considering Jerusalem an integral part of the occupied  territories. But it is the U.S. pressure that has now played a  role in omitting the issue of Jerusalem from the resolution.  All the people have voiced their indignation over this stand.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect that the UN Security Council  resolution, which condemns the massacre, will pave the way for  the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks?    [Al-Natshah] I believe that this could help the PLO return  to  the negotiations, and I also believe that the Israeli  authorities might respond to other demands. We also hope that  the Israeli authorities will also respond to the resolution and  to the other demands set by the PLO as a condition for returning  to the negotiations.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Security Council has called for  providing  a temporary international presence to ensure protection for  Palestinian citizens. What do you think of this presence?    [Al-Natshah] The word presence does not mean international  forces like those that are deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina or  Somalia. It is rather the presence of unarmed UN observers to  intervene in one way or another if attacks take place. This  does not mean armed protection as is the case in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is just few observers in the occupied  territories who would do their best to prevent any attack on the  citizens.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Israeli Government is currently studying  the idea of assembling all the Jewish settlements in an area in  the town of Hebron. Could this represent a solution to  guarantee Palestinian security?    [Al-Natshah] The attempt to assemble them in Hebron is not a  solution. Because the presence of settlements in the heart of  Hebron has split it in half and has obstructed communications  between the southern part and its western and northern parts,  particularly during Fridays and Saturdays when the army bans  traffic between the two parts of the town. Therefore, the best  practical step in this issue is to withdraw the citizens from  Hebron to another settlement as a temporary solution until a  final solution is worked out, namely dismantling the settlements  and withdrawing the settlers from the occupied Palestinian land.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What more do you need from the international  community after the Security Council resolution, which condemned  the massacre?    [Al-Natshah] We call on the international community to help  place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda of the  negotiations. This is a basic demand that has also been  prompted by the Hebron massacre. It is a fundamental, pressing  demand and should not be delayed. Because the presence of  settlements during any transitional stage would be an explosive  issue that might destroy any agreement. This kind of massacre  could recur in the future in other areas and could torpedo any  agreement.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much.    [Al-Natshah] You are welcome.</p>

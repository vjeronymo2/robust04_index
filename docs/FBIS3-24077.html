This was announced by the deputy  mayor's chief of staff, Vitaliy Voytsekhovskiy.    He also added that his boss at this point has not received  the official paper, and it is not quite clear whether a  reprimand had indeed been issued and in what wording. Dmitriy  Sergeyev learned of it only from the mass media. This did not  stop him, however, from preparing the needed documentation,  which will be handed over to the court, in the event he does  receive the official paper from the mayor with the wording  quoted in the press.</p>

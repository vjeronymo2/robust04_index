			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Malinov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Greek plenipotentiary  ambassador to Russia Kiriakos Rodhousakis said in an interview  with ITAR-TASS on Monday [14 February] that the position taken  by Greece as regards launching air-strikes on Serbian positions  in the area of Sarajevo is absolutely clear. Greece is,  perhaps, the only country of the North Atlantic alliance which  declared that it disagrees with the NATO decision, which was  officially registered in its document, the ambassador said. He  spoke at a meeting of Russian and Greek businessmen arranged at  the Greek embassy in Moscow.    The ambassador pointed out that if the bombardment and  military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina begin, none of  the Balkan countries should take part in these operations.  Turkey, for instance, declared its readiness to send combat  aircraft and take part in possible military operations which  might entail more serious consequences, the ambassador said.    The situation in former Yugoslavia and issues of Russo-Greek  bilateral relations and cooperation between the European Union  and Russia will be in the focus of attention during Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's one-day visit to Athens  scheduled on February 18, the ambassador said.    The Russian foreign minister will have talks with the Greek  government and members of the so-called EC trio consisting of  heads of foreign ministries of the former, future and present  chairman of the European Union - Belgium, Germany and Greece,  respectively.    According to the ambassador, the development of Russo-Greek  relations goes ahead, especially following Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's visit to Greece. However, there was some  stalemate in these relations because of parliamentary elections  held in the two countries. However, Russo-Greek agreements will  be given a new impetus by visits to Moscow by the Greek foreign,  economics, defence and culture ministers and representatives of  other departments.    Recently, new possibilities for the development of bilateral  relations appeared, the ambassador added. A few days ago a  delegation of the greek olympic airways company arrived in  Moscow to discuss with their Russian colleagues the  possibilities for the soonest possible opening of direct air  routes connecting the capitals of both countries.    A delegation of the Greek Tourist Organisation (ZOT) is  expected to visit Moscow soon to prepare expositions of Greek  companies organising trips to Greece. A forum of Greek and  Russian entrepreneurs is expected to be held in Moscow to  discuss ways for further development of bilateral cooperation.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Data General in disk drive push DATA General aims to seize a leadership role in the emerging market for disk arrays, a new type of mass data storage system that is gaining popularity as a lower cost alternative to high-capacity computer disk drives in corporate data centres. Yesterday, the minicomputer manufacturer, which is struggling to achieve consistent profitability after more than three years of heavy losses, launched a range of disk array products designed to work with competitors' computer systems. Data General has been selling disk array systems with its own open-systems minicomputers or 'servers' for the past 18 months. Starting in November, the company will offer similar disk systems for use with IBM's RS/6000 systems and Sun Microsystems' Sparc Servers. These will be followed by disk systems for use with Hewlett-Packard, Unisys and ICL server computers. The move represents a bid to build revenues by exploiting its lead in disk array technology beyond the company's own relatively limited base of computer customers. Disk array systems, also known as Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk (Raid) systems, are made up of an array of small disk drives of the type commonly seen in personal computers. They are capable of storing vast quantities of data at a fraction of the cost of large disk systems. A significant advantage of Raid systems is reliability. Employing sophisticated duplication techniques, Raid systems can ensure that data is not lost even if part of the array fails. Raid is upsetting the status quo in data storage technology just as microprocessors have brought wrenching changes to computing. 'In much the same way that PCs and workstations have brought inexpensive compute-intensive applications to the user, this new technology should bring data-intensive applications, such as video, voice, imaging and multi-media to the user as well,' added Mr Thomas West, senior vice president, who will head a new business unit at Data General targeting the disk array market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Cuban Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] In 1993, Cuba invested more than $1.7 million in  social security , some $4 million every 24 hours. [sentence as  heard] Orlando Penante, social security director of the Cuban  Labor Ministry, has indicated that those figures do not include  the costs of social assistance programs, which amount to another  $35 million. Penante stated that despite the economic hardships  Cuba is facing, the number of retirees and pensioners covered by  the social security system has increased in the 50 years of the  special period in peacetime. The number of subjects covered by  social security also surpasses the funds allocated for this  purpose.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THERE IS little evidence of any let-up in the weight of selling by company directors and purchasers are still few and far between. Yet more selling in the insurance broking sector included the week's largest single deal. Both the chairman and the chief executive of Lloyd Thompson sold tranches of stock during the course of 1990, and chief executive Ken Carter has just disposed of 35 per cent of his holding, realising more than Pounds 2.2m. Like most insurance brokers, interim results revealed the extent to which their business has remained relatively unaffected by recession. Shares in engineering group Metalrax remained virtually unchanged after the sale of 1.2m shares by non-executive director Derek Coombs. The shares have enjoyed an impressive recovery since the low point in January. Wace Group, the pre-press services company, has seen two directors sell 580,000 shares between them, of which 100,000 were bought by another main board director. The company has grown rapidly in a highly-fragmented industry and directors may be reducing holdings built up after taking up shares in last summer's rights issue. Option related sales have been very evident, particularly among the blue-chip stocks. Directors in Shell, Prudential Corporation, Cadbury Schweppes and Guinness have all taken this opportunity to take profits on their share options.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Directors' Share Transactions In Their Own Companies (Listed &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 No of Company                  Shares     Value      directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Allied Textile Co.       60,000     240           1 BPP Holdings             40,400     121           2 Brabant Resources        65,000      85           1 Bradstock                73,730     111           1 Cadbury Schweppes       263,000     993           2* Davis (Godfrey) Hdg     130,625     210           1 Druck                     9,500      52           1 Electra Inv.

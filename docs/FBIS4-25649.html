			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The biggest economic debate now facing China's  policymakers is over the performance of state-run enterprises  and this dispute needs to be addressed at the next plenum of the  Communist Party Central Committee, according to a senior  official. "There is a dispute on the understanding of the  overall performance of state-run enterprises," said a State  Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems official.    A consensus on the question was important because it would  help determine the urgency with which the government proceeded  with trying to overhaul the most lethargic economic sector. The  official said that by some measures, the situation looked grim.  Under new accounting procedures nearly half the state-owned  sector was in the red. Yet, by other statistics, state-run  enterprises were not doing all that badly. In the first quarter  of this year, profits and taxes handed over by the state-run  sector to the government increased by 22 per cent, despite a  drop in the tax rate.    Government revenue In the first four months of this year  increased by 250 million yuan (HK$223 million) to reach 8.4  billion yuan. State-run enterprises accounted for 70 per cent  of that revenue.    The official said a central government pilot project to  incorporate 100 state-run companies this year was on target. He  admitted, however, that the companies were not yet selected but  preparatory work had been completed and a decision should be  made in July or August. In addition, provinces would be allowed  to undertake their own experiments to incorporate state-owned  industry. Sichuan, for one, wanted to value the assets of three  dozen state-run enterprises and then sell them off.    However, one central Government concern was that the best  enterprises were floating shares on stock markets in China and  abroad, thus shedding some of their traditional responsibilities  for workers' welfare expenses. In contrast, the enterprises in  the worst financial shape had to continue to shoulder the heavy  burdens of worker welfare.    The official said the government was confident it could  bring  inflation down from just over 20 per cent at the beginning of  the year to under 13 per cent for the whole of 1994. For this  to happen, inflation would have to drop to about seven or eight  per cent in the second half of the year. Because of the high  rate of inflation, price reforms originally slated for this year  have been put off until 1995. The precise pace at which price  reforms would proceed depended on inflation in the second half  of this year, the official said.    Meanwhile, state-run shops in Beijing yesterday increased  prices for some grains by as much as nearly 30 per cent.  Top-quality flour rose from 1.56 yuan per kilo to 2.14 yuan and  top-quality rice rose to 1.92 yuan a kilo from 1.60 yuan.  Edible oil prices would also rise soon, shopkeepers said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference including statement by Prime Minister </F> Tsutomu Hata with foreign and domestic correspondents at the  Hilton Hotel in Brussels; questioners identified by caption --  live]    [Text] I have toured Italy, France, and Germany, and have  met with top leaders of these countries. Just now I had the  honor of being received by King Albert. This evening I am due  to meet with EC Chairman Delors and Belgian Prime Minister  Dehaene.    Never in history has there been a time when cooperation  between Europe, Japan, and the United States is as necessary as  it is now for securing peace and prosperity in the world.  Further strengthening of ties between Japan and Europe is an  important diplomatic task of the new administration.    Seeing as Japan wants to make international contributions,  there are now many developments taking place in Middle East,  Africa, and East Europe. I have visited this place to talk with  European people, who have deep ties and long experiences with  these regions.    In Italy, the first country I visited, I was able to  exchange  views on cooperation with respect to the Naples summit. While I  myself face the task of reforming politics in Japan, in Italy  major reform is currently underway, reform which can be called a  quiet revolution. I had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister  Ciampi, who initiated political reform, and [Belurusconi], who  won in the recent general election. I also had the chance to  talk about our experience as well as the tasks awaiting both  countries.    In France and Germany, which are the two major bulwarks  pushing for integration of Europe I was able to meet with  President Mitterand, Prime Minister Balladur, and Chancellor  Kohl. I greatly benefited from an exchange of views with them  on pending international issues from the perspective of thinking  about the future policies of our country and of affirming the  relationship between Japan and Europe in the international  community.    We agreed that our nations should make efforts to further  strengthen the world's free trade structure. We also agreed  that indeed it would be important, with respect to the Naples  summit, for our countries to announce their common resolve on  tackling unemployment.    I would like to express my welcome to EC Chairman Delors,  who  is an active promoter for establishing the European Union [EU],  on the realization of a powerful and stable EU as a step forward  toward raising the status of Europe in the international  community. On the other hand, I would like to point out that it  is important that the EU build an open and constructive  atmosphere for Japan and other countries outside the Union as  well.    Myself, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, and several others for  the  past 16 to 17 years have promoted relations between Japan and  Europe as well as between the Japanese and European parliaments.  I would like to exchange views with Delors on what I have  learned during these years.    Meanwhile, I am looking forward to the meeting with Prime  Minister Dehaene, as I hope to hear from him how the Belgian  Government intends to seek and pursue further development of the  country while pushing for European integration.    Besides, Belgium plans to send an economic mission led by  Prince Philip to Japan. I hope new relations will develop out  of this.    In the meetings with the leaders I met on this tour, I  explained Japan's political, economic, and administrative reform  programs, which can be called historical. Particularly in the  area of economics, I explained that domestic demand-oriented  economic operations would be continued pursuant to the  guidelines on reform of external economy announced on 29 March  by the Hosokawa government. Actions to enforce deregulation  will also continue, I explained.    There can never be any agreements made between Japan and the  United States at the expense of the EU. I informed them clearly  that all agreements would benefit the EU and other nations.    There are now moves in many European countries to  invigorate economic relations with Japan. Our country welcomes  such moves, and would like to provide cooperation where  possible. I think we should seek to find a point of equilibrium  in economic relations between Japan and Europe--not at a reduced  but on an expanded scale.    By coincidence, the opening ceremonies for the tunnel  underneath the British Channel were held today. This is a  historic and symbolic event which suggests strengthening  European ties.    For my part, I am hoping to see strengthened relations  between a stable and prosperous Europe and Japan, and am sure my  visit to Europe will be a new step towards that.    In my meeting today with King Albert, he expressed a strong  hope to further strengthen and develop relations between Europe  and Japan, as well as between Belgium and Japan. I was deeply  impressed by his words.    Finally, I would like to note that I am very grateful for  the  warm welcome given by the people of this country, the royal  court, and the government, even though my visit was short.    I would like to conclude my statement.    [Terasaki] I am Terasaki from NHK. Please excuse me for  asking a question not directly linked to your Europe trip.  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano has recently stated he believes  the so-called Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, and this  aroused considerable controversy not only in Japan, but also  overseas, even in Europe. In a news conference held later,  Justice Minister Nagano stated he wants to completely recant the  remark and adhere to the prime minister's decision whether or  not he has to resign. I would like to ask, what is your plan to  settle the issue. Also, please let me ask your comment about  your responsibility for appointing such a justice minister.    [Hata] Contrary to the remark by Justice Minister Nagano,  both the previous administration and I have been acknowledging  Japan's invasion and colonial rule during the war. During that  period, Japan inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the  people of many countries. To obtain the international  community's understanding of Japan's future posture, Japan must  frankly express its regret over the wrongdoing and apologize for  it. Japan must not forget its past experience and must not  repeat the tragedy, and on that ground we appealed to the  international community our intention to contribute to  peacemaking efforts. The international community has expressed  its understanding of our resolve, and leaders of some nations  told us that, apart from past incidents, they welcome Japan's  present stance. They said they want future-oriented cooperation  with Japan. Justice Minister Nagano's remarks were not  appropriate. Frankly speaking, I feel his remark was  regrettable.    Immediately after I heard about his remark, I called Justice  Minister Nagano in Tokyo to discuss the issue. I told him I  deeply regretted that his remark spoiled our efforts up to now,  and questioned why he made it. In reply to my warning, he  acknowledged the inappropriateness of the remark and expressed  his intention to withdraw it. He also said he felt really sorry  about hurting the sentiments of many people.    I appointed Nagano as justice minister because, through long  fellowship with him, I knew him as a person with a noble mind  and well-balanced political stand. I am not well informed about  the actual circumstances surrounding the remark, but I would  like to attach importance to his apology. Taking this  opportunity, my cabinet will take the initiative in obtaining an  understanding from the international community. As I noted  earlier, my trip to meet with European leaders was made to  strengthen cooperative ties with the people of Europe in  pursuing genuine world peace. In this sense, we would like to  prove our resolve with our actions, seeking support from the  international community.    [Charles (Bortzman), in English with superimposed  translation  in Japanese] I am Charles (Bortzman) from the WALL STREET  JOURNAL. The European Union is still anxious about trade  deficits with Japan. What is your tangible plan for reducing  Japan's trade surplus? What is EC President Jacques Delors  supposed to do about removing trade barriers with Japan?    [Hata] As regards your first question, Japan will continue  to take macro and micro measures to deal with its current  account surplus. The trade balance is calculated as a result of  various business activities under a free economy; however, if  one nation has a huge current account surplus, it would be  problematic. The problem results from many nations. To cut  Japan's current account surplus, the government will relax or  abolish the bureaucratic regulations and take steps to make it  easier for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese market.  This was incorporated in my 29 March statement, and the  government has already announced its decision to clarify its  future direction of economic policies before the end of June.  Under such circumstances, I intend to work to significantly cut  Japan's current account surplus.    Regarding desirable action by the EU or the EC, many  European  nations are trying to promote exports to Japan by creating a  better understanding of the needs of the Japanese consumer  market. Japan would like to offer support for market access of  products with adequate competitive power, and I hope the EU  continue its efforts in offering good export products.    [Kurimoto] I am Kurimoto from KYODO. I am very sorry to  trouble you, but I would like to return to Nagano's remarks.  You stated earlier you would like to accept his withdrawal of  the remarks and his serious apology, and would like to show  Japan's stance through future actions. Do you mean that, as far  as you are concerned, you have no intention to ask the justice  minister to resign?    [Hata] At the present stage, I would like to refrain from  making any comment on his resignation. As I said earlier,  Nagano is a man who sees things fairly, and he has candidly  apologized for making such remarks. I intend to seek an  understanding of concerned nations. My government is now  explaining our true intent to the concerned nations through  their embassies in Tokyo. Through these efforts, I would like  the concerned nations to understand Justice Minister Nagano as  well as my cabinet. In any case, we should not talk  insincerely. It is important for Japan to work to build peace  while engaging in soul-searching on its war of aggression.  Presently this is our stance.    [Tom Berkeley, in English with superimposed translation in  Japanese] I am Tom Berkeley from HERALD TRIBUNE. You mentioned  Japan will take measures to open its markets to the United  States and the EU. Do You intend to solve the issue of U.S. and  European trade deficits with Japan through the fiscal 1994  budget and market-opening measures to be issued in June? If you  do not have such an intention, why is it?    [Hata] I have received some requests from the EU. I intend  to reflect the requests in a package of external economic  measures to be mapped out in June. You mentioned the solution  of the trade issue among the three parties. However, Japan and  the United States have been discussing the issue for a long  time, and we are now trying to pave a way for solving the issue.  I do not mean we are not taking these matters you mentioned  into consideration, but presently we intend to discuss it  between Japan and the United States. Any agreement reached  between Japan and the United States should be applied to the EU  and other nations. We intend to do so based on the principle of  the most-favored-nation treatment. However, various measures  which we are now taking have reflected EU opinions. Moreover,  we are now proceeding with a committee on administrative reform,  and representatives from the European private sector will  participate in the committee.    [Unidentified AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE correspondent, in  English with superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with  the AP DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE. Earlier this week, central banks  from Europe jointly intervened in the foreign exchange market to  prevent a further decline of the dollar. In connection with  this, are you satisfied with the current level of the yen  against the dollar? What will you do if the dollar drops to  below 100 yen?    [Hata] I believe that the exchange rate must reflect  economic fundamentals. While mid- and long-term prime rates are  increasing in the United States, the recent appreciation of the  yen and the mark is too rapid and drastic. It appears the  market is excessively dominated with a speculative atmosphere.  Japan intends to deal with the recent fluctuation in currency  markets while discussing the currency authorities of other  industrialized nations. With regard to the strength of specific  currencies, I would like to avoid comment since that may  stimulate speculative moves in the market. However, I think  drastic moves in the foreign exchange market are unfavorable.    [Kojima] I am Kojima from SANKEI SHIMBUN. My question is  about Japan's desire to obtain a permanent seat in the UN  Security Council [UNSC]. In the latest meeting with French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, you reportedly said Japan would  offer all possible contributions if it is given a permanent UNSC  seat. I would like to ask what all possible contributions means  exactly. In this connection, I would also like to ask if Japan,  as a nation seeking a permanent UNSC seat, is ready to fully  participate in UN peacekeeping activities and possible sanctions  against North Korea.    [Hata] Japan has already played a role that is consistent  for a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan is  offering wide-ranging contributions to international peace  efforts. For example, Japan is the second largest contributor  to the United Nations, following the United States. To settle  regional disputes, Japan took the initiative in peacemaking and  reconstruction efforts in Cambodia. Regarding disarmament and  arms nonproliferation efforts, Japan is advocating an indefinite  extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and an  establishment of a registration system to control ordinary  weapons. The primary concern of economic assistance to Russia  and developing nations is to stabilize the social situation of  these nations. Japan intends to positively contribute to UN  peace activities, as it has already offered manpower to UN  operations in Cambodia and Mozambique.    Many nations have clarified their support for Japan's  permanent membership in the UNSC, and I believe this is because  they highly rate Japan's efforts so far. Therefore, it is  important for Japan to do everything it can, stressing its  strong points. Even in UN peace activities, Japan can  contribute in various ways, and in some fields Japan may be the  only nation which can help the United Nations. We would like to  positively support the United Nations.    The issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  weapons has been taken up for discussion during a series of  meetings with European leaders and I keenly feel that those  leaders are concerned about the issue. The UNSC has issued a  presidential statement representing the international  community's demand for an early settlement of the issue, and I  positively support the UNSC message. North Korea should work to  dispel suspicions about its development of nuclear weapons to  win an international understanding. North Korea needs to take  such an action to develop itself. The international community  is patiently seeking a consultative settlement of the problem,  and I hope the North Korean people understand that. I want to  take every opportunity to obtain North Korea's understanding of  that.    [Unidentified Belgian correspondent, in English with  superimposed translation in Japanese] I am with a Belgian  newspaper, and want to discuss the nuclear issue. Japan itself  has a large amount of plutonium, for commercial use of course.  In a sense, it can be said Japan's plutonium program is as  important as the North Korean nuclear issue. Do you have any  plans to voluntarily abolish your nation's own plutonium  recycling program before 1995 when the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] expires?    [Hata] To state a conclusion first, there is no possibility  of Japan producing nuclear weapons or being armed with nuclear  weapons. Japan underwent hardships after atomic bombs were  dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In its Constitution, Japan's  Article Nine renounces war. In addition, Japan has the three  principle of not producing, possessing, or bringing in nuclear  weapons. But since there is a nation [DPRK] that has nuclear  weapons, I intend, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S.  Security Treaty, to ensure Japan's peace using the potential  U.S. deterrent force, including nuclear weapons. As for our  plutonium program, in the true sense of the term it is for  peaceful purposes. As you know, Japan is short of natural  resources while needing to secure stable supplies of energy. It  is highly important for the international community to make  effective use of natural resources, or in view of protecting the  environment we are required to use cleaner energy. This is what  we are required to do. In this sense Japan, while making use of  plutonium, will proceed with its plutonium recycling program for  peaceful purposes. Although there is suspicion about Japan's  nuclear program, Japan has extensively concluded safeguard  agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the  same time, Japan has committed itself to support an indefinite  extension of the NPT. In this sense, Japan has been studying  how to use nuclear material for peaceful purposes. However, the  openness of such a study should be increased as much as possible.    [Yasui] I am Yasui with NHK. My question is about permanent  membership in the UNSC. The UN Charter says the Military Staff  Committee will be held among the permanent members of the UNSC  in order to take strategic leadership when UN forces are  organized. Does this run counter to Japan's Constitution? In  addition, although it has been reported that Japan and Germany  have agreed to keep in constant contact with each other in their  bids to win permanent membership, are you planning to promote a  Japan-Germany link in dealing with this issue? Please answer  these two questions.    [Hata] Yes, the UN Charter calls for the opening of the  committee. The committee session is an opportunity to discuss  how they should respond to various local strife, and is not to  endorse the permanent members' participation in military action.  As UN Secretary General Ghali has said, the permanent members  are not bound to military action. He has said the positions of  the permanent members are the same as other UN member nations.  It is important for the permanent members to take the  initiative in carrying out what they can do, such as  peacekeeping operations. Regarding my talks with Kinkel, I have  agreed that Japan and Germany will exchange various information  in a bid to win permanent membership. In view of Germany's  position in Europe and Japan's in Asia, there are some  differences in their respective positions. It is important to  exchange information.    [Unidentified FINANCIAL NEWS correspondent, in English with  superimposed translation in Japanese] Prime Minister, I am with  FINANCIAL NEWS. Japan plans to carry out economic reform along  with other G-7 member nations. For example, Japan claims it  intends to continue carrying out income tax reductions even  after fiscal 1994. I wonder if the opposition will accept such a  plan, and I want to ask how the government will deal with the  issue of a consumption tax increase designed to offset tax  reductions.    [Hata] On this matter, the government will carry out Y [yen]  6 billion-worth of income tax reductions. But if we limit this  tax reduction only to 1994, we will have to increase taxes next  year. In that case, Japan's economy will be greatly affected.  Japan is about to enter an era of an aging society.  Administrative and financial reform designed to improve such  policies as pension and welfare, as well as the correction of  unfair tax systems, are not enough to secure financial resources  in preparation for the future. Moreover, it is difficult to  obtain financial resources from direct taxes upon workers of the  younger generation. In view of this, we have to balance further  tax reductions with the securing of direct taxes and consumption  taxes in preparation for the impending era. There is no doubt  that among the opposition parties there are voices opposing such  a plan. But within the largest opposition party, some members  have shown an understanding of the plan, and the parties which  have recently left the coalition have agreed to exchange frank  discussions on this issue. There is also the fact that a  resolution has been recently adopted unanimously in the Diet on  carrying out drastic reform of taxes--we call them direct taxes  in Japan. No, the tax system. In view of this, I am of the  opinion it is possible to win national consensus.    [Yamada] I am Yamada from TV Asahi. The existing  coalition is a minority government. Parties like Sakigake  [Harbinger] are cautious about Japan becoming a permanent member  of the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, in interviews given by  newly appointed cabinet members, we have heard them make  statements critical of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ]. It appears the cabinet will have a hard time in the  Diet. Meanwhile, a prevailing view about the Hata government is  that it will be hawkish. How do you intend to deal with this?    [Hata] First, is this prime minister a hawk or dove? I  would like you to look at my past 25 years of political life.  People in Japan like to use the expression hawk or dove. But  this indeed is nonsense.    What is at issue is what to do with Japan, what we should do  to bring peace to the world, and what Japan should do to enjoy  the world's peace. The tendency to group people into hawks and  doves is nonsense.    I served as foreign minister for eight months with the  Hosokawa government, and worked in that government along with  people from the SDPJ. It is good the SDPJ people have come to  openly present their positions on security issues and the tax  system. A new pattern of governance is taking place.    We have come to speak more about the opening of information  to the public, consumer interests, and giving more weight to the  lives of the people. We also speak about or act against  environmental issues more than before.    This has been possible because people of different parties  can work together. We have come to appreciate varying views of  the people as a result. of this.    I am aware there have been misunderstandings and differences  of opinion between the SDPJ and other coalition groups, but I  have emphasized to the chairman and the general secretary of the  party that we should make the most of this experience of having  worked together. I have told them that our door remains open,  and that we sincerely want them to return to the government and  work together.    If we are serious about beginning a new governance in Japan,  it will be necessary that we keep the position of leaving the  door open for the party to come back to work together.    You referred to the issue of Japan becoming a permanent  member of the UN Security Council. We are not seeking to become  a permanent member of the council in order to do extraordinary  things.    The United Nations began with 51 countries, and has now  grown  to an organization of 184 nations. In the present post-Cold War  era, there are many things the United Nations needs to do.    Japan's role in Cambodia was different from the one played  in  other countries, and our efforts there were successful because  we were able to convince the Cambodians that it is good to have  peace and to hold elections. Japan has enjoyed peace for the  past 50 years, and has been able to accumulate all kinds of  knowledge. Japan is now being asked by the world to do its part  as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and to make the  most of what it has learned.    That is how I see the matter. I believe Takemura and others  are not objecting to this view. [coverage of the program breaks  off although the news conference continues]</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: Dollars 400 per day THE LAST time I exited St Lucia, writes Michael Thompson-Noel, the Travel editor of The Guardian was in the process of missing his London connection. The airline was concerned, and asked if my colleague would fly into a rage if he was declared a no-show. 'Chuck his bag off,' I said. 'That man is an adventurer, a highly experienced traveller. Nothing would please him more than to be delayed 24 hours in as fine a spot as St Lucia.' And so, of course, it proved. St Lucia figures highly on experienced travellers' score-cards. It is part of the Windward islands, just south of Martinique. It is sleepy, friendly, and outstandingly beautiful. But not so sleepy that Big Money hasn't noticed it. In June, the Dollars 40m Jalousie Plantation, backed by Middle Eastern funds, is due to open, managed by the Miami-based Premier Resorts and Hotels, which runs other fine hotels in the US, Caribbean and Europe. Premier says that the June opening will mark a rare event: the debut of an entirely new hotel beside one of the Caribbean's acknowledged beauty spots. Jalousie Plantation is framed between the Petit Piton and Gros Piton mountains which are St Lucia's symbol. Jalousie has its own secluded beach and 109 guest cottages, including 12 suites. Standard features include verandahs with private plunge pools, custom-size beds, air-conditioning, cable TV, etcetera. There are various restaurants, plus the usual attributes of a modern luxury island resort: golf, tennis, watersports, aerobic classes, hydrotherapy, saunas. And Jalousie is all-inclusive. Charges until December 18 1992 range from Dollars 400 (Pounds 220.90) to Dollars 500 per couple per day, though two couples sharing a two-bedroom deluxe cottage would get away with Dollars 960 per day. The single rate is Dollars 300 per day. There are various child deals available. Cheap it is not, but the rates include everything except air-flights: accommodation, all food and drink, sports, spar programme, transfers, taxes and service charge. Jalousie must be hoping to match the standards found at Four Seasons' luxury resort on Nevis, opened last year. There are direct flights between London and St Lucia. Various UK tour operators list Jalousie, including Caribbean Connection, Elite Vacations, Harlequin Holidays and Happiness Islands.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Kozyrev said that numerous politicians felt no  responsibility for what they were doing to their country.  "Regrettably, our numerous partners in the West fail to  understand that some Russian politicians, notably the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, are more interesting for medical than for  political science. Western businessmen tend to abandon plans to  invest in Russia after reading in newspapers what such politicos  have to say. The net effect is obviously anti-Russian, not  patriotic," he said.    Kozyrev was confident that Zhirinovskiy, a clownish figure,  would not be elected anywhere again.    Kozyrev would like to switch the foreign policy from  ideology  and man-made problems inherited from the cold war to everyday  problems of common people, above all in Russian outlying regions  which make the core of Russia.    In Kozyrev's view, "the state should not harm the regions or  obstruct their development. There is much talk of unemployment  while roads deep inside Russia are such that one is afraid of  riding them. Road construction is the sphere where quite a lot  of people can be employed."</p>

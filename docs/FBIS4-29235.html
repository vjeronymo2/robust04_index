			<p>BFN     [Text] Timed to coincide with its attempt to further drive  the situation on the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war with  the U.S. imperialists by finding faults with our fictitious  nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets staged a game with a  large-scale civil defense drill across South Korea on 15 June by  dragging out thousands of residents, according to radio reports  from Seoul.    The puppets made a stir by blowing warning sirens at 1405  all  over places in South Korea and staging an evacuation drill  preparing for all contingencies. In addition, the puppets ran  amok in staging a drill simulating chemical, biological, and  nuclear attacks in every place.    The South Korean warmongers incited war fever by babbling  that the drill has been restored as a war time evacuation  exercise to prepare for contingencies in the wake of the North  Korean nuclear issue.    Prior to this, the puppets announced that in future drills,  not only some 6.5 million reserve forces but also the U.S.  Forces in South Korea will be mobilized and that it will wage a  large-scale war exercise using various types of war equipment.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  continuously staging war exercises and increasing their degree  by extremely heightening tension on the Korean peninsula. This  shows that the rascals' war hysteria attempting to crush us has  reached an extremely reckless stage.</p>

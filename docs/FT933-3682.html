			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Paris plans income tax cuts and reforms FRANCE will make sweeping cuts in income tax in its 1994 budget and reform a tax system that has been too complicated for too long, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We want to underpin demand,' Mr Sarkozy told TF1 television. 'What you do not spend on taxes you will spend on consuming, and that is very good for industry, and so very beneficial for jobs.' He said there would be a cut averaging 3 per cent for 90 per cent of taxpayers from January 1 1994. Fifty per cent of tax-payers will pay at least 10 per cent less than last year. The cost to the state will be FFr19bn-20bn (Pounds 2.16bn-Pounds 2.27bn), a little more than the FFr17bn originally announced by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last month. Mr Sarkozy, noting that France's tax system has not been reformed since 1959, said the number of tax brackets would be cut to seven from 13 to iron out complexities. He also criticised the current system for penalising those who increase their earnings from one year to the next. 'How do you expect to stimulate and encourage work?' he asked.</p>

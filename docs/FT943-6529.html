			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Government veteran heads Chicago Fed The new head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is a non-banker with political connections. He has spent more time in Washington in the past decade than he has on the bank's home turf, a five-state area that includes Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, writes Laurie Morse. Michael Moskow will assume the Chicago Fed's presidency in September. An economist with a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, Moskow served the Bush Administration as Deputy US Trade Representative, working for Carla Hills. In that job he was a principal negotiator for both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A Republican stalwart of 56, he also served for seven years in the Nixon/Ford administration in various posts, and for a time was Nixon's undersecretary of labor. When not in government service, Moskow held executive positions at several corporations in the Chicago area. Since leaving the Bush White House, Moskow has been teaching strategy and international management at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. His appointment to the Chicago Fed brings unusual experience in international economics and trade to the regional bank, whose territory includes both rust-belt and grain-belt industries that are the US's largest exporters. Moskow will have about a year to become accustomed to bank policy before he becomes a voting member of the Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee. Only five of the 12 regional Fed presidents get to vote on monetary policy at any one time. It's Chicago's turn next year.</p>

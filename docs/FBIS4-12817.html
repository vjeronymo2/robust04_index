			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 13, IRNA -- The visiting Iranian  Majlis speaker, 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, arrived in the city of  Lahore in Punjab Province Wednesday and was warmly welcomed by  the local Muslim people and ulema. Enthusisastic people  chanting 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' lined up from  the airport to the city to receive the Iranian Majlis speaker.    According to an official at Iranian's culture center in  Lahore, people from various cities of Punjab had arrived in the  city and spent the night in religious places as well as at the  culture center to meet Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri.    One of the officials in charge of the welcoming ceremonies  told IRNA that Lahore was rather spending a holiday today so  that people could take part in the ceremonies.    An Iranian student in Lahore said that such an unprecedented  welcome by the people had been only given to the leader of the  Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i and to President  Rafsanjani.    Upon his arrival to the city, Nateq-Nuri visited the tomb of  Pakistan's great Muslim poet, Iqbal Lahori, where he laid a  wreath of flowers. The Majlis speaker arrived in Pakistan  Sunday and has so far held talks with high-ranking Pakistani  officials including President Faruq Ahmad Leghari, Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto, heads of parliament, Shiite and Sunni  Muslim ulema, and Afghan leaders.    The Iranian delegation will later leave Lahore for Karachi.</p>

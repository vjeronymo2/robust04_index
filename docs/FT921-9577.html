			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: GP fund-holding producing benefits for patients one of the most controversial aspects of the government's health reforms - is producing benefits for patients, Alan Pike writes. Professor Howard Glennerster of the London School of Economics, who produced the report for the King's Fund Institute, the health policy research centre, admitted he had started the project as a 'sceptic about fund-holding'. However, his research had made him 'far more positive about the opportunities it presents'. Under fund-holding some family doctors hold budgets from which they purchase care for their patients. Prof Glennerster says he is not yet in a position to judge whether fund-holding should be extended universally, and adds that weaknesses in the scheme need to be addressed. For example budgets should be set in ways which do not penalise GPs who care for disproportionate large numbers of the very sick and old or work in disadvantaged areas.</p>

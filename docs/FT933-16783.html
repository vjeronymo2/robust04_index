			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Bundesbank reward for fiscal chastity VIRTUE MAY BE its own reward but the Bonn government's vow of chastity in matters fiscal yesterday won it a welcome bonus from the Bundesbank. An unusually sunny Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German central bank, noted first that it was the third anniversary of the introduction of the D-Mark into eastern Germany. Then, passing over the widespread belief that that event lies at the root of most of Germany's current problems, he unveiled a cut of half a percentage point in the key discount lending rate. The fifth since the bank started its tiptoe progression since last autumn, it brought the bank's effective floor rate down to 6.75 per cent. The move was backed up by a less expansive quarter-point snip off the Lombard rate, now down to 8.25 per cent. According to Mr Schlesinger, the cuts were prompted by comforting monetary, political and economic indicators. But the closing link in the chain was last weekend's coalition package of public spending cuts worth some DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn). Bonn, after considerable if subtle pressure from the Bundesbank, had done as it was told. The coalition had come up with more cuts rather than taxes to patch the gaps in its budget. Crucially, its package was skilfully engineered to resist erosion by political opposition. If the chain remains intact, the Bundesbank seem certain to offer more. They are once more en route to chipping the discount rate to 6 per cent or even lower by the end of the year. Longer term, said Mr Schlesinger, the rewards may be more widely distributed if the economy turns up at the end of the year, as he expects, as the taxation under the 'Solidarity Pact' may become somewhat less of a burden. The Bundesbank has made little apparent effort to conceal its scorn for Bonn's attempt to tax its way out of the red with its springtime solidarity pact. Just as its anger at having its advice ignored by government has been reflected in the snail's pace progression of interest rate cuts (the last of which was on April 23), so its pleasure at the weekend coalition deal was reflected in yesterday's unexpectedly generous move. Explaining the decision, Mr Schlesinger ran down his checklist, peppering his routine script with optimistic asides. Inflation of 4.1 per cent last month was still too high, but 'happily' the rate of growth was significantly weaker. Money supply growth in May eased to 6.7 per cent year-on-year, down from 7 per cent a month earlier, although it is still above the target ceiling of 6.4 per cent. A 'slight tendency' to weakness in the German currency had stabilised in recent days. He noted that the economy was also stabilising. He cited Hamburg economists' predictions that recovery would start at the turn of the year. Despite his apparent confidence, Mr Schlesinger well knows - and often says  -that too much should not be read into short-term trends. The Bundesbank prides itself on its medium- and long-term outlook, but its decision yesterday seemed based mostly on recent developments which have yet to become established trends. Inflation is still expected to average 4 per cent this year - double the bank's optimum level. Optimism on the economy is based on an uncertain end to the decline in output and a slight increase in foreign orders. By the Bundesbank's own standards, such a delicate substructure demands continuing caution. But at the same time the delicate health of the international economy - and particularly that in Germany - demands more than cheerful noises from Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues.</p>

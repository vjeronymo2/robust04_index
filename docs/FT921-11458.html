			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (7): A rising tide of red ink - Steelmaking RED ink is starting to flow thick and fast across the world's steel industry. According to MEPS, the Sheffield based steel consultancy, steel production in the European Community will continue the fall which set in with a 3.5 per cent drop last year. It projects EC production in 1992 of about 129m tonnes, down from 132m tonnes in 1991 and production in western Europe is projected to 151.4m tonnes down about 5m tonnes from last year. MEPS expects European production to grow again in 1993 and climb to a peak in 1994. The weak outlook in western Europe will be compounded by the mounting difficulties facing producers in eastern Europe which suffered sharp falls in production last year. Steel production in the former Soviet Union in 1991 was about 133m tonnes, a 14 per cent fall on 1990. The Polish industry was among the worst hit with output down about 23 per cent at 10.5m tonnes, while in Czechoslovakia it was 18 per cent lower at about 12m tonnes. With the disruption to trade with the former Soviet Union, and with lower growth in many of these economies, production is likely to fall substantially again this year by about 20 per cent in Poland and 16 per cent in Czechoslovakia and more than 10 per cent in the former USSR. Outside Europe steel markets will suffer gentler falls. MEPS forecasts that US production is forecast to be about 79m tonnes, up only about 1 per cent on last year's production. According to OECD figures steel deliveries fell 8.3 per cent in the first nine months of last year, with sales to the car industry worst hit - they fell 15.6 per cent in the first three quarters - followed by the construction industry, down 11.4 per cent against the same period in 1990. However, the decline in output and falling capacity utilisation is only one of the factors putting the industry under pressure, especially in Europe. Producers there are being hit by a savage combination of falling demand and steeply falling prices as producers battle to preserve their strong domestic market shares and expand exports. Prices have remained highly volatile because they are being set by the least efficient, mainly subsidised producers who need to keep their plants running at high capacity. They are trying to buy market share. More cuts in capacity led by the best managed companies such as British Steel will not make the industry as a whole more stable. Mr Jeremy Fletcher, a director of Beddows Company, the specialist steel consultants, explained: 'The industry has been through a lengthy and painful period of restructuring. Yet from the peak to the trough of the cycle production volumes may still fall by 30 per cent and in addition prices may fall by at least 20 per cent.' The weakness of European markets is bound to complicate the situation facing US steel makers as they see their export surge in the last year dry up (US steel sales to parts of the Far East were 200 per cent up in the first seven months of last year) and face intensifying competition from higher priced imports. The fierce competition is taking a heavy toll upon the industry's finances in Europe and the US, after the brief buoyancy they enjoyed in the late 1980s. British Steel, widely regarded as Europe's financially strongest producer, last month reported its first half pre-tax profits had collapsed to just Pounds 19m from Pounds 307m last year. Analysts expect it could make a loss of up to Pounds 100m this year. In Germany, first half pre-tax profits at Krupp Stahl fell 69 per cent, while at Hoesch, which is in merger talks with Krupp, the fall was 65 per cent. France's Usinor Sacilor warned there were signs the second half of its financial year would be worse than the first when pre-tax profits fell 72 per cent. Most European producers are facing the prospect of falling in loss in 1992. In the US the top six integrated producers, which made a combined loss of about Dollars 1bn in the first six months of 1991, will remain under intense financial pressure this year. However, perhaps the most interesting test will come in Japan, where output is widely expected to fall about 4m tonnes, to about 107m tonnes this year. However, steel producers there are also facing a sharp deterioration in their finances. Nippon Steel, the largest producer, is considering a large reduction in sheet production, which analysts estimate might be 20 per cent. Kawasaki Steel, a leading manufacturer, says all product ranges are under review. With prices falling for many products and labour costs continuing to rise, profits will be squeezed hard. Nippon Steel foresees a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y110bn and Sumitomo Metal Industries, another leading maker, is bracing itself for a 40-45 per cent decline to about Y45bn. Ironically perhaps, the structure of the Japanese industry is one which both US and European makers would like to emulate. In Europe 15 main producers jostle for position in an industry which makes 140m tonnes. In Japan, just five producers dominate an industry which is only marginally smaller. The average Japanese hot strip rolling mill has a throughput of 5m-6m tonnes a year, twice the volume of European counterparts. To compete with the Japanese in the long run the Europeans would need a sweeping reduction in their number of companies and plants. The next year in Europe and the US will be consumed by fighting the downturn through plant closures, labour shedding, joint-ventures to lower research and marketing costs and even full scale mergers to reduce capacity. US producers, which have in the past questioned their long term future in the steel industry, may be forced to answer, while in Europe there will be additional pressure for cross border restructuring. It will be another very tough year.</p>

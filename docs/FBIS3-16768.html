			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 19 Mar -- "People have breathed a sigh  of relief," Vladivostok's new head of administration Konstantin  Tolstoshein affirms. He told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that  at the first planning meeting he told the Mayoralty officials:  "Whoever does not agree to work with us can be dismissed."  Tolstoshein noted that "so far few have expressed such a wish."  Today he and his assistants have been at their desks since  early morning.    As already reported, criminal proceedings have been  instituted against the Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov. He  has been accused of accepting bribes amounting to 3 million  rubles. At the decision of the kray administration he has been  removed from his post. The proceedings have been temporarily  suspended until the arrival in Vladivostok of the investigator  for especially important cases of the Procuracy-General,  Konstantin Mavrin.    "For ten months the former head of administration Viktor  Cherepkov and his team thoroughly neglected the town's economy,  including the building from which they administered the town,"  Konstantin Tolstoshein noted. "Apart from the documentation  which the Procuracy has to sort out, everything there is  tangled. No debit and credit books were kept, accounts were not  kept properly. As a result financial funds were spent without  thought."    The newspaper BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK Tolstoshein affirms,  "reflected the interests of Cherepkov and received at his  personal order several hundred million rubles. And that at a  time when there is a catastrophic lack of funds for social needs  and the town's municipal economy is neglected. Seeing their  extravagant masters, the officials of lesser rank were none too  thrifty with the taxpayers' money either."    Konstantin Tolstoshein said: "When I was asked to become  head of the town administration, I thought for a long time. I  realized it would be difficult: the townsfolk had been fooled by  Cherepkov's populist slogans and promises. I myself am a native  of Maritime Kray. I started as building site foreman, I became  district administration head, then headed the committee for  military industry of the kray's admidnistration. I am no  stranger to difficulties."</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Russian banks face up to a hard currency challenge - Leyla Boulton in Moscow examines the threat to the existing order from foreign institutions AS Russia opens up to the outside world and strives towards a market system, so its banks are beginning to wake up to the potential threat posed by foreign institutions. Russia has 1,550 so-called banks, but only 200 of them are big enough to be worthy of the name, according to an exhaustive study of Russian banking*. With inflation exceeding 2,000 per cent this year, none of the banks provide long-term rouble finance, and their hard currency deposits are placed in foreign banks rather than re-lent inside the country. Even those banks which act as more than transmission belts for central bank credit to state-owned enterprises, face severe shortages of staff, resources and experience. The environment in which they operate throws up serious additional handicaps. The settlements system, for example, is a nightmare: banking documents are handwritten, often get lost, and can take weeks to clear. However, the authorities are aware that the very weaknesses which make Russian banks fear competition militate in favour of a foreign banking presence. The Russian central bank, rebuffing calls by parliament to stop the distribution of licences to foreign banks until 1994, said foreign banks would help attract badly-needed foreign investment. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of Russia's industrialists, claims that if foreign banks were allowed to take deposits from Russian enterprises, which presently put their hard currency earnings in bank accounts abroad, it would help stem the capital flight which is plaguing Russia's reform efforts. In the next week, the central bank is due to produce regulations to assuage Russian banks' fears without closing the door to foreign banks. 'The regulations' main feature will be to counter the accusation that foreign banks will be pumping money abroad. Our position will be vice-versa: that money absorbed by foreign banks will be invested here,' said Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman told the Financial Times. Without giving details of how this would be achieved, he said banks would be required to hold a net asset position - compelling them to keep more money within the country than they take out. Foreign banks eagerly await details, even though only five of the many with representative offices in Moscow have applied for licences to establish subsidiaries. While welcoming the idea in principle, western bankers want to know how it will be enforced. 'You cannot force banks to lend,' said one western banker, who pointed out that foreign banks in Russia still cannot hold land or buildings as collateral. Given that, he wondered whether keeping foreign currency on deposit, as Russian commercial banks do, would count as taking money out of the country. Although Russia at present has no restrictions on foreign banking, obtaining a banking licence can take a very long time. Bank Austria operates on an 'offshore' basis - it can only take deposits from foreign companies and the limited number of Russian enterprises which have the right to hold bank accounts abroad, while Credit Lyonnais is the only bank to have received permission to set up a subsidiary. But the weakness of the rouble means that with starting capital of just Ecu20m, Credit Lyonnais it is among the five biggest banks in Russia even before it has started to operate. Some Russian bankers say they are all for foreign presence but only in joint venture banks like International Moscow Bank, a joint venture 60 per cent owned by foreign shareholders. According to the central bank, by April 1992 it had attracted Dollars 2bn of the Dollars 4bn held by Russian-based banks in foreign currency in correspondent accounts abroad. Here lies Russian banks' main concern: that foreign banks will pick off their most lucrative foreign currency business, leaving them with rouble deposits. It is estimated that only ten Russian banks are capable of withstanding foreign competition in hard currency operations. *Banking in Russia, Guide 1993, published by Osiris Conseil, Paris; Fax 47009252.</p>

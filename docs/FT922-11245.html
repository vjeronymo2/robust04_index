			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / European Bonds: Despondent mood spread by Germany A LITANY of bad news from Germany last week, dashing hopes of an imminent interest rate cut, left European bond markets in despondent mood. The mounting threat of strike action over pay settlements, coupled with a leap in German monetary supply, sent European bond prices tumbling, since it has effectively put further interest rate cuts elsewhere in Europe on hold. 'Speculation about unilateral easing of interest rates ahead of Germany is misguided,' said Mr Steve Major, senior European bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Euro-Securities. The expected delay in interest rate cuts has refocused attention on Europe's higher yielding bond markets. The UK gilts market stands to benefit most, particularly with currency worries out of the way, and the possibility of a move into the narrow band of the ERM in the air. In addition, Italy - despite political uncertainty  - and Spain also appear attractive. So far this year the spread between Spanish and German bonds has narrowed nearly 50 basis points. If the lowering of interest rates is put on hold by the Bundesbank, the higher yields available in these markets are more attractive in the meantime. 'In a way, the Bundesbank is doing us a favour,' said Mr John Hesket, head of international bonds at Baring Asset Management. 'By virtue of its tight monetary stance, we can be sure that inflation is going to be killed, and so rely on reasonably high real returns.' Of all the European markets, the Ecu bond market looks in worst shape. Growing concern over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty continues to depress the market. Although European bond markets have so far failed to attract the substantial shift of funds predicted at the start of the year, other leading bond markets are far from enticing. 'When the shift comes, it will be into European bonds, but no one is in what could remotely be described as a hurry,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G Warburg.</p>

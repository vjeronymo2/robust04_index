Vlcek, director general of the RDP Group arms consortium,  told us. He responded this way to the government draft law on  trade in military material, which was discussed by the  parliament committees yesterday. According to Vlcek, however,  even this law will not be able to protect the Czech arms  factories from being besmirched by foreign competitors, which  have recently described Prague as a dealer in death. "The  regular challenge to the trustworthiness of the Czech Republic  in dealing with military material is partly caused by the effort  on the part of the competition to suppress Czech arms exports.  At times, however, it is also due to our inability to convince  the world that our exports are controlled by clear laws,"  Bretislav Gregr, director of the license administration section  at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said. According to him,  the law defines limits for dealers in military material, which  correspond to international standards. It even refers to state  administration employees who have access to information on arms  trade. After their departure from these bodies, for three years  they are not permitted to work for firms involved in the  production or sale of arms.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: BENEFICIAL  </P> <P> Public radio station KLON-FM (88.1) raised $80,000 during a five-day emergency  fund-raising drive, exceeding the station's projected goal of $75,000. The June  21-25 drive, the first in KLON's history, coincided with the end of the fiscal  year and was necessary because of a revenue shortfall. General manager Rick  Lewis said the drive was the "first of several initiatives to produce revenue,  including corporate and foundation support and earned income from concert  productions." More than 1,000 listeners called in with pledges. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

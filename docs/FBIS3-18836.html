			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["gb."-initialed report: "Money Supply Objective </F> Achievable"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 7 March -- Despite the great expansion  of the money supply in January (annual rate: 20.6 percent),  Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, vice president of the German Bundesbank,  believes that the Bundesbank will still achieve its money supply  objective for 1994. For the fourth quarter of the year, its  target is a 4 to 6 percent increase in the money supply compared  to the fourth quarter of 1993. In an interview with FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE, Gaddum said a preliminary decision in this  connection would probably be made in the coming months. For the  longer term, the framework conditions speak for a slower  expansion of the money supply. In this connection, Gaddum  mentioned the less expansive financial policy, wage agreements  that are compatible with stability, and the absence of tension  on the foreign currency markets. "There is no reason to  exaggerate nervousness," Gaddum said. For the Bundesbank there  is no reason right now to abandon the monetary policy, which is  guided by a long-term perspective, or to change its course as  far as monetary policy is concerned.</p>

[Central Committee], the Workers'  Party of Korea [WPK] and premier of the Administration Council,  made a report "on the great victory of the socialist rural  theses and future tasks" at the national agricultural  conference which opened here today with a large attendance.    The reporter said that the publication of "Theses on the  Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" authored by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song 30 years ago was an event of  historical significance in achieving the victory of the chuche  cause of socialism and the eternal prosperity of the country  and the people. In the period, he noted, our party and people  have made big strides along the road shown by the theses,  bringing about phenomenal changes in all spheres of socialist  rural construction.    He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying:    "In the `Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our  Country' our party illuminated the basic principles and ways for  finding the final solution to the peasant and agricultural  questions after the establishment of the socialist system, and  roused the whole party, the whole country and the entire people  to implement them."    The rural theses are a great programme of socialist rural  construction which was worked out on the basis of the  man-centred chuche idea and a classical work which was the first  in history to give correct answers to all theoretical and  practical questions arising in the solution of the rural  question and break a new ground in the development of the  revolutionary idea of the working class. The rural theses of our  party opened a broad road for revolutionizing the peasants and  assimilating them to the working class, industrializing and  modernizing agriculture to elevate the agricultural productive  forces to a high degree and building the socialist countryside,  affluent and civilized, where the agricultural working people  will enjoy an independent and creative life to the full.    According to the report, first of all, remoulding of man has  been successfully pushed ahead in the countryside and the  ideological and cultural life of the agricultural working people  improved in all aspects through the vigorous efforts to carry  the theses into practice.    Ideological education for revolutionizing and  working-classizing the peasantry was intensified in the course  of fulfilling the task to give priority to the ideological  revolution laid down in the rural theses, with the result that  all our agricultural working people have been firmly armed with  the socialist idea of chuche, the revolutionary idea of our  party, and the chuche idea has become predominant in rural  communities. The great changes in the ideological and moral  traits and manner of work of our peasants are the most precious  success achieved in our efforts to implement the theses, which  is incomparable even to millions of tons of rice.    As a result of the active cultural revolution along with the  ideological revolution, our peasants have grown to be more  powerful beings and their cultural living conditions have been  fundamentally improved.    Regular universities and colleges of agriculture and such  study-while-working centres for training technical personnel as  farm colleges have been firmly built up in each province, at  which a large number of agro-technicians and experts are being  trained. Under the popular policy of our party, tap water, bus,  wire radio and television services have been introduced, clinics  developed into hospitals and cosy modern dwelling houses built  in the rural areas. Newspapers, magazines and various books find  their way to each peasant household. Thus our countryside has  turned into a prospering modern socialist countryside good to  live and work in, which is little different from towns.    With the successful fulfilment of the four major tasks of  the  rural technical revolution--irrigation, electrification,  mechanization and an extensive chemical application--through the  energetic efforts to implement the rural theses, solid material  and technical foundations of socialism have been laid in the  countryside and, on this basis, the peasants are satisfactorily  provided with independent and creative living conditions.    As a result of the completion of irrigation and  electrification of agriculture on a high level, our country has  a most advanced and powerful irrigation system under which rich  and stable harvest is reaped in any weather, and the yearly  electricity consumption in the rural areas has increased 8.6  times the 1963 figure.    Over the past 30 years the number of the tractors and  lorries  engaged in agriculture has increased respectively six and five  times, with the result that the comprehensive mechanization of  agriculture in the country is reaching a high level where all  categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to sowing,  rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, thrashing and carriage  are done with the help of machines.    An extensive use of chemicals in farming has been realized  to  sharply increase the supply of chemical fertilizers. Now, in  our country the amount of chemical fertilizers applied to each  hectare of paddy and non-paddy fields has reached more than two  tons, far surpassing the target set by the theses, and the  quality of their properties has improved with the rational  combination of various kinds of them.    A great progress has been made in the transformation of  social relations in the countryside in conformity with the  requirements of socialism.    Through the efforts to give full play to the advantages of  the new agricultural guidance system, the major component of  which is the county cooperative farm management committee, such  a difficult and complex problem as guiding and managing the  rural economy has been successfully solved on the principle of  collectivism in conformity with the nature of socialism and  industrial guidance and the state's material and technical  assistance strengthened through the committee.    As a result, the advanced industrial management and  production culture have gained a wide scope in the rural  communities and distinctions between industry and agriculture in  industrial management and ownership of the means of production  are diminishing fast.    Over the past 30 years since the publication of the rural  theses, grain production has jumped 1.9 times, of which rice 1.8  and maize 2.2. Our agriculture reaped an unusually rich harvest  last year, the year before the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the rural theses, by effecting a new upsurge,  despite a long spell of frost and abnormal low temperature. The  principle of the right crop on the right soil and in the right  time and an intensive farming method based on tending each  plant with care have been applied on a full scale and the  demands of the chuche farming method for each stage and process  of farming thoroughly met, with the result that we now gather in  8,9,10, and even 15 tons of rice and maize per hectare from  fields which yielded two or three tons in the past.    With the fast progress of ideological, technical and  cultural  revolutions in the countryside, the level of ideological  consciousness of the peasants and their technical and cultural  standards have been enhanced, the material and technical  foundations of agriculture consolidated and the gaps between  industry and agriculture and between towns and rural areas  narrowed in all spheres, creating more satisfactory conditions  for converting cooperative property into all-people property.    The socialist rural economic system in our country is  neither  an invention of an alien nor an imitation of other's. It is a  most independent and popular system of the rural economy which  our people, notably the agricultural working people, have  established for themselves to suit their faith and demand by  applying the rural theses under the leadership of the party.  And it is a most solid and viable system which is advancing  confidently towards socialism on the basis of collectivism.    The 30 years of efforts for building the socialist  countryside and all the historical gains in this course, the  reporter said, prove that "Theses on the Socialist Rural  Question in Our Country" authored by the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song shows the only correct guideline for clearing away  the leftovers of old society in the rural areas after the  establishment of the socialist system and finally solving the  rural question, and that only under the wise leadership of the  party and the leader is it possible to successfully accomplish  the cause of the socialist rural construction without any  deviation and turns and twists and well build an ideal socialist  society of chuche desired by the entire people.    We can say with pride and honor that we have created a model  of socialist rural construction by successfully solving the  peasant and agricultural questions, the difficult and intricate  problems in building socialism, from an independent stand under  the wise guidance of the party and the leader, he noted.    Outlining tasks to give full play to the advantages of the  socialist agricultural system of chuche, he said: We should, as  in the past, so in the future, too, invariably advance along the  road of continued revolution indicated by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song in the theses.    He further said:    We must continue to push ahead with the ideological  revolution in the countryside so as to more closely unite all  the agricultural working people behind the party and the leader,  strengthen the singlehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks  and rear all of them better to be ardent revolutionaries  faithful to the cause of socialism.    An important task in the ideological revolution at present  is  to ensure that all the agricultural working people have a firm  faith and will for the victory of the cause of socialism and  highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  strenuous efforts.    While consolidating the achievements in irrigation,  electrification and mechanization of agriculture and an  extensive use of chemicals in farming, we must increase the  state investment in agriculture and further strengthen the  material and technical foundations to bring another epochal  change in agricultural production.    And we should continuously push on the cultural revolution  in  the rural areas to raise the level of technical and cultural  standard of the agricultural working people and build a more  cultured countryside.    The industrial guidance of agricultural production must be  strengthened in conformity with the realistic demand of the  developing rural economy, the leadership of all- people property  over cooperative property constantly enhanced and measures taken  for gradually converting the cooperative farms into farms of  all-people ownership in order to establish the single ownership  of the whole people in future.    The internal and external situation of our revolution  remains  grim and complex and our people's struggle is difficult and  arduous, but no imperialist reactionary force can bring into  submission the Korean people who are advancing courageously with  conviction of the validity of their cause or deprive our people  and agricultural working people of their independent and  creative life which they are enjoying in the most advantageous  socialist society of chuche, the reporter concluded.</p>

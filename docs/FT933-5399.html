			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Observer: Mark to market Tell a City trader or analyst that Britain works from 9 to 5 and they will laugh wearily in your face. The image of the UK as a nation of late-risers has not been up-to-the-minute for some time. Just recently, the Central Statistical Office stepped up the pace by bringing forward the release time for important facts and figures to 9.30 am from 11.30 am. But surely it is the thin end of the wedge when the Bank of England's directors succumb to the early-bird revolution? Since the beginning of this week, 'Books', the daily meeting in which Bank directors discuss events and policy, has been held at 8.45 in the morning compared with 11 o'clock previously. There are no prizes for guessing that Eddie George, the Bank's Stakhanovite new governor, was the moving force behind this change. As a markets man first and last, he could see the advantage of getting the directors together just after financial markets have opened and before the Bank's money-market operations get under way around 10. The early start marks a big change - Books has been held around elevenses since time immemorial. But Bank insiders are anxious to dismiss the impression of bleary-eyed directors struggling out of the shower to make the meetings. 'Directors have been getting in for that time anyway and now are pleased to have a clear morning afterwards,' puffed one loyal official yesterday.</p>

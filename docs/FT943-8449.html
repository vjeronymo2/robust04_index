			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Public sector borrowing likely to fall below Treasury forecast The UK's public sector borrowing requirement fell to Pounds 1.1bn in July, indicating that the government is having success in keeping tight control of its spending programmes. Many economists are now convinced that the full year borrowing requirement for the financial year 1994-95 will fall short of the Treasury's Pounds 36.1bn forecast. Estimates of the likely deficit range between Pounds 30bn and Pounds 34bn. The improvement in public finances increases the chances that the government might be able to cut taxes before the next election. But analysts warned that the government would be unwise to announce cuts in the November Budget. Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at stockbroker James Capel, said: 'We would be concerned about such tax cuts unless they were funded by clear cuts in public expenditure since the better than expected PSBR outlook owes much to economic growth being stronger than official forecasts. In these circumstances, tax cuts not matched by spending cuts would only fuel already robust demand growth.' In the first four months of the financial year, the cumulative public sector borrowing requirement was Pounds 12.5bn, compared with Pounds 14.8bn in the first four months of 1993-94. If privatisation proceeds are excluded, the running total this year is Pounds 13.4bn, compared with Pounds 18.3bn in 1993-94. Government coffers were swelled in July by the repayment of some Pounds 380m of debt by privatised electricity companies and Northern Ireland airports. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the July deficit was Pounds 1.5bn. The better-than-expected performance in government finances this year has mainly been due to a decline in public spending. Revenues from taxes and other government income have risen less quickly than the Treasury forecast, although these contributed most to the overall improvement. Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 69.9bn in the four month period, 4.5 per cent higher than the Pounds 66.9bn received in the same period in 1993-94. Public spending, in the form of net departmental outlays, reached Pounds 77.9bn in the first four months, 2 per cent lower than in the same period in 1993-94. Treasury forecasts had predicted an 11 per cent gain in revenues and a 4 per cent rise in spending this financial year. Bonds, Page 20 Currencies, Page 23 London stocks, Page 32</p>

Maria Cristina Arguello, Nicaraguan government ministry  spokeswoman, told ACAN-EFE "everything is set, and the necessary  conditions are given" for the disarmament.    The government and the 3-80 Northern Front, led by Jose  Angel  Talavera, alias "El Chacal," signed a four-point agreement last  week which establishes the mechanism that will be used to begin  disarming the rebels and possibly end the conflict in northern  Nicaragua.    Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and delegates from the  Army and verification and follow-up commissions met with rebel  leaders on Tuesday in Quilali, on the Honduran border, to  establish whether the agreements had been fulfilled.    "It was a preparatory meeting to finalize the details of the  first phase of the demobilization and disarmament process,"  which will take place in the village of Caulatu, Arguello  explained.    The second contingent of "recontras" (approximately 250 men)  is scheduled to surrender its weapons on 16 March, and the  remaining members of that unconventional force, including its  general staff, will surrender on 8 April.    According to military sources the 380 Northern Front, the  foremost armed group, is formed by approximately 500 people,  mostly former members of the "contra" who fought against the  Sandinist government.    Argentine Sergio Caramagna, general coordinator of the OAS  International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS),  has said the 3-80 Northern Front's demobilization "will mark the  beginning of the dismantling of armed violence" in Nicaragua.    Nevertheless, in statements to ACAN-EFE the diplomat warned  if broad social and economic programs are not implemented in the  northern regions, there may be a resurgence of armed violence.    "Broadly speaking, peace is coming of age" in Nicaragua,  "but  I believe the time has come to attack the root of the conflict,"  Caramagna stressed.    He also expressed concern over two "recontra" leaders known  as "Northiel" and "Charro" who did not sign the recent peace  agreements signed by "Chacal" and the government.    The Army has reiterated it will fight the groups that have  not agreed to surrender their weapons, adding the groups led by  "Northiel" and "Charro" are formed by approximately 100 men only.    President Violeta Chamorro urged the people last week to  forget the chapter of armed violence in Nicaragua, and she  called for a reconciliation among the Nicaraguan people.    The "recontra" problem emerged in Nicaragua after Chamorro  took office almost four years ago. Thousands of the 22,000  former "contras" rearmed themselves because they were unhappy  with the government, which, in their opinion, had failed to  fulfill the agreements for their return to civilian life.    Sandinist Legislator Carlos Gallo, president of the National  Assembly Human Rights Commission, will attend the disarmament  ceremonies of the first 100 "recontras" from the 3-80 Northern  Front.    Gallo said the Chamorro government "must now fulfill its  pledge to present a new social and economic emergency program"  for the rebels' definitive return to civilian life.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESSAYS OF A KREMLINOLOGIST;  </P> <P> TYRANTS AND TYPEWRITERS COMMUNIQUES FROM THE STRUGGLE FOR TRUTH BY ROBERT  CONQUEST (LEXINGTON BOOKS / D. C. HEATH: $19.95; 208 PP.; 0-669-21222-9)  </P> <P> The first thing that strikes one about "Tyrants and Typewriters: Communiques  From the Struggle for Truth" is that its splendid title is a misnomer.  Ostensibly presenting portraits of Soviet writers and their works, and showing  how, over time, the pen has proved a mighty weapon against oppression and a  primary stimulus for glasnost, this book really offers a loosely connected  collection of reviews and essays by Kremlinologist Robert Conquest, author of  numerous books on Soviet politics and history.  </P> <P> Each piece in the collection was written to stand alone and appears without  prefatory comment. Thus not only does no continuity exist between pieces, but  proceeding from one to the next is a bit like being thrown successively into  the deep end of vastly different swimming pools. We're not given an opportunity  to dip our toes into the water first, to understand what we'll be dealing with;  and by the time we've managed to struggle to the surface, we're plunged into  yet another unfamiliar pool.  </P> <P> It's not that these waters aren't worth our efforts, however. Taken  individually, Conquest's reviews and essays offer important insights into a  wide range of writers and their works. These self-contained analyses are  grouped into three rather arbitrary sections (only one of which is preceded by  an introduction) -- "Witnesses," "Literature" and "History and Pseudo-History."  </P> <P> Among the 10 pieces in "Witnesses" is a discussion of Hungarian-born novelist  Arthur Koestler's masterpiece based on the Moscow trials of the 1930s,  "Darkness at Noon." Conquest's historical critique of this work illuminates our  understanding of how Koestler was able "to effect one of the first major  penetrations of the Western consciousness by a true feeling for the element of  vast and ruthless deception in the Stalinist scheme of things." Two other  notable inclusions are a review of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei  Sakharov's "Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom" and a detailed  assessment of the impact of "The Gulag Archipelago" by Nobel laureate Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn.  </P> <P> A brief introduction entitled "The Issue" precedes the second section, "Tyrants  and Typewriters." Simply put, in Soviet literature the "issue" is artistic  freedom -- the ability to speak one's mind without catering to a political  agenda.  </P> <P> Although Conquest claims he approaches the 11 authors and works grouped under  "Literature" from a "fundamentally literary point of view," he provides ample  discussion of related political situations and implications, particularly in  the essays on Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg, poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and former  editor (of the influential literary journal Novy Mir) Alexander Tvardovsky. And  this is all to the good, because such discussion is Conquest's real strength.  The more strictly literary analyses (on poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, for example)  aren't nearly as compelling.  </P> <P> The final section, "History and Pseudo-History," contains 16 pieces. Included  are a particularly insightful review of Roy Medvedev's "Let History Judge," a  discussion of genocide as revealed in Alexander Nekrich's "June 22, 1941," and  a review of Harrison Salisbury's "The Siege of Leningrad" that examines  mortality statistics. A short epilogue on Solzhenitsyn forms the volume's  conclusion.  </P> <P> Discussing Solzhenitsyn's role in the West and his impact on Soviet leadership,  Conquest notes that now is the time for the Kremlin to consider the author's  advice as set forth in his 1973 "Letter to Soviet Leaders." "He asked of them  not that they abandon power," Conquest writes, "but that they withdraw the  autocracy to the realm of political rule only, allowing an autonomous civic,  legal, economic and intellectual life to their citizens; and that they renounce  their expansionist world mission." It was Solzhenitsyn and the other writers  examined in "Tyrants and Typewriters," Conquest avers, who were responsible for  crippling the Soviet system's "huge organism of falsehood" and who showed "the  best way forward for a return to reason and reality."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, though this sounds impressive and may well be true, "Tyrants and  Typewriters" never clearly shows how this happened. The book's introduction  claims that, in addition to dealing with political themes, "Tyrants and  Typewriters" is "about writing in general, as the sphere in which the  individual asserts autonomy against the power of the state." Although we see  this indirectly throughout the volume, Conquest never makes the connections  explicit enough.  </P> <P> Perhaps the book's main problem lies in its very concept. Assembling a diverse  collection of reviews and essays into one coherent statement is a difficult  task at best; one way of ensuring at least a modicum of unity, however, is by  linking together the separate pieces. "Tyrants and Typewriters" would have been  far better -- and more accessible to a broader audience -- had each piece been  put into context and related to the rest. As it stands, this critical  compilation will be of interest to (and understood by) only a very small group  of Soviet specialists.  </P> <P> Regrettably, this is one case in which the total is less than the sum of its  parts.  </P></p>

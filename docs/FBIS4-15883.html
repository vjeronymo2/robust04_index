			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 ITAR-TASS -- Russian newspapers  comment extensively on the NATO airstrike at Bosnian targets  near Gorazde.    "The strikes in Gorazde were made without consulting Moscow,  but Moscow is again expected to display activity to bring the  Serbs back to the negotiating table", NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA says  today. "This means that no one counted on the success of the  airstrikes. The question is: What was the objective. In the  military context the entire result of the operation is a couple  or two smashed tanks and APC's (armoured personnel carriers)",  the newspaper says.    "Can the fragments of the Bosnian settlement be collected?"  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI queries. It publishes a survey of views on  the NATO operation by officials of the Russian foreign and  defence ministries, a parliament member and a scholar. State  Duma subcommittee chairman Vyacheslav Nikonov said that "as a  result of NATO unilateral military action Russian found itself  practically excluded from the process of decision-making about  the settlement of Bosnian crisis. This can exert a negative  influence on the development of relations between Russia and the  West and strengthen the position of those political forces in  Russia which are against Russia's participation in the  Partnership for Peace programme and the nationalist forces  within Russia who criticise the present government's foreign  policy".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA recalls that "53 years ago today,  several hundreds of German planes dropped 360 tonnes of bombs on  Belgrade. Airstrikes continue today. The Balkans, where the  First World War began, are being bombed. Prominent historians  utter fearful but just words: "The Balkans are a convenient  place for unleashing world wars".    "Bosnia: Fewer Chances for Peace" is a title in KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA. "The situation in Bosnia has once again demonstrated two  approaches to the settlement," the newspaper says. "Russia is  committed to reason, to difficult, albeit slow negotiations.  The United States and NATO relay on military force."    PRAVDA carries an article by its special correspondent  Nikolay Krivomazov from the area of NATO combat activities in  the Balkans, "where for the first time after the Second World  War foreign planes are bombing slav lands. Here in Sarajevo one  becomes particularly aware that the First World War began in  this place. Will the fuse in the Balkans set aflame by the  Kremlin perestroyka set off a bomb that will shake the world?".    TRUD singles out the view of Sergey Shakhray, vice premier  and the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord: "The  airstrikes hit not only Serb targets but also the internal  political situation in the Russian Federation: Nationalists are  the only force that stands to gain from them in Russia".    An interview with Belarussian parliament chairman Mecheslav  Grib is published by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Asked whether the  republic's sole orientation towards Russia threatens its  sovereignty, Grib said: "It is a question of an economic  alliance, of which there are many in the world. As concerns the  alleged threat to our sovereignty from a political alliance, I  must say that no talks on this subject have been or are being  conductive. Russia does not encroach on Belarus's independence  -- I am saying this with full confidence. The item on the  agenda now is economic alliance between our countries. The  unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus must  be the first step towards it. Unfortunately, the process has  been drawn out for too long.</p>

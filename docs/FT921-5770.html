			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Arens emerges as man most likely to succeed Shamir MR MOSHE Arens, Israeli defence minister, yesterday emerged as the potential successor to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for leadership of the ruling Likud Party, after beating off competition from Housing Minister Ariel Sharon and Foreign Minister David Levy for the crucial number two spot on the party list. Mr Sharon, one of Likud's leading hawks and an outspoken advocate of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, emerged number three on the list, dealing a severe blow to the more moderate Mr Levy, who was pushed down from number two to number four on the party list. Supporters of Mr Levy, who has been an force behind Israel's participation in the Middle East peace talks, accused Mr Arens and Mr Sharon of joining forces to push the foreign minister down on the Likud roster. The Moroccan-born Mr Levy has a strong following among the working-class and poor Sephardi voters, who have traditionally given Likud its edge in polls. Should Likud emerge victorious in the upcoming June national elections, Mr Sharon is likely to receive a key ministerial post as a result of his strong showing yesterday. The US-born Mr Arens, considered to be closely allied with the prime minister, represents the mainstream camp of Likud. He had previously served as foreign minister in the national unity government several years ago. Among the other Likud members to emerge high up on the party's list were Mr Binyamin Begin, son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Tube strike looms as rail deal looks set to be accepted The deal hammered out to settle the 15-week rail dispute is expected to win overwhelming endorsement from the signal workers over the next two days. But in a separate dispute members of the RMT transport union are still threatening to bring London Underground to a halt for 24 hours tomorrow. The package accepted by the union executive and negotiated with Railtrack, the state-owned company that operates the network's infrastructure, is being put to a telephone poll of union members today and tomorrow. The result is expected tomorrow evening. The main points of the deal are: an average increase in signalworkers' total earnings, including overtime and supplements, of 8 per cent this year; a 20 per cent average increase in basic rates; a one-off lump sum payment averaging Pounds 480; a further 2.5 per cent annual pay rise this year backdated to April. The first three elements of the deal are linked to future productivity improvements. They do not include any payments for past efficiencies, the demand made by the union that led to the dispute. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said yesterday the deal was an 'excellent' one for the signal workers as well as being a 'sound investment for Railtrack and the railway industry generally. It is a victory for the steadfastness of the signal workers'. Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, said he bitterly regretted it had taken 'many weeks of needless strikes' before the deal had been achieved. 'At last we have reached an agreement to modernise the working practices in the railway industry,' he said. He questioned Mr Knapp's assertion that the signal workers would have an 8 per cent average increase in earnings. He claimed the actual figure was 3.4 per cent. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, also welcomed the agreement. He said it was 'fully consistent with the government's approach to public sector pay' as well as being self-financing and containable within Railtrack's overall pay bill of just over Pounds 800m a year. But as both sides were congratulating themselves on solving one transport dispute, a new one loomed as the RMT executive was meeting yesterday evening to discuss tomorrow's industrial action on the Underground. The union is demanding a rise of at least 4 per cent for its Underground members after they rejected a 2.5 per cent offer in a ballot. The other five unions whose members work on the Underground have accepted the 2.5 per cent offer. Mr Knapp said no further talks were planned to try to resolve the dispute and tomorrow's strike was likely to go ahead. However, London Underground said it expected formal notification today from RMT that it was ready to delay the strike to allow time to reach an accord.

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Magistrates in the middle: After a run of scandals, France is trying to prise politics and business apart With corruption allegations having claimed two members of his cabinet, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is scrambling to prevent his government being tainted with scandal in the run-up to a presidential election that he clearly intends to contest. Mr Balladur last week proposed a series of amendments to France's existing political finance and anti-corruption legislation. These would subject public procurement to closer scrutiny and leading politicians to an annual audit of their personal wealth, as well as cut by a third the total amount that presidential candidates could spend in the 1995 campaign for the Elysee. But many - including senior parliamentary figures - are calling for more radical reforms, such as a ban on all corporate contributions to political parties. Such proposals highlight public pressure for stronger measures against corruption, raising questions about the extent of the problem, the response of the political and corporate establishment, and the implications for relations between business and state. Most observers agree that corruption in French politics and business is not on an Italian scale. Mr Balladur is almost certainly right in saying that 'only several tens among France's 500,000 elected politicians' are besmirched by scandal. But Mr Alain Carignon, his former communications minister, is now in a Lyons prison facing charges of corruption in Grenoble, of which he is still mayor. Mr Gerard Longuet has been forced to resign as industry minister over allegations concerning payments for his holiday villa in St Tropez and the funding of his Republican party. The mayor of Lyons faces investigation, and the ex-mayor of Nice awaits extradition from South America on similar charges. Internationally known company chiefs have been hit. Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, head of the Saint Gobain glass and packaging group, has been placed under investigation in a case involving influence-trafficking, which triggered the probes into Mr Longuet. Several executives from some utilities and construction groups have been questioned concerning the terms on which they secured public works contracts. Mr Didier Pineau-Valenciennes, chairman of Schneider, the electrical engineering group, and Mr Pierre Suard of Alcatel Alsthom, the telecoms, transport and engineering company, have been placed under investigation in different types of cases. The former, accused of defrauding minority investors, is the object of an international arrest warrant issued by a Belgian judge, while the latter faces accusations that he used company funds to pay for work on his private property. Much of the drive to uncover corruption has come from the French magistracy, which has shed its former servility to political and corporate power. Its first targets were the Socialist party's finances, the personal finances of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former prime minister who committed suicide 18 months ago, and the tangled affairs of Mr Bernard Tapie, the leftwing MP and former businessman. But the number of investigations - and the levels they reach - has risen sharply this year, shaking government and business leaders. 'Many company chairmen are terrified,' says Mr Elie Cohen, a Paris professor of business. 'They have seen the treatment of their counterparts and they are traumatised.' Business leaders have condemned the high-profile methods of the magistrates and the lack of respect for judicial secrecy. Mr Suard, for example, was detained for 12 hours in police custody, and claims details of the investigation were leaked to the press. But the spate of investigations has also prompted soul-searching about the way business is conducted. The Patronat employers' federation has set up a study group with a remit wider than Mr Balladur's anti-corruption commission, to include companies' relationship to the law, judges and politicians, as well as to examine means by which companies could exercise better control over themselves. Some sectors and companies are already taking their own action. The National Federation of Public Works is working on a code binding its 6,000 member companies not to offer bribes to win the FFr150bn (Pounds 18bn) worth of public contracts they carry out every year. Carrefour, the supermarket chain, has forbidden employees to accept presents worth more than FFr1,000 from suppliers. Generale des Eaux, the utilities and communications group, has an ethics committee headed by a retired senior manager to guide managers on sensitive contracts. Companies are also questioning whether a tradition of powerful bosses with inadequate internal controls has permitted malpractice. 'There is too much concentration of power in the PDG (presidents directeurs-generaux). Stronger boards are needed with more checks and balances,' says Mr Henri-Claude de Bettignies, professor of ethics at Insead business school. Pressure for reform of corporate governance in France predates the current scandals. The legal adviser to one leading industrial group says the problem is that 'PDGs control boards rather than vice versa'. A 1966 reform enabling the creation of a supervisory board headed by a president, and a directoire headed by the chief executive, would help divide power and responsibility. However, only 2 per cent of French companies have adopted the practice. This Anglo-Saxon type of solution does not sit easily with French corporate culture. 'Non-executive independent directors do not attract us,' says a one business leader. For many observers, however, more fundamental problems lie in the close relationship between business and state, particularly at the local level. Scope for corruption was increased by the decentralisation of decision-making powers to the regions over the past decade, and the trend by cities to contract more of their water and waste treatment services to private companies. Half of France's 36,000 communes, representing 75 per cent of the population, now have water provided by contractors. 'These companies have the technology and capital required these days to carry out these services,' says the National Association of Mayors. But there is widespread suspicion of sweetheart deals between public officials and private companies. Mr Balladur now proposes giving back to prefets - central government's representatives in France's 95 departements - the power to suspend contracts where there is ground for suspicion. A more radical proposal touted by some would be to ban all companies carrying out public contracts from giving any money to politicians. A 1990 law restricts to FFr500,000 a year the amount that a company can donate to a political party. But there is a loophole for the construction and utility groups, since each subsidiary of a group can make donations up to this limit. Utilities tend to set up separate subsidiaries to manage major municipal contracts, so that Generale des Eaux, for example, has 2,500 subsidiaries. Some say pressure for transparency is growing. 'We will move towards a process of increased legal scrutiny of public contracts,' says Prof Cohen. 'The more affairs there are, the more momentum will grow for a system of auctions and safeguards, such as a panel of magistrates which can oversee contracts.' He belives that the process is under way. The award last month of the potentially lucrative third mobile telephone licence to Bouygues involved a detailed analysis of rival projects and stirred a debate about the terms of the contest. 'This kind of debate would not have happened before. It was a significant step,' says Prof Cohen. More steps will need to be taken. 'Even if corruption is less than before, the popular perception is that it is rife,' admits one executive of an industrial company. 'This is creating anti-business feeling, and has to be resolved quickly.'</p>

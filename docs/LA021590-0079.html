			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINY CITY HAS BIG PROBLEM WITH CAR THEFTS;  </P> <P> CRIME: HUNTINGTON PARK RANKS NINTH AMONG CITIES NATIONWIDE IN PER CAPITA  VEHICLE THEFTS. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ONE DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO HANDLE THE  CASES.  </P> <P> Felicia Jones parked her 1979 Toyota one afternoon last month on Pacific  Boulevard in Huntington Park's busy shopping district. The 23-year-old Los  Angeles housewife returned shortly to find her car missing.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't believe it was gone," Jones said. "I wasn't gone for more than  about 30 minutes."  </P> <P> But bold, daylight car thefts are typical in Huntington Park.  </P> <P> "The auto theft in this city is unbelievable," said Lt. Paul J. Catani, chief  of the Huntington Park Police Department's detective bureau.  </P> <P> The city had the ninth highest per-capita rate of motor vehicle thefts in the  nation in 1988, the last year for which a national ranking was available,  according to the National Automobile Theft Bureau. That year, Huntington Park  reported 1,505 thefts, or 26.2 vehicles per 1,000 residents.  </P> <P> Newark, N.J., topped the list in 1988 with 14,559 thefts, or 45.6 car thefts  per 1,000 residents. Los Angeles was 37th with 57,331, or 16.9 car thefts per  1,000 residents.  </P> <P> The numbers were even worse for Huntington Park in 1989, when 1,662 vehicles  were stolen, a ratio of 27.9 thefts per 1,000 residents.  </P> <P> Poverty in Huntington Park, which is one of the nation's poorest cities, a  steady stream of cars on Pacific Boulevard and a bare-bones Police Department  contribute to the problem, police officials said.  </P> <P> The median household income in Huntington Park was estimated to be $15,481 in  1985. The countywide figure was $23,905.  </P> <P> Detective Ronald Farris, the city's only auto theft investigator, said there  apparently are no well-organized auto theft rings operating in Huntington Park,  a city of about 59,000. The majority of thefts are committed by youths who take  a stereo or other parts before dumping a car, he said.  </P> <P> Farris said one juvenile was carrying a shopping list when he was arrested.  </P> <P> "He had a list of who he sold to, how much and who wanted what," Farris said.  Occasionally, stolen cars are tracked to an area "chop shop," where cars are  cut into pieces and sold.  </P> <P> The thefts run in cycles. Chevy Luv trucks from the late '70s and early '80s  may be the choice of thieves for several months, and then another model is  targeted.  </P> <P> Currently, Nissans and Toyotas are preferred. Toyotas have been vulnerable in  recent years, ever since a clever car thief discovered that a shaved-down key  from one Toyota could open others, Farris.  </P> <P> About 80% of the cars stolen in Huntington Park are recovered within 10 to 15  days, Farris said. The majority of those cars are recovered in South Los  Angeles or East Los Angeles, but occasionally a car will turn up in Long Beach,  San Pedro or San Diego.  </P> <P> Jones, the housewife who lost her Toyota while she shopped, said officers  recovered it in eight days. The car was damaged on one side and a $200 engine  part had been stolen.  </P> <P> Pacific Boulevard, a strip of shops, restaurants and movie theaters, is a key  reason so many cars are stolen in Huntington Park, Farris said. Shoppers  provide a steady stream of cars, and they often park in unguarded lots behind  the stores that front the boulevard.  </P> <P> A four-square-block area bounded by Zoe, Florence, Rita and Rugby avenues is  particularly vulnerable. Pacific Boulevard runs down the middle.  </P> <P> "That's where the bulk of cars are taken, and they're taken from noon to 5  o'clock," Farris said.  </P> <P> The city's many alleys, where residents often park, also are attractive to car  thieves.  </P> <P> Catani said the Police Department has been unable to reduce the auto theft rate  because it has too few officers. "Our main problem is manpower," Catani said.  "High visibility is a high deterrent to auto theft."  </P> <P> Police officials will ask the city to hire a sergeant and four motorcycle  officers next year to attack the problem of auto thefts, Catani said. The  request probably will be turned down. Last October, financial problems forced  the city to lay off 25 employees.  </P> <P> Huntington Park is an extreme example of a statewide trend, according to a  California Highway Patrol spokesman.  </P> <P> Statewide, 267,229 vehicles were taken in 1988, a 15.5% increase over the  previous year. There were 114,785 motor vehicles stolen in Los Angeles County  in 1988, up 6.9% from 1987. Nine out of 10 of those vehicles were cars, pickup  trucks and vans, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> A survey of 11 Southeast area cities revealed increases in auto theft in all  but one.  </P> <P> During 1984-85, thieves took 473 vehicles in Lakewood, compared to 1,002 in  1988-89. Similarly, vehicle thefts for Downey jumped from 605 in 1985 to 1,211  last year. Detectives in several of the cities said they cannot pinpoint any  one reason for the increase.  </P> <P> Several Southeast area cities have been moving recently to curb auto thefts.  </P> <P> Last November, Lakewood started its Auto Watch program, which is patterned  after a program in New York City.  </P> <P> Residents who participate in the voluntary program are given stickers to place  on their cars. The stickers tell officers they have the right to stop the car  between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., a period of time when the owner usually would not be  driving his car. Lakewood spokesman Donald J. Waldie said about 400 residents  have signed up since the program was introduced.  </P> <P> "It's designed to give an extra measure of security to people who park their  cars in their driveways and streets at night," he said.  </P> <P> Downey police officials are considering a similar program.  </P> <P> The Lakewood sheriff's substation has started a new warning program for  residents in the six Southeast cities it serves: Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos,  Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood and Paramount. Deputies place notices on unlocked  cars that state: "Your car could have become a statistic."  </P> <P> Of the 11 Southeast cities surveyed, Compton was the only one to report  declining numbers of auto thefts. The number of motor vehicle thefts in Compton  has been decreasing from 1,773 thefts in 1985 to 1,478 last year, according to  a Compton Police Department spokesman.  </P> <P> The downward trend is difficult to explain, Cmdr. Thomas Armstrong said. "We  haven't put any special enforcement effort on it," Armstrong said. "It's just  one of those phenomena."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HUNTINGTON PARK AUTO THEFTS LEADER  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:1.89IN:2.22IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

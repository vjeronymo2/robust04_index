			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGGRESSION IN CENTRAL AMERICA  </P> <P> Up to now I didn't know quite how to say it, but with a little help from our  President I can now express myself. Don't accuse me of plagiarism; the stuff in  quotes is from the kinder and gentler George.  </P> <P> "I've had it with cruelty" by our Contra mercenaries who "ransacked and  pillaged a once peaceful and secure country, its population assaulted,  incinerated and even murdered."  </P> <P> "I've had it with brutality against innocent people" in El Salvador and  Guatemala and all the people who are being "starved by brutal dictatorships"  supported by the United States.  </P> <P> "I've had it and I'm simply trying to have the American people understand how I  feel about the brutality" of U.S. policies.  </P> <P> I suggest that "such an American President would play politics with the lives  of American kids halfway around the world."  </P> <P> He has taken the initiative to have the United Nations Security Council declare  Iraq responsible for its occupying Kuwait and to ask nations to prepare claims  for financial compensation. Then it follows that now is the time for President  Bush to go into court with clean hands and pay Nicaragua the $12-billion  judgment levied against the United States by the World Court.  </P> <P> GLENN L. ANDERSON  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

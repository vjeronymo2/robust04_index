			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: MAMET'S 'SHAWL' FEELS LIKE AN EARLY WORK AT THE WATERFRONT  </P> <P> David Mamet has, jokingly perhaps, referred to his 1985 play, "The Shawl," as  "my 'Twilight Zone' episode." But except for a jarring moment during Tuesday's  performance when the building of the Waterfront Stage shook with perfect  dramatic timing from a small earthquake, the play never realizes its ambitions  for eeriness.  </P> <P> This is the Los Angeles premiere, but "The Shawl" is so slight that it feels  and sounds like a very early Mamet work, earlier even than his other spooky  piece, "The Water Engine."  </P> <P> Like Miss A., a desperate woman who comes to John, a low-life psychic, for help  with her dead mother's will, we must accept this seer for the man he is.  Director Duane Whitaker severely undercuts this, though, with some faulty  casting. Shelly Desai as John voraciously swallows precious lines where he  should be pulling us into his orbit, so that the plot curves carry a curiously  empty feeling.  </P> <P> We also can't accept Strawn Bovee's skeptical-looking Miss A. stomaching John's  visions of her mother very long (she even out-tricks him, then doesn't leave).  There's no emotional union between Desai and Bovee, and no link of any sort  between Desai and Robert Patrick as Charles, John's lucre-sniffing lover.  Without these, the implication of danger in the play's mood -- not abetted by  the severely reined-in dialogue -- floats like a cloud above these people  without entering their lives.  </P> <P>  At 250 Santa Monica Pier, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., until June 6.  $12.50; (213) 393-6672.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'To Forgive, Divine' a Farce at Colony  </P> <P> The Colony Studio Theatre is a place that knows what its audience wants:  familiar, accessible plays with beginnings, middles and ends, and productions  in which all the actors remember their lines. That is why it has as healthy a  subscriber base as any smaller theater around. It is also why the subscribers  loved Jack Neary's "To Forgive, Divine" at the performance seen.  </P> <P> They took to Jonathan Palmer's Father Jerry Dolan, and how he gets the hots for  a married woman (Cara Roe's Katie) whom he's admired from afar since they were  in high school together. They were charmed by Kathryn Fuller's Milly, the  crusty unofficial chief around this New England Catholic church. Isn't it cute  how Milly has to corral in her teen helper, Margaret (Debra J. Rogers), then  chide Jerry for dancing with Katie in the middle of the sacristy?  </P> <P> Maybe, especially if you like the idea of a Pat O'Brien movie retooled for the  '90s, but should a faithful audience be subjected to the bad farce Neary's play  becomes? The lengths taken to create a high-tension situation involving Jerry,  Katie and Katie's burly husband (David Drummond) and a large closet is simply a  case of a playwright imposing his need for comedy on characters against their  wills. For farce, that is fatal.  </P> <P> But everyone, as always, remembers their lines; some, like Fuller, etch out  some memorable moments. Susan Gratch's set is an authentic sacristy and Michael  David Wadler's direction is professional. There's more to a show, though, than  quality.  </P> <P>  At 1944 Riverside Drive, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., some Sunday matinees, until June 17. $15-$17; (213) 655-3011.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ruby Ruby Sam Sam' on the Cast's Menu  </P> <P> Director Lee Garlington has become a specialist in plays about women who work  in eateries. But where her 1987 production of "Waiting" was a sweet and  scintillating comedy with refreshing views of how women deal with work in  public, her current staging of Stan Edelman's "Ruby Ruby Sam Sam," at the Cast  Theatre, is a contradictory muddle.  </P> <P> A lot of it is Edelman's doing. Clearly, we're meant to wonder why Ruby (Catlin  Adams), owner of a Southern diner, allows Sam (Van Quattro), a late-night  customer, to hang around the estabishment after closing time. There's something  about Sam, a struggling playwright, that attracts her, and something about the  danger of the situation that contains an aphrodisiac quality.  </P> <P> But Edelman never pins this something down, nor does he affix it to the  character's needs. If "Ruby Ruby" was about the mystery of human contact --  which it isn't -- a certain vagueness would be apt. All we can do is wonder  about Ruby's judgment, since Quattro plays Sam as a borderline nut case. Adams  puts her heart into a role that's ultimately two irreconcilable women in one.  She keeps a good diner though, judging by Andy Daley's detail-rich set.  </P> <P>  At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Mondays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m.,  until June 11. $10; (213) 462-0265.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rizzo,' Italian-American Comedy, at the Whitefire  </P> <P> Jimmy Rizzo is not asleep in Frank Adamo's Italian-American comedy at the  Whitefire Theatre, "Waking Jimmy Rizzo." Jimmy kicked the bucket during  intercourse with a woman other than his wife. Now, his pals down at the bar are  figuring out how to send him off. His family is figuring out if Jimmy is worth  the trouble.  </P> <P> Adamo breaks up his play into scene pieces -- not always to the play's benefit,  but an  </P></p>

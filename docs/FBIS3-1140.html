The elections were originally  scheduled for this year. The 10 parties, whose names were not  disclosed, as well as the 15 associations supporting them, have  formed a group known as Alternative 1994. They are demanding  the revision of the Transitional Charter, the formation of a new  government, the holding of roundtable talks among political and  military groups, as well as the signing of a social pact with  the unions to put an end to the country's social crisis.</p>

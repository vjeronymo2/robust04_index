			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Precious metals hold on to gains - Market Report Precious metals held most of their overnight gains yesterday, despite doubts about the authenticity of SILVER'S surprise rise in New York. The London silver price caught up with a 20-cent jump to Dollars 5.55 1/2 a troy ounce, while GOLD put on Dollars 2.80 at Dollars 383 an ounce and platinum edged up Dollars 1.85 to Dollars 400. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures failed to get going after a sluggish start and the July position ended the day at Pounds 947 a tonne, down another Pounds 5. Traders said the continuing absence of industry offtake and producer activity was keeping dealings quiet. New York offered no direction, holding little changed following its weaker opening. London Metal Exchange prices all moved higher with copper and aluminium (see story above). Notable gains were registered by TIN, which touched 14-month peaks, and NICKEL, which, although running into heavy sales on approaches towards Monday's 19-month highs, was underpinned by speculative buying.

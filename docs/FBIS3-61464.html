Prokhorovich]    [Abstract]An analysis is performed to determine the reasons  which lead to the difference in dose dependencies for the  intensities of various luminescence bands in semiconductors. In  other words, various luminescence bands have different  (heightened or lowered) resistance to radiation exposure. It is  shown that this difference might actually be due to more than  the radiation stimulated change in the concentration of  luminescence centers. Another factor may be the difference in  the types of dependencies for the intensity of luminescence  bands as a function of the intensity of luminescence excitation.  The noted difference in dependencies must be taken into  consideration when establishing radiation stimulated changes in  the concentration of the luminescence centers from the dose  dependencies of the intensity of the luminescence bands. 2  figures and 16 references.</p>

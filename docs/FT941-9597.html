			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Japan It is no surprise that the Japanese government's modest pump priming package and austere budget last week met with such a tepid reception both from the US and from the stock market. The package's compromise on tax - where it offers a single-year income tax cut instead of a permanent one - is a consequence of the complexities of coalition government. The budget shows the finance ministry's equally understandable wish to squeeze recurrent spending when the long-term outlook for revenues is weak. This only makes the need for another discount rate cut all the more urgent. Real interest rates are high, now that the deflation in asset prices which followed the collapse of the late 1980s bubble has taken root in consumer prices. Most economists believe that, contrary to the incomplete picture shown by the official figures, prices are falling by around 1 per cent annually. This makes it more likely that Japan's gloomy consumers will save, not spend, Mr Hosokawa's tax cut. Why buy today, when it is cheaper tomorrow  -especially when wages will be under pressure in the spring pay bargaining round?</p>

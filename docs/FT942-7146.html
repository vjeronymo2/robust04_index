			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): Mood is sombre as bears spoil the fun - In February, the bull run ended when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Tracy Corrigan discusses the painful change of fortunes for traders and investors When bankers and traders gather for the annual meeting of the International Securities Market Association (ISMA) in New Orleans on June 1, their mood is likely to be somewhat less festive than it was a year ago. The contrast between 1993 and 1994 in the international capital markets could hardly be starker. Last year, declining interest rates led to an unprecedented bull run in the world's government bond markets, which encouraged record issuance of Dollars 400bn in the eurobond market. The strong upward trend encouraged a surge of investment by mainstream fund managers, financial institutions and hedge funds. In February, the bull run rapidly turned into a bear market, when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in five years. The market's reversal was particularly painful, because most traders and investors held long positions in bonds, expecting the rally to continue. The reversal of fortune of the US bond market and the spillover into European markets were exacerbated because many traders and investors held positions through the futures markets, and were forced to liquidate positions as prices fell, to cover margin calls on their positions. 'What we saw in 1992 and 1993 was a trending market,' said Manfred Schepers, an executive director of Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'Globally, many investors were taking large positions in terms of credit and interest rate risk, which led to a dramatic expansion of emerging markets and of bond markets generally.' At the peak of the market, two emerging market borrowers, China and Argentina, were able to issue large global bond offerings. 'People lost touch with the fact that emerging markets are a credit game and that the market liquidity is not always reliable,' said Mr Schepers. As a result, when the Fed's rise came, the emerging markets were hit particularly hard. New issues of both bonds and equities from these regions have suffered as a result. The greater appetite for risk was also shown by investors' willingness to buy very long-dated bonds. For example, Germany issued 30-year government bonds for the first time last year. Although the amount of funding through fixed income bonds has dropped off this year, this has been partially balanced by the increase in issuance of floating-rate notes. Dealers also report record volume in the Euro commercial paper market, and there are early signs of a revival in bank lending. Since there is little sign that debt requirements are falling, it is likely that funding will simply shift away from the mainstream fixed income eurobond market, where the flow of new issues has suffered as a result of weakness and volatility in government bond prices. 'The US bond market has had a predominant effect on attitude well beyond the fundamentals,' said Ludovico del Balzo, a managing director of Lehman Brothers. 'There is no reason why the long end of the European bond market should be as weak as it has been except for sentiment.' Nevertheless, the fact is that for most of the year so far, the markets have defied analysts' insistence on market fundamentals. Many bond investors who held on to inventory during the first wave of selling were forced to liquidate on the second or third wave instead. The impact on stock market investment has been somewhat less pronounced. Mr del Balzo notes that while US mutuals investing in bonds have seen a high level of redemptions this year, there has been little shrinkage of equity funds. The volume of new issues in the international equities market remains firm, although there is now a greater sensitivity to pricing, particularly of emerging market transactions. But volume in this market is being buoyed by the heavy slate of privatisation issues, especially in Europe. However, the huge volume of funding in the bond market last year cannot be switched to the smaller international equities market. The net result of the turnaround in the market is bound to be lower profits for the financial institutions which dominate the international capital markets. First of all, their trading income, a one-way bet for almost all of last year, is bound to suffer. On the fee-earning side, while some of the fixed income eurobond business has been replaced by floating-rate notes and commercial paper issuance, the commissions earned are substantially lower, owing to the lower level of underwriting risk. To some extent, the market is better positioned to cope with the cyclical turnaround than it has been in the past. The last shake-out of the eurobond market, in the late 1980s, came when competition had become so cut-throat that profitability even for market leaders was being eradicated. A number of casualties pulled out or cut back, but the market did manage to impose some discipline. The introduction of the fixed price re-offer system for pricing deals, while not an unqualified success, has at least managed to rid the market of some of the worst excesses. Market participants can also comfort themselves with the knowledge that most of their institutions enjoyed record trading profits last year, have reasonably strong capital bases, and so should be able to weather a few storms. But the relentless institutionalisation of the market has also made it more difficult to squeeze extra profits out of clients. Institutional investors themselves have become much more sophisticated, and are demanding - and getting - a more competitive service from trading houses. One symptom of this is the top item on the agenda at the ISMA meeting in New Orleans - a shift in market practice from seven-day to three-day settlement of bonds. A proposal will go to the ISMA board in New Orleans, asking for a change in rules effective June 1, 1994. The reduction to three business days will apply to all ISMA members. While it is not likely to suit retail investors, some of whom like to hold eurobonds because of their bearer form, their interests are being sacrificed because they now make up only a small portion of the market. 'The main benefit will be the reduction in systemic risk, because the period of counterparty risk will go down from seven to three days,' said John Langton, ISMA's chief executive. Mr Langton said the change is needed as a result of the huge growth in secondary market volume: four years ago, the total annual turnover in Cedel and Euroclear, Europe's two international clearing houses, was Dollars 6,500bn; it is now Dollars 30,000bn. 'What was acceptable five or six years ago is no longer. You are now looking at a different magnitude of business,' as well as substantial changes in market practice, such as the growth of the repo market, he added. While trading conditions have been disappointing so far this year, one area of the market has continued to furnish lucrative business. Activity in the derivatives market has if anything accelerated, particularly in the first quarter of the year, when many traders and investors were active in the futures markets as they tried to hedge risk and offload positions. Although margins in the futures broking business are extremely thin, heavy volume has made the business attractive for larger market participants. Meanwhile, the over-the-counter market, where more exotic options and swaps are designed to suit individual clients' needs, has become more competitive, due to the advent of new participants. However, the highly specialised nature of the business means that banks still find the OTC market a lucrative area. The continued growth of the derivative markets, despite some bad publicity from heavy corporate losses, is widely expected to continue throughout 1994. However, even a partial recovery in bond prices at this point in the year is highly unlikely to allow new issue volume to recover to last year's level. A shift of emphasis towards international equities, floating-rate notes and possibly bank lending is likely to help fill demand from borrowers.</p>

Born into the family of a day labourer before the liberation  of the country, Yi could enjoy a true human life and graduate a  university in the liberated homeland. He was honored with a  commendation of the great leader President Kim Il-song, order of  national flag first class and many other state decorations for  his devoted services in dealing with revolutionary historical  relics.    Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a centenary birthday table to An  Sang-o, an ordinary woman residing in the neighbourhood unit  No.9 of Sungri-tong No.3, Naknang District, Pyongyang.    Born into a poor tenant farmer's family on the turu islet in  Pyongyang, she devoted her all to defending the system which  gave her happiness during the fatherland liberation war and  honestly worked for the country in the period of the socialist  construction, too. Her family of 49, including sons, daughters,  grandsons and great grandsons, is leading a happy life under the  loving care of the socialist system.</p>

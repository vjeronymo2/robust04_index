			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BAT investment expected to boost Souza Cruz exports BRITISH American Tobacco is to more than triple its annual investment in Brazil this year because of increased confidence in the Brazilian economy. As a result it expected Souza Cruz, its Brazilian subsidiary, to raise its 1992 tobacco and cigarette exports by more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m). Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said he decided to step up investment from Dollars 30m to Dollars 110m because he had been encouraged by 'the government's resoluteness in dealing with inflation and more market-oriented policies'. The money would be used to modernise the company's plants and increase tobacco purchases, giving work to 16,000 extra farmers. Sir Patrick, who is currently visiting Brazil, expected the investment to produce a Dollars 70m increase in leaf exports on last year's Dollars 270m and for cigarette exports to reach Dollars 50m from Dollars 10m just five years ago. The company recently started exporting cigarettes to eastern Europe and was currently negotiating with Russia. It had stepped up exports to other Latin American countries and hoped to benefit from the creation of Mercosul, the tariff-free common market between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazil has been starved of direct investment in recent years and BAT's decision will be seen as a welcome vote of confidence, coming shortly after a Dollars 2.1bn loan secured from the IMF last month. Cigarettes are one of the few items in Brazil which still have their prices set by the government and although Souza Cruz has a 90 per cent share of the Brazilian market, its cigarettes division was losing money until mid-1991 because of the low prices. Sir Patrick said he was confident that these controls would be dropped. He added: 'In the last six months the government has adopted a much more liberal pricing policy'.</p>

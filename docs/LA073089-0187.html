			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: VACATIONERS' LOVE COAST  </P> <P> We have had the Cote d'Azur and the Costa Brava, to say nothing of the Costa  Smeralda, playground of the Aga Khan. Now it's the Cote d'Amour -- the Love  Coast.  </P> <P> The Cote d'Amour is the name given to the sandy stretch that rims the southern  coast of Brittany barely five miles from St. Nazaire, the shipbuilding port  where the Nazis maintained a nest of U-boats that preyed on Allied shipping  during World War II.  </P> <P> It has a museum now, and the submarine pens are still intact, but otherwise it  is all sunshine and sailing on this stretch of coast that somehow has been  overlooked by North Americans. All that is certain to change by early fall when  the TGV, the fast French train, will trim the travel time from Paris to two  hours (from four).  </P> <P> If Americans have overlooked this sparkling strand, the French and a few other  Europeans have not. Its three-mile beach snuggles the Atlantic Ocean and is  lined with condominiums.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hotels With Style  </P> <P> Hotels of style and personality are also in evidence, among them the  fashionable L'Hermitage, the small Castel Marie-Louise and the broad-shouldered  Royal, connected by a passageway to the glittering glass box that encloses the  curative spa called Thalgo La Baule.  </P> <P> Opened just a year, the Thalgo is all glass pyramids, glass elevators,  stainless-steel trim and pale green walls. It treats rheumatism, cardiovascular  problems, circulatory problems, stress and sports injuries year round and even  touts a cure for smoking.  </P> <P> In front of the glass-block Thalgo sits a casino that opened this summer.  </P> <P> Built before the turn of the century when La Baule emerged as a resort, the  Royal casino, set in pine trees, has 103 rooms. They rent for a minimum of $50  per person double, except in July and August when the rate rises to $62. The  price includes breakfast and, like other Barriere-group hotels such as  L'Hermitage and the Marie-Louise, it includes golf, tennis, horseback riding  and wind-surfing.  </P> <P> The tiny Castel Marie-Louise, which is also a member of the Relais-Chateau, has  31 rooms for $50 per person, except mid-June to mid-September when the minimum  garden-view room is about $80 per person.  </P> <P> Breakfast here is an extra $10. The Castel has had a Michelin star for more  than a dozen years. Its menu includes: paper-thin slices of marinated bass and  salmon, a scallop of trout with grapefruit sabayon and, its signature dish, a  fricassee of lobster in a tomato cream sauce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seawater Pool  </P> <P> L'Hermitage also has a seawater pool sitting between its back door and the  beach. Meals are served on shaded terraces, in the bar and restaurant and in a  formal dining room.  </P> <P> Approximate cost is a minimum of $50 per person a day in May, June, September  and October, and a base rate of $75 per person in July and August. Breakfast is  an additional $10. For demi-pension or modified American plan, add another $62  per person a day.  </P> <P> All the action is by no means at the seaside hotels.  </P> <P> By day, the open market dispenses everything from Brittany lace ($125 for a  cloth about five feet in diameter, six-inch doilies at $6 each) to spider  crabs, succulent langoustines, wild strawberries and kuign aman, a Breton  upside-down cake. An eight-table restaurant, the Duo, serves a terrine of crab  with avocado mousse and mushrooms stuffed with duck liver.  </P> <P> The Tour de Pise (Tower of Pisa) prepares pasta in assorted colors.  </P></p>

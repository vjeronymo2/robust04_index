			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Rasul Guliyev by A. Gadzhizade; place and </F> date not given: "Rasul Guliyev: `Those Jockeying for Power  Accuse Me of Betrayal...'"]    [Text] At the initiative of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, the Kyrgyz Republic parliament, the  Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, a meeting was held on 4-5 May in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan).  Among the meeting participants were A. Dzhalilov, first deputy  chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Council; Armenian parliament  speaker B. Ararktsyan; the head of Russia's mediating mission,  V.N. Kazimirov; and Nagorno-Karabakh representative K. Baburyan.  The result of the meeting was a protocol calling for "an end to  armed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and around it," which in  place of A. Dzhalilov was signed by R. Guliyev.    [Gadzhizade] The president of the Republic of Azerbaijan and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not expressed an official  opinion on the signing of the Bishkek protocol. How do you  explain this?    [Guliyev] I signed this protocol with the consent and  participation of the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan.    [Gadzhizade] What can you tell us about the content of the  protocol?    [Guliyev] The purpose of the protocol is only a cease-fire  and, being a protocol of intentions, it serves the truce in  every way. We signed it in order to demonstrate Azerbaijan's  peaceful intentions to the entire world community. Until this,  Azerbaijan had often missed important diplomatic initiatives.    [Gadzhizade] How substantial are your amendments to the  Bishkek protocol?    [Guliyev] In my opinion, the amendments to the Bishkek  protocol are very significant and important. It is clear that  "observers" mean CIS troops. And the mention of "international  observers" says that this amendment is of an international  nature, which proclaims the participation in peacekeeping  operations of armed formations of foreign states together with  CIS troops. The Azerbaijani side proposed that the wording  "occupied territories" in the protocol be replaced by "seized  territories," and this proposal was accepted. This is very  important; it establishes that the other side is the aggressor.    [Gadzhizade] Many mass media maintain that  Nagorno-Karabakh's  participation in the negotiations means in fact recognizing it  de jure.    [Guliyev] The contention that we have recognized  Nagorno-Karabakh de jure is foolish, to say the least. One can  see even from the protocol that the issue is not worth  discussing.    [Gadzhizade] Your attitude to the peaceful settlement plan  presented by Russia?    [Guliyev] Russia's plan for peaceful settlement of the armed  conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh may be implemented only within  the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group and under monitoring of  international organizations. I will never sign a document that  is contrary to the interests of the people.    [Gadzhizade] Some political figures and a score of parties  called the signing of the Bishkek protocol a betrayal. What can  you say regarding the accusation that you have betrayed  Azerbaijan's interests?    [Guliyev] You know, statements by some political leaders and  parties have no relation to the hopes of the people--it is  simply jockeying for power. And in my opinion, in the current  circumstances and situation a power struggle in itself is  betrayal.    [Gadzhizade] What if the political circles demand your  resignation?    [Guliyev] I would gladly resign, but the interests of the  Azerbaijani people supersede my wishes. I will not resign until  I fulfill my duty and my responsibilities. I will not allow  ambitious individuals to play games with the fate of the people.    [Gadzhizade] Is the National Assembly supposed to ratify the  Bishkek protocol?    [Guliyev] No. The Bishkek protocol was not signed for  ratification because it is only a protocol, not an agreement or  treaty.    [Gadzhizade] Many deputies are now collecting signatures for  the purpose of convening the Supreme Council.    [Guliyev] I would like to tell the signature collectors that  it has long been time to part with illusions.    [Gadzhizade] The next meeting of the National Assembly has  been moved up to next week. What was the reason?    [Guliyev] This was necessitated only by the visit to Baku of  the CSCE Minsk Group chairman, Mr. Jaan Eliasson.</p>

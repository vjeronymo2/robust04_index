			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Esko Aho by Per </F> Nordrum in Helsinki; date not given]    [Text] Helsinki -- European Union [EU] membership means  that all four applicant countries must approve the agreements,  in the view of Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho. The EU will not  produce any differences for agriculture.    The structural rationalization of agriculture will continue,  regardless of Finland's relationship to the EU. "It is difficult  to say how rapidly changes will take place if we were to remain  outside the EU, but I do not think that the difference would  amount to much," Prime Minister Esko Aho said.    The Center Party leader, who will soon reach age 40, said  that it is difficult to say how many farms will remain in  Finland in the event of EU membership. For we do not know what  will happen to national agricultural policy in the future.    "But I remember very well what has happened since 1970. Then  we had around 200,000 milk producers. Today we have perhaps  40,000. We have in other words had drastic structural changes,  and I believe that this will continue if Finland joins the EU,"  Aho said in an interview with a group of Norwegian journalists  on the third anniversary of assuming the office of prime  minister.    The date of the Finnish referendum on the EU has yet to be  fixed. Most people are thinking along the lines of 2 October,  even though the prime minister says that he has not receive any  negative responses to his question of why Finland should not  hold its referendum on the same day as Sweden -- 13 November.    "We have our practical reasons to think about the same date  as Sweden," the prime minister said, without providing any more  detailed explanation.    The government in Helsinki will reach a decision on the date  for a referendum once the European Parliament has dealt with the  membership agreements on 4 May and once the national support  package for the foodstuffs industry and sections of agriculture  are complete. This support package is to complement the EU  agreement on points where Finland did not achieve the goals laid  down when the Eduskunta approved Finland's membership  application.    If the support package is satisfactory, the prime minister  also feels sure that this will be a majority in favor of the EU  at the Center Party's national congress in June. Center Party  leader Anne Enger Lahnstein, Norway's "no" queen, is also  expected, among the almost 3,000 delegates and 2,000 guests.    Could Finland be the only Nordic country to join the EU?    "In principle that is not impossible, but in practice it  would be another matter if only one or two countries out of the  four ratify the agreements. I am also looking at this from the  EU's point of view. There is only one alternative when it comes  to the date for becoming a member. So everyone who wants to  join must ratify the agreement before them."    Prime Minister Aho made it clear that Finland will naturally  take into consideration the decisions its Nordic neighbors  reach, "even though it is in principle our own decision." A  Swedish no to the EU would create a new situation, he admitted.  Nevertheless, he declined to speculate about how his government  would handle such a situation. "Our assumption is that all four  countries will accept the agreements," he stressed.    If only Norway says no to membership, will there then be  problems for the other three countries that want to become EU  members?    "Much will depend on Sweden, for Sweden will be the biggest  net contributor to the EU. Sweden's role is therefore more  important than those of Finland or Norway," said Aho, who also  believes that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect means much less  than many people believe for the Finns' desire for EU membership.    In the past the Finnish Center Party's leading bodies have  given positive assessments of the EU agreement even though,  according to the opinion polls, the majority of the party's  voters are in the no camp. When Prime Minister Aho last weekend  left a party meeting to celebrate his mother's 70th birthday,  Paavo Vayrynen, his former foreign minister, took the floor and  succeeded in a maneuver to bring in some new and more critical  assessments.    "There is no suggestion of substantial change of view of any  significance. I would also have approved this assessment of  his," Aho said, trying to smooth over the internal conflict in  the Center Party.    What is most important among your political priorities --  getting Finland into the EU or winning the election in March  next year?    "If we do not succeed in dealing with our economic problems,  we cannot even take on the challenge EU membership would  represent. If I can deal successfully with these two things --  improving the economy and Finns' living conditions, and EU  membership -- I would probably also do quite well in the next  Eduskunta elections. I have no reason to prepare myself for an  election defeat," the prime minister said, well aware that the  opinion polls are now giving the Center Party only 19 percent of  votes -- as against 24.8 percent in the elections three years  ago. But behind him he has fresh economic figures which show  that unemployment, currently at over 20 percent, is beginning to  fall.</p>

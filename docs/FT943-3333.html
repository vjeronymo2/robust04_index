			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Healthy growth ahead for rice trade - The opening of Japanese and Korean markets has raised forecasts The growth in world rice trade is likely to be 'significantly higher' than expected as a result of the successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round world trade talks, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) predicts. Before the outcome of the Gatt Uruguay Round, the FAO predicted a growth in world rice trade of 3 per cent a year to 17.1m tonnes by 2000. But as a result of the talks, Japan will allow rice imports from next year, beginning with an import volume equivalent to 4 per cent of domestic consumption, rising to 8 per cent by 2000. South Korea will allow imports of 1 per cent of domestic consumption, rising to 4 per cent in 10 years. The FAO predicts 'some significant structural changes' in the export market by 2000, especially in the Far East. Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, is expected to maintain its position, but Vietnam is forecast to replace the United States as the world's second-largest exporter by 2000. Bangladesh, which is now self-sufficient in rice, is expected to be among the top 10 rice exporting countries by 2000. China and India are expected to continue to be major rice exporters and importers, although India may emerge as the larger net exporter. The FAO also predicts considerable variations in prices over the next six years, with international prices 'moderately higher' in real terms. At its 18th session in Rome last week, the International Rice Commission was told that lower GDP growth in the Middle East would result in increased imports of medium quality at the expense of higher quality rice. Africa is likely to import more medium quality and contribute to strengthening demand and possibly higher prices. In Europe and North America the increase in demand will be mainly for higher quality rice. Imports into the US and Canada of fragrant rice from Asia have escalated 'and this trend is expected to continue,' Chan Ling Yap, FAO rice specialist, told the commission. Rice imports into the US had grown to about 10 times the level of the early 1980s, she said, but the US remained the world's second largest rice exporter. Demand for lower quality rice may fall in the next few years, although in many exporting countries, more of this rice type is being used for feed, leaving less for the export market. World output of rice is predicted to grow at 2 per cent a year to 409m tonnes by 2000, and demand for milled rice at about the same rate. About 90 per cent would be for food and the remainder for feed, seed and industrial use. 'New technologies of milling, sorting and packaging will have to be put into place' to meet the projected increase in demand for higher quality rice, said Chan Ling Yap. 'The increased sophistication of the rice market opens up new investment opportunities.' But the FAO warns that although the growth in world rice supply and demand seems likely to be balanced in 2000, 'the problem of hunger' will remain. Higher prices could lead to some countries, especially in Africa, cutting back on rice imports. This, together with cuts in food subsidies planned by some countries, 'could worsen access to rice by the poor'. However, higher world rice prices would re-emphasise 'the importance of raising domestic production,' the FAO says, while international financial institutions that have previously considered investment in rice uneconomic could find the commodity more attractive.</p>

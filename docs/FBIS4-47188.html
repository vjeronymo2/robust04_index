			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Portnikov, under the "Carte Blanche" rubric: </F> "Leonid Kuchma Gets Air Time on Ostankino. Is It Better To  Conduct a Ukrainian Election Campaign in Russia?"]    [Text] Last Sunday, viewers of television Channel 1 could  have seen two leaders of the unions of industrialists: the  Russian Arkadiy Volskiy and Ukrainian Leonid Kuchma appearing on  a program called "Dialogue on the Air," whose guests as a rule  are heads of new independent states and other formations on the  territory of the former Soviet Union. Even though the organizers  of the program repeatedly stressed that it is in no way  connected with the presidential campaign currently under way in  Ukraine, it was clear that Leonid Kuchma had acquired a  brilliant opportunity to present his program appealing to an  audience far broader than that of the Ukrainian TV.    It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to predict that  in the next several weeks Leonid Kuchma will be a frequent guest  on Channel 1. In Moscow, it appears, they now believe that it is  specifically this politician who is best disposed toward Russia,  the most tractable, and the most susceptible to pressure  compared with other presidential candidates, and mainly compared  with the present head of the Ukrainian state Leonid Kravchuk and  the reformist economist Vladimir Lanovyy. This means that air  time on Ostankino must become that sail which will accelerate  the presidential campaign ship of the retired prime minister.  This approach, however, also incorporates a serious political  error. For Ukraine, television Channel 1 is a program coming  from an alien territory and often, how would it be possible to  say this gently, it is, if not discredited, at least received  with some slight irony by consumers of political information.  Naturally, the "Ostankino effect" was very well reflected in the  results of the referendum on independence. There was a no more  systematic critic of that decision than the TV liberated from  party control, and the result? Therefore, in order to ensure the  victory of Leonid Kravchuk at the polls, it is simply necessary  to curse him more frequently on Ostankino TV and praise Leonid  Kuchma more often. Even though true followers of the former  prime minister will hardly be scared off by that.    Getting the possibility of presenting his program to an  audience of millions, Kuchma, however, did not reveal the  existence of such a program. For almost a year he repeated the  same formula: An economic union with Russia is necessary. He  condemned Ukrainian leadership for isolationism, as if  forgetting that it was specifically he who failed to achieve any  real agreement with either Gaydar or Chernomyrdin. The reason  for that, naturally, is not any personal lack of desire to reach  agreement with the Russians, but the unwillingness of the former  prime minister and the military-industrial, lobby which brought  him to the summit of power, to reform the Ukrainian economy. It  was under Kuchma that Russia, simply speaking, had nothing to  talk about with Ukraine. The appearance of Kuchma on the  television screen in the company of Arkadiy Volskiy, a respected  politician who proposed for Russia specifically that path which  was used "to reform" the Ukrainian economy, who was still not  supported by the voters, demonstrated that one must not expect  reforms should Leonid Kuchma regain power. In that case, what  occurs? Economic union with Russia? But using what formula? The  Belarus one does not appeal to Kuchma: "Nothing is working out  for us with regard to them," he confessed in a disappointed way.  All of the other formulas turn out to be strictly declarative.  Who but Leonid Kuchma himself, who in the final days of his  tenure travelled almost incognito to see Viktor Chernomyrdin  with a request for help and was not understood in Moscow, could  explain that better than others to Leonid Kuchma?    Nevertheless, Kuchma actually did reveal his principal aim  in  the TV appearance, beside the illusory economic union.  Preservation of big industry, indicating a lack of understanding  of objective laws of economic reforms in favoring such  preservation, which was noted even by the television  viewers--that was expressed and belabored by the long-term party  secretary of the famous Yuzhmash. There is little doubt that if  he is elected president, Leonid Kuchma will preserve that  industry at any cost.    But what will happen to Ukraine?</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> Chula Vista Mayor-elect Gayle McCandliss said Friday that she will take the  oath of office Tuesday night despite suffering from a liver illness that has  forced her to undergo chemotherapy.  </P> <P> McCandliss, who formerly served as a councilwoman, said she went public with  her illness to dispel "a lot of questions and suppositions about my health."  </P> <P> She said a cancerous tumor was removed from her colon July 31, and cells from  the tumor had traveled to the liver.  </P> <P> However, McCandliss denied rumors that she is suffering from cancer of the  liver.  </P> <P> "It is not liver cancer," she said. "I (am) feeling well. My liver functions  are normal. I am feeling good. . . . The cells traveled to a secondary site,  that's all."  </P> <P> She acknowledged that the last few months have been a "difficult battle," but  expressed optimism that she will be able to handle all mayoral duties.  </P> <P> McCandliss will replace Mayor Greg Cox, who is stepping down after nine years  as Chula Vista's first full-time mayor.  </P></p>

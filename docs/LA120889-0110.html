			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY CANADIANS DEMAND STRICTER GUN LAWS  </P> <P> Canada, blessed with a low crime rate and strict gun laws, recoiled in horror  Thursday at the Montreal massacre, a killing spree of the type many Canadians  smugly believed only happen south of the border.  </P> <P> But reaction to the killing of 14 female students by a crazed gunman at the  University of Montreal on Wednesday -- the worst mass murder in Canadian  history -- turned rapidly from shock to outright anger.  </P> <P> "This is a human tragedy of enormous proportion and a grim reminder of the  vulnerability of society and of the fragility of life itself," Prime Minister  Brian Mulroney said in a statement.  </P> <P> Flags flew at half-staff in the Canadian capital and across Quebec province as  demands grew for even stricter guns laws and greater protection in general  against crazed individuals.  </P> <P> "We're not used to this kind of thing in Canada," said Gary Rosenfeldt,  president of the lobby group, Victims of Violence Society. "I think probably  it's a sign of the times."  </P> <P> Rosenfeldt, echoing concerns of other social groups, said that while Canadian  gun laws are strict, more could be done to keep mentally ill people off the  streets.  </P> <P> There were also questions of how the gunman could have obtained his  .223-caliber Sturm Ruger semiautomatic rifle, a kind of weapon that is supposed  to be strictly controlled in Canada.  </P> <P> "How can you justify selling an assault weapon in a downtown store?" one irate  woman asked on a Montreal radio talk show flooded with calls.  </P> <P> The gunman, dressed as a hunter, went on a shooting rampage on three floors of  the University of Montreal, killing 14 women and wounding 13.  </P> <P> The French-speaking man, in a rage against feminists he blamed for ruining his  life, later committed suicide.  </P> <P> Although there have been other mass shootings -- the most recent when a man  with a machine gun killed three in the Quebec Legislature in 1984 -- Canadians  take pride in the country's low crime rate.  </P></p>

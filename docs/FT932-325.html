			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Speculation over interest rate cut fuels French prices surge FRANCE stood tall in a strong European government bond market yesterday as rate cut enthusiasm held sway and drove prices forward. However, the yield spread between 10-year French and German government bonds remained slightly wider, at eight basis points, as Germany also benefited from encouraging inflation data. On the Matif, French government bond futures for September shot ahead by more than half a point during official trading. They broke through 120 before late profit-taking took the contract back to 119.92, still a gain of 60 basis points on the day. Some economists are starting to feel the value in the French market is beginning to dry up. Although Ms Marie Owens Thomsen of Midland Global Markets takes that line, she believes France still has room for three more 25-basis point cuts in its intervention rate - the rate that sets the floor for official rates - independently of any German move. Part of yesterday's rise sprang from a technical correction after falls on Friday. However, there was also a boost from signals coming out of Germany: if Germany can cut rates it will give the Banque de France much greater room for manoeuvre. Interest in the French market was fuelled by a press report arguing that France might quit the European exchange rate mechanism if Germany refused to ease monetary policy. Economists said the report was refuted by French officials and had no impact on prices. However, it did encourage fierce debate. GERMAN debt prices picked up in reaction to comments from the Bundesbank and reassuring economic data. The comments came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, who indicated in a radio interview he would be keen for German interest rates to fall. Also, the market was surprised by the latest consumer prices data, which showed inflation rising at 0.1 per cent against 0.3 per cent a month ago. September bunds bounced 0.33 per cent to 95.67. However, there was a growing consensus that the Bundesbank will leave its discount rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent when it meets on Thursday for its fortnightly council meeting. Most economists are now looking ahead to the following meeting on July 15. That meeting comes just befores the G7 meeting in Tokyo, and just after the German cabinet's budget proposals. 'The Bundesbank is looking for the right pre-conditions to cut rates. We need something astonishing and the inflation change is not it,' said one economist. UK government bonds rose sharply as a stronger pound prompted continued overseas buying of gilts. A survey of dealers and analysts in the weekend press found that almost half of the specialists interviewed believed sterling would become the strongest currency in Europe over the next three months. The well-timed research sent the pound jumping sharply in early trade to hit DM2.54. That strength gave a renewed incentive to the overseas investors, particularly those from the Far East, who have been switching out of 10-year French bonds and into the UK equivalent. Long-dated gilts performed most strongly as investors held stock ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per cent 10-year gilts. In the futures market, the September gilts contract was up half a percentage point before profit-taking took it back to close  9/32 higher at 107 5/32 . IN the high-yielding European government bond markets, Spain and Italy were overshadowed by political worries. The struggle by Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, to force employers and trade unions to agree on a new wage bargaining system lay behind weakness in Italian government bonds. Alone in Europe, the government bond futures market was weaker with the September contract falling 28 basis points to 102.32. However, Spanish bonds for September clawed back some of Friday's losses in spite of enduring concern over prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzales' ability to form a coalition government. September bonds traded in Barcelona bounced 0.60 point to 92.90 after a 1.25 point slide on Friday. Portuguese bonds rose after the Bank of Portugal cut its intervention rate by half a point to 11.5 per cent. OVERNIGHT demand from foreign investors, the lack of supply pressures, and expectations that Friday's employment report for June will be weak pushed US Treasury bond yields to historic lows yesterday. In late trade, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105 13/16 , yielding 6.669 per cent, the lowest yield in the 16 years that the Treasury has been selling the issue on a regular basis. At the short end, the two-year note was only slightly firmer, however, up 1/16 at 100 1/8 , to yield 4.043 per cent. Prices opened firmer in the wake of demand from overseas markets - particularly London - believed to have been a follow-through from heavy buying on Friday, when bond yields closed at an all-time low. The influence of foreign trading aside, the market in New York was otherwise supported by two factors: expectations that Friday's jobs data will be weaker than originally forecast, and the lack of fresh supply in coming weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Solidarity representatives issued a statement in  Katowice yesterday relating to the conditions for the suspension  of the strikes. Here is the union spokesman, Piotr Zak:    [Begin Zak recording] We are asking Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak and Industry and Trade Minister Mark Pol to hold a  direct, working meeting between representatives of the  government and the mining and energy generation secretariat of  the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] Solidarity.  The aim of the meeting will be to specify the range and  timetable of talks intended to resolve the problems lying at the  root of the conflict. For some time, the Solidarity trade union  has, as it were, reached out to the authorities, proposing  substantive talks with the aim of resolving the conflict that  has arisen. [end recording]    [Correspondent Orzech reporting from Katowice] A  representative of the brown coal-mining section of Solidarity  threatened that if these talks are not held, a strike will once  more begin at the brown coal mines. Simultaneously, an activist  of the energy generation section warned that there might be  wide-scale cuts in electric power supplies, and that these will  not exclude the mass media. The trade unionists said that a  timetable of strikes has been prepared, but that it must remain  secret. According to Marian Krzaklewski, a scenario is also  being prepared to meet the situation that would arise if the  government rejects talks. Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the  mining and energy generation secretariat, said toward the end of  the news conference that it would be wiser to give way. He did  not make clear what he had in mind. This is Witold Orzech in  Katowice.    [Announcer] On the "Signals of the Day" program this  morning, Labor Minister Leszek Miller addressed yesterday's  statement by Solidarity's national mining section regarding  talks with the government:    [Begin Miller recording] We are open for various contacts  with representatives of Solidarity. If such a meeting were to  have a consultative character -- by this I mean one during which  the both the subjects and the participants are specified -- such  talks can certainly come about, such a team can certainly be  created. On the other hand, I would here like to clearly  distinguish between a consultative meeting and a negotiating  meeting. As regards negotiations, our stance is unchanged. We  invite representatives of other trade unions active in the  mining sector to these talks. [end recording]</p>

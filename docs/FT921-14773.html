			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Treatment works to cost Pounds 350m NINE WATER companies are to invest a total of Pounds 350m in advanced water treatment works to make their operations conform with the European Community drinking water directive. The nine cover 7 per cent of England's water supply and serve more than 4m people. The UK government is at present before the European Court over its failure to ensure that drinking water in parts of England meets the European standard. Yesterday Mr Michael Healey, chief inspector of the Drinking Water Directorate, announced that Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, had approved undertakings from the nine companies. They provide for the best available treatment technology to be installed at 32 treatment works to deal with pesticide residues in drinking water. Britain should have been conforming with the EC Drinking Water Directive by 1985. Most of the improvements announced yesterday will be completed by 1995 but four new plants will not be finished until 1996 and 1997. The nine companies are: Severn Trent, Southern, East Surrey, North Surrey, Tendring Hundred in Essex, Sutton in Surrey, and Eastbourne.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH GROUP ACCUSES SEOUL OF RIGHTS ABUSES  </P> <P> More than 1,800 of South Korea's leading clergymen Friday accused the  government of human rights abuses and demanded that it make good on promises of  democratization and other reform.  </P> <P> The Korean National Council of Churches said the government of President Roh  Tae Woo is more undemocratic than that of his dictatorial predecessor and is  "causing people's lives to collapse with the suppression of human rights." In a  statement issued after an all-night prayer meeting at a downtown Anglican  church, the council said more than 800 people were arrested as political  prisoners in recent months.  </P> <P> The church council, which represents leading Protestant clergy in a nation  where one-fourth of the population is Christian, has been a political force for  years. But Friday's message was its first major political statement since Roh  came to power, succeeding Chun Doo Hwan.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: HOME-GROWN ARTISTRY AT UTAH FAIR  </P> <P> The Utah Arts Festival, an outdoor celebration in Salt Lake City from June 21  to 25, enables visitors to see and buy some handcrafts from across the country.  Held downtown in the Triad Center, the event is a showcase for about 70 top  artisans and crafts people.  </P> <P> The Triad Center is about a block from the Doubletree Hotel, where many of the  artists stay.  </P> <P> Some of the most interesting offerings are works by the following:  </P> <P> Rick and Brigid Anderson (from Arizona) produce tiny hand-tied, hand-dyed  macrame earrings ($12 and up), some of which contain shining crystals or gold  and silver strands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wind Instruments  </P> <P> Michael Graham Allen (from Oklahoma) makes four types of wind instruments ($60  to $125), including sweet-sounding flutes and easy-to-play pan pipes ($40) with  two-octave G-minor pentatonic scales, modeled after instruments played by  Andean Indians in South America. Under the Coyote Oldman Music label, he also  produces cassette tapes ($10) of flute music.  </P> <P> Lori Mehan (from Salt Lake City) is a sculptor whose ceramic coyotes (around  $150) are dressed as people and perform human activities.  </P> <P> Paul and Patricia Goodspeed (from Arkansas) are leather workers who create  handsome suede shirts patterned with varicolored earth-tone stripes and lines  with lamb suede (about $300), as well as suede scarfs ($45) and small pouches  ($25) that attach to ranger belts ($30).  </P> <P> Kolene Kumpfer (from Salt Lake City) weaves delicate baskets out of straw and  twigs, fills them with subtly colored dried flowers and wires them so they may  be used as wall decorations ($35 to $40).  </P> <P> Californian Michael Kelly's contemporary furniture handcrafted of hardwood has  a sculptural look.  </P> <P> Pieces include rockerlike bentwood chairs and coordinating work tables, as well  as roll-top desks ($2,500) that have numerous drawers and hidden cubbyholes and  are painted a brilliant yellow and other bright colors. Also file boxes with  sliding tops ($50), tape dispensers ($22), compact-disc holders ($42) and  cassette holders ($20).  </P> <P> Michael Thiele (from Arizona) sculpts musical instruments out of hardwoods,  including rosewood, walnut and teak.

He calls his work South American Lizzard  Research and uses lizards as a source for many decorative objects, including  belt buckles ($150 to $175). Kirkpatrick also makes silver and bronze earrings  shaped like lotus flowers ($50) and pins that look like futuristic bugs from  outer space ($25).  </P> <P> Briant Matheson (from Salt Lake City) is a mixed-media man who uses ceramics,  metals, paper and other materials to create decorative home and personal  accessories shaped like fish -- fish as bolo ties (about $45), fish as toys and  mobiles ($20 and up) and large collectible papier-mache fish ($100 and up) that  have no function other than to be beautiful and amusing.  </P> <P> June Rettig (from Arizona) makes custom-designed leather shoes (from about $250  and up), many of which are shaped like native American moccasins and  hand-colored with geometric patterns.  </P> <P> Glen Richards (from Utah) is the creator of wooden toys, including parrots and  clowns ($25 and up), and pull cars and trains ($30 and up) hand-painted with  original cartoon characters.  </P> <P> Barbara Ellison and William Fickinger (from Arizona) hand-paint one-of-a-kind  T-shirts ($20).  </P> <P> Cynthia Henrie (from Salt Lake City) produces colored clothing, including  stylish pedal pushers ($36), flowing full circle skirts ($32) and tank-top  T-shirts ($19) out of tie-dyed cotton cloth.  </P> <P> In addition to the show and sell stalls the festival organizes fine art  exhibitions in other venues, large environmental art projects and a Children's  Art Yard in which youths can enjoy face painting, labyrinth construction,  storytelling, dance workshops and other activities.  </P> <P> This year's demonstrations and workshops include Michael Lortsher's instruction  in brush and ink Sumie painting, Coy Mooso's class in Ukrainian Egg Decorating,  Jim Tuttle's hand-painted clothing techniques, Cami DeRosa's hand-built  pottery, Kolene Kumpfer's basketry and others.  </P> <P> The festival also presents performances in open-air venues on the festival  grounds.

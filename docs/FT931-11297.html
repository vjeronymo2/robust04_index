			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / France says offer to Palestinians is step in the right direction Reuter adds from Paris: France said yesterday Israel's offer to allow back 100 expelled Palestinians was a step in the right direction but further efforts were needed to end the dispute and revive the Middle East peace process. 'Ideas put forward by the Israeli government point to the will to seek a settlement. . .it is therefore a step in the right direction,' the foreign ministry spokesman said. He added the offer did not meet Palestinian demands and France hoped for more efforts to find just a solution.</p>

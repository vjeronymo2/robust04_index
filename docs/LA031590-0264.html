			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNBRIDLED THE FAVORITE FOR $500,000 FLA. DERBY  </P> <P> Unbridled was installed today as the favorite for Saturday's $500,000 Florida  Derby at Gulfstream Park, and the long shot claimed the rail.  </P> <P> Chuck Streava, official odds maker for the track, didn't wait for the drawings  before making Unbridled, who finished third in the Fountain of Youth stakes, a  5-2 pick.  </P> <P> Ross's Warning, the long shot at 20-1, drew the rail.  </P> <P> Pat Day will ride Unbridled, which drew the fourth position in the nine-horse  field. Slavic was rated second at 3-1 and drew the eighth position; Single Dawn  was set at 4-1 and drew the ninth position for the 1 1/8-mile course.  </P> <P> Roanoke was at 6-1 and drew the sixth position, followed by Country Day at 8-1  starting in the fifth position. Run Turn, at 10-1, was at the seventh position  and Top Snob, at 12-1, drew the third slot. Late entry Sunny Serve, also at  12-1, claimed the second spot.  </P> <P> Track officials also announced that the Swale Stakes will be moved up to the  fifth race because of the interest in several potential contenders in this  year's somewhat muddled 3-year-old field.  </P> <P> The race was originally scheduled to be run 11th, after the Florida Derby.  </P> <P> Gulfstream officials expect a fast track Saturday with warm and breezy weather.  </P> <P> In the Swale Stakes, Summer Squall, on medication after bleeding in a workout a  month ago, was installed as a slight favorite at 8-5 with Housebuster at 9-5.  </P> <P> Carl Nafzger, trainer for Unbridled, said he was a little surprised that his  horse was picked as a Florida Derby favorite but said: "I don't get too excited  about that."  </P> <P> He was pleased with the position drawings for his two horses, Unbridled and Top  Snob.  </P> <P> "We're real happy. . . . You don't want the rail and you don't want to be too  far on the outside," he said.  </P> <P> Because of injuries and lackluster performances this year for some of the early  Kentucky Derby contenders, the Florida Derby and the 3-year-old picture remain  filled with question marks.  </P> <P> "To me, the race is wide open," said Sonny Hine, trainer for Ross's Warning.  "That's why we're going to run it."  </P> <P> Craig Perret, who will be riding Roanoke, said he feels that the best horses  this year have yet to have strong showings.  </P> <P> "That's what makes the Florida Derby a wide-open thing," he said.  </P></p>

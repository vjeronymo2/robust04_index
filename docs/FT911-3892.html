			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Congress looks into Sununu's travels THE US General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has begun an inquiry into the dozens of trips taken by Mr John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, using military aircraft for what may have been personal and political purposes. The investigation was requested by Congressman John Conyers, chairman of the House government operations committee. The Michigan Democrat lost no time in pouncing on the opportunity to discredit Mr Sununu, who is heartily disliked by many congressional Democrats. An account of Mr Sununu's trips was given in the Sunday editions of the Washington Post and US News and World Report magazine. The Post said Mr Sununu had taken more than 60 trips in the past two years which included visits to New Hampshire, his home state, and to Colorado ski resorts. Mr Sununu reimbursed the government for the trips at the rate it would have cost him to fly commercially. However, his use of military aircraft costs thousands of dollars more. On one trip, to Aspen, Colorado, he reimbursed the government Dollars 1,076 (Pounds 601). However, according to the Post, the cost to the Air Force was more than Dollars 30,000. Administration officials rushed to Mr Sununu's defence, portraying the use of military aircraft as necessary so that the chief of staff could maintain constant communications with the president.</p>

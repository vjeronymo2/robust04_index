			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Daewoo halts N Korea project Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest business group, said yesterday it was suspending its plan for the first joint ventures with North Korea. Disappointed by the outcome of talks between the prime ministers of North and South last week, Seoul said any economic exchanges would be banned until North Korea allowed inspection of nuclear facilities. 'We have also decided to put off the plan to send our executives to North Korea for a feasibility study of the joint venture project,' a Daewoo spokesman said. In Washington yesterday, Mr Robert Gates, director of the CIA, said that North Korea could have a nuclear weapon in as little as a few months.</p>

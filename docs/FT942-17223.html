			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: Tough for Turks Mrs Tansu Ciller's appointment as Turkey's prime minister in June 1993 appeared to herald a radical policy shift to correct structural flaws in the country's inflation-prone economy. In fact, by offering no more than palliatives during her first six months in office, Mrs Ciller greatly contributed to the economic crisis that erupted with the 12 per cent devaluation of the lira in January. Yesterday, after a two-month lira slide and mounting public sector liquidity problems, Mrs Ciller finally faced reality with an extensive austerity package. This programme, including tax increases and closures of loss-making state enterprises, is tougher than expected. Yet it is the minimum necessary to subdue overheating and calm anxiety among foreign creditors. Turkey plans to enter a full-scale customs union with the European Union in 1995. If the country's generally efficient private sector is to hold its own against European competition, steps to reduce the rampant cost of the Turkish public sector are ineluctable. Partly reflecting Mrs Ciller's refusal to take remedial action earlier, she is exposed to a difficult combination of circumstances. Her room for economic policy manoeuvre is constrained by the cost of mounting an internationally-criticised military clampdown against the Kurds. Pushing through yesterday's programme will prove politically troublesome. Under strain as a result of the Islamic-based Refah party's gains in last week's municipal elections, Mrs Ciller is trying to coax the main opposition party Anap into an alliance with her governing True Path party to back reform and safeguard Turkey's future as a secular state. Anap has already warned, however, of 'serious doubts' about the programme. Even if the measures are implemented, they may have less effect than the government has suggested in reducing public sector borrowing, which last year was 16 per cent of gross domestic product. The official forecast for privatisation receipts appears excessively optimistic, while planned lay-offs at loss-making state-owned companies will generate extra social expenditure. Perhaps the biggest immediate economic problem is that the fresh lira slump set off by yesterday's abandonment of central bank support intervention will add to inflationary pressures. If the Turkish authorities are serious about bringing down the 74 per cent inflation rate, they may have little choice but to engineer a full-scale recession. That would have large political and social costs in a country accustomed to high economic growth. Turkey is, however, fast running out of alternatives.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Teh-lin (6774 1795 2651): "The Military </F> Appreciates Jiang Zemin's Trip to Seattle"]    [Text] Deng Xiaoping Was All for Jiang Zemin Making a  Trip to the United States    According to a well informed source in Beijing, between  mid-November and early December last year, as head of state,  Jiang Zemin, concurrently state president, Central Military  Commision chairman, and General Secretary of the CPC Central  Committee, was in Seattle to participate in the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference. In its wake, he met  U.S. President Clinton, and visited Cuba, Brazil and Portugal.  His trip was highly appreciated by the Chinese military. The  Army, Navy and Air Force, all branches of the services, the  Defense Ministry, all military regions, advanced military  institutes and academies have sent letters and cables to salute  and extend regards to Jiang Zemin. This is a rare situation in  China's political life.    Originally, some leading members of the military --  including  some old generals -- wrote to the Central Committee to express  their hope that Jiang Zemin would refrain from attending the  Seattle summit on the grounds that the United States had pursued  a series of incidents to oppose China and intervene in its  internal affairs. These include the "Yin He" incident and the  U.S. Congress' opposition to China's application for the 2000  World Olympics, as well as the false charge that China provided  guided missiles for Pakistan. They said China should respond to  these things and not endure the bullying of U.S. hegemony and  power politics. Some even suggested de-escalation of Sino-U.S.  diplomatic relations, recalling the Chinese ambassador to the  United States, and so forth. Later, the CPC Political Bureau  Standing Committee sought instructions from Deng Xiaoping, who  stated: It is better that he should go, for he can express  China's position so as to promote understanding. Thus the  Standing Committee made the decision on Jiang Zemin leaving for  the United States to meet President Clinton. At the same time,  Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen -- the two Central Military  Commission vice chairmen -- together with CPC senior statesmen  Wan Li and Bo Yibo, went separately to do ideological work among  the military and old generals. Facts have demonstrated the  correctness of Deng Xiaoping's decision.  <H5>  Chi Haotian on Three Major Events </H5>   On Jiang Zemin's return to Bejing, Colonel General Chi  Haotian, member of the Central Military Commission and  concurrently minister of defense, at an 8 December Defense  Ministry report meeting, appraised Jiang Zemin's trip highly,  saying: Three major events took place in our party, country and  Army in November: 1) The report meeting on Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaopeng presided over by General  Secretary Jiang Zemin; 2) The successful conclusion of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, presided over by  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, at which the historical document  on building the socialist market economic structure was adopted;  and 3) Jiang Zemin, in his capacity as state president, went to  Seattle by inviation to participate in the APEC conference.  During a meeting with U.S. President Clinton, he frankly [tan  shuai di 0982 3764 0966] set out the Chinese Government's  principle stand and views on a series of incidents, while  adhering to the Chinese Government's wishes to improve bilateral  relations on the basis of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.  <H5>  Zhang Zhen Says the Military Supports Jiang </H5>   On 6 December, two days before Chi Haotian made his speech,  Zhang Zhen attended a discussion meeting for senior coaches of  the three military institutes, He dealt with the world situation  and stressed Jiang Zemin's mid-November trip to Seattle. Zhang  said: Our respectful Comrade Jiang Zemin, chairman of the  Central Military Commission, went to Seattle on invitation to  participate in the APEC conference. He held a Sino-U.S. summit  with Clinton there, during which he explicitly expressed China's  persistent principle stand, the hope for China and the United  States to proceed toward world peace and the long-range friendly  cooperation of the two countries in seeking common ground while  resolving differences. He was neither haughty nor humble.  Zhang added: Whether in the past, the present, or the future,  China will never barter away its sovereignty and principles; the  Chinese people have a deep understanding that nothing is more  precious than the country's independence and initiative.  History -- in which the Chinese people suffered the aggression,  bullying and plundering of foreign powers -- will never be  repeated. At the Sino-U.S. summit, President Jiang Zemin  expressed the Chinese Government's position to the whole world,  and won the support of peace-loving, independent countries  throughout. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, in its  entirety, is proud of and inspired by Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the supreme leader of the party,state and Army.    In addition, all military regions have held report meetings  to express their support for Jiang Zemin's leadership.</p>

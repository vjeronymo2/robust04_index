			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-PRICED HELP  </P> <P> It was incredible to read in S. J. Diamond's May 26 column, "Teachers' Strike  Left Consumers Feeling Helpless," that the chauffeur for the superintendent of  schools makes $91,000 a year. Not bad, not bad at all when compared to the  teacher's salary range of $23,000 to $43,000 quoted in the article.  </P> <P> What a squandering of public money! There will surely come a day when the  public will demand changes in the entire educational system, which is  apparently top heavy with highly paid administrators.  </P> <P> JOHN A.

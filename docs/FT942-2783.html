			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Siemens buys 51% of BTR offshoot Siemens, the German engineering group, has acquired a 51 per cent stake in Dunlop Automotive Composites from BTR as part of its strategy to expand in the automotive components sector. The venture was formed in 1989 by BTR and the electrical and fuel handling division of Ford in order to market composite components for automotive engines using Dunlop's lost-core moulding process. It has a workforce of 165 based in Telford, Shropshire, and will operate as Siemens Automotive Systems. Siemens said that it expected the business to lift sales from Pounds 8m last year to about Pounds 35m by 1999, leading to the creation of an additional 150 jobs. It aimed to become a leading international supplier in the growing market for composite intake manifolds for engines. The UK subsidiary will operate as part of the Siemens Automotive group's integrated air fuel systems business based in Ontario, Canada.</p>

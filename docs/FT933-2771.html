			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Ford and union agree contract FORD Motor and the United Auto Workers union yesterday announced tentative agreement on a three-year labour contract in the US, paving the way for what may be tense contract negotiations between the union and troubled General Motors. The UAW chose Ford as its first target in its contract negotiations with each of the big three Detroit motor manufacturers this autumn. It will now try to impose the contract pattern reached with the target on the other two car manufacturers, Chrysler and GM. However, GM is struggling to stem losses in its US operations and has made clear it will be seeking substantial labour cost cuts. The Ford agreement was reached after negotiatins that ran almost 24 hours after the expiry on Tuesday night of the old three-year contract. Company and union officials will not provide details until the pact is unveiled next Monday to local union leaders. However, it is believed to provide that workers hired in future will receive lower starting wages for a longer time, before reaching parity with veteran employees.</p>

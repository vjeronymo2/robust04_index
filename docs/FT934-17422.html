			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / BR to compete on Gatwick line TRAVELLERS from London to Gatwick Airport will be offered a choice of rail services from Monday, as competition comes to British Rail in the run-up to railway privatisation. Gatwick Express, the non-stop airport link due to be privatised next year, will face stiffer competition from BR divisions Network SouthEast and Thameslink. Passengers who are prepared to use the slower stopping trains operated by the new competitors will pay Pounds 7.50 for their single journey, compared with Pounds 8.60 on the express. The introduction of competition on the route is a precursor to privatising Gatwick Express next year. A seven-year franchise to run the express service, one of the few profitable routes on offer, will be put up for sale in April. Until then, the service will be run as a 'shadow franchise', operating as a stand-alone operating company with more than 400 staff and its own rolling stock. Privatisation of the route is expected to be completed by October next year. The service carries 3.7m passengers a year between Victoria station in London and the rail station in Gatwick airport's main terminal. For much of the day, Gatwick Express offers four services an hour, covering the 27 miles in 30 minutes. It uses its own special platforms at Victoria, and the carriages are designed to provide space for air passengers' luggage. With the launch of the shadow franchise, it will also sell its tickets from separate ticket offices at Victoria and Gatwick. Express passengers pay a premium fare of Pounds 8.60 for the journey. Although cheaper commuter trains run over the route, BR has not advertised them and has discouraged their use. The shadow franchise means these restrictions will be lifted. Network SouthEast and Thameslink will be running frequent stopping services in competition with the express, cutting the fare to Pounds 7.50 for a single journey. Network SouthEast will provide up to four services an hour into Victoria, taking around 37 minutes and stopping at East Croydon and Clapham Junction. Thameslink will offer at least two trains an hour into London Bridge station, taking 33 minutes for the journey and also stopping at East Croydon. Thameslink services continue across the centre of London to Bedford, north of the capital. Mr Rob Mason, the new managing director of Gatwick Express, said yesterday that he expected to lose business to the two cut-price services in the short term. However, Mr Mason hopes to win extra business by selling tickets for the express through airlines and travel agents, so that people arriving at Gatwick are already committed to using the service. Negotiations will be completed during the shadow franchise on the track charges to be paid for using the rail network, and leasing charges for the rolling stock. Mr Mason said that he expected the management team to put in a bid for the franchise if the experiment is successful.</p>

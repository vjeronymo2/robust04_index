			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China's public  security organs today handed over to the Royal Hong Kong Police  five pleasure crafts stolen from Hong Kong last year.    The five pleasure boats were handed over to Commissioner of  Hong Kong Police Li Kwan-ha at a handling-over ceremony held at  a pier in Shekou, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of  southern China's Guangdong Province and then towed back to Hong  Kong.    The recovered pleasure crafts have a total value of 12.2  million HK dollars (1.56 million U.S. dollars), said Perter Yam,  senior staff officer of the Organized Crime and Triad [word as  received] Bureau (OCTB), at Sai Wan Ho Marine Police  Headquarters, where the five boats towed to and anchored.    A total of nine pleasure boats were stolen from the Causeway  Bay and Pochong Wan Typhoon Shelters in Hong Kong between  January and October last year. Hong Kong Police passed on  relevant information to its counter parts in China and some  southeastern countries.    After a period of investigation, the public security bureau  (PSB) in Guangdong Province recovered five of the nine stolen  crafts and arrested two Hong Kong residents in connection with  the case, Yam said.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong Police also arrested six Hong Kong  residents based on information supplied by the Chinese PSB, he  added.    As for the other four boats, Yam said, "The Chinese side  tried its best to assist us in locating them, but there was no  evidence that the boats are at the moment in China." He  believes the other four boats are still somewhere in Southeast  Asia.    Four of the five returned boats will be handed over to the  insurance company and the fifth will go back to the original  owner, Yam said.    In future, local police will tighten patrol on the sea and  keep in closer contacts with China in cracking down on unlawful  activities, he added.</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The risk-based capital standards tailor an institution's minimum capital requirement to broad categories of credit risk embodied in its assets and off-balance-sheet instruments. These standards require institutions to have total capital equal to at least 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk are expected to operate above minimum capital standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As defined, risk-weighted assets include credit exposures contained in off-balance-sheet instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 305(b) of FDICIA, (12 U.S.C. 1828 note) requires the agencies to revise their risk-based capital standards for insured depository institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities. This proposed rule addresses concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities. Rulemakings regarding interest rate risk are being issued separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advance notices of proposed rulemaking issued by the agencies with respect to section 305 requested comment through a series of questions on possible approaches to defining, measuring and incorporating these risks in the risk-based capital standards. Comments received in response to the notices are summarized in the following discussions of each risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, each agency addresses capital adequacy through a variety of supervisory actions and considers the risks of credit concentrations and nontraditional activities in taking those varied supervisory actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Concentration of Credit Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies received 107 responses to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on concentration of credit risk, with some duplication among agencies. In response to the question of what factors should be used in defining concentrations, most commenters agreed that borrower, industry, geography, collateral and loan type are relevant factors to define concentration risk. There was less consensus on which of these factors is the most significant or how to apply these factors in determining concentrations. Some commenters suggested using a narrow definition for concentrations to make any rule the agencies might adopt easier to implement and less burdensome to the industry. Others suggested caution in defining concentrations given data limitations and differences in the way definitions are applied by institutions in managing risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Bricks thrown at the mouse: UK amusement parks fear Lego more than Disney When he became general manager of Thorpe Park in 1988, Mr Colin Dawson started wearing a Mickey Mouse watch to remind himself what he was up against. He and his team at the Surrey-based theme park, like their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, watched the 1992 opening of Euro Disney nervously. Two years later, they take a more relaxed view of the Paris theme park, whose poor financial performance has brought it pages of bad publicity. Mr Dawson, who still wears the Mickey Mouse watch, can afford a touch of schadenfreude at Euro Disney's plight. He says: 'I think their egos prevented them from seeing what some of the problems would be.' Despite the competition from across the Channel - Euro Disney attracts nearly 10m visitors a year - the UK's three largest theme parks all enjoyed record attendance figures last year. Alton Towers, based in Staffordshire, saw attendances rise 5 per cent to 2.6m in 1993. This year's figure is expected to be higher, after the opening this spring of the Nemesis ride, which gives customers the feeling of weightlessness as it hurls them around. Surrey-based Chessington World of Adventures - which, like Alton Towers, is owned by the Pearson group, publisher of the FT - had 1.5m visitors last year, up 28 per cent on the year before. Thorpe Park, a subsidiary of concrete producer RMC, received 1.3m customers, compared with fewer than 1.2m in 1992. While neither parent group releases profit figures for the parks, all three say their owners are happy with their financial performance. In retrospect, they say the opening of Euro Disney may even have helped them. Ms Lesley Morisetti, Chessington's marketing manager, says the press and television coverage of Euro Disney helped to explain to British parents what a theme park was. Many had memories of the seedy seaside amusement parks of their youth. Euro Disney demonstrated to a wide audience that there was now something new on offer: clean, safe, well-run amusement attractions. Some of the press coverage of Euro Disney mentioned that Britain also had theme parks worth visiting. Ms Morisetti says: 'On balance, Euro Disney has done us a lot of good.' While Euro Disney introduced many Britons to the company's attractions, others already knew them well, having visited Disney parks in Florida or California. Ms Morisetti estimates that 20 per cent of visitors to Chessington have been to a Disney park. Their experiences of the US Disney attractions had already raised expectations of what a British theme park should offer. The three large UK parks say that the Disney organisation has taught them much of what they know about grouping attractions in areas with different themes - such as Calamity Canyon at Chessington and Fantasy Reef at Thorpe Park. Disney's influence can be seen in all three parks. Thorpe Park has been the most open in its adoption of Disney ways. Like Disney, it calls its employees 'cast members'. Its rules on employee appearance and dress sound similar to those in force at Euro Disney. Thorpe Park's employee booklet says men's hair must be one inch above their collars at all times. It adds: 'Tails of hair plaited with beads, step or graded hairstyles are not permitted. Extreme hair colours are not allowed.' Unlike Euro Disney, Thorpe Park allows beards, provided employees grow them during the winter when the park is closed. While the quality of the rides is high at all three parks, none is able to offer the well-known characters that Disney can. Alton Towers had a mascot called Henry Hound, but Ms Jill Britton, the park's marketing director, says: 'He has gone to the great dog kennel in the sky. He just wasn't strong enough.' The park is now introducing Beatrix Potter characters instead. There are other ways in which the UK parks fall short of the Euro Disney standard. None manages to be quite as clean as Euro Disney. Thorpe Park comes closest, but during a visit in early summer, parts of Alton Towers had litter which would not have been tolerated at the Paris park. Mr Andrew Hollingsworth, Alton Towers' divisional director, says the litter problems are the result of staffing difficulties. The park has had problems this summer attracting employees: the park is closed in the winter and working only part of the year is not an attractive proposition for work-seekers at a time when the economy is improving. The other two theme parks say they have no difficulty attracting staff for only part of the year. The large student population in the south of England means there is a pool of people happy to work in the summer months. Chessington and Thorpe Park say they also have little trouble recruiting non-student employees in the spring and autumn. The UK parks claim they have avoided two of the causes of Euro Disney's financial difficulties. First, unlike Euro Disney, they do not stay open in the winter. Mr Dawson dismisses Euro Disney's claim that the weather does not affect theme park attendance. Second, the UK groups have not built hotels at the parks. Euro Disney has six, which it has struggled to fill. Alton Towers is building one 175-room hotel. Because 20 per cent of its visitors stay for two days, it says it should have no difficulty filling it. There is something, however, that worries the two south of England parks: the planned opening of Lego World on the site of the former Windsor Safari Park in 1996. Lego, the Danish manufacturer of the toy building bricks, is basing the British park on its Legoland park in Jutland, which draws about 1.2m visitors a year. Lego World will be the company's first park outside Denmark. Like Thorpe Park and Chessington, Lego World is expected to appeal to day-trippers from the surrounding area. Chessington has requested planning permission to expand its offerings to counter the threat from Lego. Mr Dawson has been to Lego's park in Denmark and was impressed by what he saw. Thorpe Park will have to work hard to hold on to its market. He says: 'We're a lot more concerned about the arrival of Lego World than we ever were about Euro Disney.'</p>

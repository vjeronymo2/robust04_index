			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian miners in Sardinian gold project Two small Australian gold-mining companies yesterday secured a 70 per cent interest in a joint venture company that hopes to produce gold commercially in Sardinia, the Mediterranean island, by 1995. No gold-mining facility has ever been developed in Sardinia, although the island was mined in Roman times for copper and lead. Gemcor, however, whose shares are listed in both London and Australia, and General Gold, in which Rothschild Australia holds a controlling interest, said that a six-month feasibility study was under way and that, if this was favourable, they hoped to begin production by early-1995. The initial annual production target is 500,000 tonnes of ore, and mining will be centred at Furtei, 35km north of Cagliari, Sardinia's capital. The project will be developed by a joint venture company, to be called Sardinia Gold Mining. Gemcor and General Gold will buy their respective 35 per cent interests in SGM from Progemisa, a local quasi-government organisation which was set up to develop resource-based opportunities in Sardinia. According to the Australian partners, Progemisa has already been involved in ceramics and crystal ventures in the region. Gemcor and General Gold will pay ADollars 2.3m each for their SGM interests, and Progemisa will continue to hold the remaining 30 per cent stake. All three partners will then contribute around ADollars 5m to fund the development programme. In addition, they plan to seek further project funding - perhaps to the tune of ADollars 6m - from either the Italian government or through European regional assistance programmes. The total initial cost of the project is estimated at ADollars 18m, and the balance being funded by bank loans. Gold exploration in Sardinia began in the late-1980s, and a programme of drill holes has suggested four principal resources, at Furtei and also to the north of the island. The chairman of Gemcor, Mr Geoff Cohen, said yesterday that early drilling at Furtei had suggested oxide resources of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes at a grade of 2 to 2.5 grammes a tonne. According to Mr Barry Bolitho, from the Resource Service Group mining consultancy, these resources 'appear to be the cap of the epithermal systems and cover widespread gold sulphide mineralisation. 'RSG has concluded that the current resources at Furtei contain between 304,000 and 377,000 ounces depending on the upper cut,' he said. General Gold and Gemcor, via an associate company, are already partners in the Mt Monger gold project in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL BEHAVIORIST B.F. SKINNER  </P> <P> The Times' obituary of Skinner (Aug. 20) was remarkably well-done. It provided  a good sense of the life of this dramatically influential psychologist.  </P> <P> There was neither confusion of the baby tender with the Skinner box nor of  Palov's classical conditioning with operant conditioning, a distinction that  eluded a national news magazine and a scientific journal.  </P> <P> It tells us something about ourselves that even such fine journalism is no  protection against a major distortion of one of Skinner's fundamental beliefs:  that behavior uncaused by heredity and environment, sometimes called free will,  is a fuzzy mirage. The article informs us that Skinner "argued to the end . . .  (that) there is little or no free will." "Argued to the end" is a phrase you'd  expect to find applied to an earlier century to an atheist who died without the  expected death-bed recantation. In fact, Skinner explained, as have many before  him, that so-called free will is a misconception. Therefore, he could not  believe that people might have just a little of it, except in the sense that  they might have just a little of the misconception.  </P> <P> Skinner did not propose "forsaking individual freedom . . . in favor of  controlling human behavior to achieve a world free of war," etc. There is  nothing to forsake but a muddled concept, which is held to because it is  confused with a meaningful freedom: the freedom to do what one wishes uncoerced  by others. A clearer understanding will reduce resistance to needed social  engineering and also sensitize us to the dangers of being subtly manipulated to  our disadvantage by those using rewards rather than threats.  </P> <P> RICHARD O'CONNELL  </P> <P> Professor of Psychology  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge  </P></p>

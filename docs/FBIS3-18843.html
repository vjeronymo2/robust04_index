Clinton had dared to come out very far with a  regulation that links more favorable trade conditions for China  to progress in the sphere of human rights. Yet his additional  signals to the rulers in Beijing were ambiguous. While his  human rights delegate was pointing his index finger at moral  issues in Beijing this week, next door the trade delegate was  promoting new contracts involving big money.    From this, Beijing seems to have drawn the conclusions -- as  it did after Federal Chancellor Kohl's sales visit -- that all  these Western tirades in connection with human rights are  presented only half-heartedly. The brutal suppression of the  Chinese opposition is disgusting, and Beijing's rulers are  responsible for it. Yet, are China's conclusions and the  criticism that the United States and Europe are being  "two-faced" so wrong?    The menacingly pointed U.S. index finger produces  conflicting  feelings. If it is seriously meant -- good. Yet, if it is  actually rather intended to soothe the U.S. public, which is  outraged about repression in China, or as an instrument of trade  policy to exert pressure -- then "no thanks!"    The advocates of "business as usual" should not deduce from  it that pressure on Beijing might be totally dropped in the  future. After all, the United States forced a human rights  dialogue on the PRC. Should it have been meant seriously, then  Wei Jingsheng and his fellow-fighters can gather fresh hope.</p>

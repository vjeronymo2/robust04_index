			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (1): Rocky road to transition - As the Philippines moves towards a democratic transfer of power, many Filipinos approach this milestone disappointed and impatient at what they believe is a lack of progress towards both economic and social stability. Yet a new president will take over amid signs of renewed optimism SIX years after President Ferdinand Marcos's 20-year grip on power was broken in a popular rebellion, the Philippines is again approaching a turbulent transition. Despite seven coup attempts, President Corazon Aquino has confounded her detractors by surviving and is steering the country towards that rare south-east Asian event, a democratic transfer of power. Judged by the yardstick of democracy, a peaceful handover after the May elections will be viewed as a significant achievement for Mrs Aquino. Yet the restoration of elected institutions has been fraught with difficulties and has yet to provide the foundations for the kind of economic growth enjoyed by most of the country's neighbours. Swept along by understandable but unrealistic optimism immediately after Marcos fled in 1986, many Filipinos approach this milestone disappointed and impatient at what they say is a lack of progress towards economic and social stability. The path to a more predictable future has been complicated by the sudden departure of US bases from the Philippines by November this year. Triggered by the Senate's refusal to ratify Mrs Aquino's new treaty with Washington, the closing of the bases heralds fundamental changes in the often emotional relationship between Filipinos and their former colonial rulers. The importance of the Philippines to US projection of power in the Pacific was bound to diminish with the collapse of the Soviet Union and Washington's budget problems. Yet the abrupt end to the historic relationship and the imminence of the withdrawal have yet to be fully appreciated. Quite suddenly the Philippines will have to strengthen its ties with Asian neighbours and come to terms with the growing regional importance of the old adversary, Japan. The looming elections have so far provided few pointers as to how the Philippines will emerge from this transition. In an atmosphere somewhere between high drama and farce, eight serious candidates have lined up to succeed Mrs Aquino, including Mrs Imelda Marcos, the former First Lady accused of looting millions of dollars from her country. Mrs Marcos faces more than 100 charges ranging from money smuggling to theft, and probably stands little chance of winning the election. But she is well enough financed not be written off as a nuisance candidate. Against this background of uncertainty investors are once again intoning the familiar refrain - 'wait-and-see'. This is exactly what the Philippines could do without as the country emerges from a year of negative per capita economic growth. Yet despite the destabilising effect of the elections, the gloom that hung over the economy for much of last year is beginning to lift. Foreign exchange reserves are at an all time high as migrant workers, driven abroad by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano, remit more dollars. A revenue-raising levy has slashed imports. Money already pouring back into the country to fund election campaigns is also expected to fuel a consumer-led mini-boom which optimists hope will tide the country over until investment can lead recovery after the elections. This recovery could, however, be substantially diminished if the main opposition candidate is elected. Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, the most accomplished of Mr Marcos's business cronies before he fled with the dictator in 1986, is still widely suspected of favouring the protected, monopoly-dominated form of capitalism nurtured by his former boss to the lasting detriment of the country. If he wins, investors could well go to ground. Manila's businessmen fear that a similar cocktail of inward-looking economic nationalism could be ushered in by Senator Jovita Salonga, the Liberal candidate. On the other hand, should either of the ruling LDP party's two candidates win, there is likely to be a continuation of recent movement towards economic liberalisation. The LDP's chances have been weakened, however, by Mrs Aquino's endorsement of retired General Fidel Ramos as her preferred successor, rather than Mr Ramon Mitra, the Speaker, who won the nomination of his party's delegates. It is an example of the sort of decision made by Mrs Aquino that has bemused observers and lost her much of her early rapturous support at home and abroad. Despite an enviable mandate for change, she is now widely criticised as having led a government of missed opportunities. Most damaging has been the administrations's inability to control the nationalist-dominated Senate, even though Mrs Aquino hand-picked most of the incumbents. The Senate's refusal to endorse her decision to prolong the US bases agreement was one of its more notable acts of rebellion. Yet at the eleventh hour, the Senate fell into line with the administration on the equally crucial question of economic management. By passing new revenue-raising measures during its last hours in session, the Senate has given the new administration a chance to tame the burgeoning domestic debt which has kept local interest rates high and discouraged investment. The new measures also appear to have persuaded the International Monetary Fund to approve a new austerity programme which clears the way for new foreign aid and an important rescheduling of Dollars 5.3bn of commercial debt. In any case, to lay all blame at Mrs Aquino's feet, as her critics are doing, is simplistic. Many of the problems she has confronted were inherited and would have been passed onto the next president whoever replaced Marcos. Foreign debt, now standing at Dollars 29bn, has been a running sore. And the army, for so long the policeman of martial law, has steadfastly refused to accept that it should be subservient to civilian government. Few observers will put money on the military remaining in their barracks. More reasonable Filipinos, while welcoming the likelihood that almost any new president will provide more decisive leadership, nevertheless point out that Mrs Aquino leaves some solid foundations on which to build. The communist-led insurgency, for example, has been badly damaged not only by the collapse of role models in eastern Europe but also by Mrs Aquino's commitment to democracy. Delivery of some basic services such as roads, schools and healthcare to remote areas might be the clinching final blow against the guerrillas as it was against Thailand's insurgents in 1984. On the economic front, the dismantling of the big Marcos monopolies and crony capitalism, while not complete, has liberated local entrepreneurial flair, particularly in the important Filipino Chinese community. All they would seek from a new president is a continuation of the process that is slowly edging government out of business. Last month's privatisation of Philippine Airlines was the latest successful move along this path. If the government supplies the stability and better infrastructure - the country is facing a serious power shortage - business will resume investing, the argument goes. Already in Cebu island and Cavite province where the local political leadership is strongly pro-business, pockets of dynamic investment-led growth have sprung up as an example of what could happen elsewhere. In recent months, the government has also adopted important economic reforms. It has relaxed foreign exchange rules, greatly increasing exporters' flexibility and reducing red tape. And it has begun to undo damage done to foreign investor sentiment by Supreme Court interference in a Taiwanese company's plans for a Dollars 250m petrochemical plant. After the court's ruling, the investor packed his bags and went home. The new investment code now explicitly presumes projects are acceptable unless specifically excluded, reversing the previous rules that said most investments needed regulatory approval. These reforms remain, however, humble beginnings compared to what Thailand, Malaysia and even Indonesia have already achieved. But as the country moves chaotically out of the gloom of the Marcos years, Filipinos who can look beyond the clamour of the forthcoming elections are nevertheless teetering on the verge of optimism.</p>

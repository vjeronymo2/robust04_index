Yu Yongbo, member of the Central  Military Commission [CMC] and director of the General Political  Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], spoke at the  rally on behalf of the CMC and the three general departments.    Inscriptions by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and Vice Chairmen  Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen were read at the rally. The three  leaders' inscriptions are, respectively: "Carry forward the  hard-boned spirit and promote Army building in an all-round  way," "Pass on the hard- boned spirit from generation to  generation," and "Carry forward the tradition of Red Army  veterans and promote the hard-boned spirit."    The "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" is famous throughout the  services for its steadfast combat readiness, strong militancy,  toughened military skills, and strict military and  administrative discipline. On 22 January 1964, the Defense  Ministry designated it with the honorable title of the  "Hard-Boned Sixth Company." In 1985, it was again named by the  CMC the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company." The company has been  cited for collective meritorious service, first class, on three  occasions; collective meritorious service, second class, on 11  occasions; and collective meritorious service, third class, on  eight occasions. The company's party branch three times has  been named an advanced grass-roots party organization in the  nation and throughout the services.    Yu Yongbo congratulated the company on behalf of the CMC and  the three general departments. He said: The growth and  progress of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" reflect the  painstaking care of three generations of our party's leadership  collectives. Chairman Mao received the delegations of the Sixth  Company on six occasions. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a high  opinion of the company and pointed out: "As far as companies  are concerned, they are doing the right thing in emulating the  Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the company's work style should  not be the work style of one company alone. All companies, and  even cadres at all levels, should study hard and train hard like  the Sixth Company and should have the political awareness of the  company." Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected the company in person  and called on us to "carry forward the hard- boned spirit and  promote Army building in an all-round way." He also pointed  out: The "hard-boned" spirit is the precious spiritual wealth  of the PLA. This spirit, in a nutshell, means never bowing  before any adversity but rather daring to fight, to sacrifice,  and to win. This kind of hard-boned spirit is important in  times of war; it is also important in times of peace. Comrade  Jiang Zemin's comments, which sum up the Sixth Company's basic  spirit and bring to light the profound substance of the  "hard-boned" spirit, serve to point out a direction for the  emulation of the Sixth Company in the new situation.    Yu Yongbo said: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th  CPC National Congress, the whole party and the whole nation are  marching with big strides along the path of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.  As the solid pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship,  our Army is entrusted with the sacred mission of safeguarding  national security and providing a peaceful environment for  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. We must arouse  our morale and fighting will with the "hard-boned" spirit; be  loyal to the party, the people, the motherland, and socialism at  all times; place the interests of the party, state, and people  above everything else; and make new and greater contributions to  the party and people. He urged leading cadres at all levels in  the military to take the lead and set a good example in  emulating and promoting the "hard-boned" spirit, arm the cadres  and fighters with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and further enhance  their awareness and steadfastness in implementing the party's  basic line. It it necessary to guide the cadres and fighters to  conscientiously study modern military skills, train hard,  constantly enhance their awareness, foster a correct outlook on  life and values, and arm the whole Army with this  all-conquering, hard-boned spirit. We should, pursuant to the  requirements in the reissued "Program for the Construction of  Grass-Roots Army Units," develop in large numbers all-round  competent companies which are "qualified politically and  competent militarily, which have a fine work style, which  maintain strict discipline, and which are assured of adequate  logistical support."    On behalf of the three general departments, Zhou Ziyu,  deputy  director of the General Political Department, presented the  company with a horizontal board with the words "Forever preserve  and carry forward the hard-boned spirit" inscribed in gold.  Also present were leaders of the Nanjing Military Region and  Zhejiang Province including Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi, Li Zemin, and Wan  Xueyuan, and officers and men of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company."</p>

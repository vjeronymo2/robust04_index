			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSS, HENLEY, BROWNE SPARK UNIVERSAL LINEUP  </P> <P> Diana Ross will make her first Los Angeles-area concert appearances in five  years when she headlines the Universal Amphitheatre for four nights beginning  July 19.  </P> <P> Ross -- whose shows will be part of her first tour since she became part owner  of Motown Records -- was among 41 acts announced Wednesday for the  amphitheater's spring through fall season.  </P> <P> Also returning after lengthy hiatuses from touring are Don Henley, whose Sept.  26 and 27 shows will be his first L.A. dates in four years, and Jackson Browne,  whose Aug. 11-13 stand represents his first non-benefit L.A. shows in three  years.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the 41 acts will be making multi-night stands. They include  Dolly Parton (July 12-13), L.L. Cool J (July 25-26), Tom Petty &amp; the  Heartbreakers (July 29-30), Randy Travis (Aug. 9-10), Kenny Rogers (Nov. 24-26)  and Barry Manilow (Dec. 26-31).  </P> <P> "It's the most (multi-night stints) we've had since we opened in '82," said  Larry Vallon, the amphitheater's executive vice president, noting what he sees  as a trend toward such stands in mid-size venues (the Universal holds 6,200) as  an alternative to single shows at such larger arenas as the Forum or Los  Angeles Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Also increased this year will be the the number of shows featuring the general  admission, standing-only "Party in the Pit" area in front of the regular  reserved seats. Introduced last year for several shows, including concerts by  Keith Richards and Steel Pulse, the "party" tickets will be offered this year  for such acts as Petty and L.L. Cool J.  </P> <P> For some other shows, Vallon said, special themes will be adopted, a la Duran  Duran's shows last month for which the amphitheater was decorated as a mid-'60s  English dance club. One special event planned is Joan Baez's Dec. 16 show,  which will mark the singer's 30th anniversary as a professional musician and  will feature special guest appearances.  </P> <P> Vallon said the 41 acts represent about half of the final amphitheater  summer/fall lineup. Additional shows will be announced as acts are signed.  </P> <P> The schedule also includes several non-pop music performances, with the Royal  Danish Ballet (June 11), comic actress/singer Sandra Bernhard (Oct. 5) and  comedian Steven Wright (Oct. 9).  </P> <P> The rest of the announced schedule:  </P> <P> April 29, Guy, Today and Salt-N-Pepa; May 17, a reggae fest with the Wailers  and Third World; May 19-21, Willie Nelson; May 26-27, Roberto Carlos; June 2,  the "Classic New York Doo-Wopp Show"; June 3, Eddie Money; June 15-16, Hank  Williams Jr.; June 20-21, Jimmy Buffett; June 23-24, Smokey Robinson; June 25,  Tiffany and New Kids on the Block; June 30, Ashford &amp; Simpson.  </P> <P> July 9, the Monkees; July 14-15, David Sanborn; Aug. 1-2, America and Three Dog  Night; Aug. 6, "Quiet Storm" with Phyllis Hyman and others; Aug. 25, Tony  Bennett; Aug. 26, Randy Newman; Aug. 30-31, the Bee Gees; Sept. 8-9, Pointer  Sisters; Sept. 15-16, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary; Oct. 6, Dwight Yoakam; Nov. 4,  Michael W.

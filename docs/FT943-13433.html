			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo gains 5% despite June earnings warning PepsiCo, the US soft drink and fast food company that last month warned of flat profits in its second quarter, yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in net income for the period to Dollars 446.5m. However, further indications of its difficulties came with the announcement of another top management change. Just one week after the departure of Mr Jeff Campbell, senior vice-president for brand development, PepsiCo said Mr John Cranor, chief executive of its KFC fast food business, had resigned. Mr David Novak, a Pepsi-Cola North America executive, will become chief executive of KFC-USA, and Mr Larry Zwain will remain chief executive of KFC International. Both will report directly to Mr Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive. The shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 30 3/4 at midday. Last month, PepsiCo said two main factors were behind its poor financial performance: a downturn in profits from its fast food businesses, and discounting in its US soft drink business caused by price competition. Yesterday, PepsiCo confirmed 11 per cent growth in revenues from domestic beverages had been partly offset by higher discounts to retailers, producing a 5 per cent increase in operating profits to Dollars 270.9m. Internationally, operating profits from beverages fell by 23 per cent to Dollars 64.1m, mainly because last year's figure included a one-off Dollars 11.9m credit. Snack food profits rose 15 per cent to Dollars 318.7m, but profits from all the fast food businesses were down. Pizza Hut's fell by 10 per cent to Dollars 59.7m, Taco Bell's declined by 5 per cent to Dollars 54.6m, and KFC's fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 41.6m. Poor sales, lower prices and higher costs were mostly to blame. Overall, group sales rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 6.56bn and earnings per share rose 4 per cent to 55 cents. Excluding the effect of accounting changes, net income rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 729.3m in the half year.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Exceptional costs drag Asda into heavy loss ASDA, the struggling grocery chain, yesterday reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.8m as it suffered from falling operating profits, a mounting interest bill and a string of exceptional charges. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 58.4m to Pounds 10.1m in the 28 weeks to November 9 but the company was dragged into heavy loss by exceptional costs of Pounds 78.9m relating to reorganisation charges and property write-downs. The City had been braced following an earlier warning from the company. Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'In the circumstances it was about the best outcome we could have hoped for.' Asda's sales grew from Pounds 2.25bn to Pounds 2.3bn but operating profits fell from Pounds 107m to Pounds 74m in difficult trading conditions. Asda's grocery stores produced profits of Pounds 84m (Pounds 100.9m) on sales slightly ahead at Pounds 2.2bn. But losses from the Allied Maples furnishings business amounted to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 3.2m) and the Gazeley property business saw profits fall to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 9.3m). The interest charge rose to Pounds 63.7m (Pounds 44.4m). The exceptional costs split as follows: the recent financial restructuring cost Pounds 11.1m; head office rationalisation, including the loss of 350 jobs, Pounds 9.6m; write-off of capitalised distribution start-up costs, Pounds 19.1m; and provisions against its development properties at Gazeley, Pounds 39.1m. Asda accepted it had paid too much for the 60 superstores it bought from Gateway for Pounds 705m in 1989 - implying that a current asset revaluation would include a further write-down in the year-end accounts. Losses per share came to 5.71p against earnings of 2.9p the year before. An interim dividend of 1.25p was recommended against 1.85p last year. Lex, Page 22</p>

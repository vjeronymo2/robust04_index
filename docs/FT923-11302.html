			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Tokyo investors had steeled themselves for disappointment over yesterday evening's high-level government meeting on how to halt the slide in the equity market. Hence the 3.4 per cent drop in the Nikkei to a new six-year low before the outcome was even known. The meeting convened by the Prime Minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, may have been an empty political gesture of concern ahead of tomorrow's upper house elections. Or the authorities may be genuinely concerned but still unable to reach the required Japanese consensus on the appropriate course of action. Either way round, the likelihood of further falls has increased as a result of the meeting's lack of result. The poor outlook for corporate profits and the low yield on Japanese equities provide little natural incentive for share purchases. It looks increasingly as if some form of official action will be needed to lift the all-pervasive gloom, but such action will have to be pretty determined if investors are to be persuaded about the appeal of equities. Another government spending programme would not suffice. If and when the authorities do decide to act, they may have to consider some direct help for the struggling financial sector. At the very least, there would have to be a further cut in short term interest rates, a point on which the Bank of Japan still evidently needs some persuading.</p>

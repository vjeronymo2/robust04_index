Apparently, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has set  new conditions. The doubts exist because differences between  the two parties to the political crisis have persisted.    Reports from Aden said several Yemeni politicians fear that  the situation might explode in light of the military deployments  by the rival parties.    A member of the committee that is tasked with setting a time  and venue for a ceremony to sign the accord document, who  demanded anonymity, has said that YSP Secretary General 'Ali  Salim al-Bid has set new conditions for the signing. The  committee member said the YSP wants to see, once the agreement  is initialed, the implementation of its major clauses before a  final settlement to the Yemeni crisis is reached. Al-Bid and  other YSP officials, most of whom are in Aden, do not think it  is necessary for them to go back to Sanaa after signing the  agreement, even though the agreement stipulates their return.    The committee member said Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar,  the YSP representative, told the committee al-Bid will not go  back to Sanaa before these clauses are implemented.    Al-Bid, who has been staying in Aden since 19 August 1993,  wants security guarantees before he declares his readiness to  sign the agreement, which was reached after extensive  discussions that lasted two months. The agreement meets most of  the YSP demands, especially with regard to a broad  administrative decentralization and security arrangements.    The member asserted that representatives of the General  People's Congress, led by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, under 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, have  rejected this demand. They argue that the agreement is binding  and that its implementation requires the contribution of all the  leaders of the government coalition.    The member added that the YSP wants the signing ceremony to  be attended by representatives from the United States, the  European Union, Russia, the PRC, Canada, Syria, Saudi Arabia, in  addition to Fahim al-Qasimi, the secretary general of the Gulf  Cooperation Council. The purpose of this is to have more  guarantees.    A source close to the president's party said this demand is  part of political one-upmanship and efforts to internationalize  the Yemeni crisis.</p>

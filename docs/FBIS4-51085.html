			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Township-run  enterprises, an economic power-house in east China's Zhejiang  Province, will continue to thrive despite temporary  difficulties, according to a provincial government official.    Qian Xinhao, deputy director of the provincial bureau of  township-run enterprises, said that Zhejiang currently has more  than 100,000 such enterprises.    They manufactured 300 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993,  accounting for 75 percent of Zhejiang's gross domestic product,  the value of goods and services produced province wide, he said.    That figure also formed 11 percent of the output value of  rural industries throughout China, he added.    Under the tax reform begun earlier this year, rural  companies  no longer enjoy lower tax rates as they did before, Qian said.    Moreover, most of them are now suffering from acute  shortages  of funds because the Chinese government has tightened credit  control in an effort to ensure top-priority construction  projects, he said.    Consequently, the profits of rural businesses plunged nearly  27 percent in the first quarter of 1994 to 679 million yuan, he  said.    "Even so, the development momentum of rural enterprises in  Zhejiang is good on the whole," he said.    For example, output value of these enterprises amounted to  111.2 billion yuan during the first four months of 1994, up 80  percent over the same period in 1993.    To overcome the present difficulties, rural enterprises have  accelerated the introduction of the joint-stock cooperative  system, he said.    According to Qian, the new system has turned workers into  shareholders and has tied up shareholders' incomes and fringe  benefits with their enterprises, thus resulting in higher  productivity.    To date, over 60,000 rural businesses have introduced the  new  system, he said.    "Many rural enterprises have shifted their attention to the  international market," he said.    So far, 119 rural firms have opened factories and  subsidiaries in other countries.    For example, the Zhedong Cement Pipe Factory in Yinxian  county has built a factory in the Philippines at a cost of 15  million yuan in a move to break into the local market.    Furthermore, rural enterprises in Zhejiang are trying to  promote cooperation with their colleagues in underdeveloped  central and western parts of China, he said.    They have proposed 100 major projects for cooperation with  township-run enterprises in Henan province and the Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region.    The deputy director also noted that production of rural  firms  set up by groups of farmers or individual farmers has been  growing rapidly.    During the January-April period, output value of such firms  amounted to 45.2 billion yuan, up 182 percent on the same period  in 1993, he said.</p>

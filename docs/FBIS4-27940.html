			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Energy Thai Phung Ne by </F> unidentified VNA corrrespondent; place and date not given]    [Summary] [Correspondent]: "As people around the country  are very interested in hearing about progress on the north-south  500-kv power line, could you review the status of the project?"    [Thai Phung Ne] "Testing is the final phase of construction  for the power network before it goes into operation. According  to a schedule drawn up by three parties, namely Vietnam; the  (Merland Guerain) company of France, which provides transformer  stations; and the PPI-SECVI (of Australia), a technical  consultant that participates in supervision of construction, the  test period will last for about two months.    "The testing program officially began 5 April, exactly two  years after the beginning of construction. I cannot recall  everything we have done in the past month because the testing  involves huge amounts of work." I can only recall the most  essential activities, which include finishing the inspection,  testing, and adjustment of the entire 1,487 km of the 500-kv  power transmission line; completing the inspection and testing  of equipment at all five transformer stations and the National  Power Regulator Center; completing testing of measuring  instruments and switches at the Hoa Binh, Ha Tinh and Danang  transformer stations; measuring the electrical resistance of the  Danang-Ha Tinh-Hoa Binh, Danang-Play Cu, Play Cu-Krong No, and  Krong No-Phu Lam microwave transmission lines; and  test-connecting the 15-kv power network with the 500-kv power  network.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, were there any problems with  the test-run?    [Thai Phung Ne] "Generally speaking, the results of the  test-run were good."    [Correspondent] "Mr. Minister, everyone is waiting for the  moment when the switch is turned on, carrying electricity from  the north to the south. Could you tell us exactly when that  will happen?"    [Thai Phung Ne] "As I said earlier, two months of testing  are  needed before the power transmission lines are connected  officially. I have asked the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of  Australia) and other testing units to focus their greatest  efforts on finishing the remaining testing work promptly."    It is necessary to point out here that the remaining work is  very extensive. I have asked the National Electricity Regulator  Center and the PPI-SECVI Consultant Company (of Australia) to  draw up an operating plan for various power stations in order to  ensure a smooth supply of electricity to the national power grid.</p>

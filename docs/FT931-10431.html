			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Finland reopens Ecu Eurobond sector THE Republic of Finland reopened the neglected Ecu-denominated sector yesterday with a Ecu500m five-year Eurobond, the first sovereign issue since last June when the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty put the international Ecu market out of favour with investors. The last sovereign borrower in Ecu Eurobonds was the Kingdom of Spain, which raised Ecu250m via a two-year note last May. In July, the European Investment Bank brought a 10-year Ecu200m Eurobond. Since then, the sector has been virtually moribund, apart from some small issues of Ecu80m or less. The French Treasury's successful auction of Ecu710m worth of 10-year notes in late January had raised hopes that the Ecu market would soon recover. Syndicate managers said that a resurgence of investor interest in Ecu-denominated instruments had also encouraged borrowers to look again at this area. Yesterday's offering from Finland was priced at 99.40 to yield 8.15 per cent, in the middle of the indicated range of 8.13 to 8.18 per cent. An official at the lead manager Morgan Stanley International said that about two-thirds of the issue had been placed by yesterday afternoon and the syndicate was unlikely to be broken until today, to allow time to place the remaining stock in the Far East overnight. Yesterday's offering was Finland's second in the international market so far this year. In late January, it reopened its Dollars 2bn global bond offering launched last November, adding a further Dollars 1bn of five-year bonds. Finland has a borrowing programme of close to FM60bn in 1993, which will be split between the international and domestic markets. Finland's foray into the Ecu market reinforced rumours that the French Treasury was looking to raise up to Ecu2bn in five-year notes. Other issuers said to be showing interest in Ecu were Belgium, the European Investment Bank and the European Community. Dealers reported that prices in the Ecu secondary market eased in the afternoon, in anticipation of a sharp increase in supply. Finland kicked off this week's round of sovereign borrowing, which is expected to be quite heavy. Scandinavian issuers were said to be interested in the dollar sector, and among non-sovereign borrowers, the Asian Development Bank was reportedly looking at raising dollars in the 10-year area. In the early afternoon, the Republic of Ireland launched a Dollars 500m Eurobond due 2003, priced at 99.46 to yield 6.95 per cent. An official at the co-lead manager, Daiwa Europe, said the issue was Ireland's first Eurobond this year, and its first in the Eurodollar sector since February 1990. He reported good sales into Germany, the Benelux countries and the UK, and said that a majority of the issue had been placed by late afternoon. The remainder is expected to be placed in the Far East. After the syndicate broke, the deal traded at 99.43 bid, representing a widening of two basis points in the yield spread since the launch to 57 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. Elsewhere, France Telecom raised FFr2.5bn through a 10-year Eurobond, priced at 98.70 to yield 8.07 per cent. Syndicate managers reported good demand, as investors were encouraged by the improved outlook for the French franc since the cut in German rates. The issue traded at 98.40 to yield 8.11 per cent, reflecting the weaker tone in French government bonds.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The Common Crop Insurance Policy should be thoroughly reviewed and revised as needed before any additional crop provisions are implemented under it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Program changes necessary to comply with crop insurance reform will have the same effects on either the existing ELS cotton policy or these ELS Cotton Crop Provisions. Any necessary changes can be made to the ELS Cotton Crop Provisions as easily as they can be made to the existing policy. FCIC has recently completed a review of the Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (&sect;457.8). Any necessary changes required to be made to the Basic Provisions as a result of reform will be required whether or not the ELS Cotton Crop Provisions have been implemented. Therefore, FCIC does not find it necessary to delay implementation for either of the reasons stated in the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment questioned requirements contained in the definition of ``practical to replant.'' This definition indicated that the replanted acreage must have the potential to produce at least ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee. The late planting provisions provide production guarantees much lower than the ninety percent (90%) potential requirement contained in the definition even though the late planted and replanted crop may be planted at the same time. The comment recommended removing the production potential requirement from the definition of ``practical to replant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ELS Cotton Crop Provisions do not provide for a late planting period or late planting production guarantees. However, acreage initially planted to ELS cotton may be replanted to American Upland cotton. FCIC agrees that the production potential required by the definition of ``practical to replant'' and the production guarantee for late planted American Upland cotton acreage may be inconsistent depending on the time of planting. American Upland cotton acreage initially planted twenty-five (25) days after the final planting date would have a production guarantee equal to sixty percent (60%) of the guarantee for timely planted acreage, while the definition of ``practical to replant'' would require acreage replanted at the same time to have a production potential equal to ninety percent (90%) of the production guarantee. However, expected yield does have an effect on whether it is practical to replant. The ninety percent (90%) production potential requirement has been removed from the definition of ``practical to replant.'' However, the expected yield must be sufficient to cover production costs and must be at a level that growers in the area would normally care for and harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment recommended changing the term ``approved yield'' to ``approved APH yield'' in the definition of ``Production guarantee'' to correspond with terminology in underwriting procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Underwriting procedure contains several methods which may be used to determine approved yields. These include the use of yields which may not represent actual production history (APH). Using the term ``APH'' could be misleading to readers not familiar with administrative procedures, and, therefore, will not be used in the crop insurance policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three comments disagreed with the definition of ``written agreement''. This definition requires written agreements to be requested at least 15 days prior to the sales closing date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) One comment recommended keeping the current deadlines for written agreements as specified in procedures. These procedures require that requests be made not later than 15 days after the acreage reporting date for most types of written agreements. Setting a deadline 15 days prior to the sales closing date will either force insureds to submit requests for written agreements they may not need, or result in uninsurable acreage if requests are not made for all possible situations. Unnecessary requests will increase paperwork for the insured, agent, FCIC Regional Service Office and company. The comment also recommended deleting the last sentence of the definition, which required written agreements to contain all variable terms including, but not limited to, crop variety, guarantee, premium and price election. The comment indicated it was not necessary to include this information on every written agreement because many written agreements do not alter these items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One comment recommended keeping the deadline of 15 days after the acreage reporting date because there are many instances when it is not known that a written agreement is necessary until the acreage is reported. The comment stated that the change would be an unreasonable requirement and would create difficulties since the sales closing dates will be 30 days earlier than in prior years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) One comment stated that it is hard to understand why the written agreement deadline is 15 days prior to the time a producer has to purchase coverage, and that a more appropriate date should be established. The comment also stated that the sales closing dates are not listed in the proposed crop provisions. If these are the same date as the cancellation and termination date, the policy should so indicate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed definition was intended to require that requests for written agreements be made far enough ahead of the sales closing date to allow the insurer to make the offer, and for the insured to accept the offer, by the sales closing date. Since the insurance policy is a written contract, both parties must have a meeting of the minds before the contract is valid. The terms and conditions of the policy must be known by the final date for establishing the insurance contract. In this program, the final date is the sales closing date. FCIC has determined that some situations may allow written agreements at other times. FCIC is preparing proposed written agreement regulations which will specify when written agreements must be completed. Until these regulations have been published, the written agreement must be completed by the sales closing date, or, in specific instances, a written agreement may be requested or approved after the sales closing date if the crop is physically inspected and a determination made that the crop has an expectancy of making the guaranteed yield. No prevented planting liability will be established as a result of any request submitted after the sales closing date. FCIC does not agree that the final sentence should be deleted. Specifying all variable terms in the written agreement is necessary to assure a clear understanding of the terms in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the sales closing dates normally will be the same as the cancellation and termination dates this is not always the case. Therefore, the sales closing dates will not be included in the crop provisions. Federal regulations authorize the Manager of FCIC to extend the sales closing date in any county upon the Manager's determination that no adverse selection will result during the extended period. The extended date is placed on file in the applicable service offices and a notice is placed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the sales closing dates were contained in the crop provisions, the crop provisions would need to be amended each time a sales closing date is extended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment stated that unit division language contained in subsection 2.(b) should allow for situations in which the insured creates a discernible break via some tillage operation. The proposed provision states that the insured must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit. There is no required method of creating a boundary as long as a discernible break is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The intent of the policy language is to allow separate optional units if acreage is farmed separately. Farming separately includes planting separately, keeping separate records of inputs, production, etc. Creating a boundary after the crop is planted by means of a tillage operation along a section line may or may not meet the policy requirement of planting the crop in a manner that results in a clear and discernable break at the units boundary. FCIC believes the present language clearly sets out the requirements for unit division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two comments were received regarding the changes in the cancellation and termination dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) One comment stated the assumption that since cancellation and termination dates were changed, that the sales closing dates will be changed to align with the new cancellation and termination dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One comment expressed the concern that an earlier cancellation date would decrease the amount of time available for producers to make decisions regarding their insurance coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The sales closing dates, as contained in the Special Provisions, will be changed generally to be the same as, but no later than, the new cancellation and termination dates. Earlier cancellation and sales closing dates are intended to reduce the possibility that a producer's decision to cancel or purchase insurance is based on favorable or unfavorable growing conditions. FCIC expects this change to have favorable impact on insurance experience. Favorable results will be considered when calculating future premium rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

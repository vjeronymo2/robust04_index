			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL STARTING, ENDING BELL TIMES WILL GO ON A ROTATION SCHEDULE  </P> <P> In an effort to promote fairness, bell times for starting and ending the school  day will be rotated every five years, beginning next fall, at almost all San  Diego city elementary and middle schools that use bus transportation, trustees  decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The board voted 4 to 1, with Trustee Jim Roache opposed, to implement the  controversial rotating schedule at about 20 schools in the 1990-91 year.  </P> <P> Additional schools will be added each year until almost 90 are on five-year  rotations. Initially, some will be placed on the generally preferred early  times and others on the less popular 9 a.m. start schedules. Those schools that  for years have enjoyed the early times will be the first to rotate to later  times for five years, and those with late times will be phased in for the early  schedules.  </P> <P> Only 12 schools, which are without any bused students, will be exempt from the  new procedures. Another 7 schools -- Torrey Pines, La Jolla, Fremont, Florence,  Longfellow, Loma Portal and Freeze -- will remain voluntarily with the late  start and dismissal.  </P> <P> Elementary and middle school start and end times will include: 7:50 a.m. to  2:10 a.m., 8 a.m. to 2:20 p.m., 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 9:15 a.m. to 3:35 p.m.  </P> <P> Junior and senior high schools, including the atypical secondary schools at  Gompers, Muir and the School for Creative and Performing Arts, will be anchored  permanently on 7:30 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. schedules to allow students enough time  for afternoon extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> The board said it decided to move ahead with the complex and controversial plan  on the basis of equity.  </P> <P> Because the district has a plethora of special integration and special  education programs that result in bus transportation of students all over the  city, schools now start and stop at different times based on the limited number  of buses available to deliver and pick up students.  </P> <P> The district has been under pressure from federal education officials to begin  all special education programs at the same time as regular instruction at a  given school, in order to allow more special education students chances to  participate in regular classes during part of the day (so-called  mainstreaming).  </P> <P> But it would cost the district more than $1 million to maintain current  schedules -- under which most schools begin and end early -- and improve the  transportation picture for special education children by adding buses. By  rotating schools at the same time -- and giving those with perennially late  times preferred schedules -- the district will spend only another $278,000  because fewer buses will be needed.  </P> <P> However, the plan continued to face vocal opposition from parents at schools  with longstanding early times. Parents complained Tuesday of the difficulty in  rearranging child care and car pools every five years, particularly if they  have work schedules that call for them to leave before their children can be  driven to school in the morning.  </P> <P> Board Vice President Shirley Weber conceded that trustees were influenced by  the strident opposition from parents, and said her ideal would be to give every  school its preferred schedule.  </P> <P> But Weber said that with the district facing a possible funding shortage next  year, trustees could not justify spending additional money for transportation.  </P> <P> However, Roache said the board may have "created a monster" that could come  back to haunt administrators, much like a computerized bus transportation plan  that failed in the mid-1980s after costing the district more than $2 million.  </P></p>

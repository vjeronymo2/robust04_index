			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Observer: Authoritative Tuesday's announcement that Sir John Banham will become chairman of Tarmac early in the new year has set tongues wagging in the local government world. Banham is chairman of the Local Government Commission which is busy reorganising English local authorities. It is unlikely to have completed its task much before the end of next year. Although Banham has told the commission that he plans to see the review through to the end, this looks like an excellent early exit route for him. He hinted in the summer that he would resign if the government rejected the commission's recommendations and ministers are promising to do just that if, as expected, the commission decides to leave some counties unchanged.</p>

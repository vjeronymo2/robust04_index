			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Peace talks over Bosnia THE Bosnia peace proposals put forward in Geneva yesterday by the presidents of Serbia and Croatia are a far cry from the principles embodies in the Vance-Owen peace plan. Instead of a unitary state grouping 10 quasi-autonomous provinces, the plan advocated by Bosnia's neighbours would produce a confederal state of three ethnically-based republics for each of the warring communities, Serb, Croat and Moslem. This is an unhappy solution. But the violence of this inter-ethnic war makes it difficult to believe that the three communities can live in peace without some degree of separation. Since even Lord Owen concedes that his original plan is probably no longer feasible, the essential priority now is to press any opportunity of a genuinely negotiated settlement which has a reasonable chance of bringing an end to the fighting. The key question of principle which will confront these negotiations will be the relationship of Bosnia's constituent parts. The foundation of the Vance-Owen plan was that Bosnia-Herzegovina should remain a unitary state, so as to prevent it becoming a victim of expansion by Serbia and Croatia. But it is no longer obvious, in today's circumstances, that the unitary integrity of Bosnia as a centrally-governed country should be the absolute priority governing these negotiations. Moslem demands The Moslem community will undoubtedly continue to demand a sovereign state within existing borders. And that is what the outside world will demand as well, since Bosnia has been recognised as an independent state. As Lord Owen pointed out yesterday: 'There has been a lot of loose talk about partition. That is not acceptable to the international community.' Fortunately, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has accepted this principle. He said yesterday in Geneva that he would prefer three separate states, 'but if the international community wants us to stay together, then it should be a confederation'. But while it is an important matter of principle that the international community should not accept a three-way settlement which is merely the ante-chamber to partition and partial annexation by Serbia and Croatia, the top priority is an arrangement which has a reasonable chance of providing some peace and stability. These negotiations cannot avoid in some measure being seen as offering rewards for the brutality of ethnic cleansing, but any settlement must take due account of the facts of inter-ethnic civil war. This may mean a relatively loose relationship between the constituent parts. The over-riding requirement is that any negotiated settlement should provide some promise of peace and security for the Moslems; none of the three communities is an innocent by-stander, but in essence this has been a civil war of territorial expansion by the Serbs and the Croats, at the expense of the Moslems, and it is their security which must be safeguarded. Serb conquests It is not yet clear whether the proposals from the Serbs and the Croats can be the starting point for a reasonable negotiation. The facts on the ground are that the Serbs have effectively conquered over 70 per cent of the territory. If the Moslems are to have the makings of a viable share of Bosnia, the Serbs will have to surrender much of the ground they have captured. Mr Karadzic claimed yesterday that, under the Serb-Croat plan, the Moslems would be getting 'the best part of the country - over 30 per cent of the territory'. But the devil will be in the details, and it will not be easy to delimit a territory which is economically viable and self-contained, and which commands reasonable and secure access to the outside world. These negotiations will depend critically on continued pressure from the outside world, starting with the European Community. On Tuesday the EC summit in Copenhagen rightly resisted calls for a lifting of the arms embargo. But it must now carry through with its declared intention to provide extra troops to secure the Moslem safe havens. France yesterday undertook to provide 800 more troops. Other European partners should follow suit.</p>

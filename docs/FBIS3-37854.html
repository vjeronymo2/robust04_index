			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Tretyakov report: "`Canards' Flying in From Across </F> the Ocean. On Russian-Polish Relations"]    [Excerpts] Warsaw, 21 Feb--It is planned to hold a  Russian-Polish government-level conference under the motto "On  the Path to New Partnership" 23-25 February in Krakow. A  Russian delegation headed by Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev  will take part.    The aim of the conference is to assess the state of  Russian-Polish political and economic relations and elaborate  mechanisms to strengthen mutual cooperation. This meeting could  play an important role in eliminating obstructions in the way of  raising the effectiveness of our cooperation and finding  compromises for the many controversial questions which have  emerged following B. Yeltsin's visit to Poland last year.    However, the prospects of a warmer climate in Moscow-Warsaw  relations is evidently not to Washington's liking; judging by  its actions, it has not given up plans for creating a "cordon  sanitaire" around Russia.    We say nothing about how this is being done at the  diplomatic  level, where everything is always shrouded in mystery; but at  propaganda level such trends can be clearly outlined.    You do not need to go far to find examples. Literally on the  eve of the conference the influential WPROST periodical  published an article by a staffer of the U.S. Hoover Institute  in which the author, clearly distorting historical facts and  making vague hints, dumbfounds readers with the claim that  during World War II Krakow was saved from destruction by the  Hitlerite invaders not through the heroism of liberating Soviet  servicemen but as a result Vatican pressure on Berlin. [passage  omitted]    What is this -- the latest attempt to falsify history, and,  what is more, so obviously? Evidently not! This is big-league  stuff. It even includes elements of psychological warfare, aimed  at setting Slavs at loggerheads with each other by playing on  religious feelings, and even using blatant lies in the process.  They are also counting on the fact that there are few  eye-witnesses of these events left, and indeed that anti-Russian  sentiments, stirred up by certain political circles on the  Vistula, have been reinforced in Poland in the past four years.    To follow these "sensational historical facts" the U.S.  special services are putting new, "fresh" ones, into  circulation. A few days ago THE WASHINGTON POST published an  article which, citing a former high-ranking CIA staffer, claims  that during the 1980's, without the USSR's knowledge, the Poles  sold large consignments of state-of-the-art secret Soviet  weapons to the Americans to the tune of over $200 million. Some  types, notably the "Strela" missile launchers, were then sold by  the Americans to the Afghan mojahedin, who used them to shoot  down Soviet military aircraft.    Such insinuations by THE WASHINGTON POST have clearly placed  the Polish Ministry of National Defense in an impasse. Its  spokesmen were clearly shocked. Polish National Defense  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk called the article an act of  provocation.    Whereas in the first case the Americans were making snide  remarks about Poland, in the second this was obviously aimed at  Russia, counting on the fact that Moscow was bound to be annoyed  at the "perfidy" of its former Warsaw Pact ally.    It cannot be ruled out the Washington is currently going  through a period when its head is being turned with success  following the collapse of the USSR and the significant weakening  of Russia, which is busy with its own serious domestic problems.  It is trying to dictate its terms of play to the world even by  rewriting history and spreading obvious disinformation.    The question is solely one of whether our two neighboring  countries should be led by Washington and shut themselves off  from each other by a wall of hostility. Or whether they should  nevertheless be guided by pragmatism and reestablish relations  on the principles of partnership and mutually advantageous  cooperation. It looks as though the Russian-Polish conference  in Krakow will provide some answers to these difficult questions.</p>

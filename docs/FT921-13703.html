			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Serbs defy Croatia's authority SERB leaders from Croatia declared yesterday that the newly independent state no longer had authority on their territory and promised that Serbs would not form part of an independent Croatian state. Mr Goran Hadzic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serb region in eastern Croatia, said: 'Serbs from our region, at the price of our lives, will not remain in independent Croatia.' His remarks coincide with tensions in Bosnia-Hercegovina over plans for a referendum on independence there. President Alija Izetbegovic said parliament would approve the proposal this week. The federal military, with substantial munitions and air force industries in Bosnia, opposes the referendum. Meanwhile, sporadic violations of the latest ceasefire were reported yesterday.</p>

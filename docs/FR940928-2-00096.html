The proposed change continues to allow us of the STS in performing surveillance tests as documented by the NRC in SSER 2. However, additional manual tests independently from the STS will no longer be required. Since the proposed change does not add additional testing configurations or operating modes nor does it alter the plant design, it will not introduce any new failure modes. Thus, this proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Performance of the currently required manual testing of the NSPS logic independently from the STS system involves actuation logic for the reactor protection system, emergency core cooling systems (ECCS), reactor core isolation cooling system, automatic depressurization system, nuclear steam supply shutoff system, and the residual heat removal (RHR) system, including the shutdown cooling mode of operation. Performance of these tests requires these systems to be disabled to prevent unwanted system actuations.Thus, these systems are rendered inoperable during this testing. This also results in extensive temporary reconfiguration of systems and actuation instrumentation, including logic card removal, installation of signal simulators, disconnecting load drivers, etc. The removal of these safety systems from service to perform this testing results in reduced availability of RPS, ECCS, and RHR shutdown cooling systems during the plant outage. In addition to the intentional disabling of equipment to perform this testing, this testing has in the past led to safety system unavailability due to equipment damage caused by bending pin connectors and burning circuit cards out due to electrical shorting. Further, CPS has experienced unintentional equipment actuations resulting in unnecessary challenges to safety systems and the need to file licensee event reports with the NRC. IP has concluded that elimination of this currently required manual testing of the NSPS will have a positive impact on overall plant safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only margin of safety that could be negatively impacted by this proposed change is the potential for a functional failure in the NSPS logic going undetected. The manual tests proposed for deletion are only required to be performed at least once every four fuel cycles. In addition, the ability of the STS to detect functional failures of the NSPS logic as designed was verified as part of General Electric's independent design verification. Further, this capability was also verified as part of the preoperational test program as described in Section 14.2.12.1.62 of the CPS Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and subsequently during testing performing during the first four refueling outages. These manual tests did not identify any functional failures of the NSPS logic which would be expected to be detected by the STS per its design. All other functional failures undetectable by the STS have been identified as Untested Islands (UTIs). Thus, the original objectives of this testing have been satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change will continue to require testing at refueling outage intervals. As identified in USAR Section 7.2.1.1.4.8 and SSER 6, circuits which are not capable of being tested by the STS are identified as UTIs. General Electric and IP have identified, via analysis and manual testing, all UTIs in the functional NSPS logic and have established procedures for testing these UTIs. Periodic verification of the operability of these UTIs will continue to be performed at the frequencies recommended by the manufacturer as accepted by the NRC in SSER 6. These frequencies were established by the manufacturer based on mean time between failure analyses for the components in the associated circuits and may be as long as six years. Based on the above, the functional operability of the NSPS logic is adequately assured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From the above, IP has concluded that the proposed change will result in a net increase in the overall margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Leading Article: The challenge for the Labour party THREE WEEKS ago, the Labour party presented itself to the electorate as an alternative government; today it hardly resembles a viable opposition. The abrupt resignation of Mr Neil Kinnock has left it effectively leaderless, at a time when it should be reflecting upon why it has lost four general elections in a row. Its behaviour over the past week, as factions have quibbled over the rules for electing a new leader while trade union bosses have called the tune, has been dispiriting. The temptation is to write it off completely. This should be resisted. Democracy cannot function if there is no credible opposition. Yet while it is not certain that Labour can fulfil that role again, it is the largest opposition party Britain has. Some believe that that is a good starting point. The theory is that with 'one more heave' Labour will find itself back in government. It improved its position in 1987 and again this year, bringing 69 new MPs into the Commons. A new leader, a little tidying-up of policy here and there, perhaps some tentative overtures to the Liberal Democrats and next time the Conservatives will lose. It is necessary to reflect for only a moment upon the depth of the party's recent defeat to see that this is wishful thinking. At a time of deep recession, the Conservatives retained their previous share of the vote, while Labour was rejected by two-thirds of the voters. The lesson is unmistakable. Labour must restructure itself, or make way for a party that is better suited to the needs of the 1990s. The restructuring must be radical, perhaps more so than Labour can bear to contemplate. Unions out If it is to have any chance of winning a future election, it must first sever all formal connections with the unions. They may contribute to funds, as the AFL-CIO does for the Democrats in the US, but they should not participate ex officio in party affairs. This means no bloc vote at the annual conference, no union presence in Labour's policy-making counsels, and no union participation in the election of the leader. It is too late to avoid the latter absurdity in the present contest but if, as expected, Mr John Smith wins, his first action should be to start the process of de-unionisation. When it is completed he should re-submit himself for election. To achieve that would be revolutionary by the standards of five years ago, but by the needs of five years hence it might seem a mere beginning, a clearing of the decks. Labour's fundamental problem, which it faces in common with other European parties of the left, is that it may serve no political purpose in a post-socialist age. Its original interest group, the organised working-class, is a dwindling minority. Its former generators of ideas, the leading socialist thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, have been discredited by events and not replaced. Tentative embrace The result is that Labour's embrace of the market is tentative and uncertain. Its substitution of regulation for state ownership is disquieting. Its 1960s-style plans for redistributing incomes are indiscriminate and wasteful. It has failed to dump its Clause Four commitment to public ownership. Above all, it offers more government when taxpayers are unwilling to finance much, if any, more than the present amount. The Conservatives are moving in the opposite direction. By the time of the next election, they will have devolved much more administrative power to unelected school boards, trust hospital managements, housing associations and other sub-branches of 'Great Britain plc', all to be controlled by means of careful cost accounting at headquarters in Whitehall. If this great assemblage of quangos functions well, and gives people what they want, it will stick. Yet Labour may usefully offer an alternative approach to the governance of Britain. The Celtic regions may still want home rule. Local government by independent elected authorities, may seem worth reviving. A party that thus espouses democratic reforms, champions the consumer, outflanks the Tories in its zeal for competition, thinks afresh on the environment, and finds some room for targeted help to the poor may yet stand a chance. But there is a great deal of rethinking to do to get from here to there.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bandage boom boosts Seton to Pounds 4.8m THE BANDAGE business is booming for Seton Healthcare, inventor of the tubular bandage which yesterday revealed a 60 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.8m, on sales just 19 per cent higher at Pounds 36.2m. The sharp rise in profits for the year to February 28 was largely due to a series of acquisitions in the healthcare division. However, Mr Iain Cater, chief executive, said underlying sales growth in that business had been 14 per cent last year. The underlying growth in Seton's smaller sports and leisure division was 11 per cent. Seton, which came to the market in July 1990, raised the total dividend by 16 per cent on a pro forma basis to 5.1p, after the final pay-out of 3.6p. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose by 18 per cent to 14.7p, despite a Pounds 2.7m placing of 1.1m shares in November, and the issue of a further 409,000 as part of an acquisition. Seton purchased four companies - one after the year-end - at a total cost of Pounds 9.2m, pushing current borrowings up to about Pounds 7m. However, interest cover - which was 6.8 times at the end of February - was expected to rise to 9 times in the current year. Capital expenditure last year came to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m), with a further Pounds 7m (Pounds 5m) written off to goodwill. Seton pulled out of the US and France resulting in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.6m. However, Pounds 1.4m of this was due to the new accounting standard requiring goodwill charges previously written off to reserves to be included in the profit and loss account. The sport and leisure division held sales at about Pounds 5.5m, although pre-tax profits were down by 20 per cent to Pounds 563,000. COMMENT Forty years after founder Mr Ivor Stoller hitched his star to an elastic sock, the company proves it can still profit from injury. The brand-led acquisitions appear to be settling in well, with sales already 25 per cent ahead at Lyofoam. Further benefits are expected next year from the move to allow nurses to prescribe medications - a market which Seton has taken great pains to clinch with its support staff of 20 nurses. Expect more acquisitions towards the end of the year which, if the track record holds, should prove beneficial. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m, but the share price, on a prospective p/e of 17.8, is more than up with events.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Myakinnik: ``The `Gold Reserve' of </F> Russia is Not Only the Gold Itself, but Also Highly Productive  Russian Technologies. Why Then Are We Striving, as Usual, to Let  the West Take Them Over?'']    [Text] There's talk going around about the slimming down of  the Russian gold reserve. Be that as it may, it can be rather  rapidly supplemented if the government would finally show some  interest in the fate of our country's competitive technologies  for the production of gold from its raw materials. Otherwise the  know-how and inventions associated with them may become the  booty of the nouveau riche and without hindrance will turn up  abroad. The time has come to acknowledge that these technologies  also constitute a ``gold reserve'' of Russia, strengthening its  national economic security. It cannot be allowed that they share  the fate of the nonferrous and rare metals which have floated  abroad together with dollar earnings already exceeding 20  billion rubles.    An obvious paradox of our time: the results of the  scientific  and technical activity of our country's scientists are being  introduced in many regions of the world, but in Russia itself  they either remain unused or are not used at the proper level. A  fashionable variant of solution of economic, technical or other  problems is becoming the turning sometimes not to the best, but  only to foreign experience. The country may be seized by a sort  of foreign far-sightedness in which we remain oblivious to our  own scientific ``gold placers.''    In a letter to the editor from Valeriy Golovin, entitled  ``Gold in Waste Heaps,'' published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 9  December 1993, he reported that the Mnogovershinnnyy Mineral  Enrichment Combine in the Amur region when extracting gold and  silver from ore on a regular basis dispatches to waste heaps up  to 15% of the gold and up to 78% of the silver. As  it was  asserted in the publication, the lack of Russian technologies  does not make possible the undertaking of any intensive  exploitation of the Khakandzhin gold and silver deposit. The  administration of Khabarovsk Kray links gold production plans  for the immediate future only to reliance on the experience of  foreign specialists.    Thus, a formula for success in the economic rebirth of  different regions in Russia, seemingly attainable only by the  use of foreign technologies, is being defined. But, truly, such  a point of view can scarcely be elevated to the rank of a state  policy. However, only those who are wearing the blinds of  pro-Western far-sightedness fail to note that foreign companies  usually offer for sale technologies which, to put it mildly, are  of no economic value for their own countries.    However, the enormous interest which some foreign companies,  unlike national producers, are manifesting in our competitive  technologies, which in most cases until recently were kept  completely secret, is logical. These technologies,  understandably, can and must be an object of national pride, a  truly golden Russian asset, the basis for the restoration of the  national economy and civilized economic and scientific-technical  cooperation with foreign countries.    One such technology was developed under the direction of  Academician Boris Laskorin. This is a sorption leaching  technology for extracting gold and silver from ores, the  so-called ``resin in pulp'' method. Due to its universality and  high efficiency it became the basis for developing technological  schemes for the reworking of raw material containing gold from  different deposits in the former USSR. Here the experience of  production workers and the knowledge of the inventors of the  technology were brought together.    Nowhere in the world is there raw material containing gold  which is identical in its composition. And for this reason  alone, even knowing the method itself, its optimum application  is virtually impossible without the scientific-technical  oversight of its inventors, a statement which can be made,  however, relative to the use of any high technology. As is  confirmed precisely by the situation prevailing at the  Mnogovershinnyy Mineral Enrichment Combine, where the production  workers through their own efforts probably could not accumulate  that experience and knowledge which would be adequate for the  optimum exploitation of the technology, which also evidently  served as a reason for seeking assistance from abroad.    The many years of experience in using this technology  confirms its high productive indices. For example, at the  Muruntau gold production enterprise in the Kyzylkum alone, where  the base technology with the participation of the inventors of  the method was introduced as early as 1968, up to 94% of  the  gold is being extracted, and this in a deposit with an extremely  low gold content. For richer ores the percentage of gold  extraction is usually still higher.    In addition, a quarter century after its development the  base  technology is constantly being improved and has been perfected  both in the laboratory and under commercial conditions at seven  gold-producing enterprises in the former Soviet Union. The  accumulated experience is unique and the new technological  solutions are still protected as inventions.    Precisely Russian gold technology has opened the way to the  production of gold from deposits regarded as poor, unsuited for  commercial exploitation. After reexamining the conditions of  gold and silver minerals, with allowance for use of the Boris  Laskorin technology, the confirmed geological reserves of ore in  gold-bearing deposits for their input into the economic cycle of  the country increase in many cases by a factor of 10-12. Such  deposits can be exploited at once, leaving for future  generations the richer strategic geological gold and silver  reserves.    Confirmation of the high competitiveness of our country's  gold technology by foreign specialists became possible only  after the stamp of secrecy was removed. The first publications  on Russian technology for the complex reworking of gold-bearing  raw material created broad interest throughout the world. When  mineral exploiters became familiar with our method  representatives of the leading companies of the gold-producing  countries, that is, Great Britain, South Africa, United States,  France and Brazil, as reported by Boris Laskorin, all gave the  highest marks to the ``resin in pulp'' technology. To be sure,  however, our know-how remained for them a commercial secret.    In turn, as long as this Russian method remained a secret  foreign specialists used a different technology -- the so-called  ``charcoal in pulp'' method. A technical-economic comparison  shows that the advantages of the ``resin in pulp'' method are  indisputable in all respects: gold extraction is increased by  5-12%, the expenditure of costly reagents, the time  required  for processing the raw material, amount of engineering equipment  and consumption of electric power are all reduced. The capital  expenditures on the construction of a plant also are  considerably lower.    The leading gold producing companies in the world, being  guided by the obvious economic advantages from use of the  competitive Russian technology, are intelligently acquiring it,  even giving up their own ambitions. Our technology, for example,  already is being exploited by the British Lonro company in  Zimbabwe; the national JCI company in South Africa also is close  to this, in a contract with which the Ministry of Atomic Energy  of the Russian Federation there is a provision for  commercialization of the rights of the inventors of this  technology as being intellectual property (know-how and  inventions). A number of key gold producing companies of other  foreign countries also are interested in economic cooperation  and in these countries through the Soyuzpatent Patent Attorneys  Association juridical protection of this technology is being  ensured and the patent office in South Africa has issued a  patent for it: a document giving exclusive rights to Russia in  the territory of South Africa.    It is possible, to be sure, not to analyze and not to take  note of this problem, but simply put in the hands of the market  economy, which sooner or later will put everything in its place.  But, possibly it is necessary that the interested federal  control agencies in the Russian Federation pay heed to the  prevailing situation with the use of high competitive  technologies both in Russia and in the CIS countries and attempt  to organize such a state scientific-technical, economic  (investment, tax) and juridical strategy for a breakthrough, the  fundamental thesis of which should be the fact that the gold  reserve of the country and competitive gold extraction  technologies constitute an important factor in the economic  rebirth of Russia and the preservation of its national economic  security.    A radical solution of this problem will serve as a basis for  an attentive comparative analysis of that which is of value both  in our country and abroad. It also probably can assist in  extinguishing the Russian debt to foreign countries, which  according to recent data exceeded the 60-billion dollar mark,  not to mention the difficulties associated with debts within the  country. But since debts must be paid off even today, a solution  also must be found at once.</p>

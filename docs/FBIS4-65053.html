At this conference Mr. Benbitour  presented a detailed report on the objective of his tour. He  said: We have come to Brussels to explain the contents of the  Algerian political and economic program to European circles and  also to brief European political and financial circles on the  progress of the talks with the International Monetary Fund on  the rescheduling of Algeria's debts. We will also inform them  that we have drawn up a program for economic revival. Benbitour  added: We are hoping for comprehensive cooperation with Europe  without having to ignore the financial aspect. [as heard]    On the first day of his visit to Belgium, Benbitour met  European Commission President Jacques Delors and (Manuel Marin),  the commissioner in charge of cooperation and development and  contacts with Belgian and European financial and business  circles. After these meetings, the Algerian finance minister  declared that he was given a very encouraging welcome and  presented with a serious readiness to support Algeria. He also  stressed the determined will he found at the European Union to  offer Algeria significant financial and political support to  help it implement its plan for economic revival and employment.    Regarding his meetings with representatives of the world of  finance and business, Benbitour talked about the importance of  the messages that needed to be conveyed to the economic  operators that had been offered opportunities on the Algerian  market; he also stressed the importance of partnership.    Benbitour is expected to leave later for Washington, the  third leg of his tour, where he will meet IMF and World Bank  officials and U.S. financial authorities.

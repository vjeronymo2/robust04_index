			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Fast train to China - Chris Patten faces his moment of truth in determining how Hong Kong is governed A familiar face flashed briefly across British TV screens last week, just as the monetary whirlwind was gathering speed. So familiar that many viewers will hardly have noticed it. Six months ago, after all, the sight was an everyday one: Mr Chris Patten, then chairman of the Conservative party, standing beside the prime minister. The sad sequel is well known. Mr Patten's triumph as party manager was marred by the loss of his own parliamentary seat, and he was sent off to govern Hong Kong. So what was he doing breakfasting with the prime minister, who surely had other things than Hong Kong on his mind last week? He had returned to London because in Mr Patten's judgment the affairs of Hong Kong merited a spot of prime ministerial attention. You are probably thinking that things in Hong Kong must be pretty bad if the British government had to be bothered with them in such a week. Not a bit of it. The colony is booming. The deep gloom into which it was thrown by events in Tiananmen Square on June 4 1989 has almost entirely dissipated. For those events, traumatic though they were, did not usher in the long era of repression and retreat that many expected. The Chinese central government remains essentially authoritarian, but it has allowed capitalism to proceed apace in the provinces, and nowhere faster than in Guangdong, the province that borders Hong Kong. As China's economy grows, Hong Kong has thrived as never before, being the conduit for foreign trade and investment. That leaves Mr Patten in a much happier situation as governor than he would be now as a British cabinet minister. Stamp duty and other indirect forms of taxation are pouring in. The public sector is showing a healthy surplus. He himself, as the first politician to govern the colony in its 150-year history, has, according to opinion polls, won almost universal popularity. He has done this by his direct, meet-the- people approach - a contrast with the aloof dignity adopted by previous governors. So why should he need to bother Mr Major? In the first place he knows from personal experience that opinion polls are fickle and honeymoons do not last. A fresh face, a glamorous teenage daughter, a witticism here and there can make you popular for a few months. But soon comes the moment when you have to take real decisions. These can seldom measure up to people's hopes, and if they are to make any real difference they are bound to upset vested interests. Mr Patten knows, from his experience as a junior Northern Ireland minister in the mid-1980s, that when interests are sharply polarised it is not only impossible to please everybody but dangerous to please anyone, since one side's admiration is enough to damn you with the other. The moment of truth he has set himself is now two weeks away. On October 7 he will address the colony's legislature, and lay out his programme for the last five years of British rule in Hong Kong. The date falls in the middle of the Tory party conference, but even so Mr Patten's officials are hoping he will grab a few headlines in the UK and locally. Of course he can only achieve that if he keeps the content of the speech a surprise, but he expects it to cause considerable 'reverberations', and wanted to be sure of full support from Mr Major before finalising the draft. Reverberations will no doubt come from many quarters, and notably from Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats, who, having won most of the directly elected seats in last year's elections to the Legislative Council (LegCo), believe they should now join the Executive Council (ExCo). (The former body has to approve all legislation and the colony's budget, though it has no power to initiate expenditure. The latter is an advisory body consisting of permanent civils servants, plus some appointed pillars of the community.) Mr Patten, though he certainly has more respect than his predecessors did for Mr Lee's democratic credentials, has dropped several hints that he does not see things this way. In his eyes the logic of the Hong Kong constitution, and the best hope of enabling it to function democratically under the Basic Law after 1997, lies in a clear separation of powers between executive and legislature. He believes the opposition would be better advised to concentrate on broadening the electoral base of LegCo and using it to check and supervise the government, rather than on securing representation in ExCo, which is in any case only an advisory body, not a cabinet. The reverberations that count, however, will be those in Beijing, to which Mr Patten will make his first visit as governor immediately after the speech. The Chinese have already given many signs of displeasure about his appointment, which they have taken, rightly or wrongly, as a sign that Britain's Hong Kong policy has changed and will be less accommodating than it was. Indeed, some Chinese officials have made a direct link between the financing of Hong Kong's new airport and their fears that Mr Patten will appoint people to ExCo whom they regard as subversives, such as Mr Lee. On that point Mr Patten has called their bluff, by agreeing to let the airport be financed essentially in the way Beijing says it prefers. Although Hong Kong officials believe this is a less good deal for Hong Kong, they do not see the issue as important enough to give China extra leverage over political decisions. The crunch issue, however, is likely to be the manner of election, and hence the composition, of LegCo after 1995. Up to now both Britain and China have set considerable store by the notion known as the 'through train', under which the LegCo elected in 1995 would remain in office through the handover of sovereignty and up to 1999. The Chinese interpret this as giving them a veto over its composition. Mr Patten is keeping his own cards close to his chest. He cannot increase the number of directly elected seats (20) without China's consent, but he could expand the 'functional constituencies' which elect 30 members, and many of which at present have small electorates. He could also, more radically, allow the 'election committee', a new body which is to choose the remaining 10 members, to be elected in its turn by the people - like the electoral college in US presidential elections. This would create a LegCo half of whose members would be democratically chosen. It is certainly not what the Chinese want. In their eyes the purpose of the election committee is to enable the executive to pack LegCo with its own nominees. But it would not be incompatible with the letter of the Basic Law. If that, or something like it, is what Mr Patten announces on October 7, stand by for reverberations of a seismic order. China will probably threaten to derail the train and hold elections for a new LegCo in 1997, using its own rules. That thought would have been enough to deter previous governors, but Mr Patten is not easily intimidated. He knows that China's rulers hold most of the cards, but he still has nearly five years in which to convince them that Hong Kong itself also has a hand to play.</p>

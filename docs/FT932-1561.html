			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: BTU tax RIP THE ENERGY tax which President Clinton announced in February was that rare thing: a tax that would raise money and improve economic efficiency at the same time. Four months of special pleading later, the chances that it will do either are fading fast. Mr Clinton's difficulties hold important lessons for governments chasing the same prize. When first unveiled, the BTU (British thermal unit) tax was the cornerstone of Mr Clinton's deficit-cutting package, intended to raise Dollars 72bn over five years. The final version has yet to emerge from Congress. But the idea of taxing fuels on their thermal content has already been dropped. So too has the revenue figure, now likely to be some two-thirds lower. What went wrong? As with much of the Clinton plan, the BTU tax began life as a careful compromise, less green - and trickier to collect - than the carbon tax the purists would have wanted, but apparently more likely to survive. Unfortunately, the horse trading did not end there. Both efficiency and clarity of purpose were the losers. Increasing the price of fuels with a tax improves economic efficiency to the extent that it makes people pay the full social cost of using the fuel. Not all fuels impose the same costs. If a tax is to capture the differences between them, it must be shamelessly selective, hurting some energy users more than others. The problem is finding a way to sell such a seemingly capricious tax. As Mr Clinton discovered, the result can be a costly mess. Complicated taxes are usually the result of pinning several distinct aims to a single mast. In the case of the BTU tax, Mr Clinton tried to meet an environmental objective, while giving into the demands of 'dirty' fuel lobbies and holding on to future revenues. The predictable result was an exemption-ridden monstrosity, too complicated to collect or, indeed, to defend. When he abandoned the BTU tax altogether on June 9, it was a mercy killing. Finding a replacement seems just a local US difficulty. Some kind of generalised fuel levy is likely, along with further budget cuts to make up the revenue shortfall. Both are clearly desirable in their own right. For environmentalists, however, a uniform tax is a blunt instrument, since it fails to match tax paid to relative damage done. This is why non-Americans should pause. There may be little new in the sight of yet another US president trying to introduce the kind of fuel taxes which have long been accepted in other OECD countries. But Mr Clinton began on a fresher path, which many in Japan and the EC wish to follow. His ambition was to combine an environmentally nuanced idea of efficiency with cutting the budget deficit. After the death of the BTU tax, governments may well wonder whether both can be tackled at once.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Gardening: Traditional edge to the Sloane-Walleys' year - Robin Lane Fox looks in on the festive season at the Old Rectory Down in Sussex Old Rectory, Julian and Veronica Sloane-Walley have spent a wet and windy week recovering from their annual bout of competitive present giving. They are veterans by now of seven years' country living since the move from Onslow Gardens in Chelsea at an unwise point in the property market in 1986. By tradition, each competes with the other for the least expected present which will be Truly Useful in the coming year. Julian fortunately had resisted the temptations of the main window of Peter Jones, the up-market department store in London's Sloane Square. It was not so much the sight of Her Ladyship's Kitchen Garden (which appeared to amount to a packet of parsley seeds, a plastic top and a nostalgic box for Pounds 2.99) as the Natural Herbal Revitaliser at Pounds 1.95. It was advertised for the Weary Gardener who is Behind with the Weeding, Crooked with the Edges, Late with Pruning and has Grass in the Path . . . Maturity has not always brought marital harmony to the Sloane-Walleys' gardening and there are times when Julian wishes Veronica was not so damnably green. Apart from three proper meals a day, he insists on little in life except exemption from equestrian duties, properly clipped edges to the lawn and weed-free paths. He often thinks Veronica is being deliberately awkward when she refuses to use weed killers 'in the country.' This year, he believes he has finally outwitted the yearly problem of the Old Rectory path. While visiting his bank in Mayfair, Julian happened to notice London's most familiar plant: the drills, compressor and lorry of the capital's leading Irish engineer, whose workmen were hacking up the pavement when not in a tabloid-and-Thermos mode. A quick dialogue through the window of the Volvo established that the old paving slabs were going nowhere in particular and, despite their weight, could make the short journey into the Sloane-Walley boot at a mere Pounds 1 apiece. Mayfair is not Onslow Gardens, but Julian has now ferried 28 priceless old paving stones in three separate runs and stored them in the lower garage at the Old Rectory while managing to persuade Veronica that he has to commute by car, not train, at this time of year because British Rail is being disrupted by gales and the hazard of twigs on the track. With Network SouthEast, alibis are easy. The paving will make an excellent path and stand as a personal coup: Julian's recognition of Veronica's nostalgia for the London pavements, a nostalgia increased by seven years with the children's pony in an over-brokered corner of Sussex. At least she can now walk out on a carpet of old Mayfair, if not Chelsea. And when the slabs are pointed properly, there will be no need to argue about spraying and applying weed-killer while Veronica is out shopping at the local freezer centre. Freezer shopping, in fact, has taken a different role in the Sloane-Walley year. In January, Veronica became fed up with all the talk of recession and deided to earn her keep by fee-paying demonstrations. (Julian did annoy her by asking if they were to be demonstrations of pony management by a former Londoner, as neither of them is proud of the fact that the old family pony, Peter Jones, has suffered twice from mud fever since the rain started again this summer). Veronica had set her sights on cooking, in the belief that country dinner parties are now dominated by exactly the same recipes from the book by Raymond Blanc. Since its launch this spring, Onslow Entrees has been a roaring success. Half the housewives in Sussex turn out to be as fed up during commuting hours as she is, and the sessions have developed a pleasantly therapeutic give-and-take. Veronica takes the fees and many of the clients give their best recipes - which she can then re-cycle to customers on the next week's course. In July, she suffered the fate of every small business nowadays which starts to sprout green shoots: an uninvited visit from the health and safety inspector. The kitchen passed muster, largely because she had sent Harvey and Nichols, her pair of Jack Russell terriers, away to her mother for the week before inspection. The problem was the plumbing. Julian had been adamant that he did not want a mass invasion of his home's WC by fee-paying customers, and insisted they must use the outdoor lavatory adjoining the tool shed, a stone's throw from the kitchen door. But under Section 391A of the Health and Safety (Bottomley) Act of 1990, it is not permissible for commercial premises to offer toilet facilities in a detached or separated building unless that building is connected to the point of office egress by an approved shelter. Veronica tried to butter up the inspector, but he only became more truculent when she gave him a quick sketch of a possible wooden pergola on the back of an Onslow menu. Then he struck a mortal blow by asking if the rectory was a listed building. In a fit of domestic exhibitionism, Julian had recently drawn the arguable merits of its late-Victorian facade to the local conservation officer, and had succeeded in having it listed grade II on the ground that this would enhance its market value. This meant that Veronica's plan would have to go before the local council's planning committee before HM Inspector could clear it for health. In August, the committee rejected the pergola on the grounds that it would be standing in a listed context and, in keeping with Sussex period vernacular, the connecting passage would have to be tile-hung. Veronica has already written to John Major about idiotic legislation and the urgent need for his party to prune most of the undergrowth it has have introduced. She did, however, wear her other hat and point out to the planners that the Old Rectory garden had undergone extensive landscaping without any mention of 'period vernacular.' Since she now opened it on a Gardening Sunday, she regarded herself as fully entitled to build a pergola, not a tile-hung extension, in order to meet the objections to her unobjectionable loo. The planning committee was predictably weary, but called for a planting scheme before it could consider a decision. In October, Veronica sketched in her suggestions. Old Sloane-Walley favourites like rose Danse du Feu joined newcomers like the yellow-leaved choisya Sundance and a backbone of pyracantha Golden Cheer for evergreen colour in winter. She added 'VSW Fecit' to her artist's impression and sent it off, expecting to be able to give Julian the unexpected present of planning approval on Christmas day. Five days after Christmas, she received a buff envelope. The environmental health department was satisfied, with the proviso that the pyracantha was a berry-bearing shrub and must be certified as non-poisonous; but the chairman of the planning committee had the cheek to write that he himself was a keen gardener; that he had kept abreast of the art for years by reading the Weekend FT; and that every one of her proposals was unsuitable - vulgar, to be frank - in a grade II setting. Veronica wrote at once to the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey - where she first saw the plants - and asked for a letter supporting her choices. In her annoyance, she also saw the chance for a New Year present which Julian probably wanted most and expected least. For years, she had banned Julian from having the FT on a Saturday because, she said, it belonged in the office, not the home. She has changed tack, wanting ammunition against the planners; as from today, she has cancelled the Telegraph and given Julian a year's subscription to the paper he has wanted for years. She, meanwhile, will take the chance to discover how on earth, in this day and age, a Sussex planning committee can dare to tell a Sloane-Walley they are not being horticulturally correct.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ramallah -- Dr. George Habash, secretary general of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP],  stressed that the Palestinian national struggle entered a new  political phase after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord.  The most prominent feature of this phase is the diversion of  part of the Palestinian bourgeoisie from the national program.    In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash added: We  are preparing ourselves and are working on the basis of a  program of comprehensive opposition to the Madrid-Oslo program  and its numerous and Islamic parties without ignoring the  international link, be they international institutions or  progressive organizations, parties, and forces supportive of our  rights and struggle.    Dr. Habash affirmed that the future struggle will consist of  two parts: First, continuing the struggle in all forms and with  all available means. Second, opposing the accord and its  implementation on the ground with the aim of foiling it.  [passage omitted]    Dr. Habash emphasized that his opposition to the self-rule  authority will be based on political, popular, and social  struggle and all possible democratic forms.    On whether Arab states, especially Syria, were exerting  pressure on the 10 factions, Habash said: The current situation  of the official Arab system and the state of total collapse that  it has reached, particularly following the second Gulf war,  constitutes by itself the greatest pressure on us -- as  rejectionist forces -- to be incorporated into the U.S. orbit.  This situation, however, does not preclude the existence of  Arab regimes that reject or oppose the U.S. concept of peace  despite their limited role and effect.    Habash affirmed: Despite differences in views and positions,  Syria is not exerting any pressure on us. On the contrary, it  is showing understanding for these positions, which stem from  the nature and dangers of this accord.    Dr. Habash said: For more than a year now the PLO leadership  has stopped paying the PFLP its allocations from the Palestine  National Fund. The cause for this is not the financial crisis.  It preceded the crisis. By doing so, it is using the same  weapon which Arab and Western countries are using against it.    Dr. Habash added: Nationalist allies in Arab regimes provide  us with periodic aid, which is very modest and does not meet the  requirements of the struggle.</p>

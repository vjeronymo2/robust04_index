			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: Among top 10 for equality Sir, One further invaluable thing Robert Horton will bring with him to Railtrack ('Hatchet honed to a softer point', July 31/August 1) is a solid commitment to equal opportunities. From interviewing him at BP for the European Commission video, 'The glass ceiling breakers', I'd rate him in my list of top 10 males in industry, along with BT's Iain Vallance, who really believe companies will be more successful if women are treated, trained and promoted on equal terms with male colleagues.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Book Review: Man who put a charge into General Electric CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL By Noel Tichy and Stratford Sherman Doubleday, Dollars 24, 374 pages THE NEW GE By Robert Slater Business One Irwin, Dollars 24.95, 295 pages Ask America's top business leaders which of their peers they admire most and the name Jack Welch would almost certainly win the biggest vote. Since taking over as chairman of General Electric in 1981, at the age of 45, this restless, contentious and charismatic individual has engineered a revolution in the running of one of the country's largest, most conservative and complex business groups. The financial results speak for themselves. GE has enjoyed strong productivity and earnings growth for much of the past decade, and its share price has more than quintupled. Yet all around it, former giants of US industry have been falling flat on their faces, victims of inertia and complacency. Control Your Destiny Or Someone Else Will - one of Welch's favourite aphorisms and the title of Tichy and Sherman's book - could serve as an epitaph for Robert Stempel, ousted last year as chairman of slow-to-change General Motors. It might yet apply to John Akers, chairman of IBM, which on Tuesday reported the biggest annual loss in corporate history. The volume by academic Tichy and journalist Sherman is significant because it is the first scholarly attempt to pin down the secret of GE's success. Tichy, a professor of organisation at the University of Michigan School of Business, can speak with authority about GE, since he has had a ring-side seat at the Welch transition, both as a long-time consultant to the company and as head of its executive training school for two years. But this hardly makes him an impartial observer. There appear to be three main elements to Welch's success. The first was his realisation at the start of the 1980s that all was not well with GE, even though the company was one of the most admired in the US. Welch, a brilliant entrepreneur who had revitalised profits in every GE division he had run, saw that the conglomerate's hodgepodge of businesses was ill-equipped to compete in a world of intensifying global competition. He ruled that henceforth every GE business must be first or second in its sector or face disposal. His second great achievement was having the guts to stick by this strategy in the early 1980s as GE laid off thousands of workers, cut layers of management and sold 125 businesses, while critics declared that he was trying to mend a fine company which did not need fixing. He has never entirely shed the label 'Neutron Jack', which the press pinned on him at that time. The third, which has taken place over the past five years, has been a transformation more subtle, but arguably of far greater long-term importance, in GE's business culture. Welch has been trying to create an organisation which embraces change as inevitable, rather than resisting it; where information flows freely around the group, rather than being jealously hoarded; and where employees are given important powers to control their working environment. These ideas have been encapsulated best in 'work-out' - a programme begun in 1989 which involves small groups of employees from all levels of a business getting together to thrash out common problems. They are encouraged to speak freely, with the promise of no retribution from managers. Worker participation in continuous improvement is hardly a new idea. What is novel is the sheer scale and commitment of GE's endeavour. For example, managers presented with ideas for change are required to say quickly whether they support them or not. There can be no fudging. Tichy and Sherman give a helpful, clear account of all these developments, illustrating their case with interesting case studies of individual businesses which have been turned around. But the book is marred by being too reverential, devoting remarkably little space to the weak spots in Welch's record. Tichy and Sherman do acknowledge, but do not delve deep into, the fact that in 1985 the revolution had become so unpopular that Welch 'slowed the very process of organisational change that he was so urgently trying to accelerate. His efforts to change a corporation that most people still regarded as healthy caused deep emotional trauma.' Nor is there any substantial mention of GE's problems in running the NBC television network, which ranked first in the US ratings when Welch acquired it in 1986 but is now third. Are creative businesses poor candidates for the GE treatment? The NBC saga is, however, covered at length by Slater, a journalist and prolific author, whose racy and generally favourable account of the Welch era is descriptive rather than analytical, yet touches on areas where the management may be open to criticism. It is Tichy's contention that Jack Welch will go down in history as one of two 20th-century business leaders remembered for their ideas, alongside Alfred Sloan, who thought up the modern corporate management structure when he put together General Motors in the 1920s and 1930s. This seems unlikely. For the ideas Welch espouses are either specific to GE or interesting variations in the general stew of modern management theories, which holds that the successful 21st-century business will need to be participatory, not authoritarian. Given the track record so far, what Welch will be remembered for is his remarkable ability to articulate a vision for GE and then execute it successfully. It calls for an unusual combination of intelligence, leadership and communications skills, which cannot be learnt from reading GE primers. Just ask Robert Horton, who rushed into the chairmanship of British Petroleum with a revolutionary manifesto for cultural change that owed a lot to Welch's track record at GE. Two years later he was ousted in a boardroom coup.</p>

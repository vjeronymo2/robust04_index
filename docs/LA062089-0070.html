			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO EMPHASIZE VERIFICATION MEASURES AT NEW MISSILE TALKS IN GENEVA  </P> <P> In one of several modifications to U.S. proposals for a treaty reducing  long-range nuclear weapons, President Bush announced Monday that the United  States will propose speeding up discussions on verification measures to police  compliance with any new accord.  </P> <P> Bush held out the possibility of putting some of the verification measures into  effect even before U.S. and Soviet negotiators reach agreement at the Strategic  Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva.  </P> <P> The President plans to outline this and other relatively minor changes in the  U.S. bargaining position to congressional leaders today, a senior  Administration official said. U.S. negotiators then will lay out Bush's new  proposals Wednesday at the first formal negotiating session in Geneva since  Bush took office in January.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Round Under Way  </P> <P> A new round of talks opened Monday with an 80-minute procedural meeting, after  which Richard R. Burt, who succeeded Max M. Kampelman as chief U.S. negotiator,  said he had described Bush's "overall approach to arms control, emphasizing the  President's commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war."  </P> <P> Burt, former U.S. ambassador to West Germany, added that both sides have agreed  to "maintain the confidentiality of the negotiations" by not publicizing  details and their give-and-take.  </P> <P> The new Soviet negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, pronounced himself "satisfied"  with the first meeting. Burt described his Soviet counterpart, who replaced  Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, as a "low-key problem solver."  </P> <P> In Washington, several Administration officials said that tentative decisions  on some of the major obstacles to a strategic arms treaty, such as whether to  abandon U.S. opposition to mobile land-based missiles, also were made over the  weekend by Bush and his top aides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congress to Be Consulted  </P> <P> They will be the basis for consultations with Congress members in coming days  before being "fine tuned" and announced over the next week or two, they said.  </P> <P> "We want to see what Congress is prepared to do," said another senior official.  </P> <P> Bush's statement Monday suggested that the Administration is prepared to  abandon its opposition to mobile land-based missiles.  </P> <P> Bush repeatedly stressed the goal of greater "stability" in the strategic  balance. And one way to enhance stability is to permit mobile missiles, because  they are relatively secure from enemy attack. There is less incentive to "use  them or lose them" in time of crisis, in the jargon of nuclear strategists,  than there is for fixed missiles, whose silos are more vulnerable to surprise  attack.  </P> <P> Congress is split on which kind of mobile missile to build, the 10-warhead MX  that would be moved on railroad cars, or the single-warhead Midgetman that  would be carried on truck-like vehicles. The Soviets already operate both types  of weapons, but the United States has neither.  </P> <P> The Administration has asked Congress for funds to deploy the MX on rails while  continuing to develop the Midgetman. The Administration wants authorization for  one or both weapons before it changes its opposition to mobile missiles at the  negotiating table, lest it remain without either weapon while the Soviets are  free to deploy both.  </P> <P> The White House has not yet begun such consultations with Congress, however,  according to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.).  </P> <P> Aspin said that the Administration could get a commitment of full support for  both the MX and the Midgetman. But he urged the Administration to craft a new  strategic arms proposal "to ensure that if we don't build one kind of mobile,  the Soviets couldn't either."  </P> <P> In its recent reviews of arms control policy, the White House has been looking  for a new approach to the arms talks that would place a Bush stamp on the U.S.  position and take advantage of the Soviets' apparent willingness to accept arms  reductions.  </P> <P> Bush said in his announcement that much of the 400 pages of draft treaty  already negotiated would stand. But he added that "modifications will be  proposed in some cases," and he "reserved the right to introduce new  initiatives aimed at further enhancing security and strategic stability."  </P> <P> He emphasized the importance of agreeing on procedures to verify compliance  with a new treaty.  </P> <P> "The United States will also propose that the two sides make a special effort  to agree on, and to begin implementing as soon as possible, certain  verification and stability measures drawn from proposals that both sides have  already advanced," the President said.  </P> <P> Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, insisted that this does not mean that  verification will have priority at the talks, and he emphasized that agreement  on such measures is not a condition for completing a treaty.  </P> <P> The emphasis on verification stems from the Senate's suspicions that the  Soviets may cheat on the recent treaty banning ground-launched, medium-range  nuclear missiles. The Senate ratified the treaty last year, but only after  extensive debate.  </P> <P> "We don't want a START treaty dead on arrival on Capitol Hill," said Ronald F.  Lehman, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  </P> <P> But critics fear that the focus on verification, whether intentional or not,  will divert attention from the remaining obstacles to a treaty.  </P> <P> In Geneva, Nazarkin, the Soviet negotiator, said that from the Soviet  perspective, "issue number one" at the current session would be linking the  proposed 50% cuts in the long-range missiles to the strict observance of the  1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.  </P> <P> Toth reported from Washington and Tuohy from Geneva.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TALKS: STARTING AGAIN  </P> <P>  U.S.-Soviet talks on cutting long-range nuclear forces have resumed in Geneva  after a six-month recess.  </P> <P> THE PLAYERS:  </P> <P> New chief delegates are Richard Burt and Yuri Nazarkin. Burt, a military expert  and former U.S. ambassador to West Germany, replaces Max Kampelman. Nazarkin,  who has been Soviet envoy at 40-nation Conference on Disarmament dealing with  chemical weapons, replaces Yuli Vorontsov.  </P> <P> THE AIM:  </P> <P> START -- or Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -- is intended to cover nuclear  weapons with which superpowers can strike each other's home territory,  including: sea-and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers.  </P> <P> In this round, delegates likely to first review agreements contained in  400-page draft text that commits both sides to cuts of up to 50% in strategic  nuclear arsenals.  </P> <P> PREVIOUS PROGRESS:  </P> <P> Among the agreements in earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 6,000 nuclear  warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles -- missiles and bombers -- for each side.  </P> <P> STICKING POINTS:  </P> <P> Among remaining disputes are mobile land-based missiles, the counting of cruise  missiles carried by bombers, sea-launched cruise missiles and the Pentagon's  space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars," missile defense  system.  </P> <P> NEW PROPOSALS:  </P> <P> U.S. to suggest speeding up discussions on verification measures and putting  some of those measures into effect before final agreement on a treaty is  reached.  </P> <P> SOURCE: Associated Press, New York Times  </P></p>

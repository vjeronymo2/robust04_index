The Unha combined general bureau on trade, with a goal of  quadrupling the export volume this year as against last year, is  improving the quality of processing and introducing diverse  embroidered patterns catering to the tastes of the customers  while remodeling the equipment of the factories under it.    The Tongdaewon garment factory has taken a long stride in  equipping itself with complete sets of up-to-date facilities  capable of producing 100,000 high-class ready-made suits a year.    The Korea garment company of the Pyongyang Municipal General  Bureau of Garment Industry is expanding its export-oriented  production base and effecting a new turn in garment processing  trade this year.    The Mangyongdae garment factory, the Pyongyang children's  clothing factory and the Pyongyang Changgwang garment factory  under the company are topping their daily production quotas for  coats and jumpers by more than 50 percent.    With the application on a new computerized embroidery art,  the company has doubled the productivity of embroideries and  exported first-class suits, shirts, padded coats and gloves,  winning popularity from the importing countries.    The Pyongyang alcohol factory, the Odaejin export fisheries  station and other units have overfulfilled their January plans  for the production of export goods more than 10 days ahead of  schedule.</p>

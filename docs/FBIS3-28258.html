Other funds will also come from state-owned and private  banks  as well as from sales of bonds, Pranoto added.    Half of the U.S. $30 billion will be used to finance power  distribution network projects, the director general revealed.    "Power projects are expected to meet the people's need for  electricity which will continue to rise in the coming ten  years," he said.    Indonesia's need for electrical power will increase by  [figures indistinct] percent annually in the next decade. By  1995, the country needs to double its electrical capacity from  the present 11,500 megawatts to nearly 23,000 megawatts.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Tennis: Master of mind games AT FIRST glance it would seem that Jim Courier, the world No. 1 and top seed, has been dealt a tough hand for the 106th Wimbledon Championship which starts on Monday. His first opponent, Markus Zoecke of Germany, stands 1.96 meters in his socks and delivers one of the fastest serves in the business. But the rest of his game is brittle. Courier would then meet the winner of the section containing the No 16 seed David Wheaton, a semi-finalist last year, and two former champions, John McEnroe and Pat Cash. If he survives, there will be in his path either the tall Frenchman Guy Forget, seeded 9, or the diminutive American, Michael Chang, seeded 7. Finally, his prospective semi-final opponent is the No. 4 seed, Boris Becker, three times the champion, and a finalist six times in the last seven years. Chatting with Jim this week on the Centre Court, I was impressed by his quiet confidence. He points out: 'Everyone talks about the importance of the serve on the fast grass and assumes that guys like Becker, Edberg and Stich will have it all their own way. But you have to break the serve to win, so service return and ground strokes are really more important. After all I got to the quarters last year and so did Andre (Agassi). I'm a better player now and once I've adjusted to the bounce then I feel I have as good a chance as anyone else.' He makes a good point. The five consecutive victories of Bjorn Borg in the late 1970's were won mostly from the back of the court and Stich's success last year was based as much on the quality of his backhand returns and passes as on the penetration of his serve. Although in theory Courier's game is not ideal for grass, he does have a wonderful serve and has been in the final of four of the last five Grand Slam championships, winning three of them. He has won his last 23 singles matches. That sort of record cannot be ignored; it reveals a strength of character and a technical adaptability superior to any of his current rivals. Tennis matches are won in the mind, and Courier has proved that he has the strongest mind in the business. In a difficult year for forecasters, I believe Courier to be the most likely men's champion - although Stich, with a win on grass in Rosmalen last week and a soft draw as the No. 3 seed, must have a strong chance. He is due to play Pete Sampras or Richard Krajicek in the quarter-finals, and then Stefan Edberg in the semi-final, a match he won last year without breaking serve. Edberg will be burning for revenge. The most fascinating thing about this year's Wimbledon is the return of Monica Seles after her mysterious non-arrival in 1991. Like Courier, the world champion is supposed to have a game unsuitable for grass. But cast your mind back two years: do you remember that spectacular quarter-final on Court No. 1, Seles against Zina Garrison? For sheer drama it was quite unrivalled - the issue was in doubt until the last nail-biting second. Garrison had an inspired day, and kept hitting the lines with her volleys to inflict a 3-6 6-3 9-7 defeat on Seles. And, like Courier, Seles has the most destructive ground strokes of the modern era. Already the reigning US, French and Australian champion, I believe that her improving serve, a greater readiness to volley and, of course, those relentless two-fisted drives will carry her to a first Wimbledon title. Is there anyone who can stop her? I suppose Steffi Graf, the present champion, might - but the faithful forehand is not the weapon it was, and the anguish of losing the French final two weeks ago (after so many chances to win) will have its effect. Nor can I be too sanguine about the chances of last year's finalist, Gabriela Sabatini. Her nerve, on the great occasion, remains suspect. As for Martina Navratilova: her first-round loss at Eastbourne this week, added to a lack of match play, will militate against her.</p>

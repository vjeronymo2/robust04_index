The prisoner is  being charged with actions the punishments for which have been  stipulated in Part 1 of Article 60 of UKK [Kazakhstan Criminal  Code] (the article is called "Violation of National and Racial  Equal Rights and the Equal Rights of Citizens Depending Upon  Their Attitude Toward Religion").    As a citizen of the Russian Federation who is residing in  the  Kazakhstan city of Petropavlovsk, Boris Suprunyuk attracted the  interest of the North Kazakhstan procurator's office as early as  last summer, after he spoke at the local Cossack Circle,  criticizing the "linguistic" policy of the city authorities. The  criminal case that was initiated in this regard languished until  April of this year. But apparently after Suprunyuk took part in  the picketing of the Kazakhstan embassy during Nursultan  Nazarbayev's recent visit to Moscow, the authorities decided to  let this case go full speed ahead. The leader of the "Russian  Commune", after his arrest, was in Petropavlovsk for one week,  and no one, not even his lawyer, was allowed to see him.  According to a statement made by employees of the oblast  procurator's office, during the night of 19-20 April, the  prisoner was taken to Alma-Ata for the purpose of undergoing  trial-related medical evaluation. But for a period of two weeks  nothing was known about Suprunyuk: Kazakhstan officials  completely refused to make any comments on the situation. There  was a similar lack of success in the attempts made by employees  of the Russian embassy in Alma-Ata to learn anything about the  fate of the Russian citizen.    The embassy sent notes several times to the republic's  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and statements were also sent to  the Kazakhstan ambassador in Moscow from the appropriate  committee of the State Duma. According to Russian diplomats,  both Nursultan Nazarbayev and Andrey Kozyrev were informed of  this. By preventing the embassy employees from seeing the  accused, the Kazakhstan authorities, in the opinion of the same  diplomats, are violating the Russo-Kazakhstan consular  convention. In addition, people in the Russian embassy consider  that the forced psychiatric evaluation is also inadmissible.    Last Monday it finally became known that Suprunyuk has been  brought to the capital of the republic. In his own words, he was  brought from Petropavlovsk several days earlier than the date  given by the authorities. And while he was in Alma-Ata, only his  lawyer was allowed to visit him.    On Wednesday the republic procurator's office was picketed  by  activists from the Alma-Ata "Russian Commune," the "Harmony"  movement of Semirech'ye Cossacks, and social democrats. In their  opinion, there is no corpus delicti in Boris Suprunyuk's  actions, since he, as a journalist, had the complete right to  express his opinion with regard to the local policy, so long as  he did not go beyond the confines of the law.    However, one also hears hypotheses concerning a kind of  behind-the-scenes agreement between the Moscow and Alma-Ata  officials with regard to Suprunyuk. Otherwise it is extremely  difficult to explain such an obvious ignoring by the Kazakhstan  officials of the Russian reaction to the events. Boris  Suprunyuk, with his aggressiveness in defending the interests of  the Russian-speaking population of North Kazakhstan, has been  troubling not only the local authorities for a long time. His  actions also have been causing dissatisfaction on the part of  Russian officials who deal with Central Asia, and who definitely  do not always view the Russians in Kazakhstan as the object of  their official concerns.</p>

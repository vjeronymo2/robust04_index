			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar firmer on inflation data THE DOLLAR remained firm against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after US inflation figures turned out to be higher than expected and the Bundesbank again eased monetary policy, writes James Blitz. The US currency has been in the throes of a good recovery since the start of the week, after the market took the view that last Friday's non-farm payroll figure was not as bad as some dealers had anticipated. Yesterday, the dollar peaked at DM1.6135 after it was announced that US producer prices rose 0.6 per cent in April, against market expectations of a 0.3 per cent gain. It later closed in London at DM1.6115, up 30 basis points on the day. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.6105. The higher inflation figure underlined the belief of some dealers that US short-term interest rates have bottomed out at about 3 per cent, and that the Fed Funds rate could rise before the end of the year. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS in London, believes that today's US retail sales figures for April will be watched closely. 'We need a good retail sales figure to show that, by June, there will be a rundown of the large inventories made in the first and second quarters of this year,' he said. The market's forecast is for a rise of around 0.6 per cent on the month. Mr Chertkow believes that increasing signs of a pick-up in the US economy will set the scene for a rise in the Fed Funds rate of  1/2 percentage point after the summer. His three-month forecast for the dollar is DM1.72. The Bundesbank yesterday surprised dealers by cutting its repo rate by 11 basis points to 7.60 per cent for both 14-day and 28-day funds. The move helped to alleviate pressure on the Danish krone in the run-up to Tuesday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The krone closed yesterday at minus 46 percentage points of divergence against its central Ecu rate, compared to around minus 50 percentage points at the start of the week. However, sterling lost some of the ground that it had made against the German currency on Tuesday, finishing a pfennig weaker on the day at DM2.4700. A dealer at one of the major London counterparties said there had been strong selling of the pound by the Bank of England at DM2.4800. The UK authorities still need to build up reserves following the expulsion of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The peseta also came under very strong selling pressure in Europe yesterday, although the Bank of Spain again appeared able to hold the exchange rate through intervention. There were reports that Spanish banks were acting as proxies for the authorities, by selling dollars and buying the D-Mark to help build up Spanish reserves. The peseta closed at Pta73.56 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta73.35.</p>

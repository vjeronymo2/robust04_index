			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Observer: Misbehaviour Nice to see Francis Maude, the minister in charge of the citizen's charter, wearing his name-badge at a meeting fixed by London Electricity to report on its customer charter. As he observed, the charter requires increasing numbers of faceless bureaucrats to wear badges on the assumption that they'll behave differently if they can be identified by name. However, departing from his usual anonymity didn't seem to prompt Maude to behave differently from the ministerial norm. Not only did his speech begin 20 minutes later than scheduled, but he failed to offer financial recompense to the audience. Perhaps he'd forgotten that the citizen's charter encourages the swift dispensation of Pounds 10 notes to customers kept waiting by meter readers, repair men and suchlike.</p>

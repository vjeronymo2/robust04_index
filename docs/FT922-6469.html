			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Opportunity knocks across the Channel  -Investing in . . . France IT MAY just be British prejudice, but few people seem interested in the investment opportunities available just across the Channel. Germany has been regarded as the leader of European economies for years now, while France seems merely to move in its slipstream. Also, the French market has relatively few quoted stocks, and is far less liquid than London - to the extent that the stock market generally receives a boost in January and February, when the coupons on government bonds are paid. Despite having its own Big Bang, the impression is that the Paris bourse is dominated by a small number of firms, even though brokers say that trading is generally cheaper in Paris than it is in London. Add to this the traditional British friction with all things French, and the limited range of opportunities for UK investors to gain exposure specifically to France is scarcely surprising. Only two authorised UK unit trusts invest exclusively in France, although there is a range of insurance and pension funds and a few Luxembourg-based funds. However, if you choose to invest in a European fund, you may find that you are in fact investing very heavily in France. Most UK fund managers are now heavily overweight in this market. Henderson is launching a European investment trust next month with an initial asset allocation including 23 per cent in France, compared with only 14 per cent in Germany. Its managers point to the current political optimism and the intention of several big French pension funds to increase their equity holdings. There is also a belief that the economic balance of power between France and Germany could change. The Continent is awash with speculation that the Franc could replace the D-Mark as the anchor for the European monetary system. This may be premature, but it speaks volumes for the shift in sentiment. Germany's problems are well-documented and have much to do with the resurgence of optimism about France. But few appreciate that France has avoided the worst of Germany's difficulties. France's political embarrassments over the last year, with the fall and rise of Edith Cresson and the near-breakthrough of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the far right, have obscured the enviable price stability over the same period. Inflation - at 3 per cent and forecast by many to fall further - seems to be 'licked', as John Major might put it. The main banks' base rates, at 9.85 per cent, remain almost artificially high thanks to the neighbouring influence of Germany. The markets have also received the appointment of prime minister Pierre Beregovoy, a former finance minister, with delight. He has instilled new confidence in the markets, is trusted to be 'responsible', and any fiscal stimulus he does administer, to help the Socialist re-election effort, is likely to benefit the markets. All this might lead you to think that the time to buy has passed. Certainly, the performance of the French stock market over the last year has been impressive - the benchmark CAC-40 index is up 10.78 per cent over a year. Meanwhile, the performance figures of UK funds investing in the area look very respectable. INVESCO French Growth, the longest established unit trust investing exclusively in France, leads the European sector over a year with growth of 13.88 per cent. Over three years it is 13th, with 24.89 per cent growth. Le Fond Francais, now owned by Providence Capitol and managed by Wargny, the long-established French broker, has grown 16 per cent this year. It sounds as though a lot of good news is already in French prices. However, optimism among fund managers remains high. Interest rates have much to do with this. Real interest rates (compared with inflation) of more than 6 per cent are rare, and suggest that there is scope for substantial fiscal easing. This ought to be good news for equities, and also for strong capital growth in bonds. Not only will companies be more free to raise finance. At present about FFr1,000bn is tied up in cash mutual funds, thanks to the attractive rates offered. This is roughly half the total capitalisation of the stock market. Once money market rates fall, analysts expect a significant flow of funds into equities, which will act as a stimulus. Yet more liquidity could come from a projected new tax relief for small savers, the Plan D'Epargne Actions (PEA), which would offer hefty concessions on equity investments provided they were held for at least six years. Jean Legros, of Mercury, thinks this could have a big impact on the market although other managers, such as Rory Powell of Invesco MIM, are more cautious. The US economy is another important factor. Many of the largest French companies have heavy exposure to American markets. So their corporate earnings should receive a significant boost when - and if - American consumers start buying again. Many forecasts for corporate earnings are bullish - Invesco is predicting growth of 'at least 15 per cent, possible closer to 20 per cent, for the next year. If this is right, then market valuations are attractive, in spite of the market's relatively low yield and recent price rises. And given the current lamentably high level of unemployment - more than 9 per cent - the room for growth is evident. So, in which sectors are managers investing? Legros has aimed for cyclicals and companies with heavy exposure to the US. That includes Michelin, the largest tyre manufacturer in the world, which is ideally placed for a pick-up in the US, and Rhone-Poulenc, a consumer credit company, which would leap on any base rate cut as an opportunity to increase margins. Powell is adopting an almost identical strategy for Invesco, concentrating on US-exposure stocks, cyclicals, and companies which can benefit from rationalisation. Powell is also heavily invested in Michelin and Rhone-Poulenc, but also in St. Gobain, which is well-placed to benefit from a revival in the US construction industry. He has now started to move into medium-sized and smaller companies. So, it might be time for a does of extended entente cordiale. As the current spate of investment trusts demonstrates, UK managers seem finally to be aware of the opportunities available across the Channel.  ------------------------------------------------ FACTFILE: FRANCE  ------------------------------------------------ Population                               56.7m Gross Domestic Product        Pounds  674.05bn Market Capitalisation         Pounds 174.756bn Yield on the Market              3.25 per cent Three-month Interbank Rate      9.937 per cent Currency &amp; Exchange Rate  Pounds 1 = FFr 9.865  ------------------------------------------------</p>

Numerous documents were forged and the Home Office was 'fooled' repeatedly, Southwark Crown Court was told. For nearly three years Mr James Walker, a solicitor, and barrister Mr Paul Samrai got away with the 'scam' which enabled dozens of people to get the right to live in Britain, said Mr Brendon Finucane, prosecuting. He alleged that their company, charging about Pounds 40,000 for each application, made a total of Pounds 1.36m, most of which was obtained illegally. The case continues.</p>

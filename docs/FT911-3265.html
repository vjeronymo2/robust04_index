			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Allies press UN over Kurdish camps in Iraq THE US, Britain and France opened talks yesterday with the UN secretary-general, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, to speed up preparations for a UN take-over of Kurdish refugee camps in northern Iraq. At the same time, the British defence secretary, Mr Tom King, yesterday called on Iraq to remove its forces from the northern Iraqi town of Zakho immediately, and said Britain would not tolerate obstruction of the so-called safe havens plan. Mr King told a news conference in London that the lives of thousands of Kurdish refugees depended on Iraq pulling its forces from the area around Zakho. 'They have to go now. So great is the fear that, unless we can meet that concern and fear, we will have provided facilities which will not do the job for which they are planned,' Mr King said. President Saddam Hussein reinforced his government's presence in Zakho yesterday, further frustrating the west's refugee plan, being carried out without his consent. Residents said that 500 to 700 uniformed Iraqis had arrived to join an advance party which drove in by bus on Sunday, and which was described by the Iraqis as armed 'police'. US-led forces have also boosted their strength in Zakho. Kurds in Turkey say they will not go to the haven while Saddam's security forces remain nearby. The US has also demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the town, but a US military spokesman denied statements by British military and diplomatic sources that the allies had given Iraq 48 hours to pull its forces out of Zakho. A US military spokesman said Zakho had effectively been partitioned into two zones - the centre, in Iraqi control and the outskirts in the hands of the US-led alliance. In calling for the UN to speed up its plans to take over the safe havens, the allies feel that while the UN has done a great deal of paper work on relieving the refugees' plight, it has been slow in putting its proposals into effect. They consider that it is high time for the UN to start co-ordinating its efforts on the ground with the allies' own operations. Meanwhile, US forces in occupied southern Iraq yesterday handed over the first of their positions to UN military observers in a simple flag-changing ceremony at an outpost north of Safwan. However, the remarks of the US officer at the transfer seemed to add to the confusion about the timing and role of any full UN presence in the area. Colonel Bill Nash of the US 1st Army said tersely: 'We will continue to protect the refugees,' appearing to confirm the UN's reluctance to play a military role. Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, UN delegate in charge of the refugee programme, told Mr Douglas Hogg, junior British Foreign Office minister, in Geneva last Tuesday that the UN had no objection to taking over the camps, according to British officials. At the same time, it is clear the international organisation is not prepared to take over the allied military operation in northern Iraq because it feels that UN resolution 688 does not give it the authority to do so.</p>

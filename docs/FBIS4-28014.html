			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan, by Shigeo Ishii and Ryoji Tateo,  TOKYO SHIMBUN editorial staff; date and place not given; first  paragraph is TOKYO SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] At the start of the Hata regime, the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] left the coalition government  ranks because of the controversy over the formation of the  parliamentary group "Kaishin." Now the SDPJ has made public its  immediate action policy for its return to the government on  condition that the Hata cabinet resign en bloc following the  passing of the budget. It is hard for the people to comprehend  what the SDPJ is aiming at. Among the ruling parties are heard  voices supporting the SDPJ's policy, making the future political  development completely unpredictable. What is the aim of the  SDPJ policy? How is it going to carry out the political  realignment? SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, 65 years old,  was interviewed as to what the party's real intention is.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What does the SDPJ really intend in  proposing the cabinet resignation en bloc after the passing of  the budget and the SDPJ's return to the third coalition  government?    [Kubo] What are the immediate things to do to stabilize the  coalition government? If a no-confidence vote is passed in the  cabinet, the only way left is a general election. But the  coalition is "against conducting elections under the plural  member constituency system." Although the way to dissolving the  Diet and then conducting elections is blocked, we can play the  best card in the end. In my opinion, the plural-member  constituency system may have to be used as the last resort.    When the cabinet has to resign en bloc as the result of a  no-confidence vote, there is no other way left than turning over  the government to the leading opposition party (the LDP). I am  opposed to that, so there is only one way left. That is to  reconstruct the Hata coalition cabinet consisting of weak  minority ruling parties. To make the third coalition government  a stabilized one, the present regime has to resign en bloc  following the budget's passage.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] In that case, is Mr. Hata eligible to run  for premiership?    [Kubo] Since the present coalition ruling parties are  involved in the discussion, every head of a political party is  eligible for nomination to premiership. Mr. Hata will not be  eliminated.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is too much party interests and  tactics for him to resign and assume the premiership again.    [Kubo] Therefore, it is necessary for him to clarify the  reason for the block resignation when he decides to resign.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, why did the SDPJ withdraw from the  coalition government in the first place?  <H5>  Hata Cabinet's Mission Completed With Budget Formation </H5>   [Kubo] The foremost reason the SDPJ withdrew was that faith,  the most important element in the coalition, was betrayed. From  the outset, the Hata regime had problems that compelled it to be  vulnerable. Therefore, its mission will be finished with the  budget's passage. At that point, it can liquidate the problems  created when the second coalition government was formed.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will not such a problem as the formation of  the parliamentary group "Kaishin" occur again?    [Kubo] It probably will. But it is irresponsible for  politicians and political parties not to do anything for fear of  it. A passive attitude must not be taken.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it all right not to liquidate the double  power structure represented by Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro  Ozawa?    [Kubo] It is a big mistake to have the illusion that nothing  can be done without Mr. Ozawa. He is surely an amazing  politician in his reckless attempt to push through his strategy.  In his handling of matters, I have noticed dangerous factors of  trespassing on democratic principles.    For that reason, a coalition must be formed. There could be  battles as well as cooperation. He would think seriously and  act accordingly when he faces a counterpart to fight against. I  have the idea that a coalition is impossible unless Mr. Ozawa is  excluded. I admit he has many excellent points.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Why is it not possible for the SDPJ to form  a coalition with the LDP, when a coalition is possible with Mr.  Ozawa, who has a different theoretical view of the state, to  form a coalition with the LDP?  <H5>  No Policy Agreement Exists With the LDP </H5>   [Kubo] There exists a complete agreement of opinions with  Shinseito in our policy and basic agreements. No such  agreements exist with the LDP. Mr. Ozawa's theoretical view of  the state has been clearly made public in the Ozawa  investigation committee's report and in his book, "A Blueprint  for a New Japan." Even if we went to hell, there could be no  agreement in these matters. But at present, Shinseito and the  SDPJ have compromised to reach an agreement. It is possible for  representatives of the political parties that share the regime  to cooperate in government beyond the difference in theoretical  views of the state.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The chairman's and secretary general's  positions on returning to the fold of the government sound  different.  <H5>  Both Men in Agreement for United Efforts of the SDPJ </H5>   [Kubo] We are in complete agreement in that the SDPJ will do  its best to form a new coalition government. Mr. Murayama and  his followers insist on opening a new phase by positively  pushing for a general election, if there are no other means. I  am insisting on the block resignation, to form a more democratic  and more powerful coalition government by making the most of  experience in the first coalition. We are looking at the same  moon over the mountain from different sides of the mountain.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you not think the LDP is acting the same  way the old SDPJ did?    [Kubo] Well, it is a hell of a lot more unskillful an  opposition party than the SDPJ used to be. (laughter) In their  interpellation at the Budget Committee, they hit at mistakes at  random but we did not attack that way. The LDP has not become a  real opposition party yet. (laughter) On the contrary, they  might be thinking that the SDPJ cannot become a ruling party as  they expected. (laughter)    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you expect the political realignment  will go?  <H5>  Worrying About Comeback of Big Conservative Alliance </H5>   [Kubo] The reason I am insisting on the formation of a third  coalition government originates from worries that a big  conservative alliance will be restored if the present situation  is left untouched. Prime Minister Hata does not think he can  survive until the next Diet session. Some sort of strengthening  measure is necessary. If we continue to refuse cooperation in  that situation, we will be committing a grave mistake. As for  the SDPJ, a partial alliance with the LDP that changes as the  case may be is a possibility. With a wide list of choices, the  SDPJ will secure and maintain its leadership in forming the next  regime.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What will its combination be?    [Kubo] The government will be a coalition and the political  forces will be tripolar for the time being. They are an "old  conservative party," a "new conservative party," and a "new  kakushin [reformist]," that is a congregation of liberal forces  based on complete democracy. These tripolar forces will form a  varied coalition government as they find possible bases for  cooperation in policies. In the future, they will be contracted  into the "new conservatives" and the "new kakushin," bringing in  time two great forces, alternately taking control of the  government.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is not the single-member constituency system  disadvantageous for the tripolar forces?    [Kubo] I doubt that the LDP will really be in a predominant  position. At present, the LDP holds a popularity rate of 20  percent, compared to the old days when it commanded 40-50  percent popularity. The new conservatives, all added up, have a  nearly 20 percent popularity rate. If it tries hard, the SDPJ  can come up with nearly 20 percent support. Thus the time has  come for the tripolar forces to compete for one Diet seat in  each constituency. If we have the thought that the LDP candidate  cannot be defeated unless we stage a united campaign, it will  lead us to a loss of confidence.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi a candidate  for premiership?    [Kubo] I want him to come back with vigor to the central  political field. He must come back at the opportune time. He  is unmistakably one of the leaders of a new time. But he is not  the only one. He is a lot younger than I.</p>

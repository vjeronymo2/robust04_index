			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Heavy carpet losses leave Lamont 22% lower HEAVY LOSSES in a carpet subsidiary helped to depress pre-tax profits at Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based textiles company. Yesterday it reported a 22 per cent decline for 1992, from Pounds 8.11m to Pounds 6.3m. Mr Richard Milliken, chief executive, said the fall reflected a Pounds 2m loss in Shaw Carpets and a further Pounds 1m deficit in the computer business. Steps had been taken to stem the losses, including the reduction of Shaw's workforce by 17 per cent and a refocus of the company on less expensive volume products. This latter tactic was expected to recoup some of the market share lost in a competitive sector. Lamont estimated that the market as a whole had declined by 10 per cent, while Shaw's turnover had fallen some 18 per cent. Margins - which had dropped by 3 to 4 per cent during the year - continued to present difficulties. Total costs of rationalising the loss-making businesses came to about Pounds 250,000 in 1992. A further Pounds 400,000 in costs would be taken in the current year. Mr Milliken said the full benefits of rationalisation were not expected to feed through until 1994. Regarding ICS Computing, Mr Milliken said Lamont was still in discussions over a sale. Group turnover was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 115.5m, including a seven-month contribution from textile printer Alexander Drew &amp; Sons. This business produced profits of not less than Pounds 3m in that period. Mr Milliken said other businesses had performed reasonably well, either virtually maintaining or increasing profits. Capital expenditure was increased from about Pounds 4m to Pounds 11m, with just over half spent on two carpet operations. As a result of this investment and debt acquired with Alexander Drew, interest payments rose from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 698,000. Mr Milliken said the group aimed to reduce its debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds from 24 per cent to roughly 12 per cent. Mr Milliken said the outlook for the current year was better, with Lamont expecting to reduce the losses at Shaw. As a result, the final dividend is maintained at 8.5p, for an unchanged total of 12p. Earnings, partly depressed by the 1-for-4 rights last year to pay for Alexander Drew, fell from 21.84p to 16.09p. However, Mr Milliken remained 'cautious and cagey' considering the lack of any sign of real upturn in the markets served by the carpet companies. 'We do not anticipate any help from the market this year,' he said.</p>

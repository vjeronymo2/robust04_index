			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- Parties and movements of the  opposition held a meeting and a mourning ceremony in Moscow on  Sunday in remembrance of those killed during tragic events in  Moscow in October, 1993. The column of thousands of mourners  who marched along the Krasnaya Presnya to the Russian White  House was led by relatives of those killed six months ago.    The mourning ceremony continued for about half an hour.  Before the ceremony began, photographs of the victims of the  October 1993 tragedy in Moscow were placed on a wall of the  Krasnaya Presnya stadium. Addressing all those present,  speakers called for reconciliation in society.    Participants in the remembrance ceremony adopted an address  to the people and authorities, pointing out, in particular, the  futility of attempts to resolve political problems in Russia by  means of force. Participants demanded that October 4 be  proclaimed a day of national mourning and that the parliamentary  commission for the investigation into the circumstances of the  October 1993 developments resume its work.    Upon completion of the meeting, a religious service in  remembrance of those killed was held.</p>

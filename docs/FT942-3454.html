			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / US telecoms alliance for France and Germany: Dollars 4bn stake in Sprint planned Plans for an ambitious global telecommunications alliance between the French and German state-owned operators and Sprint, a US company, were unveiled yesterday, heralding a bitter regulatory battle in the US. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom intend to pay Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.80bn) for a 20 per cent stake in Sprint, the third-largest long-distance carrier in the US. The three will establish joint ventures targeted at the communications needs of multinational companies. AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, yesterday urged the US government to block the alliance unless France and Germany agreed to open their markets to competition before the 1998 deadline agreed by the European Union last year. The European state operators would strongly resist such a move. The link-up is the second multi-billion dollar international telecoms venture to have been launched in the past year. It resembles the deal forged by British Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US carrier. BT has pledged Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in MCI, and a further Dollars 750m to establish a joint venture company. The BT-MCI alliance will this week gain the final approval of the US Department of Justice, after a year-long investigation. However, the Franco-German alliance with Sprint is set for a more fraught regulatory battle because of the relative size of the operators and the fact that, unlike BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom enjoy a monopoly over most telecommunications services in their respective countries. Mr Victor Pelson, chairman of AT&amp;T's global operations, said: 'The French and German markets are two of the most closed markets in the world for telecoms service and equipment. They should provide full access before this deal is allowed.' The French and German companies insist that the alliance will offer services only in sectors already open to competition in their home markets, such as calling cards, data networks and private corporate networks. Mr Helmut Ricke, chairman of Deutsche Telekom, said: 'We are sure that we will receive regulatory approval otherwise we would not have signed.' However, last month the Federal Cartel Administration in Berlin reported that Deutsche Telekom had channeled subsidies totalling DM1.9bn (Pounds .76bn) into its data networks division since data services were opened to competition in Germany in 1989. The company claims that the cross subsidies have ended The Sprint deal builds on an Ecu1bn (Pounds 769m) alliance between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom signed last December, which still has to be approved by the European Commission.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking brings Dow back from high Wall Street US EQUITIES edged off their record highs yesterday in spite of fresh declines in long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.35 at 3,572.73. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.25 lower at 449.46, while the Amex composite finished up 0.39 at 439.19, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.41 at 717.08. NYSE volume was 255m shares. After Monday's record-breaking run, some investors chose to take profits. The early fall in prices, however, also reflected a still uncertain mood. Monday's advance was powered primarily by falling interest rates, and although rates continued to drop yesterday - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped to 6.45 per cent, the lowest point in the bond's history - stocks did not respond. Instead, selling pressure pulled prices lower across the board. Each time stocks have posted new record highs this year, they have fallen back almost immediately. This suggests that investors remain nervous about the fact that prices keep reaching new heights in spite of relatively poor economic fundamentals. Among individual stocks, Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 in volume of 1.7m shares after the big consumer products manufacturer announced a fourth quarter loss of Dollars 1.83 a share, compared with a profit of 46 cents a share a year ago. The loss followed a Dollars 1.5bn charge for the cost of plant consolidations and other organisational restructuring. Some big retailing stocks fell on disappointing earnings. Among them were Wal-Mart, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 25 in heavy trading, Dillard Department Stores, down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 35, and The Limited, Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 21. Eastman Kodak continued to rally as investors looked forward to an improvement in the company's earnings following the departure last week of its chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore. The stock added another Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 60 5/8 in volume of 3.5m shares. Tandy fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 after the computer company announced a sharp drop in quarterly operating earnings. On the Nasdaq market, Scitex dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 on second quarter earnings of 52 cents a share, down from 75 cents a share a year earlier. Other stocks received a boost from strong second quarter results, including Huntco, up Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 , Teva Pharmaceutical, up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 7/8 , and Merisel, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 11 3/4 . Profit-taking took the edge off leading technology stocks, with Apple down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 28 1/2 , Microsoft, Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 71, and Sun Microsystems Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 27 5/8 . Canada TORONTO stock prices closed higher in busy trading, led by a surge among mining stocks. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index rose 26.24 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at 4,028.44. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 412 to 306. Volume was 63.038m shares, up from Monday's 42.776m, and value rose to CDollars 709.2m from CDollars 510.3m. Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the mining group, up 2.8 per cent. Alcan Aluminium climbed 1 to CDollars 27 5/8 .</p>

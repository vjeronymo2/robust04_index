			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (5): Banks take expansive view - Conflicting attitudes towards the OTC market THE Pounds 150m treasury loss incurred by Allied Lyons last year, through its involvement in the options market, had a dramatic impact on corporate attitudes towards derivative financial instruments. However, while the episode made companies look hard at their treasury operations, bankers argue that there has been no significant slow-down in the rate of growth or innovation in the futures and options markets. They point to three main areas of growth: New buyers are coming into the market as the price of interest-rate and currency-hedging products falls to the point where it is efficient for smaller companies to buy complex hedging products. Competition among banks offering over-the-counter derivatives has intensified. 'Margins have come down to the point that they can not fall any further,' commented Peter Hajas, head of interest-rate derivatives at SBC/O'Connor. He estimated the price of simple sterling or dollar interest-rate products, such as caps and floors, had fallen to just 25 - 30 per cent of the levels seen at the end of the 1980s. Banks are offering existing products in a wider range of currencies. Demand has grown for interest-rate hedging products in European currencies such as the lire and the peseta, while hedging tools such as forward contracts and options are now available in a range of smaller currencies. National Westminster Bank, for example, plans to make a forward market in currencies from Korean won to Indonesian rupiah by early summer. By the year end, it hopes to be offering options on these currencies. New products are being developed which offer existing customers new ways to hedge currency and interest-rate exposures. Within the interest-rate derivatives market, there is growth in products which allow buyers to manage previously inseparable risks. For example, in buying an 'index swap', an investment manager might agree to pay the bank Deutsche Mark interest rates in return for a payment linked to US dollar interest rates. This is clearly an interest-rate hedge based on the expectation of falling German interest rates and rising US interest rates. However, the whole transaction is denominated in dollars, separating out the risk of an appreciation in the D-Mark. Within the options market, developments include drop-out or barrier options. These offer a conventional option on a currency or market at an agreed strike price, but the contract dissolves if the market moves too far away from the strike price. The product can be offered at a lower price than a conventional option, because the bank's exposure is easier to hedge. On this basis, it is favoured by fund managers or treasurers with a strong view on the direction of markets. Another development is 'tender-to-contract' options, which allow a company to hedge a potential currency exposure when tendering for a large contract. This works something like an option-on-an-option, but tries to take into account the probability of the company's actually winning the contract. The biggest draw-back on these types of instrument is that the bank writing the option or swap can find it difficult to hedge its own exposure. This cost is inevitably passed through to the company buying the hedge. Another product being aggressively marketed by a number of banks is the 'average rate' option, on which the prevailing market rate is determined by a sampling process through the life of the instrument - rather than by simply taking the price on exercise date. The idea is that the option will reflect the buyers' foreign-exchange or interest-rate exposures, rather than taking an unrepresentative 'snap-shot' on a single date. But while bankers are keen to parade the latest examples of futures and options-based financial engineering, corporate treasurers are showing a desire to return to basics. 'There has been a reversion to a more fundamentalist attitude to treasury management,' commented Derek Ross, head of treasury management consultancy at Touche Ross. 'There is a growing awareness that every level of complexity adds to the cost of financial products.' For example, big companies with large, core foreign-exchange exposures have started to use 'dynamic currency hedging' in preference to over-the-counter (OTC) options. Dynamic currency hedging involves the active management of a physical currency portfolio, to 'synthesise' currency options. The core of the system is a computer-trading model, which automatically buys and sell currencies according to day-to-day exchange rate movements. For example, a UK company needing to hedge a dollar exposure would buy dollars as the US currency appreciated against sterling, and sell dollars as the US currency depreciated, according to a pre-set formula. While the theory is simple, setting up a sophisticated dynamic currency-hedging system can be expensive, up to  1/2 per cent of the exposure being hedged. There are also cumulative costs in the day-to-day trading of the currency portfolio - although initial fees are reduced if the trading is channelled through the same bank which sells the system. Nick Goulding, head of derivatives at National Westminster Bank, estimated that dynamic currency hedging was efficient only for companies with a core foreign exchange exposure in excess of Pounds 50m. However, big banks, including NatWest itself, already use dynamic currency hedging techniques in place of OTC options. Blue-chip companies are following suit. The technique is popular in the management of 'translation exposures', which arise from the translation of foreign currency earnings back into a base currency for accounting purposes. Dynamic hedging is least efficient in liquid currencies, because the cost of the alternatives - including OTC options  - is less. However, simplified forms of the technique are being used without a huge investment in systems to manage exposures in 'exotic' currencies, where OTC hedging products are only available at a high cost.</p>

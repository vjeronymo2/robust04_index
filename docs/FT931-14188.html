			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Russia in gas pact with Italy RUSSIA has agreed to supply Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) worth of natural gas to Italy, in return for having equipment to modernise its own industry serviced by companies which are part of ENI, the Italian state oil concern. The agreement underlines Russia's need to find the means of paying for equipment to boost gas productivity and exports. It also emphasises Italy's desire to continue to expand reliance on gas and to look to the new Commonwealth as a secure energy source. Italy has been buying gas from the former Soviet Union since 1974 and these imports now account for 40 per cent of all external gas supplies. The break-up of the Soviet Union and the increasing inability of the Russian authorities to fund the modernisation and maintenance of the gas industry has been viewed with concern in Italy. The present deal in various forms has taken almost three years to arrange and makes use of credit lines already approved. Under the deal, a consortium headed by ENI's Snamprogetti and Nuovo Pignone is to provide pipes, machinery and equipment to modernise and upgrade the gas transport facilities of Gasprom, the Russian state gas concern. Nuovo Pignone will provide gas turbines to boost pumping stations. In return, Gasprom will supply gas to Snamprogetti largely from the extra quantities from more efficient pumping operations. ENI yesterday declined to give details on the new quantities of gas to be delivered or the pricing. Two pipelines supply the gas to Italy running from Russia through Ukraine, Slovakia and Austria. Current supplies, at 13.7bn cu metres a year, are near capacity, but throughput can be upgraded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The settlers' operation to double the number of  settlements begins in Qiryat Arba' this evening. Our settlement  affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that several dozen  settlers from Judaea and Samaria arrived in Qiryat Arba' and  started preparations for setting up a new presettlement about  one km from Qiryat Arba'. Our correspondent reports that the  settlers set up a special headquarters for this purpose in a  Qiryat Arba' apartment, and the operation is being conducted to  all intents and purposes as a military operation. The heads of  the operation told our correspondent they have not coordinated  their actions with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and that if  they are asked to evacuate the place they will evince passive  resistance.    Reacting to the settlement operation, Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer said Israel is a state of law and whoever breaks  the law in Qiryat Arba' will be dealt with in the same manner as  someone breaking the law in Herzliyya. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer  made these remarks during a tour with the heads of his ministry  to the 'Etzyon Bloc and Ma'ale Adumim.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1605 GMT on 26 January  carries a report on Minister Ben-Eli'ezer's tour, in which  correspondent Gil Litman asks the minister whether the  government intends to territorially unite Jerusalem with Ma'ale  Adumim on the east and the 'Etzyon Bloc on the south. Minister  Ben-Eli'ezer is quoted as saying: "I want to tell you that I do  not know of any such territorial linkage plan." Later on  Ben-Eli'ezer adds: "If you ask me whether there is any plan to  link the 'Etzyon Bloc to Jerusalem, the answer is negative."]</p>

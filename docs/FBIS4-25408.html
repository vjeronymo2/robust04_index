			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with King Norodom Sihanouk by correspondents (Li </F> Bun) and (Yuan), on 6 June at his residence in Beijing --  recorded]    [Text] [(Li Bun)] We are correspondents for China Radio  International.    [Sihanouk] Please come in. [Words indistinct] [laughter].    [(Li Bun)] We would like to thank Your Majesty for kindly  granting us an interview despite your being very busy. We are  very happy to see that Your Majesty is healthier and stronger.  This is a source of pride for all Cambodian and Chinese people.    [Sihanouk] Thank you very much. I am this healthy because  of the great benevolence of the PRC and all the ladies and  gentlemen -- male and female doctors and nurses -- who are  giving me the care and medical treatment to relieve me from my  illnesses, which include cancer. It is also thanks to the great  friendship and considerable scientific knowledge of the Chinese  doctors and nurses who have given me the treatments on behalf of  the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, His  Excellency [H.E.] President Jiang Zemin, and the PRC Government.    For several months they have worked day and night to enable  me to live longer for the sake of the sublime interest of the  Cambodian nation and people, and so that I will be able to  continue serving the correct cause of eternal and immortal  friendship and fraternity between our two countries. We are  fraternal countries which will always have great friendship,  fraternity, and solidarity. Thank you.    [(Li Bun)] We believe that Your Majesty will have perfect  health and a very long life.    [Sihanouk] Thank you very much for your great friendship and  respect for me.    [(Li Bun)] I would like to beg permission to ask some  questions. China and Cambodia have a long-standing bond of  traditional friendship, especially since the Bandung Conference  in 1955, under the joint efforts of Your Majesty and the Chinese  leaders of all generations. The friendship between the two  countries has been continuously enhanced and tested in all  circumstances. What is your opinion concerning the basis for  promoting the fraternal, friendly relations between the two  countries and the future of this relationship between the two  countries? Thank you.    [(Li Bun)] H.E. President Jiang Zemin has given a grand  welcome for the official state visit I paid this week in the  most glorious PRC, which is the greatest, most sincere, and  oldest friend of our Cambodian people and nation. H.E. Jiang  Zemin recalled that history shows that our two countries have  established a bridge of friendship since time immemorial. In  the Angkor era, the greatest era in Cambodia's history, there  was close contact between our two peoples and nations. In the  Angkor era, the Chinese philosopher Chou Ta-kuan paid a courtesy  call on the Cambodian king and had close contact with the  Cambodian people and stayed with them for a long time. He wrote  to inform the Chinese people about Cambodian history, life and  traditions of the Cambodian people and nation in that era.  Later, I and H.E. Zhou Enlai reestablished the friendship as it  was in the past. After the Bandung Conference, I had the great  honor to pay an official state visit to the great Chinese state  of the PRC. I had the great honor to call on H.E. Chairman Mao  Zedong, and our friendship and cooperation has strengthened  since then.    The PRC has given us so much help. We support one another in  the international arena. In Cambodia's national reconstruction,  the PRC has helped us all along in this effort, thus enabling  our country to become very prosperous during the Sangkum Reas  Niyum era, that is from 1955 to 1969. H.E. President Liu  Shaoqi, H.E. Premier Zhou Enlai, H.E. Marshal Chen Yi, and H.E.  Chairman Li Xiannian went personally to Cambodia to give us  cooperation and assistance. Later, H.E. Deng Xiaoping, the  esteemed chairman, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li  Peng; H.E. Chairman Qiao Shi, and others have performed  excellently in continuing the good traditions of friendship and  cooperation with me and the Cambodian government. The PRC has  helped us regain national reconciliation and security through  the Paris Conference on Peace in Cambodia held in 1991. China  has played a big role in that effort. Within the framework of  the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], China also  played a big role in helping Cambodia to achieve national  reconciliation, peace, and the possibilities of rebuilding the  nation. The Chinese people and nation have helped us in the  national reconstruction to enable us to enjoy peace and  prosperity following over two decades of war and misery.  Throughout our life and the history of Cambodia, we will never  forget this contribution of the PRC. We will always respect the  PRC, which has made great contributions to us.    Therefore, the basis of our friendship is the fact that we  know each other very well and respect each another like real  brothers. The many Chinese people who have had family ties to  Cambodia since time immemorial and those Cambodians with Chinese  blood represent another good bridge of friendship that has  always bound our two countries together. The common ideals of  justice, progress, freedom, independence, and mutual trust --  the correct ideals for all mankind -- are the basis for what has  always bound us together.    Another point is China's concern for the fate of Cambodia;  they view it as the fate of the Chinese nation. China has  always wanted Cambodia to enjoy prosperity and live forever with  its independence and territorial integrity. We regard great  China as our second motherland; that is, we love China  wholeheartedly. We love each other without seeking to gain any  personal benefit from each other; that is, we are honest with  each other and are determined to defend our common ideals in the  international arena and contribute to world peace and the  development of various countries.    These are the major principles and the main basis that will  always bind our countries together as great friends and brothers  and will help to strengthen our cooperation and solidarity.    [(Li Bun)] [Words indistinct] the outcome of your visit?    [Sihanouk] First is the enhancement and consolidation of the  basis for the traditional bonds of friendship and solidarity  between our two countries, peoples, and nations, and between the  leaders and governments of our two countries -- the PRC and the  Kingdom of Cambodia. We decided to cooperate in all fields  based on the ideals of friendship, fraternity, mutual trust, and  mutual interest in defending our common ideals in the world.    Second, China -- that is, the respected PRC -- wants to  honor  me as a longstanding and faithful friend of nearly 40 years. In  other words, because the Cambodian nation and people restored me  as king of Cambodia, the PRC wants to express its highest  consideration to the Cambodian king to show that it supports the  Cambodian king for his loyal service to the nation. This  service will enable Cambodia to achieve all the noble [words  indistinct] peace, independence, and territorial integrity.    Third, the PRC today -- as in the past; since the 1950's and  1960's -- wants to show its sincere desire to help Cambodia. It  wants to help so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and prosperity  through national reconstruction. The PRC has given Cambodia  aid. When the two Cambodian prime ministers paid an official  visit recently at the amiable invitation of H.E. Premier Li  Peng, the PRC gave an additional sum of aid to the Cambodian  nation. H.E. Jiang Zemin has said the PRC will continue to help  us.    Finally is the knowledge that the Cambodian delegation and  I... [pauses] Cambodia has learned from the overall prosperity  the PRC has accomplished under the leadership of H.E. Chairman  Deng Xiaoping, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, and the CPC. They  have set a good example for the Third World -- including  Cambodia -- on how to carry out reforms and modernization; how  to make contact with the outside world; how to build and make  the country prosperous; and especially how to make progesss in  the fields of the economy, industry, public works, justice, and  so on. The progress the PRC has made over the past few years  (?is an encouragement to) Cambodia and people around the world.  It is a big lesson for us.    I was greatly encouraged by the leaders of the Chinese  nation  and people; that is, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li  Peng, and H.E. NPC [National People's Congress] Chairman Qiao  Shi. They met with me and said on behalf of the PRC that they  support (?King) Sihanouk in his efforts to seek a basis for  building the nation and making it prosper quickly. That basis  is peace; that basis is to achieve national reconciliation,  solve national problems, end the war, institute a cease-fire,  and settle all disputes and conflicts between the Royal  Government of Cambodia and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea  through peaceful means. We must only use peaceful means. Their  excellencies the PRC leaders and I are of the same opinion and  views; 100 percent. This is a great encouragement to me. I  feel greatly encouraged by the PRC leaders, who share my view  that this matter must be resolved quickly so that the time for  national construction is not wasted. We must only use peaceful  means. It is a [words indistinct] I highly value my intimate  and fraternal conversations with H.E. President Jiang Zemin,  H.E. Premier Li Peng, and H.E. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi. Thank you.    [(Li Bun)] [Question indistinct]    [Sihanouk] I think that this reply will be in accordance  with  the desire to know.    [(Li Bun)] Your Majesty, we at the international radio have  enjoyed the support and encouragement of Your Majesty and the  Cambodian people. This has encouraged us to continue striving  to serve the friendship between Cambodia and China.    [Sihanouk] I would like to take this auspicious occasion to  express my respect, admiration, commendation, and gratitude to  our Chinese brothers and sisters in the national radio,  television, and press sectors who have given us immense support.  This is because the PRC's radio, television, and press have  genuine might and prestige in the national and international  arenas. They have helped to disseminate information -- not only  inside great China but also in the international arena -- on the  Cambodian situation; developments, problems, and the efforts of  the Cambodian people and nation toward national construction and  defense. They have helped the international community come to  know and understand us well. Therefore, I would like to express  my heartfelt and deep respect, commendation, and gratitude to  all our Chinese friends -- brothers and sisters -- who are  members of the PRC's national radio, press, and television.  Thank you.    [(Li Bun)] Thank you.</p>

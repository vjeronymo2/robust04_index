			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bertam to purchase three more plantations BERTAM Holdings has announced further acquisitions in line with its policy of investing in plantation and development land in Malaysia, with a view to participation in further schemes with Malaysian partners. It has conditionally agreed to buy Sungkai Estates and Rembia Rubber from Rowe Evans Investments for Pounds 4.27m cash, and Lendu Rubber Estates from Lendu Holdings for some Pounds 1.37m cash. Rowe Evans will use the proceeds to reduce borrowings and focus operations and expansion in Indonesia, while Lendu intends to focus on agricultural projects in Australia, particularly in relation to the 81 per cent investment in Gubbagunyah, southern Queensland. As Rowe Evans holds 33.65 per cent of Bertam, shareholder approval will be needed; also the three acquisitions are conditional upon completion of the disposal of 2,000 acres of Bertam to its joint venture company, expected by the end of October. For the time being all three estates will continue to be operated as plantations. But Bertam intends to exploit the industrial development potential of Rembia and Lendu, subject to relevant local regulatory consents. All three companies also announced results for 1991. Helped chiefly by the firmer palm oil market, Bertam lifted pre-tax profit to Pounds 1m (Pounds 810,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 1.11m). Earnings per share were 3.09p (2.62p) and the dividend is 2.5p (2p). Also resulting mainly from the oil palm market, Rowe Evans produced sales of Pounds 3.93m (Pounds 3.49m) and pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.35m). Earnings per share slipped to 1.85p (2.05p) but the dividend is again 1p. There were recovery signs in wool and wheat markets for Lendu. Its turnover rose to Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 408,000) and its pre-tax deficit was cut to Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 138,000). Losses per share came to 0.39p (1.08p) and the dividend is held at 0.3p.</p>

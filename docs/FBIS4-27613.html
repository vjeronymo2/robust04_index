			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese and U.S. Governments have decided to  cooperate in building next-generation communications networks.  The two countries have agreed to include telecommunications as  a "cooperation sector" in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    A Japan-U.S. roundtable on telecommunications policy may be  set up in September to start work on standardizing advanced  communications and broadcasting systems and equipment.    There have been forums at the governmental level on this  subject between Europe and the United States, or between Japan  and Europe -- for instance, the "Japan-Europe Telecommunications  Forum" -- since the beginning of the 1990's. The start of the  planned consultations between Japan and the United States will  practically expand international cooperation in  telecommunications into a trilateral framework.    The "cooperation sectors" in the framework talks, unlike the  sector-by-sector negotiations which deal with bilateral economic  friction, refer to sectors where the two countries will promote  cooperation from a global perspective. This includes such  issues as environment and population, and telecommunications has  been included as one sector under commercial technology.    A concrete step in bilateral telecommunications cooperation  is the standardization of next-generation communications and  broadcasting systems and equipment. The two countries are  presently working on a number of large-scale projects to build  next-generation communications networks, including the Global  Information Infrastructure (GII), the National Information  Infrastructure (NII) of the United States, domestic networks for  Japan, and the Asian Information Infrastructure (AII).  Standardizing systems and equipment used in these projects will  facilitate mutual participation of companies from both countries  and prevent bilateral friction.    Furthermore, standardization of equipment will enable mass  production to cut costs, and will give the two countries a  technological advantage in similar projects in other regions.    In discussions on communications cooperation, the Ministries  of Posts and Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs will be the  government offices in charge on the Japanese side, while the  Departments of Commerce and State, the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC), and the Office of U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR), and others will participate on the U.S. side.  Telecommunications and broadcasting companies, and  communications equipment makers will also be invited to  participate when necessary.    Cooperation in telecommunications was suggested by Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to President Bill Clinton during the  Japan-U.S. summit in April 1993, and the President agreed to the  proposal. However, the United States postponed discussions due  to the intensifying economic friction. The two countries now  plan to begin preparatory meetings in early June, and hold the  first official meeting around the time of the plenipotentiaries'  meeting of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in  Kyoto from mid- September to early October.    Since inauguration of the Clinton administration, the U.S.  Government has given much emphasis to information policy. Apart  from working on building a national information network under  the NII program, it proposes building an international computer  communications network under GII. On the other hand, the  Japanese Government has proposed the AII program covering the  Asian countries. It has started to invite Asian countries to  get involved in this plan by sounding out the ROK government on  possible participation in early May. Japan and the United  States want to accelerate building the infrastructure for the  multimedia age by promoting information policy coordination.</p>

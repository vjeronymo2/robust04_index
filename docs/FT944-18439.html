			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leftwingers capture two NEC seats Two leftwingers were unexpectedly elected to Labour's ruling national executive committee yesterday in a setback to Mr Tony Blair's drive to modernise the party. In elections for seven constituency representatives - the first under one-member-one-vote rules - Mr Dennis Skinner and Ms Diane Abbott were elected in fifth and last places. Ms Abbott, the MP for Hackney North, was elected - after failing to win enough votes for outright election - under a rule requiring two members of the constituency section to be women. However, in a demonstration of the left's continuing ability to mobilise activists' votes, the highest-scoring loser was Mr Ken Livingstone, the leftwing MP for Brent East. Mr Skinner, the veteran MP for Bolsover, returns to the national executive a year after being voted off with Mr Tony Benn, the MP for Chesterfield, at the low-water mark of leftwing influence. The results are an embarrassment to the modernising Labour leaders around Mr Blair, who had hoped that three vacant constituency section places would be filled by sympathisers. Mr Jack Straw, MP for Blackburn, and Mr Blair's leadership campaign manager, was the only modernist candidate elected. Ms Mo Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith, shadow cabinet supporters of Mr Blair, both scored fewer votes than Ms Abbott. Mr Livingstone said the election results were a warning to Mr Blair to recognise the substantial level of rank-and-file support for leftwing policies. Mr Blair's friends said the election would make little difference to the political balance of the national executive, which remains largely supportive of the leadership. They pointed to strong support for two sitting allies of Mr Blair - Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury chief secretary - as evidence of backing for modernisation. The leftwing tide did not extend to the trade-union section, which elects 12 members to the national executive. Mr Arthur Scargill, the mineworkers' leader, was cheered during an attack on the leadership, but finished third from bottom of the poll with fewer than half the votes needed for election. However, the elections, combined with the re-emergence of the union block vote in spite of its abolition last year, fuelled fears among modernisers that the left might regain control of the national executive unless Labour's constitution is reformed. The Labour co-ordinating committee, a modernising pressure group, will today call for a radical review to reduce union influence, extend individual voting and extend national executive representation to excluded groups such as councillors. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, topped the constituency section poll followed by Mr David Blunkett, party chairman. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former acting leader who left the national executive after failing to win re-election as deputy leader, topped the poll for five women's-section representatives.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cap'n Bob press-gangs Andy Capp for launch ANDY CAPP, the cartoon character whose idea of work is lifting a pint, was yesterday press-ganged into Robert Maxwell's marketing campaign for the sale of almost 50 per cent of Mirror Group Newspapers. The Mirror cartoon favourite has been recruited to a press and television campaign to boost interest among readers and other private investors in the sale of the MGN stake. The pathfinder prospectus launched yesterday in London will form the basis on which shares are marketed to institutions. The float aims to raise about Pounds 250m for the group, which comprises the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and The People and the Scottish papers, the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail. MGN also has two specialist racing papers and two free papers in Scotland. In the prospectus these titles are being accounted for as Pounds 625m worth of intangible assets. Total net assets in the pro forma balance sheet, prepared as if the company were already floated, are Pounds 840.3m. MGN is also involved in contract printing and the syndication of newspaper material and has interests in two North American companies: Quebecor Printing and Donohue, a forest products group. Prospectus pro forma pre-tax profits for last year amount to Pounds 83.4m. That is after an interest saving arising from application of Pounds 210m of the proceeds to repayment of bank borrowings. The balance of the sale proceeds will go to repay a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings, a family company. Compared with yearly figures for 1990, circulation of the four main titles suffered slight declines in the first quarter.</p>

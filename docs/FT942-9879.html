			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Kingshott moves to John Jacobs from Sally Michael Kingshott, 47, is quitting his job as chief executive of Sally UK, the cross-channel ferry operator that he founded, to take over at John I Jacobs, an old-established firm of shipbrokers and shipowners. Kingshott, an insurance broker by training, has been involved in the shipping and transportation industry since 1964. He takes over from John Jacobs, 74, who has headed the company since 1967. Jacobs is staying on as chairman of the company until a successor is found. Kingshott wants to develop Jacobs into a more broadly-based shipping, transportation and property group. He says that in five years he hopes Jacobs will look more like P &amp; O or Trafalgar House but without their problems.</p>

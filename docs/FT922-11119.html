			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Letter: Unions argue that lack of funds seriously restricts EOC Sir, As the local trade union representatives at the Equal Opportunities Commission, we were shocked to read in Diane Summers's article ('EOC is criticised over value for money', April 22) that the recent review of the EOC would find that it failed to provide value for money. We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that the report being prepared will include such allegations, but there is plenty to suggest that the commission is constantly achieving the impossible on a shoestring. The EOC has brought pioneering cases under the equality legislation, carried out substantive investigations and produced authoritative research and reports. By its very nature, the work is labour-intensive and the expertise of the staff is its most important resource. These criticisms can only come from an attempt to discredit the report and the EOC by implying that money spent on equal opportunities is money wasted. The real issue is the pitiful amount of money provided by the government in the first place. The EOC's grant-in-aid has been drastically cut in real terms for years. Consequently, our abilities to fulfil the statutory duties outlined in the Sex Discrimination Act and Equal Pay Act are now seriously restricted. Staff are already stretched to give legal advice on a wide range of issues to the thousands of people, mostly women, who have suffered as a result of discrimination, and who cannot afford a solicitor and usually have nowhere else to go for help. What we clearly need are more staff and more resources, and it is the government that is to blame for undermining yet another vital public service. Our respective unions have long campaigned for a properly funded EOC, and our members at the commission intend to continue fighting to defend our jobs and conditions, the service we provide to the public, and also the importance of equal opportunities in a far from equal society.

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A mint-condition example of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's 1891 music hall poster  "Moulin Rouge" set a world poster auction record of $220,000 during a  $1.2-million auction of 540 rare posters in New York. The 30-square-foot  lithograph was sold to an American private collector who asked to remain  anonymous. The previous world auction record for a poster was $95,000 paid in  1987 for another example of "Moulin Rouge" in Paris. The poster, advertising  "concert and dancing every night," shows the popular entertainer La Goulue --  "The Glutton" -- dancing the can-can.  </P></p>

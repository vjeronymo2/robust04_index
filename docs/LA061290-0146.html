			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> BRANCH MERGES WITH COUNTYWIDE YMCA  </P> <P> The Newport/Costa Mesa YMCA has merged with the Orange County YMCA to save on  operating costs and avoid the possibility of closing.  </P> <P> The Orange County YMCA now oversees the fiscal operations of eight branches in  the county, taking care of payroll, personnel, accounting and data processing.  </P> <P> "This moves all the technical support functions into one office and frees up  the local branch staff to run the programs," said Jerry Nutter, president of  the Orange County YMCA.  </P> <P> The merger became effective June 1, but representatives of both sides signed  the agreement Monday night. Nutter said he does not anticipate laying off any  of the 45 full- or part-time workers because of the move.  </P> <P> "Instead, this moves them to more productive roles," he said.  </P> <P> The Newport/Costa Mesa branch, 2300 University Drive, Newport Beach, with a  $1.3-million annual budget, was operating under a $380,000 deficit that could  have forced it to close, Nutter said.  </P> <P> "That was definitely in the wings," he said. "We were concerned because that  community deserves a 'Y.' "  </P> <P> The majority of a branch's funds, nearly 90%, come from fees generated from  classes and the use of its facilities. The rest comes from sustaining  membership donations and funds from the United Way.  </P> <P> George Scobas, executive director of the Newport/Costa Mesa branch, said the  merger will not eliminate any of the programs or classes offered at that  branch.  </P> <P> "I think we'll be stronger for it. This gives us more discipline on how monies  are spent and how the facilities are developing. There's also somebody looking  over the operation of the branch," he said.  </P> <P> The branch offers child care, an aquatics program, summer camp activities and a  parent-child program.

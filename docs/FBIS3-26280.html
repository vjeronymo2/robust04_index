The Hong Kong Government has sent China a new airport  financing package, offering to pump about 7.76 billion U.S.  dollars into the project and reduce the overall debt burden.    A Hong Kong-based spokesman for the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG) told KYODO news service by telephone that  the latest offer is "a distinct improvement" on three previous  ones which all sought a greater level of debt.    "We still need time to study the proposals fully but it's  fair to say that we are more optimistic than before that an  agreement can be reached," the spokesman said.    "I can't tell you exactly when we will respond to the  proposals, especially with the Chinese New Year holiday coming  up, but it should not be too long." The holiday is February 9  and 10.    The spokesman declined to speculate when China might be  prepared to attend a JLG airport committee meeting to hammer out  a final funding agreement, but said the new proposals have  "improved the prospects" for such a meeting.    Under the latest plan, the Hong Kong Government would dip  into its huge fiscal reserves to help pay for airport projects  and reduce the amount of debt payable after China resumes  sovereignty over the territory in July 1997.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO FOR THE MOMENT  </P> <P> Manuel Escobedo, atop a galloping palomino, thundered alongside a fleeing steer  and seized its tail barehanded. But the steer slipped his grasp and dashed off,  its dignity intact.  </P> <P> "No luck for Manuel Escobedo," an announcer boomed in Spanish over loudspeakers  to a few dozen spectators in the grandstands. Escobedo, disappointed that the  steer had not fallen, trotted off while a ragtag brass band pumped out an  energetic Mexican march.  </P> <P> It was a scene straight out of a Mexican rancho. One would never guess that  this was really Saugus, just three miles up a canyon road from a burgeoning  suburban housing tract. But for six months, 20 to 30 horsemen have gathered  each Sunday afternoon at a whitewashed riding ring in San Francisquito Canyon  to test their horses and their skills in the classic Mexican rodeo or  charreada.  </P> <P> For just a few hours, Saugus is transformed into Zacatecas, Durango or Jalisco,  all Mexican states rich in the traditions of the Mexican cowboy or charro. The  weekly events are a chance, said Escobedo, "to conserve our Mexican culture."  </P> <P> The arena was built along San Francisquito Canyon Road a year ago by Leonardo  Lopez, an Encino resident and owner of a chain of Mexican restaurants.  Originally from the Mexican state of Durango, Lopez, 39, also heads an  association of charros that includes horsemen from the San Fernando, Santa  Clarita and neighboring valleys.  </P> <P> The ring has become a regular stopping place for some of the 27 other charro  associations in the state. For a $6 fee, fans can cheer and jeer the charros  and listen to a brass band or mariachis. A few extra dollars buys beer and  tacos. Cheapskates, unwilling to pay, sometimes park their trucks on a nearby  bluff and, standing on the roofs, watch the proceedings from afar.  </P> <P> The rodeos have not gone without criticism. Some neighbors have complained  about the band music that fills San Francisquito Canyon each Sunday. Some  spectators have blocked driveways with their cars or dumped litter.  </P> <P> "Some of them are pretty careless about throwing away their beer cans," said  Linda Cullen, who lives on the 80-acre Lady Linda Ranch next door. But, Cullen  added, Lopez has responded to the complaints. "It's improved since they first  came out," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> '100% Mexican'  </P> <P> On a recent Sunday, the ever-present announcer promised a sparse crowd that  "these charreadas are 100% Mexican." For the most part, that's true. Spanish  was the language of the day, and the tempting aroma of carnitas -- pork  simmering in a big black caldron -- overpowered the smell of corrals.  </P> <P> But the charreadas, through an appealing mix of American mass culture and  Mexican tradition, offered reminders that this really was Saugus. Two fans in  the grandstands recorded the competition on videotape. A little boy twirling a  lasso wore a western shirt, chaps -- and a Boston Red Sox cap. While most  charros swigged Budweisers, one sipped Perrier.  </P> <P> The events in the charreada, however, have not been changed and differ from  those in American rodeos. While cowboys ride bulls and broncos one-handed for a  maximum eight seconds, charros use two hands and hold on until they give out or  the animals give up.  </P> <P> Only Mexicans perform the coleadero, a feat in which points are awarded for  sending a charging steer tumbling with a yank on the tail. The points vary,  depending on where and how the animal falls down. Charros can even lose points  for a bad performance. The scoring is so complicated, the charros said, judges  often keep an open rule book at their side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Activists Disapprove  </P> <P> Animal activists have branded the coleadero and other charreada events as  inhumane to animals. But on a recent Sunday in Saugus, the steers seemed to be  winning.  </P> <P> Manuel Escobedo was the fourth charro to fail in the coleadero. Seven more  tried without success. Some never touched the tail. "Zero points for Ruben  Gutierrez," blared the loudspeaker.  </P> <P> The 12th rider up was Fernando Lopez, the 11-year-old son of Leonardo Lopez.  Perhaps by accident, or perhaps as a joke, he was sent after the largest steer  of the day, a muscular animal of mottled brown and black. He held the tail  briefly before letting go.  </P> <P> Fernando later recalled that once, at a different charreada, a steer actually  went down after he tugged its tail. "That was luck," he said. "It tripped over  something."  </P> <P> Fernando would have no such luck today. It seemed that neither would anyone  else. The steers outwitted three riders after him.  </P> <P> Finally, charro Rodrigo Barunda snatched a steer's tail and wrapped it around  his outstretched right leg. The steer pulled right, but Barunda pulled left.  The steer went down and the crowd cheered. Even the spectators on the nearby  bluff applauded.  </P> <P> It's hard work. Risky too. "They can lose fingers," Escobedo said. In the world  of charros, "everything is dangerous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Tradition  </P> <P> Escobedo, like most of the charros, is originally from Mexico. A ruggedly  handsome man of 42, he learned to ride on a ranch in Zacatecas. As his father  had taught him, he is teaching his own son, Esteban, 10, to rope and ride. "He  rides well," he said with satisfaction.  </P> <P> The lure of the charreada is understandable for Escobedo and other Mexican  immigrants. The rodeo is the national sport of Mexico and charros have been  long celebrated in songs, movies and on television. So just as the charreada  transforms Saugus into a slice of Jalisco, the weekly event also transforms  ordinary men into the dashing Mexican equivalent of John Wayne.  </P> <P> Consider Gerardo Gandara, 29, a native of Zacatecas living in Sylmar. During  the week, "I'm a truck driver," he said. But on horseback, the stocky man is  surprisingly agile and graceful, completely in control. The tiny crowd cheered  as Gandara skillfully roped a sprinting mare.  </P> <P> It's doubtful that the Saugus charros perform to hear the roar of the crowd.  The grandstands could hold more than 100, but sometimes just 60 people attend.  Sometimes 40.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, nobody," said a guard at the gate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friendly Competition  </P> <P> The small crowd does not discourage the riders. "This is nothing more than  practice," Escobedo said. And although the announcer awarded points for  well-performed feats, nobody kept score. "This is a friendly competition," he  said.  </P> <P> To be sure, the state's charro associations sometimes compete for titles. But  often enough, they ride just for the sake of riding. James H. Nottage, chief  curator of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park, said  charros traditionally have savored their sport not for awards, but for the  demands it places on man and beast.  </P> <P> In the 1800s, Mexican cowboys in California sometimes would rope grizzly bears  "as a matter of sport," Nottage said. "Of course, it was a very risky  competition."  </P></p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / RHM plans split to fight bid RANKS Hovis McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group facing a Pounds 780m cash bid from Hanson, the Anglo-US industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced plans to split into three companies. Mr Stanley Metcalfe, RHM chairman, said the demerger plan was 'the most effective way of delivering the value that is within the group to RHM shareholders' and would give them an alternative to the Hanson offer. RHM shareholders would receive shares in each of three companies: A milling and baking group, including bread brands such as Hovis and Mother's Pride, as well as Federal Bakeries, which RHM bought yesterday from Dalgety, the food group, for Pounds 28m. A grocery products company, including Bisto gravy mixes, Robertson's jams, Keiller and Golden Shred marmalade. A cake manufacturer, including the Mr Kipling brand. Mr Metcalfe said that rather than Hanson selling parts of the business for more than it had paid for the group, RHM's own shareholders should benefit. He acknowledged that the demerged businesses could be taken over. RHM's board had been concerned for months about the fall in its share price, which reached a low of 135p in mid-September, Mr Metcalfe said. Various options had been considered to address the fall before Hanson bid. 'Whilst it may be true that Lord Hanson (Hanson's chairman) has provided a stimulus for these proposals, I would not wish to dent his modesty by overstating that point,' he said. Lord Hanson responded by saying: 'Modesty undented, I continue to believe that our cash offer fully values RHM.' Mr Metcalfe said the demerger would reward shareholders for their loyalty on previous bid occasions. The group turned down an offer of 465p a share in 1988. Lord Hanson countered that 'since 1988 this loyalty has cost shareholders half the value of their investment'. It echoes the step taken by Imperial Chemical Industries in July when it said it would split into two companies. Hanson had taken a small stake in ICI last year and although it did not bid, ICI was put under pressure to improve its performance. BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, demerged its retailing and paper-making subsidiaries after Sir James Goldsmith threatened an 'unbundling' bid in 1989. Lord Hanson said the stock market's reaction to RHM's announcement 'bears out our view that there is no added value in these proposals'. RHM shares rose 5p to 246p, 26p above Hanson's cash offer.

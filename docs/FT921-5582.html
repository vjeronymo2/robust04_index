			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Bowater There is something of a fin de siecle feel about two highly leveraged packaging businesses simultaneously returning to the big company fold. Add in the names of Mr Michael Ashcroft and Mr Roland Franklin and the effect for some will be pure 1980s nostalgia. Turning to the more serious matter of making money in the 1990s, Bowater's purchase of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging makes good strategic sense. Between them the acquired companies increase their parent's presence in the profitable niche markets of healthcare and pharmaceuticals packaging, while providing a substantial platform for expansion in continental Europe. DRG and Cope, in turn, will have access to Bowater's financial resources and should thus be able to make good the years of capital expenditure neglect. While cash strapped buy outs generally leave little scope for further working capital reductions, it would be surprising if Bowater does not get to work quickly on margins. And thanks to the way the deal is structured, there should be no earnings dilution in the first year. Yet there is little room for the shares to disappoint. They have outperformed the market by two thirds over the last two years, but more to the point are trading on a 16 per cent premium to the market's prospective multiple for 1993 on the most optimistic forecasts for profit.</p>

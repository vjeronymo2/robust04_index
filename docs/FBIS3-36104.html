Botnaru stated that so far Moldovan officials are satisfied  with the results of CSCE Mission's activity. CSCE Mission  recommendations on setting the Dniester conflict were examined  at the highest level and are accepted as a basis for continuing  the negotiations. The minister said the recent events in  Dniester denote an agony of the unconstitutional structures and  that Tiraspol regime loses its social basis. "We almost reached  an agreement on granting a special juridical status to East  districts, in the context of territorial and administrative  reform and decentralization of power. Of course, it does not  mean federalization or division of territories," pointed out  Botnaru. He added the most destabilizing external factor is the  presence of Russian 14th Army in Moldova. Samuel stated to BASA  that he is just getting acquainted with Mission's activity. He  wishes to travel trough Moldova and waits for the Thursday [3  February] meeting with President Snegur in order to contact the  sides involved in the controversies. Samuel also asserted that  "Mission's main purpose is to accomplish the CSCE Mandate  continuing to activate in directions established and supported  by his predecessors." It is not the moment to make concrete  proposals; we will resume our work where it was finished and we  will find new possibilities for positive involvement of CSCE,"  said Samuel.</p>

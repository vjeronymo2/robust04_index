			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Algeria appoints prime minister MR Belaid Abdessalam, who once swore to make Algeria 'the Japan of Africa by the year 2000' was appointed the country's prime minister yesterday after the resignation of Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, who had held the post for only 13 months. The change came 10 days after the assassination of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the head of state. Mr Ghozali said he was resigning primarily to allow Mr Ali Kafi, who replaced Mr Boudiaf, to appoint his own 'strong government capable of eliminating the forces of evil which have not ceased seeking the destabilisation of the state to achieve power'. Mr Ghozali's tenure encompassed the cancellation of multi-party elections which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. The High State Council, the five-man presidency, said yesterday his government had carried out its task efficiently 'in the harshest moments of Algeria's life'. However, he had become increasingly unpopular, and the lack of security around Mr Boudiaf when he was killed drew particularly fierce criticism from Algerians. Mr Abdessalam's austere nationalism will appeal to many Algerians. As economic overlord from 1964 to 1978, Mr Abdessalam, aged 64, is also remembered for appointing people for their competence rather than their family and regional ties. He has spent 13 years in the wilderness but foreign observers - and in particular Algeria's creditors - will be asking whether he has changed his interventionist economic spots sufficiently to help steer the troubled country through painful economic reform. Mr Abdessalam was on the provisional executive of the National Liberation Front (FLN) at the time of independence in 1962. Together with then President Houari Boumediene he shaped Algeria's oil policy, nationalising foreign oil interests in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Such moves earned him the lasting antagonism of the French. He built up Sonatrach, the oil and gas monopoly, into a respected company where Algerian nationals were responsible for most decisions. His policy of large-scale industrialisation was much less successful and many of the difficulties Algeria has faced in the past decade came from the over-ambitious industrial investment made in those years. Mr Abdessalam was also a member of a regime which presided over a decrease in freedom as the 1970s went by. Few people dared speak out for fear of the security forces. Diplomats said yesterday that one of the challenges ahead was a decision on whether the trial of FIS leaders Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, on charges punishable by death, would go ahead next Sunday.</p>

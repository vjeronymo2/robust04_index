			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo steady Further heavy two-way business developed in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production stock, after the group confirmed the market's long-held view that the final dividend was doomed. Lasmo also announced big losses, heavy write downs, more asset sales and hosted a poorly-received meeting with analysts. The shares rose to 132p immediately following the results, which were broadly in line with analysts estimates, but later fell sharply, dipping to 124p, with Smith New Court, the securities house said to have forecast a drop in the shares to 100p. 'On fundamentals the shares are 20 per cent too high,' said a Smith analyst. By the close, however,the stock had rallied to 126p, a net fall of 2, with US institutions, which already hold over 20 per cent of Lasmo shares, said to have moved in to buy the stock. US investors view Lasmo as a BP-type recovery play and focus on the company's cash flow.</p>

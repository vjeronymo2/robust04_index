			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Harvey's Passion - Concert IT HAS taken 12 years for Passion and Resurrection, Jonathan Harvey's 1981 'church opera' for Winchester Cathedral, to make the journey to London. At Westminster Abbey, on Thursday, it left a remarkable impression - a 90-minute work of controlled mastery, economical in its forces (15 singers taking 18 parts, small orchestra), sure in their employment, and hypnotically powerful in overall effect - and so the delay seemed equally remarkable. Plainly, Passion and Resurrection ought by now to have won for itself a regularity of performance comparable at least to that of the Britten Church Parables, of which it is a distant relative. Harvey's aim was to make his drama - 12 scenes showing the final episodes of Christ's life, followed by his death and resurrection - flower out of church service in the manner of the medieval church dramas. So the opera is enclosed within a liturgical event, and the audience is invited to join in the congregational singing of plainsong hymns and the concluding Alleluias and Amen. But, far from proving too limiting, too 'localised' in scope, the blend of opera and liturgical ritual has been so precisely achieved that even to an outsider to Christian worship it affords a wholly gripping experience. The nice judgment of where exactly to place those hymns - at moments of climactic intensity in the unfolding of the narrative - is just one token of Harvey's distinctive, confidently sustained artistic vision. He has bound his scenes (most of them dialogues supported by spare accompaniment) by means of instrumental interludes which vary in style, vocal idiom and language according to the dictates of the dramatic moment - from modern resumes of church-musical forms in modal harmonies to agonisedly angular non-tonal outbursts. Another token of the composer's skill, highly yet unassumingly theatrical, is his placing and contrast of timbre - 'antique' brass echoing awesomely, the shiver and tremble of percussion, the haloes of high harmonics painted by the strings around the recitative. With beautifully calculated and contained radiance the austerity of the male-voice-dominated ensemble is eventually relieved by the female-voice incursions of the 'Resurrection Garden', which builds to a concord of honestly attained grandeur. The sum is a purposeful, compelling modern revival - from the inside, as it were - of an ancient artistic form. The text, extracted in modern-English translation (by Michael Wadsworth) from an Italian and a French medieval passion-plays, was on Thursday unclearly delivered by too many of the participants. This apart, the performance was of very fine quality - played by Docklands Sinfonietta, sung by Michael George (Jesus), Paul Agnew (Pilate) and Juliet Schiemann (Mary Magdalene) at the head of a devoted cast, and conducted by Martin Neary. As the latest offering of the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network, this simply staged Passion and Resurrection proceeds over the next ten days to the cathedrals of Canterbury, Liverpool, Sheffield and Llandaff, and to St Mary's Church, Bath. It is well worth catching in any of those places.</p>

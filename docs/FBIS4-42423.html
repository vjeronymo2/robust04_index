			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed J.Ve.: "Herman van Rompuy, Leo Delcroix, or </F> Melchior Wathelet -- The Tug of War for Dehaene's Successor Has  Already Begun"]    [Text] The leader of the Belgian federal government,  Jean-Luc Dehaene, is remaining stubbornly silent on the subject  of his possible move to the European Commission (EC). He has  never even given official confirmation that he has any ambitions  for this post. However, following the recent French-German  summit, it looks more and more as if those two countries intend  to venture out on European waters under Dehaene's captaincy.    It is not yet clear who might become head of the federal  government after Dehaene's departure. The CVP [Flemish  Christian People's Party] is only permitting itself the  observation that it would feel flattered if one of its members  was asked to take on the EC leadership. However, more than  this, CVP headquarters simply will not say. Who should be  Dehaene's successor? "Only if Dehaene should decide to go away,  which is still not necessarily the case, will the question of  his succession figure on the agenda."    So far, the CVP has two hotly tipped candidates: Herman van  Rompuy and Leo Delcroix. However, strangely enough, neither of  these two appears to be raring to lead the government. Earlier  on, Leo Delcroix humbly admitted that he still lacked the  competence to perform such a duty. Was that genuine modesty on  the part of the politician, or merely tactics? Herman van  Rompuy, too, has repeatedly made it known that he has no great  enthusiasm for taking on the leadership of the government. Here  again, the question as to genuine or false modesty must be  asked.    Could the CVP suddenly let the leadership of the government  slip out of its hands? Influential members of the CVP in the  chamber say that this cannot happen. Whispers in the corridors  of Parliament would suggest that the CVP must not be allowed to  relinquish the presidency of the federal government, especially  now that the fruits of the restructuring policy are slowly  beginning to ripen. Within the CVP, not everyone is convinced  that this viewpoint is correct. It is pointed out that it is  precisely the group that turned down the prime minister post in  1992 for the CVP in March 1992 that is now demanding it. So  it does not look as if we have a dogfight on our hands here.  However, even if there is no such fight, there is a third party  which is certainly hungry for one. Gerard Deprez, the president  of the PSC [Walloon Christian Socialist Party] has already on  more than one occasion thrown some encouragement in the  direction of Deputy Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet. Wathelet  speaks excellent Dutch and is therefore, even if he increasingly  answers in French questions put to him in Dutch, an acceptable  candidate in this respect. However, the disadvantage is  Wathelet's reputation as an eternal skeptic. So far the  Citizens' Charter has had no success, but that criticism is  partly unjustified, because security cannot be guaranteed by  laws and decrees.    Should Wathelet succeed Dehaene, there might be a problem of  parity. According to the Constitution, there must be an equal  number of Flemish and Walloon ministers. Nonetheless, as far as  this parity goes, no account has been taken of the community to  which the head of the government belongs, who is assumed to be  above any Flemish-Walloon differences. Ever since this parity  has come about, there has been an equal number of Flemish and  Walloon ministers, but Wilfried Martens and Jean-Luc Dehaene  were not counted. Were the rule implemented, Wathelet's place  as Dehaene's potential successor would have to be taken by a  Walloon minister, as opposed to a Fleming. However, people say  there is no need for this. The Constitution says that the  government must number as many Dutch-speaking as French-speaking  ministers "perhaps with the exception of the prime minister."  So the word "perhaps" could be taken to mean that Wathelet can  be included for the purposes of parity. However, with 15  ministers, it will become impossible to maintain parity if  Wathelet is counted as a Walloon. Unless he is divided down the  middle.</p>

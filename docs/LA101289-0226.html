			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UAL MACHINISTS PROTEST BUYOUT  </P> <P> The machinists union at United Airlines has asked the Labor Department to block  the proposed employee buyout of the airlines' parent company, claiming it  violates laws governing the use of retirement funds.  </P> <P> In a three-page letter sent Wednesday to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford  Dole, the union charged that the tax benefits of the proposed $6.75-billion  buyout "are effectively subsidizing a substantial and excessive windfall" to  UAL Corp.'s management and United's pilots, the employee group spearheading the  takeover effort.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, United's pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit $20 million from  their $1.2-billion pension fund to buy preferred stock in an employee stock  ownership plan.  </P> <P> The pilots are the only UAL employee group so far committed to participating in  the buyout.  </P></p>

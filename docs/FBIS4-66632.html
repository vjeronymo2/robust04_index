			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Taoufik Bouderbala, the new director of the </F> Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH--Ligue Tunisienne des droits  de l'Homme), by Ziyad Karichan and Lotfi Haji; place and date  not given--first four paragraphs REALITES introduction]    [Text] For more than a year, the LTDH [Tunisian Human  Rights League] has experienced a truly exceptional situation,  unprecedented in its history. After a marathon effort in recent  months, the League has been able to lay the ground for its  fourth conference, renew all of its branches, and--most  importantly--reanimate and revitalize its cadres.    The "exceptional" in all that has happened is that the  League  has been able to once again draw attention to itself, after many  had dismissed it.    The League has salvaged itself despite all that has been  said  and is being said regarding the holding of its conference, the  election of its leadership, and its resumption of regular  activity.    Moments after the announcement of the final results of the  vote [on the composition of the new board of directors], the new  board of directors elected a new director by a consensus of all  of its members. He is Taoufik Bouderbala, who was the secretary  general in the outgoing board. Given Taoufik Bouderbala's  previous and current responsibilities, no one is more suited  than he to speak of the League's past, present, and future. He  granted his first press interview to REALITES [AL-HAQA'IQ], for  which we are thankful. Let us listen to him.    [REALITES] Now that you have caught your breath after the  marathon preparations for your fourth conference, how do you  assess the results, before, during, and immediately after the  conference?    [Bouderbala] My initial, basic assessment is that the League  succeeded in preparing and holding the conference and in forming  a board of directors according to its bylaws and articles of  association. It should be emphasized that preparation for the  conference lasted more than four months, during which the  previous board of directors held numerous meetings to study the  admission of new members, the branches' conferences, and  preparations for the conference. The board of directors issued  statements inviting all those wishing to join the League, whose  precepts are compatible with the League's articles of  association, to apply for membership.    The board of directors delegated a five-member committee to  check the lists of membership applicants submitted by the 41  branches. The lists were then submitted to the board of  directors, which held five meetings to check the lists. We made  some revisions upon the request of the branches or members of  the board of directors. We did not go forward with the  conference until after the outgoing board of directors approved  by consensus the lists of persons joining all 41 branches.  Immediately after that, we established an agenda to renew the  branches' cadres. We agreed that this would be done through  elections or consensual installation if we were unable to hold  an electoral session. However, thank God, we were able to hold  41 general sessions in public places with complete openness,  with the attendance of at least three-quarters of the members of  the branches, and with the supervision of the board of directors.    No pressure of any type was exerted. However, we encountered  difficulties in three branches concerning members and the  composition of the branch. Some members did not accept the  covenant and wanted to hold an electoral session without  consideration of the covenant before elections. However, the  brothers who were supervising were able, after a dialogue with  the members, to install cadres with everyone's agreement (these  branches are in Nafta, Jendouba, and Beja).    [REALITES] This is not the first time that you have  personally participated in a League conference. Did you feel  that you were participating in a regular conference? Or did you  have a different feeling?    [Bouderbala] I felt that we were in an ordinary conference,  because we applied our articles of association and all of the  requirements of these articles. Hence, we called it the fourth  national conference of the League. As for the content of the  conference, it concerned the situation the League has been  experiencing. The emphasis was on the independence of the League  and its decisionmaking, and the need for it to exist, so that it  can perform its normal functions. The conferees all indicated  that they have no wish to return to the stagnation and paralysis  of the League prior to the conference.    [REALITES] For the first time in the League's history, a  unanimous or near unanimous agreement was not reached regarding  the League's board of directors. Two competing lists were  submitted to the conference. Do you attribute this situation to  the "League Covenant" list's certainty of its absolute victory  in elections, which is what actually happened, or to the fact  that the competing list, "the Independence List," put forth  conditions you considered unfair and impracticable?    [Bouderbala] I do not believe that matters were decided  before the conference. However, at the conference, some  conferees wanted or pretended to forget the League's principles.  We have tried to preserve the League's existence without being  in a position that would permit any party to infringe on its  legal and de facto existence. The conference is not a revocation  of the League's previous decisions.    All of the parties attempted to uphold the covenant and to  agree on a list with a maximum of 30 individuals. However, we  found that some parties refused to enter into this covenant or  wanted to enter the covenant on their own terms.    [REALITES] This conference indicated that there is a  majority  position and a minority position (almost a third) within the  League. How will you deal with this situation in the future?    [Bouderbala] In the wake of the conference, we do not  believe  that there is a minority or majority in the League. The  conference is first and foremost the League's conference. The  board of directors that was elected is the board of directors of  the League, which is to say all of the League's activists. It  will not discriminate between League members, and it will  transcend all of the competition that occurred between  individuals or the two lists during the conference. The  competition now focuses on the League's work. The board of  directors will continue its work with all of the branches. It  will formulate programs in coordination with all of the branches  and then announce those programs.    [REALITES] The current board of directors has undergone  major  renewal and rejuvenation. Will this new situation impede the  League's activity and spread?    [Bouderbala] I do not think so. Renewal indicates the  presence of new, exuberant life in the organization. We do not  believe that the activists who have borne responsibility for the  branches and struggled within them lack adequate experience to  continue the struggle along with the "veterans." They have the  same experience in the struggle, but on another level. The  important thing is to combine all efforts, so that the League  can continue its struggle. The League has existed for 17 years.  The new members of the board of directors were trained and  gained experience within the League. The League has been able to  train a generation of activists in its core cadres. These  activists have advanced within the League to positions of  responsibility. No outside party imposed these activists. They  are products of the League.    [REALITES] The League now has close to 4,300 members.  However, the outgoing board of directors deferred for your  consideration the status of 1,800 membership applicants. How  will you proceed in this regard, especially given that many have  expressed fear that these new members, if they are accepted,  will significantly disrupt the balance of power in the League?    [Bouderbala] We have agreed on this matter. We said that  those who have expressed a desire to join the League must not be  disregarded. The outgoing board of directors recommended to the  branches' boards that they give priority to admitting these  applicants when the admission process begins in 1994. Naturally,  only those who fulfill the requirements and criteria we  established in late 1993 will be admitted, all within the limits  of the branch's capacity. Perhaps the League will in the  future--even though it might be premature--create new branches.  In this case, priority will be given to these 1,800 applicants,  always bearing in mind that any citizen wishing to join the  League must fulfill the criteria and qualifications on which we  have agreed.    Then (starting in 1994), the new bylaws, which were amended  in the conference, will be applied to new applicants. Under the  amended bylaws, a new entrant must remain a candidate for two  years before becoming an active member. After that, the new  member can assume responsibility within the branch's board.  Then, after being a member for five years, a member can be  nominated to the board of directors.    [REALITES] What are the most pressing issues now facing you,  following the League's year-long period of frozen activity?    [Bouderbala] Our first concern is to restore the tie between  the board of directors and the branches and to set up the  League's structures by delegating committees to submit draft  programs in all fields, legal, economic, and cultural. After the  board of directors and branches approve these draft programs,  they will begin to be implemented. The League's main role is to  educate and thus inculcate the philosophy of human rights in all  citizens, regardless of their affiliations and theories. This is  a difficult task requiring persistence, endurance, and  insistence on principle.    Parallel with this activity, we will continue to support and  defend freedoms, monitor all violations, and undertake all  contacts and interventions needed to limit and contain these  violations.    We will also make efforts to develop human rights projects,  following the country's experience regarding the amendment of  several laws, especially the Protection [ihtifaz] Law,  Associations Law, and Press Law. This does not mean that we will  exclude other issues.    The League will undertake these tasks simultaneously on all  tracks.    [REALITES] All of the participants in the conference,  regardless of their political tendencies, agreed to reject the  amendments introduced to the Associations Law. Do you intend to  undertake tangible initiatives in this regard?    [Bouderbala] The board of directors adheres to the League's  positions that preceded the conference and that were emphasized  during the conference. In other words, the board of directors  still rejects the amendments introduced to the Associations Law  on 2 April 1992. The League has submitted to the administrative  court a challenge to the classification decision issued in May  1992. We are waiting for the administrative court's decision.    [REALITES] And in the meantime?    [Bouderbala] In the meantime, we have been reclaiming our  legal existence by:    1. The administrative court's decision, which suspended the  classification decision.    2. The election of a board of directors that will make  efforts to continue defending this position according to the  general bylaws issued at the conference, which affirm the board  of directors' decisions that provide the League with a legal  existence to continue its struggle.    [REALITES] And regarding freedoms?    [Bouderbala] The board of directors will continue its  efforts  within its committees by resuming its reception of citizens and  complaints. It will intervene with the authorities and wait for  solutions and responses. If it becomes clear that a response or  solution is not forthcoming, the League will issue statements to  inform public opinion and to alert the authorities.    [REALITES] Some members of the League are now expressing  fear  regarding the League's independence. Is this fear justified?    [Bouderbala] For me, the League's independence is a settled  matter. The League is either independent or not independent. It  will continue its efforts in complete independence. The  composition of the current board of directors, like that of  previous boards of directors, is the greatest guarantee of this  independence.    [REALITES] What is the content of this independence?    [Bouderbala] It consists of the fact that decisions flow  from  the board of directors and the members' consciences.    [REALITES] Must the League remain a counterbalance in order  to guarantee its independence? Or are there other forms of  independence that you are now considering?    [Bouderbala] The League is a nongovernmental counterbalance.  In other words, it is an independent organization. It does not  receive orders from any party, including the government,  political parties, or any other pressure group. Nor does it  issue orders to anyone. Rather, it draws attention, appeals for  help, and criticizes if necessary. It always advocates dialogue  and tries to preclude a breakdown of the dialogue between  different segments of society. The League tries to keep open the  channels of communication with all parties, especially the  government. The League does not treat anyone, including the  government, adversarially. It does not intend to act hostilely  toward anyone. Nor does it intend to play the role of  opposition, a union, or an association. It believes that each  has its role and characteristics in civilian society.    [REALITES] The country is approaching legislative and  presidential elections in about one month. Is the League  prepared for this important political event?    [Bouderbala] The League concerned itself in the past with  elections, especially the premature legislative and presidential  elections in 1989. The League believes that its activists in the  outlying areas are tantamount to observers. They perform their  regular role of informing the board of directors of any  violation that occurs on any day, especially during election  days.    The board of directors will deal with this subject, and, as  usual, it will have its say and adopt positions after studying  them.</p>

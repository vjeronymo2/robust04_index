			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Spoleto Festival Italy's best-known and most fashionable festival opens on Wednesday with a Poulenc double-bill, pairing his surreal opera 'Les mamelles de Tiresias' with a reconstruction of Nijinska's original choreography for 'Les Biches'. Spoleto is small, hot and very busy, but the programme offers something for everyone: the Martha Graham Dance Company, an Italian-language production of Arthur Miller's 'The Last Yankee', a new staging of Berg's 'Wozzeck' and concerts on the piazza.</p>

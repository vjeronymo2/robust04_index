			<p>BFN     [Text] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu received  this evening a Chinese military delegation led by Colonel  General Zhang Wannian, member of the Central Military Commission  and chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who  is visiting our country on the invitation of the Romanian  Ministry of National Defense. The meeting was attended by  Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina, chief of staff of the  Romanian Army.    After conveying to the Romanian prime minister greetings  from  his counterpart, the guest expressed satisfaction that the good  Romanian-Chinese relations, unaltered by the changes that have  taken place in international life, continue to develop in the  spirit of the old traditions that bind us.    The visit of the delegation that he is leading, through its  very rich program and through the various exchanges of opinions  that it occasions, makes a contribution to a better  familiarization of the sides with each other and to the  enhancement of relations of cooperation between the two armies  and two countries.    The prime minister assured the Chinese guest that the  Romanian people follow with keen interest China's outstanding  achievements on the road to economic reform in the past 15 years  and also assured him that this country, with its huge potential,  represents one of the current foreign political guide marks of  Romania.    As a continuation of bilateral contacts in the past months,  the visit to Romania of Li Peng, premier of the State Council of  the People's Republic of China, scheduled for summer 1994, is  expected with great interest, reads a press release faxed to us  by a spokesman for the government.</p>

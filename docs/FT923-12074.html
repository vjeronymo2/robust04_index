			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Groggy pound hauled back from the brink: Peter Marsh says talk of sterling devaluation will not end THE BIG battalions of the world's central banks yesterday helped pull the pound back from the brink. Even so, the worries over sterling may not yet be over. After scares about a possible sterling devaluation, the pound was looking groggy before concerted intervention on foreign exchange markets succeeded in lifting the currency. It closed last night in London against the D-Mark at DM2.8425, nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs up on the day's low of DM2.8282. That level, reached about lunchtime, represented the pound's lowest value against the German currency since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. The thrust of yesterday's operation - involving leading north American and European central banks, including the Bank of England - was to sell D-Marks for dollars. The action was designed primarily to prevent the US currency from sliding to its all-time low against the D-Mark. The German currency has gained strength in recent weeks, particularly after last Thursday's tightening in interest rates by the Bundesbank. Allowing the D-Mark to continue its appreciation against the dollar, a move exacerbated by recent interest rate cuts in the US and concern about the faltering US economy, was in few countries' interests. In the past week, the rampant German currency has led to serious strains in the ERM. It has caused Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands to increase their borrowing rates. The strong D-Mark also threatened rises in interest rates in other European nations, Britain included  just when they want to make borrowing cheaper to stimulate their flagging economies. Meanwhile, the weak dollar has also provoked concern on Wall Street. Hence yesterday's move by the central banks - led by the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank, and the first concerted intervention on such a scale since last July - came as little surprise. The immediate effect was to lift the dollar from DM1.447 before the action to a close last night in Europe of DM1.4815. As pressure on all other ERM currencies eased as a result of the weaker D-Mark, the pound firmed. Doubts remain that sterling is out of the woods. The last time it suffered similar fragility was in January, just after an earlier round of interest-rate tightening by the Bundesbank to reduce German inflation stimulated by unification. Then, the pound fought its way out of the doldrums. It was helped by strong statements from government ministers that devaluation was not on the agenda. That convinced the markets that - at the levels seen in January, of about DM2.83 or roughly 5 pfennigs above the pound's ERM floor of DM2.78 - the pound looked cheap and was a good buy. Six months on, the outlook has worsened. First, the UK recession has lasted longer than expected. That has increased pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to bring down base rates from 10 per cent - almost impossible given the pound's position as the weakest ERM currency. Second, the prospects for an imminent reduction in German borrowing rates look far from propitious. Indeed, many commentators expect the Bundesbank to follow up last week's 0.75 per cent increase in the discount rate - which mainly affects domestic bank borrowing - with a rise later this year in its more internationally important Lombard rate, now at 9.75 per cent. Third, while German short-term rates have moved up, US rates have come down, increasing the attractiveness to the international investor of the D-Mark and exacerbating ERM strains. Finally, there have been increasing doubts - barely evident in January  - about whether the Maastricht agreement on European economic and monetary union will unravel. Many investors see Emu and the ERM as linked. If Maastricht comes finally unstuck, perhaps after a large number of 'no' votes in the French referendum in September, then the faith of investors in the ERM as a vehicle for pegging Europe's currencies may be weakened. Those points explain why talk of a sterling devaluation - perhaps in the context of an ERM-wide realignment that increases the value of the D-Mark against the other currencies - is being taken much more seriously in the markets than in January. It may be a long, hot summer for sterling.</p>

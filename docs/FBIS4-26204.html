			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A national postal and telecommunications conference  opened in Hangzhou today. Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications Wu Jichuan and Vice Governor Zhang Qimei of  Zhejiang attended and spoke at the conference.    The conferees called for improving the organizational  planning and structural readjustment of first-class postal trunk  networks this year, by rationalizing the postal transportation  system, actively setting up independent and exclusive air postal  routes, ensuring a good job in the readjustment and distribution  of motor vehicle postal transportation networks, and  accelerating the completion of auxiliary equipment for  heavy-duty trucks and other supplementary facilities in a bid to  raise the postal transportation capacity.    They said: During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, there  will be 20 postal transport planes, 36,000 km air trunk postal  routes operated by the ministry, 9,700 motor vehicles for trunk  postal transportation, and 280,000 km of motor vehicle trunk  postal routes operated by the ministry, thereby gradually  setting up a relatively independent postal transport system  which comprehensively utilizes planes, motor vehicles, trains,  and ships and which combines routes operated by the ministry  with those operated by other departments consigned by the  ministry.</p>

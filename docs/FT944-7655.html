			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: UAP in accord for younger staff Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance companies, yesterday announced a labour contract with the government so that it can take on younger people. The group said its workforce was too old - with an average age of between 35 and 45 - and it wanted to employ younger people. About 250 of the existing staff will be going part-time and the remaining 150 will take on more flexible hours. UAP, privatised earlier this year, will hire 400 new staff next year, including large numbers of long-term unemployed, while placing an equivalent number of staff on part-time and flexible contracts. The accord, signed by Mr Jacques Friedmann, UAP's chairman, and Mr Michel Giraud, the French minister of labour, will require the state to pay up to 30 per cent of the salary of those working part-time for up to five years. In exchange, some 40 per cent of those hired by UAP during 1995 will have been unemployed for more than one year, and aged over 50. The rest will be younger than 30.</p>

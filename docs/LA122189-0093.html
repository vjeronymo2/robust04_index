			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> CHURCH AIDS FOOD BANK  </P> <P> The Westwood Presbyterian Church has donated $8,700 to the Westside Food Bank.  The money was raised through the church's annual musical benefit, held in July.  </P> <P> "This donation translates to more than 30,000 meals," said Bruce Rankin,  executive director of the food bank. "One benefit of this kind of support is  that it helps to keep many financially pressed families in their housing at  this critical time of the year."  </P> <P> The food bank was founded in 1981 by the Westside Ecumenical Conference, the  Interfaith Hunger Coalition and local social service agencies. It purchases and  collects surplus food and distributes it free to 33 nonprofit agencies serving  needy people in Santa Monica, Venice, Culver City, Westchester, West Los  Angeles, Beverly Hills and Inglewood.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 13 (MTI) -- Contrary to original  plans, the National Election Committee could not declare the  final official result of the parliamentary elections today, as  Mayor Gyula Varga of Kapuvar (W Hungary), a candidate of the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), has turned to the Supreme  Court to request a repeated re-count of valid and invalid votes  cast in the sixth constituency -- west Hungarian  Gyor-Moson-Sopron county.    As was reported earlier, Varga won the mandate in the May 29  elections by 10 votes, ahead of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] candidate Gyorgy Rasko, who subsequently asked for a  re-count by the National Election Committee. Based on this  re-count, in which the committee re-classified several invalid  votes as valid, and invalidated several valid votes, Rasko ended  up in first place.    According to Varga's information, there were many ballots  among those examined by the committee and classified valid which  should be invalid under the electoral law.    If the Supreme Court decides on the matter this Thursday,  the  National Election Committee will declare the final official  result of the elections that evening.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Reno's former deputy blasts anti-crime bill Mr Philip Heymann, the former deputy attorney general, has delivered a blistering critique on the effectiveness of important parts of the anti-crime legislation supported by the Clinton administration and now in front of Congress. Mr Heymann only left office last week following disagreements over 'management style' with Ms Janet Reno, attorney general. But in interviews published yesterday he sided with positions Ms Reno herself has frequently taken, particularly over the necessity of tackling the underlying social factors behind crime. His largest objection was to the 'three strikes and you're out' initiative, under which anyone convicted of three violent crimes would face life in prison without prospect of parole. This, he said, 'sounds terrific,' but 'doesn't make any sense'. He was afraid that the politics of crime 'has overwhelmed serious debate'. His opinions were at variance with some of those expressed by President Bill Clinton, who went to a police academy in Ohio on Monday to urge fast action on crime. The president again insisted that 100,000 more policemen were needed on the streets, but also said that legislation on mandatory sentencing, which he endorsed in his state of the union message last month, needed careful drafting. He again stressed the importance of community responsibility in combatting crime. White House officials, however, were not exactly pleased with Mr Heymann's interviews. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the senior adviser, sniffed 'it's a free country and we just disagree'. In Mr Heymann's view, mandatory life sentences wasted money by forcing the incarceration of those over the age of 50, by which time most criminal careers were winding down. He also thought building massive new regional prisons for violent offenders would strain resources.</p>

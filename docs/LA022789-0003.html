			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Pentagon plans call for closing Mather Air Force Base in four years, but  cleaning up hazardous waste there will take at least 30 years, according to Air  Force documents. The documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act,  show that the commission that recommended the base's closure did not determine  how toxic waste cleanup would affect the sale and conversion of Mather to other  uses. Nor did the commission conduct an environmental review of its plan to  move Mather's navigator training school to Beale Air Force Base 40 miles north  of Sacramento, even though its charter required such a review, according to the  records. The records also reveal that the panel did not study the effect of  closing Mather's hospital on medical treatment for the 43,000 military retirees  in the Sacramento area. Mather is one of 86 military installations nationwide  that the commission recommended be closed as a cost-saving measure.  </P></p>

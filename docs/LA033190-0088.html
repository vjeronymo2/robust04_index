			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIAN CAUSES ON SHORT END OF CHARITY GIFTS  </P> <P> While charitable interests such as United Way have begun more active courting  of Los Angeles' ethnic communities, a new report has found that less than half  of 1% of all donations from foundations and corporations in the region went to  Asian causes.  </P> <P> Given that Asian-Americans make up about 10% of the population in Los Angeles  County and have become the county's fastest growing ethnic group, Asian  community leaders met Friday to talk about becoming better charity recipients.  </P> <P> "An initial reaction to the study might be: 'Japanese (Americans) don't need  help,' " said Bill Watanabe, president of the Asian Pacific Planning Council,  which issued the report. He said that the council represents about 50 agencies  that serve the 10 major Asian Pacific communities in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The report stated that some Asian organizations are hampered by "the general  fallacy" of Asians being a "model minority" with fewer problems than other  ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Another problem, Watanabe said, is that Asian organizations historically have  had limited success in applying for grants. Many Asian groups, because they  have few or no ties to foundations, he said, assume that they will not get  grants.  </P> <P> "We are not criticizing or pointing fingers at the major funders," Watanabe  said at the meeting in Marina del Rey. "This study was done more in the spirit  of asking ourselves, 'Are we doing things right?' and 'Where do we go from  here?' We hope the donors are doing the same."  </P> <P> The study, which examined the four-year period from 1984 through 1987, profiled  corporations and foundations across the nation, as well as in Los Angeles. It  included a look at the philanthropic powerhouse, United Way.  </P> <P> Of the 360 charities funded by United Way in the Los Angeles-area, only eight  were Asian American groups. And, even though United Way funding increased from  about $200,000 in 1984 to $350,000 in 1988, the latest figure still represented  only .6% of its total donations. This year, United Way raised nearly $95  million.  </P> <P> The percentages for all corporate and foundation donations to Asian agencies  nationwide were similarly low, the report stated.  </P> <P> "We are not, in any way, going to fool ourselves into thinking that the United  Way network reaches all ethnic groups," said Leo Cornelius, president of the  United Way of Greater Los Angeles. "All I can say is we are taking a look at  what funding ought to be."  </P> <P> He added, however, "In some fashion, ethnic communities benefit from United  Way's agencies which address the issues that transcend any one community," such  as the lack of AIDS treatment centers and child care.  </P> <P> Cornelius, who was credited by Watanabe for initiating a "perestroika-type  effort" within the United Way, said that a 2-year-long reassessment of the  organization's priorities will end soon.  </P> <P> The Asian-funding study concluded that agencies need to persist in applying for  grants, thus giving donors the opportunity to learn more about the needs in the  community.  </P> <P> "People giving out the grants would like to know who they are giving their  money to," said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation,  one of the state's largest philanthropic donors. "They are human beings, after  all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> (Southland Edition) CHARITABLE DONATIONS  </P> <P> Contributions from foundations to various groups in the country and California:  </P> <P> Total foundation support in United States: $2.44 billion  </P> <P> Minority: $1.9 billion  </P> <P> Other: $2.25 billion  </P> <P> Total foundation support to California: $278.2 million  </P> <P> Minority in L.A. County $8.4* million  </P> <P> Los Angeles County $114.5 million  </P> <P> Other: $278.2 million  </P> <P> * Contributions to Asian non-profit organizations made up .39% of the total in  Los Angeles County. The contributions to Asian groups amounted to $384,500.  </P></p>

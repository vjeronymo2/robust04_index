			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Aylwin red-faced after spy disclosure THE disclosure of a secret police force that spied on military officers, trade union leaders and political opponents has seriously embarrassed President Patricio Aylwin's government in Chile. Mr Aylwin is being accused of emulating the dictatorial practices of his predecessor, General Augusto Pinochet. The spying scandal was disclosed by the Union of Independent Democrats (UDI), a small right-wing party best known for its loyalty to the former dictator. The scandal has allowed UDI to recapture the moral high-ground after being taunted for failing to defend human rights during Gen Pinochet's rule. 'This government was elected to correct the errors of the past, not to repeat them,' Mr Jovino Novoa, UDI's president, said at the weekend. The government has not contested the veracity of the classified documents that fell into the hands of its opponents. Mr Horacio Toro, chief of Investigaciones, the civilian police force, was forced to resign on Friday. President Aylwin wrote to him saying: 'Instructions issued under your orders . . . have gravely damaged the credibility of this government in the field of civil liberties.' Few Chileans believe, however, that Mr Toro acted on his own initiative. UDI has called for a parliamentary inquiry to determine who gave Mr Toro his orders. The police chief's immediate boss is the home secretary, Mr Enrique Krauss, who is one of President Aylwin's closest advisers. The documents revealed by UDI gave details of instructions to a 'special branch' of Investigaciones to report monthly on the activities of the government's political and trade union opponents, including their family lives. Of particular interest was a 'Falcon Plan' to keep tabs on Gen Pinochet's meetings with business leaders and politicians.</p>

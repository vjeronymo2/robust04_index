			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt holds firm over pits policy MR DAVID Hunt, employment secretary, last night emphasised the difficulties in expanding sales of deep-mined coal for electricity generation as hopes of a reprieve for the pits facing early closure continued to fade. In a boisterous Commons debate he faced a barrage of interruptions from Labour critics, and anxious questions from some Tory backbenchers, as he insisted that the government had not given any guarantee that 12 pits could be saved. Mr Hunt also angered Labour MPs by contending that privatisation would help to ensure a continuing role for Britain's coal industry. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, maintained that in spite of the cautious words used by ministers in public the press had been 'heavily briefed' that 12 pits would be saved. He said two of the pits were already doomed as a result of ballots in which the miners were offered an extra Pounds 10,000 on top of their redundancy payments if they voted for closure, and the other 10 were still at risk. Mr Cook argued that with the market 'rigged' against it British Coal could not be blamed because, even with the new subsidy offered by the government, it had so far failed to secure additional orders from the electricity generators. Even though coal was being offered at 40 per cent below the base contract price the electricity generators were not prepared to place additional orders because they had retained large stocks and preferred to enter into 'sweetheart deals' for new gas-fired power stations. Mr Cook said the nuclear subsidy provided by the government was being used by the electricity generators to import electricity from France at a higher price than coal available from the British pits which are facing closure through lack of orders. He protested that the government had offered the generators a subsidy without implementing a recommendation by the Commons trade and industry committee requiring them to enter into contracts for an additional 21m tons of coal. Mr Richard Caborn (Lab Sheffield Central), chairman of the committee, warned that without a package of measures similar to that it had recommended, the remainder of the 12 pits would close at the rate of one a month. Mr Hunt said the industry had to come to terms with a substantial change in the energy market, and while it had a future it could not rely on an 'open-ended' subsidy designed to keep alive uneconomic pits. He said the generators held stocks of 30m tons, and this obviously had an effect on the market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] will hold a large-scale 3-day economic seminar from 28 to  30 June in Chengdu city, Sichuan Province, to cooperate with  China in the economic development of China's inland areas.  Viewing the same province as a model case of developing inland  areas, the MITI, together with Chinese Government officials,  will study support measures, including reconstruction of old  factories and agricultural technological cooperation. The MITI  will send 50 officials -- specialists in such areas as trade,  electric power, financing, and agricultural technology -- to the  seminar. The population of Sichuan is about 120 million.  Although it is the largest of all provinces, there is a growing  gap in income between Sichuan and coastal provinces due to a  delay in the development of basic industries in Sichuan. Public  security in Sichuan is also worsening. Therefore the MITI also  wants to improve business conditions for Japanese corporations  by trying to correct the economic gap by cooperating with China  in developing its industries. The MITI is saying that "the  seminar will be the first step toward our full-fledged economic  cooperation in the inland areas."    The seminar will be held jointly by the Association for  International Study and Exchanges, which is the MITI's  extra-governmental organization, and China's National Economic  System Reform Committee. Through panel discussions and  subcommittee meetings on such topics as investment and  industrial cooperation, and energy and environment, they plan to  formulate support measures for the reconstruction of old  facilities, including iron mills, and improving the efficiency  of agricultural management in China.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP peaks in heavy trading British Petroleum, the UK's flagship oil company, raced up to an all-time high of 415p in mid-session before coming off the top and settling a net 3 higher at 411 1/2 p as the stock market became increasingly optimistic about oil prices. Brent crude for July delivery was trading around Dollars 16.90 a barrel late yesterday and looking to move even higher, dealers said. Oil prices have moved up by around a dollar a barrel over the past week following the Opec meeting in Vienna, viewed as reasonably successful, a technical squeeze and increasing worries about the situation in Korea. Analysts voiced some concern over the current excitement about the possible lifting of a US ban on exports of Alaskan oil, a move which would provide a big boost to BP's earnings. 'There is mounting opposition in the US Senate to a lifting of the ban, which could delay a decision until September,' said one oil analyst. It was also pointed out that the Kuwait Investment Office may be taking a hard look at the performance of crude oil prices and the BP share price with a view to placing its 9.7 per cent stake of around 540m shares at a considerable profit. At least one US brokerage is known to have bid for the KIO stake in BP with a view to placing the stock across the globe.</p>

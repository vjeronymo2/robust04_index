			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: A festival that flourishes for the fully-funded Finns  -Off the Wall IT IS OBVIOUS, really: if you want to start a flourishing opera festival, choose the most remote spot and avoid public funding. All the opera houses in trouble seem to be heavily subsidised buildings in the midst of a vast catchment area. In the UK, Glyndebourne excels among the downland sheep of Sussex, and in Finland the Savonlinna Festival, by the Russian border in dreamlike lake country, is this month celebrating 25 successful years. Savonlinna tries hardest. As you idle by the water in the attractive holiday resort you are approached by one of a brigade of young lads selling tickets, at up to Pounds 50, for that night's performance. There are 2,200 seats to be filled, and with the Festival dependent on box office, and its marketing activities, for almost 90 per cent of income, there is every incentive to whip in an audience. Most need little persuasion. Although eastern Finland is hardly on the music lover's Grand Tour, Savonlinna has one unrivalled asset - its performances take place in the grandest of Scandinavian castles. Olavinlinna was built in the 15th century to keep out the Russians. It did not always succeed but it managed to avoid a heavy pounding. Its courtyard, covered by an awning, today seats an opera audience, while the singers perform against the wall of the keep. Without the castle there would be no opera in Savonlinna. Indeed, it was as a symbol of Finnish resistance and independence that the first Festival was held there in 1912, Finnish music, especially patriotic opera based on folk lore, played a key role in developing the national consciousness which secured independence from Russia in 1917 when the Government in St Petersberg had other worries. In the five brief seasons before the Great War the audience negotiated a perilous channel which separated the castle from the mainland. Some opera lovers were swept to their deaths in their quest for music. Today a bridge leads to the island. Modern Savonlinna started in 1967 as a modest summer music school. Today it is a power house of the opera world. It has helped promote the works of Finnish composers like Kokkonen and Sallinen while developing an international dimension. This month the Opera Ebony from New York presents Porgy and Bess. Its large box office take enables Savonlinna to pay composers well: it is a rewarding commission. With such a location Savonlinna has a weakness for operas (and they are not rare) with castellated settings. This season it has revived the classic fortress opera Fidelio, but the popular favourite, brought back this July by public demand, is The Magic Flute. This 20-year old production, directed by August Everding and sung in Finnish, has come to epitomise opera, and the Festival, for many. It is like an annual pantomime favourite: old timers complain that the fixtures and fittings are not as glamorous; the costumes not as brilliant; the thunder and lightening not so clamorous than in the past, but on first view this is a light-hearted Flute, which speeds merrily along. There are idiosyncracies which cause some lip biting - the blacked-up Moors seem out-dated and the three boy cupids are less than magical in jeans and Red Indian head-dresses. But Jorma Hynninen, the artistic director of the Festival, has wisely cast himself as Sarastro to provide a solid heart to the opera. As well as popularising Finnish composers Savonlinna, like Glyndbourne, breaks unknown singers. This season's find must be Soile Isokoski, a thrillingly-voiced Pamina. The Festival is also bolstered by the freak good fortune of a superb acoustic and the fact that professional Finnish musicians and singers are happy to take a working holiday in the orchestra and the chorus. Finnair offers a package from Helsinki which flies you to Savonlinna, provides you with a ticket, a dinner in the castle, and a flight back for Pounds 190 - just about the sum you will pay for (perhaps) seeing Pavarotti at Covent Garden. Isn't it time for an end to the baiting of Jeremy Isaacs, director of Covent Garden? Talk of disquiet among his board, and the opposition of the UK's Heritage Minister, David Mellor, has been overdone. In the last few months, helped by a run of artistic successes, Isaac's position has strengthened. He is prepared for another stint at the Opera House when his contract expires in 18 months, seeing the House through to its 1997 closure for re-building. Both Isaacs and Mellor are playing down any differences between them. If Isaacs can persuade his staff to accept a wage freeze in 1993, without precipitating a revenue-wrecking labour dispute, his position will become even more secure. Perhaps the problem with the art market is not reluctant buyers but misguided gallery owners and artists? While some big galleries have failed to sell a picture in two months, Deborah Gage of Bond Street had disposed of 46 out of the 50 works on offer in her summer show, which ends next Saturday. The artist on display is Joanthan Warrender, who paints bird's-eye views of some of the grander British country estates. Warrender has revived a tradition last popular in the late 17th century when the new rich liked artists to capture every sheep, every servant, in their charge. He has tapped a generation of estate owners willing to pay more than Pounds 30,000 for a minutely accurate pictorial audit of their holding. At Deborah Gage's gallery are 17 such panoramas (not for sale) plus 50 preparatory sketches which are on offer, mostly for under Pounds 1,000. Among the houses immortalised are Stowell Park, the home of the Vestey family, Courteenhal, where the Wakes have lived for centuries (the current Sir Hereward is just glimpsed on the canvas exiting left, a tiny dot taking his horse for a canter) and Cawdor castle in Nairn. Surprisingly, many of Warrender's commissions come from old families. He spends summer months familiarising himself with the properties, down to the sheep dogs and garden parasols, and completes the scene in his studio in the winter. His latest commission is municipal - in the gallery the town of Ayr is taking shape, immortalised on a summer's day in 1992. Obviously Warrender appeals to a conservative, ordered, view of art, a view with a large following of collectors who keep the faith while patrons of contemporary art lose confidence as the critics lead them on to yet another spiritual dead end.</p>

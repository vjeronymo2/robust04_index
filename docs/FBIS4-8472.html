			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colonel Vladi Vladkov: "Reform in Cadre Policy </F> -- On the Basis of the Law"]    [Text] At the beginning the defense minister called the  meeting a conversation rather than a news conference, about  certain things which are happening in the army, and others which  will happen soon, and which were broadly reflected in the press  before they even took place.    It is natural that the topic of the officer corps occupies  an  important place in the newspapers. According to Minister  Aleksandrov he had seldom encountered such unanimity in the  criticism of him as on this issue.    At the last meeting of the Consultative Council on National  Security at the Supreme Command the defense minister reported on  the cadre situation in the army.    He told journalists that since December 1991 there had been  no cuts at the Ministry of Defense and stressed that no cuts are  being made now or in the future. Military personnel are simply  being retired. One must distinguish between cuts that are made  on the basis of a certain criterion, and applying the existing  law.    Minister Aleksandrov said that the cadre issue is a basic  issue in the army. The first civilian team that entered the  Ministry of Defense more than two years ago found that there a  serious anomaly. Many jobs in many structures of the ministry  were being done by people with various qualifications. In other  words, many officers were involved in inappropriate activities.  In addition, during the tenure of Minister Aleksandrov a study  has been implemented, which has shown that "our family" had  increased by 1,500 members since the beginning of the reform.  Naturally, this took place at the expense of new structures,  which did not exist before, but without whom work under the new  conditions in anything related to the legal and social aspects  and certain units of the Ministry of Defense would have been  aggravated.    After many academic talks and discussions the situation with  the cadres has been analyzed and one factor unfortunately  inherited from an incorrect cadre policy has become obvious.  This prompted the decision to restore the pyramid in the  command structure. It is well known that most officers in the  army must be junior officers -- lieutenants and captains. The  pyramid becomes narrower at the higher echelons, and at the top  there are a few generals. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that  at present we have an accumulation of senior officers in the  leadership of the Ministry of Defense and in all the  administrative structures and commands. At the same time there  is a serious shortage of combat officers in the units. At  present 55 percent of the officers have the rank of major and  above. Obviously, the model has been turned upside down.    Afterward, the minister informed journalists about the  results of several very important sociological studies. The  basic dissatisfaction of the officer corps relates to the low  wages and social status. However, nothing more could be done  under existing conditions. The second cause of officers'  dissatisfaction relates to the lack of prospects regarding a  career as commanders. This is the results of two factors:  Either the cadre selection is incorrect, or senior officers  have "plugged up" the central leading units.    Personnel not related to combat units can be reduced. As an  example Minister Aleksandrov pointed out the decrease in the  personnel of the Ministry of Defense General Chancellery, which  was brought down from 33 to 11. On 6 April Army General Lyuben  Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, signed a  decree that all colonels from the Ministry of Defense and the  Military-Economic Bloc over 50 years old who have been on active  service for 20 years must retire according to the requirements  of Article 71 of the current law. This applies to 87 people and  does not affect colonels performing generals' duties.    Decreasing the personnel of the General Staff will be a  gradual process, Minister Aleksandrov said. This is a result of  the simple fact that the members of the General Staff have great  responsibilities. It is there that operational plans are worked  out, strategic deployments decided, and their responsibility is  for anything related to the troops' combat readiness. The  officers of the General Staff are highly qualified and not mere  clerks.    This only is the beginning of the process. The transition  toward the corps-brigade organization will reduce in the future  the personnel of many staffs. We planned this for 1995-97, the  minister said, but the aggravated economic situation and the  iron framework of the budget compelled us to hurry. The  Bulgarian Army General Staff fully supports this position. The  necessary retirements and changes in the officer, sergeant, and  enlisted men corps will be effected by the summer, in accordance  with the existing law, the code on the military service of the  officers and sergeants, and the Labor Code. By 30 April the  structures of the administrative units General Staff, and the  commands of the troops and the detachments will be optimized.  We will not allow the combat command personnel to be painfully  affected by the reforms, the minister said. In May the changes  and optimization will be discussed by the Military Council of  the General Staff and submitted to the minister of defense.  Afterward, the payrolls of the approves structural changes will  be worked out. Thus the cadre issues will finally be resolved,  Defense Minister Aleksandrov said.    The goal is to complete the cadre reform by July and August.  By about 1 September, when the graduates of the military  schools receive their posts and the others climb one stage  higher in accordance with the approved structures and payrolls,  one will be able to determine the number of people who have not  received and will not receive a new post and will be released  from the army. However, all this will only be done according to  the law in anything related to the post, age, years of service,  and rank. The sergeants, military employees, and other  civilians without a post after the structural changes, will be  released after 1 June in accordance with the law and the Labor  Code. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that there are 2,886  officers who do not correspond to the requirements of Article 71  of the law. Those people will have to leave the army during  this period. The issue will be resolved in an easier manner  concerning sergeants. About 1,500 of them do not have a high  school education.    Minister Aleksandrov announced his decision that military  doctors-colonels and graduate military personnel of military-  scientific units could serve until the age of 60, because they  are first rank experts and the army needs them.    The minister of defense also answered many questions from  the  journalists.</p>

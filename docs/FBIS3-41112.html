			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  0900 GMT on 20 January reports that "the Lebanese border unit of  the Galilee District Police last night seized 10 kg of heroin  believed to be worth over $1 million. Our correspondent in the  north Yo'av Aviv reports that the drugs were seized from an  Israeli drug dealer who had smuggled it from Lebanon in the  Metulla region."    Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 23 January carries a report by  Shmu'el Tagar on page 4 which states "last Friday night 10 kg of  marijuana were seized from an apartment in one of Elat's new  neighborhoods." The report notes that the Elat police have  detained three persons suspected of smuggling the drugs from the  Sinai for distribution in Elat and the rest of Israel, adding  that "this morning the three will be brought before an Elat  judge for extending their remand."    Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 27 January in a  report by Raine Marcus and ITIM on page 14 reports that "a man  and woman suspected of dealing in marijuana in Tel Aviv's  Sheinkin area were remanded for a week by Tel Aviv Magistrates  Court yesterday." The report notes that "detectives found two  kilograms of marijuana in a pillowcase and an additional four  grams elsewhere in the apartment, but both suspects deny any  connection to the drugs." THE JERUSALEM POST adds that "after a  period of drought Tel Aviv is now flooded with marijuana,  according to a senior narcotics squad officer. In the last two  months alone detectives in the greater Tel Aviv area have seized  30 kilograms of marijuana, apparently grown in Sinai, said the  officer." Later on in the report, the paper writes: "In Petah  Tiqva yesterday, police acting on a tip off found 12 kilograms  of marijuana in an abandoned building. Nobody has come forward  to claim the drugs and police are looking for the owner."    "In Haifa yesterday, Egged member Aharon Zalmanovitz, 35, of  Nahariyya, was remanded until February 6 by the Haifa  Magistrates Court on suspicion of smuggling and dealing heroin.  Police found 1.3 kilograms of heroin in Zalmanovitz's  apartment."</p>

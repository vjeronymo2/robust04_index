It did not cause any casualties.    The explosion occurred at about 0400, substantially damaging  windows and doors as well as causing minor damage to nearby  offices, including those of the Belgian consulate.    Police sources have reported that no extremist group has so  far claimed the attack.    The sources added that patrolling of malls was increased  during the Christmas period following the discovery of fire  bombs installed in teddy bears in a mall in Santiago and in a  shop in southern Chile.    The militarized Carabineros police have reported that 14  people were killed in traffic accidents, including seven  pedestrians who were run over, during the Christmas celebrations.</p>

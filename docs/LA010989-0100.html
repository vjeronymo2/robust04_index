			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. TIMES CO. TO SELL CABLE TV; MINORITY SHARE IS KEY TO DEAL  </P> <P> The New York Times Co. has agreed to sell its cable television system for $420  million in cash to an investment group that will include at least 20% minority  ownership, it was announced today.  </P> <P> J. Bruce Llewellyn, a Philadelphia soft-drink bottling executive who is one of  the nation's top black business executives, will head the minority investment  partnership.  </P> <P> The other investors, which will evenly split the majority ownership of the  company, are two cable TV companies based in the Philadelphia area, Comcast  Corp. and Lenfest Communications Inc.  </P> <P> NYT Cable TV of Cherry Hill, N.J., which serves 162,000 subscribers in southern  New Jersey, apparently will become the nation's biggest cable television system  with at least 20% minority ownership, parties to the deal said.  </P> <P> By selling to a group that includes minorities, the New York Times Co. will be  able to defer taxes on its gain from the sale, which it expects to be $320  million before taxes, according to David Gorham, the company's chief financial  officer.  </P> <P> The tax-deferral provision was created by Congress in 1978 to encourage  minority ownership of communications companies. The minority group has to be  the managing partner in order for the deal to qualify.  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission must certify that the deal meets the  intent of Congress. Gorham said the FCC has indicated that approval is likely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Above-Average Cost  </P> <P> NYT Cable TV serves 59 communities in southern New Jersey, all within about 35  miles of its Cherry Hill headquarters. Its number of subscribers is expected to  increase to 170,000 by the time the deal is completed.  </P> <P> At a price of $420 million, the price per subscriber will be $2,470, slightly  above the average for recent deals.  </P> <P> Llewellyn has not finished lining up the minority investors who will join his  group and, until he does, the percentage of the company that his group controls  will not be decided, according to Julian Brodsky, vice chairman of Comcast.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs are  continuing their withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around  Sarajevo to seven destinations selected by the United Nations.    Convoys of artillery can be seen moving along the highways  outside Sarajevo.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after a meeting  with the U.N. Secretary General's Envoy Yasushi Akashi today  that the Serbian side plans to complete withdrawal of heavy  weaponry one day before the NATO deadline.    He said Serbs have removed several convoys of artillery from  around Sarajevo, and are continuing doing that. He said those  weaponry which cannot be removed because of the snowing weather  will be put under control of the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR).    Karadzic said that the U.N. side has promised not to let any  other party get the upper hand following the Serbian withdrawal.    Predicting peace in Sarajevo in the near future, he  expressed  the hope that the model of demilitarization in Sarajevo will be  used in other parts of Bosnia.    Yasushi said today that the UNPROFOR is monitoring the seven  sites for concentrating weapons from both the Serb and Muslim  sides.    Serbian sources said the Serbs have so far submitted more  than 100 heavy guns to the UNPROFOR.    Yasushi said that the progress in weapon withdrawal is a  good  start and "We are moving towards a permanent ceasefire and the  final goal of the demilitarization of Sarajevo."    Both UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman and UNPROFOR Commander  in  Bosnia Michael Rose also confirmed reports of the ongoing Serbs'  withdrawal of heavy guns from around Sarajevo.    The Bosnian Serbs accepted a Russian proposal to withdraw  heavy guns and in the meantime to have 400 Russian troops, now  serving in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, sent to Sarajevo.    Yasushi today also held a meeting with Bosnian Muslim leader  Alija Izetbegovic.    Izetbegovic said after the meeting that the Muslim side will  withdraw all of their heavy guns from around Sarajevo by  February 19 and put a small number of their weapons under  control of the UNPROFOR.    He also said the Muslim side will strictly observe the  ceasefire and will not violate the military demarcation line.    Yasushi confirmed the statement by Izetbegovic.    Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary general's spokesman Joe Sills  said in New York today that Butrus Butrus-Ghali is very much  "satisfied" with the process of weapon withdrawal from Sarajevo.    Three thousand UNPROFOR soldiers are now being deployed in  key positions across and around Sarajevo, mainly in the sites of  weaponry submitted by both Serbs and Muslims, and along the  demarcation line.    Ghali has called for a reinforcement of 3,000 UNPROFOR  soldiers to guarantee the peace plan.    In the meantime, fighting is continuing with Serbs and  Croats  as one side, and Muslims as the other side in other parts of  Bosnia.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / French strike over public sector policy A ONE-DAY strike in protest at pay restraint, job cuts and employment worries yesterday caused widespread disruption in France's public sector, affecting rail, air, postal and telecommunications services. The strike was called by two of France's union federations, the Force Ouvriere (FO) and the left-wing Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and took place mainly within public sector companies, though one in four civil servants stayed away from work. Train services in much of the country were cut by two-thirds, as was much of the Paris Metro, while striking Air France employees for a time blocked access to their airline's terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport and caused the cancellation of many medium-haul, but not long-distance, flights. Pay is the main issue for the national civil service which has been offered an increase of 4.5 per cent for the 1993-95 period. But elsewhere strikers were mainly preoccupied by job cuts, privatisation plans and the Balladur government's employment bill which is aimed at introducing more flexibility in French labour law. The strike was widely followed at Air France which has announced a further 4,000 lay-offs over the next year. Air France is on the government's privatisation list, while the postal service and France Telecom are not. But striking postal workers cited privatisation as one of the reasons for their protest. Nearly three-quarters of France Telecom staff stayed away from work. The government has announced its intention to turn the telecoms utility into a public limited company so that it is better adapted to form international alliances. But many France Telecom staff see this as a step to eventual privatisation. While Mr Louis Viannet, head of the CGT, hailed the action as a success, Mr Francois Perigot, head of the Patronat employers' federation, said such a revival of strike action would 'block action already underway to get the country's out of its rut'. He contrasted yesterday's action in the public sector with the labour climate in the private sector 'where the number of disputes is the lowest since 1945'. Meanwhile, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, claimed yesterday that the recession was now no longer getting any worse. 'One swallow does not make a summer,' said the minister. But he said it was important not to minimise encouraging signs. With an upturn already in new housing and household consumption, it was possible to hope that unemployment would stabilise in 1994. The draft budget for 1994, on which the national assembly started debate yesterday, would support economic activity and fight unemployment, he said.</p>

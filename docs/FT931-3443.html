			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amersham expands in the US via Dollars 69m buy AMERSHAM International, the UK health science group, is to acquire United States Biochemical, a privately-owned supplier of reagents to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, for up to Dollars 69m (Pounds 48m) in shares and cash. Amersham will pay Dollars 52m immediately to the group of investors headed by Mr Thomas Mann who are selling USB. Further payments up to Dollars 17m will follow over the next three years, depending on sales of USB products. USB - founded 20 years ago in Cleveland - is known particularly for making enzymes that genetic researchers use to determine DNA sequences. It is expected to make pre-tax profits of Dollars 3.6m in the year to April 30, on sales of Dollars 36m. 'This represents a strategic step forward for our life science business,' said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive. 'Joining with USB will give us a leading position in both radioactive and non-radioactive sequencing and will provide critical mass in the vital American marketplace.' In 1990 Amersham bought the US-based Medi-Physics business for Dollars 46m and sold its clinical reagents business to Kodak for Pounds 84m.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Hong Kong talks on airport resume Britain and China said yesterday their officials would meet on Friday to discuss the financing of Hong Kong's airport project - the first such meeting since August last year. The talks will mark another step towards normalising Sino-UK discussions on Hong Kong's future, although it is unlikely the two sides will be able to announce a resolution to their two-year dispute about how to finance the airport. Since March there has been a noticeable move by the Chinese to separate economic issues from those relating to Hong Kong's political development. It remains unclear, however, whether China will want to agree financing before the legislative council debates governor Chris Patten's political reform bill at the end of June. The government said yesterday it hoped the meeting of the airport committee would lead to an early agreement on the project. It said it should now be possible to make substantial progress following the useful and constructive talks that have taken place in the past two months. At issue in Friday's talks is the split between debt and equity for the airport and its connecting railway. Together these two projects will cost about HKDollars 85bn (Pounds 7.3bn). Two years ago the Hong Kong government hoped that all but HKDollars 16bn of this sum could be raised in international debt markets. But in the face of Chinese opposition the government retreated and has since offered to increase its equity contribution to HKDollars 60bn. Another issue which is important to China is the amount of land - principally alongside the airport runway - which will be sold to finance construction of the project. The Hong Kong government has maintained that the staggered release of this land - about 60 hectares in all - should be 'additional' to the release of land governed by other Sino-British agreements. The Chinese appear to object to this, fearing that property prices might be upset by the additional land release.</p>

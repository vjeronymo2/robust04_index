			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data leave Dow little changed Wall Street A VARIETY of economic reports had little effect on US stock markets yesterday as investors concentrated on equity valuations and quarterly results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally just 3.36 up at 3,307.92, although after showing a midsession decline of 10 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.66 ahead at 409.11, but the Nasdaq composite index continued its slide, losing 6.61 at 560.33. Turnover on the New York SE came to 189m shares, while falls led rises by 959 to 715. Two sets of data provided fresh evidence of economic recovery. Gross domestic product in the first quarter rose 2 per cent, in line with expectations, although the details on personal consumption within the GDP numbers showed spending had risen much further than analysts had forecast during the first three months of the year. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index showed a big rise to 64.8 per cent in April, but providing negative news was a larger than expected 14.8 per cent drop in March new home sales, undermining hopes of a housing market rebound. In spite of the weight of positive economic data, some analysts were concerned that the stock market had risen too high during the recent rally. First-quarter corporate earnings continued to come in. General Motors put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 40 1/4 after reporting quarterly net income of Dollars 179m, against a loss of Dollars 144m at the same stage a year ago. The car maker's revenues in the quarter were up slightly to Dollars 32bn. GM's figures helped the other car stocks, Chrysler adding Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19 and Ford Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 . RJR Nabisco firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 in active trading after the tobacco and foods group announced a first-quarter loss of Dollars 15m, after a charge for the early repayment of debt. Without the charge, RJR's operating profit was Dollars 144m. Pepsico rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 3/4 on news of first-quarter profits of 30 cents a share, up from 26 cents a year ago. Whirlpool fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 42 7/8 in spite of reporting first-quarter profits of 50 cents a share, up from 35 cents in the first quarter of 1991. Coleman advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/2 in the wake of a big improvement in first-quarter earnings, and a forecast from the company that second-quarter profits should come in substantially higher than at the same stage a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 109 after the company said it was 'comfortable' with analysts' estimates that it would make between Dollars 1 and Dollars 1.05 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter. Borland International bounced back from Monday's selling that was spurred by news of a quarterly loss. It recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46. Canada BANK SHARES led a late rally in Toronto blue chips, leaving the TSE composite index at the session's high. The broad market closed on a softer note, with merchandising, gold and consumer products issues slightly lower. Trade was slow due to investor caution ahead of the Ontario provincial Budget, due out late tomorrow. The composite index closed 11.5 ahead at 3,337.9. Declines outnumbered advances by 297 to 253 after volume of 24.6m shares valued at CDollars 253m. Nova shares began flooding the secondary market after the company closed its public offering yesterday of 42m shares to raise CDollars 302m. The stock rose CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 8 1/8 on volume of 2.8m shares.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (9): Bottling up competitors - Vitro VITRO came into being as a producer of bottles for Cerveceria Cuautehmoc. Recently, Femsa started producing all its own bottles, thereby ending a long-standing relationship. Unlike other Monterrey companies, Vitro has stuck to one business, although some observers say that the acquisition of the Serfin financial group by Sada family interests has been taking up an increasing proportion of the time of the company chairman, Mr Adrian Sada. Vitro, the only glass producer of size in Mexico, is the country's largest industrial company with 1992 revenues of Dollars 3.3bn. A third of this revenue comes from its US glass containers subsidiary, Anchor Glass. In its home market, it has aggressively pursued a monopoly position in the Mexican market. It has bought up competitors and has kept a tight grip on distributors. Yet Vitro has underperformed the market in the past few years. Margins on its US operations have been low, in spite of significant new investment there. So have world glass prices, reducing the importance of its monopoly position in Mexico's newly-opened market. 'They are reacting now but they have been slow to react to the new situation in Mexico,' says Mr Pablo Riveroll of Bursamex. Like other companies in Monterrey, Vitro has long experience of joint ventures with foreign companies: Pilkington of the UK, Owens-Corning and PQ Corporation of the US. But as Mr Ernesto Martens, its chief executive officer, says, the motive for these joint ventures has changed over time. 'Originally, in the 1950s and 1960s, the aim was to have the best technology available for the domestic markets. Then, as Mexico began to change, the need for exports became more evident. We began to look at how we could gain access to technology and to markets.' He says management of companies has improved significantly but that change is still needed. 'The most important change that many Mexican companies have to go through is to become fully aware of their customer and how properly to service his needs.'</p>

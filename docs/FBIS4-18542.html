			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 6 (AFP) -- NATO still hopes Russia  will sign the Partnership for Peace accord in April as the  Moscow government has repeatedly announced, a NATO spokesman  said Wednesday [6 April].    Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday said Russia was  seeking a special accord with NATO taking account of Russia's  military strength and nuclear status.    "We still hope that the signature will take place in April,  as announced by [Foreign Minister Andrey] Kozyrev," the  spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said.    Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said on Tuesday that  Russia would join the program by April 21.    The NATO spokesman said: "We have not been officially  informed about the Russian preferred date of the signing of the  Partnership for Peace framework document."    NATO sources said it was clear that the Russians were  determined to join the Partnership for Peace program, but that  NATO was having difficulties in working out exactly what type of  cooperation Russia wanted with the Alliance.    The Partnership for Peace, aimed at increasing military  cooperation between the 16 members of NATO and the former East  Bloc countries, has already been signed by Romania, Lithuania,  Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia,  Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia and Slovenia.</p>

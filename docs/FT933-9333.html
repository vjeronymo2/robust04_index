			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Veba interim profits fall 12% VEBA, the German energy, chemicals and trading group, reported a 12 per cent drop in pre-tax profit for the first half of 1993 to DM782m (Dollars 454.60m). The company blamed the decline mainly on the difficult market in plastics and rubber, reflecting in particular the troubles of the motor industry. The effect of this was aggravated by worldwide over-capacity, tough price competition and a rise in low-priced imports from eastern Europe. Group net income was 13 per cent lower at DM316m. Veba said earnings per share would show a more gentle decline as 1992 interim result included extraordinary gains. It said turnover for the period showed virtually no change at DM33.2bn. Growth in electricity, oil and services was offset by declines in chemicals, trading and transport. The group expected no improvement in the profits and economic trend for the second half of the year. It intended to cut costs further and increase oil and chemicals productivity to boost competitiveness. The resulting charges on profits would be offset by the profit on the sale of its industrial gas business. Veba, whose capital spending was 11 per cent higher in the first six months at DM2bn, said it was optimistic that its cost-cutting measures would bear fruit in 1994. Last year, Veba managed to maintain its dividend at DM12 a share, despite a 15 per cent slide in net profits to DM1.04bn.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Not so special MR JOHN Major yesterday seemed well satisfied with his first meeting with President Bill Clinton. Indeed there is no reason to think it went badly. But it would have had to go very badly for Mr Major to say so in public, since its main purpose was to demonstrate, for British domestic consumption, that the 'special relationship' is still in working order. The truth is that this relationship is special above all in its lop-sidedness. For a time the personal respect and affection of the then President Ronald Reagan for the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher did something to offset the manifest inequality between their two countries. But even the afterglow of that time has now faded. All the world can now see is, on the one hand, a self-confident young American leader, fully engaged in an ambitious project of national recovery and not in the least disposed to be sentimental about any foreign country; and, on the other hand, a nervous and defensive British leader whose project has already been derailed. Mr Major desperately needs to be seen to get on well with Mr Clinton. Mr Clinton has no reason to quarrel with Mr Major, but that is as much as one can say. On two issues Mr Major's advisers claim that he was able to influence the president. On one of them, the handling of the war in Bosnia, the Clinton administration has indeed moved closer to the European view and away from its early twitches of more forthright interventionism - but this change occurred a fortnight ago. All that happened this week was a fairly simple bargain: Mr Major agreed to swallow his doubts about the wisdom of parachuting relief supplies into the Moslem enclaves, in return for being publicly exempted from participation, with a gracious acknowledgement of what British troops are already doing on the ground. On the other issue, trade, the differences are real and important. It will have done no harm for Mr Clinton to be reminded personally by a European leader of what is at stake. But no one should imagine that by reiterating his commitment to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round he actually shifted the US position on any of the points in dispute; still less that Mr Major was able to convince him that European governments' advances to the Airbus consortium are not really subsidies. If anyone did think so, they will have been disabused yesterday by the US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, who revealed that he is asking for 'special consultations' on Airbus before the present agreement expires in July.</p>

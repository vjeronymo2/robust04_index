			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ahead as Chemical cuts its prime rate Wall Street AFTER last week's dramatic fluctuations, business on US stock markets was relatively subdued yesterday, with the main indices posting modest gains in very light trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.53 at 3,269.90, its high for the day. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 1.82 at 406.09, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks firmed 3.91 to 588.15. Turnover on the NYSE was extremely low at 143m shares. Concern about political turmoil in Russia, where the government submitted its resignation yesterday, surprise at Chemical Bank's decision to lower its prime lending rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent, and a string of first quarter earnings reports pulled market sentiment in different directions during the morning session. Trading was also conducted against the background of last week's unexpected easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which in just two days added 90 points to the Dow. Those gains were sustained yesterday by hopes that the Fed will soon ease again to inject life into the economy. Among individual stocks, Goodyear jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 after the group's chairman, Mr Stanley Gault, told shareholders that sales during the first quarter would be around Dollars 2.7bn, the highest in the company's history for the first three months of a year. Net income for the period would come in between Dollars 60m and Dollars 65m, a substantial improvement on the Dollars 90m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. Ford firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 40 1/4 in active trading after the car manufacturer announced plans to invest almost Dollars 3bn in North America over the next three years to design and build a new mini van, develop new engines for future light-duty trucks and expand an existing assembly plant for production of F-series trucks. Among mostly firmer or steady bank stocks, Chemical eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after the group unexpectedly cut its main lending rate. The big banks usually change their rates simultaneously. Yesterday's rate cut by Chemical suggests that it expects further easing from the Fed and that it is trying to get a head start on its main rivals by offering cheaper funds to customers. JP Morgan eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 1/4 despite reporting a 10 per cent increase in first quarter profits to Dollars 299m. The lack of reaction was due to discounting - the market had already bid the stock up in anticipation of strong earnings. There was a stronger reaction to record first quarter profits at Primerica, which owns the securities house, Smith Barney. The stock rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 in active trading. Canada TORONTO share prices ended slightly higher in light dealings. Based on preliminary data, the composite index rose 13.19 points, or 0.39 per cent, to 3,389.83. Volume was 19.5m shares against 23.8m shares on Friday and trading value was CDollars 178.4m against CDollars 260.8m. The metals and mining sub-group posted a 2.31 per cent gain on index. Financial services were up 1.18 per cent. Golds were up moderately.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> TWO BIG PLAYS PROPEL SANTA MARGARITA  </P> <P> Santa Margarita High School parlayed a blocked punt and two big plays -- from  95 and 80 yards out -- for a 21-0 first-half lead and held on for a 24-14  victory over Bell Gardens in the Division IV quarterfinals Friday night at Bell  Gardens.  </P> <P> The Eagles (12-0), playing their first season with seniors, won the right to  face Baldwin Hills, a 21-7 winner over Canyon Springs, in next Saturday's  semifinals.  </P> <P> "We definitely did some nice things in the first half," Eagles Coach Jim  Hartigan said. "We decided to loosen things up. You can't be conservative and  win the championship. We threw more than we normally do."  </P> <P> Santa Margarita quarterback Trevor Yankoff threw only 10 times, but he  completed six of those for 193 yards, including a 95-yard scoring pass to David  Shearer with 59 seconds remaining in the first half to give the Eagles a 21-0  lead.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita jumped to a 7-0 first quarter lead after Ryan Zalta blocked a  Lancer punt and Ron Mehrens recovered the ball on the Bell Gardens 29-yard  line. Yankoff hit Mike Farris with a 22-yard pass to the one-yard line, where  he scored on a sneak. Travis Lucero kicked his first of three conversions.  </P> <P> Eagle running back Josh Ireland made the score 14-0 with 6 minutes 48 seconds  left in the half when he took a pitchout from Yankoff, cut through right tackle  and headed 80 yards for the end zone.  </P> <P> After Jason Ortiz thwarted a Lancer drive with an intercepted pass, Yankoff and  his teammates were pinned on their own five with third and 15. But he hit  Shearer streaking down the right sideline for a 95-yard scoring play.  </P> <P> Bell Gardens (8-4) fought back with two scoring drives in the second half, led  by running back Alfred Zamudio, who finished the game with 169 yards in 31  carries, but Lucero's 22-yard field goal with 2:04 left in the third quarter  padded the Eagles' margin.  </P> <P> "Bell Gardens showed a lot of heart (in the second half)," Hartigan said. "They  did a nice job of punching it at us. We need to play a complete game."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CAN'T AGREE ON VOSS SUCCESSOR  </P> <P> City Council members deadlocked Tuesday in efforts to replace ousted Councilman  Fred Voss, finally deciding to leave his seat vacant.  </P> <P> When voters ousted Voss on Nov. 7, they also chose to replace him by council  appointment rather than special election. But City Atty. Alan R. Burns said  Tuesday that he believes that the council fulfilled its duty by attempting  twice to appoint a replacement.  </P> <P> Acting Mayor Laurann Cook and Councilman James E. Neal both voted for John  Collins because he was the runner-up in the last election. Council members  James Petrikin and George Scott both supported John McKnight because they had  both worked with him on city commissions.  </P> <P> Burns said he did not think a four-member council will pose a problem, "because  the council members are not sharply divided on any issues other than this one."

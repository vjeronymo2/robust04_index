			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar on hopes of tough approach to deficit US TREASURY prices roared ahead at the long end of the market yesterday on growing hopes that the Clinton administration will take a tough line on tackling the budget deficit. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105 1/8 , yielding 7.199 per cent, its lowest level in more than five years. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was only slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 3/4 , to yield 4.197 per cent. The market opened markedly higher as investors and dealers got their first chance to react to Sunday's comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new Treasury secretary, which suggested the White House views cutting the deficit as a top priority. Treasury investors welcomed his reference to the possible introduction of a broad-based energy tax that would be part of a plan to reduce the deficit by about Dollars 145bn over the next four years. Until recently, the bond markets have been concerned about President Bill Clinton's willingness to tackle the deficit issue at a time when he wants to boost economic growth through tax cuts and spending increases. Mr Bentsen's remarks helped address some of those concerns. UK government bond prices fell in quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007. The long end fell about  1/2 point while the shorter end eased about  1/4 point. With all eyes on the auction, prices failed to respond to the day's data which economists said were broadly encouraging since they pointed to a further cut in interest rates. Lending by banks and building societies (M4) rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 0.2bn in December, an improvement on the November figure when lending fell by Pounds 0.6bn, but below market forecasts of a rise of Pounds 1.8bn. This suggested the private and corporate sectors remained wary of accumulating new debts. The Liffe March gilt future ended down  11/32 at 100 1/16 in moderate volume of 18,816 lots. GERMAN government bond prices fell on press reports that the German pay talks had broken down, which prompted profit-taking after the recent advance. As a result, the market ignored the better-than-expected M3 data for December, which showed an annualised rise of 8.8 per cent against forecasts of more than 9 per cent, The market was cautious ahead of today's bond launch by the Treuhand privatisation agency. Dealers expect a 10-year issue in the region of DM10bn. The Liffe March bund contract traded just above the day's low of 92.66 in late trading, compared with a day's high of 93.01 and Friday's close of 92.97, in average volume of just over 44,610 lots. FRENCH government bond prices fell further than their German counterparts, as the market turned its attention to the forthcoming legislative elections in March. Fading hopes of an interest rate cut, a slight firming of three-month funds and some concern that the franc might come under renewed pressure prompted investors to take their profits. March futures lost over half a point to settle at their lowest level for two weeks. The contract ended 54 basis points down at 112.86 on good volume of 129,352 lots. ECU bond prices slipped in the absence of a cut in French interest rates. The Matif Ecu futures contract fell from an opening of 110.04 to a low of 109.70, and ended at 109.78. However, traders expect Thursday's auction of French government Ecu bonds to boost the market. The French treasury announced on Friday that it plans to auction Ecu500 to Ecu700m of a new 10-year Ecu stock. This will be the first substantial issue of Ecu bonds since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June last year which threw the Ecu bond market into confusion. France has been one of the most significant issuers of Ecu bonds but has not sold large amounts of Ecu bonds since April 1992. The return by the French to the Ecu bond market is seen as an important show of confidence in the Ecu, dealers said. THE Swiss government bond market was enlivened by the government's announcement of a maximum of SFr1bn of 5 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998. Subscriptions close on Thursday and the issue price and final issue amount will be announced on Friday.</p>

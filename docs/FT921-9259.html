			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Arts: Making it Better - Hampstead Theatre This new play, by James Saunders, operates on many levels and does not quite succeed on any one of them. Even so, I commend it. I found it witty, intelligent and interesting until, somewhere in the middle of the second half, a certain creakiness set in. In the space of two hours it covers a woman's three contrasting love affairs; the ways in which Czechs and English have used one another before and after 1989; issues of betrayal and independence, manipulation and honesty, in both love and politics; and the uses of drama. Making it Better - which has already been playing in Vienna and which is also opening now at the Theatre la Bruyere in Paris - does all this deftly, urbanely and with a fair degree of humanity. For London theatre-goers it has the added interest of presenting Jane Asher in its leading role. The plot. An Englishwoman finds herself alone, after her husband of 20 years has come out of the closet. (She met him in Prague in 1968 and, on their return, married him 'on the rebound. I suppose I was in love with Prague.') On a whim she picks up a middle-aged Czech and starts a casual affair with him. Her husband meanwhile starts to carry on with another Czech, much younger and prettier. Later, to the considerable chagrin of her husband and the older Czech, she and the young man begin a serious affair. All this occurs in the last half of 1989; a brief prologue and epilogue are set in the present. Diana and Adrian, the English wife husband, both work in Bush House for the drama department of the World Service. Again, Saunders can find humour in this. The point, however, is to bring drama itself up as a subject. With Josef, who is plainly a highly cultured (and rather endearingly pompous) man, this works. But, though I was convinced of young Tomas's intelligence, I couldn't quite believe that he brought Diana to the point of discussing 'drama as a cultural weapon' immediately prior to orgasm - though she assures us and him that he did. This in in Act Two, which tends to cover too much ground too rapidly, leaving an impression of glibness. Jane Asher has often played bitchy ex-wives with great success in recent years; the role of Diana gives her a welcome variant on this. She's softer here, though still witty, and only occasionally adopts a hard edge. She sometimes overdoes little things (fidgeting during a tense scene with her husband, unnaturally quick responses to other people's lines) and underdoes big ones (her last, drunk, scene with Tomas). David De Keyser is absurdly perfect as Josef, while Larry Lamb is, well, almost perfect, as the almost absurd Adrian. Rufus Sewell is marvellous as Tomas; voice, accent, cheekbones, eyes are all used with a youthful Czech intensity that heightens the whole play. The device of using half-banal World Service snippets during scene-changes ('More from the late great Buddy Holly later') pays dividends. Michael Rudman's direction makes everything work smoothly. Maybe too much so? At any rate, the production could not quite fend off the idea that gathered in my head as the play neared its close; that really these characters were all literary devices. Diana &amp; Co. amount to less than the themes they raise. Which is another way of saying this play has too little inner life. It also has some lumpy metaphors. The one about the British as ducks is used so many different ways - water off a duck's back; plastic duck; us dying ducks; the endearing way of the duck to surface from its mucky dives - that it loses any serious use except to draw attention to itself.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (15): Balancing risk against reward  -Profitability As banks search for stable forms of income which do not carry the risks of lending or securities trading, custody has started to become distinctly fashionable. Yet this popularity has intensified competition, and made participants examine more closely where the best long-term returns lie. Two aspects of custody attract banks. The first is that it does not strain balance sheets. Custodians only need to hold small amounts of assets on their own balance sheets, so they require little capital. The second is that the returns are less volatile than securities trading activities. Mr Robert Binney, business executive for global securities services at Chase Manhattan, says that the lack of volatility is a significant attraction for banks. 'Custody has been a mainstay of our income during blacker days than we are facing right now,' he says. In addition, custody can boost other forms of business such as securities and derivatives trading. Banks which administer securities have a rich potential to sell customers related services. As well as measuring portfolio returns, they can offer to raise returns through other activities. This has led to stiffer competition. Ms Jean Pellegrini, JP Morgan's head of sales for securities and cash in Europe, says this is less because of new entrants than old ones doing more. 'I cannot think of any banks starting from scratch, but people are getting more serious about it,' she says. However, the fact that there are few new entrants does not mean that competition is hindered. Most corporate banks offer custody services, says Mr Alistair Reid, Barclays' director of custody. He argues that some have become custodians virtually 'by accident' because they offer related services. Some custodians believe that competition will drive market players in two directions. They will compete by offering lower cost, standardised services; or higher cost and high value forms of custody. In different ways, both strategies could be easier for larger, diversified banks. Mr Reid says straightforward custody involving the holding of securities, and collection of dividends and bond interest payments in domestic markets, faces being 'commoditised'. The banks which handle large volumes through low cost networks will be able to undercut smaller competitors. This trend is being accentuated by the pressure to disclose the structure of commissions and fees which were previously not clear. Ms Pellegrini says that the 'ratcheting down' of fees is also being stimulated by a rise in the number of consultants which analyse commission structures. In this market, banks with large electronic networks may have an advantage in their ability to link markets easily. Mr Binney says that Chase's Infoserve network gives the bank an edge because 'all our centres have the same hardware and software. That is where you can get some savings'. The other end of the market is for specialised services in addition to the core products. Mr Binney cites the examples of custodians deducting taxes from dividends at source on behalf of customers, and attending company meetings on their behalf to exercise proxy shareholder votes. Ms Pellegrini argues that large banks have an advantage in providing these services because they have resources such as securities trading arms on which to call. 'Helping customers handle a derivatives portfolio is natural for a trading house, but it may be more difficult for others,' she says. However, although margins may be higher for such services, they can also carry risks that simpler services do not. This means that while the immediate returns are higher, the longer term profitability must be analysed. Banks can otherwise fall into the trap of over-estimating returns on capital. One form of risk is credit. Custodians may perform a number of services involving short-term credit to clients. An example is guaranteeing to credit dividends to customers on the due date, and accepting the risk that there will be a delay in the payment from companies in their portfolio. A second risk is operational. The costs of services such as attending shareholder meetings is far higher than relying on simple automated activities. This means that custodians can either miscalculate inflexible costs, or be exposed to the risk of costs outstripping revenues in quiet periods. A further problem for custodians providing complex services involving different arms is being able to fix the true costs of services. They must have a transfer pricing formula which ensures that the profitability of custodianship is not over-estimated because the costs fall elsewhere. This would be complex in itself, but Mr Reid of Barclays says the challenge of transfer pricing can be exacerbated by the fact that the bank allows customers to waive custodian fees if they wish to pay for services through other methods such as 'soft' commissions on brokerage services. Such complications are only likely to grow. Mr Ian Cormack, managing director of Citibank's financial institutions and transaction services group in Europe, says that custodians will respond to increasing demand for services linked to asset management by tailoring new services for customers. 'The people who will get into trouble are those that can only do one thing,' he says. Yet these services will in turn make it more vital for custodians to devise better methods of measuring profitability. As competition erodes margins, the balancing of risk and reward will become trickier.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Postel gains support for Greycoat rescue bid POSTEL, the UK's largest pension fund, was last night closer to clearing the most serious obstacle in the way of its Pounds 120m rescue bid for Greycoat, the property company. With holders of Greycoat securities descending on London for today's crucial votes on the rescue plan, Goldman Sachs said it would use its 8 per cent holding of Greycoat preference shares to vote in favour of Postel's bid. Postel has faced the fiercest resistance from holders of preference shares, one of four classes of bond and shareholders which will vote on the controversial offer today. Some preference shareholders have said the Postel offer greatly undervalues Greycoat's properties. Greycoat denies the valuation claim and says rejection of the bid would probably lead to liquidation and a fire sale of assets. For the deal to be approved, Postel will require 75 per cent of the vote from holders of the preference shares, the zero coupon bonds and the so-called Britannic House bonds, and a straight majority from ordinary shareholders. If all four classes agree, Postel will take control of a company acclaimed for the daring and quality of its developments in the 1980s, if not for its finances. As hopes faded of a last-minute intervention from another bidder, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, turned up the heat on Greycoat's dissenting shareholders. In a letter to Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman of Greycoat, he said Postel would not increase or amend any part of its offer. Earlier in the day Salomon Brothers said holders of more than 75 per cent of the Britannic House bonds supported Postel. Until yesterday Goldman Sachs had not said why it had built its preference share stake after Postel announced its bid, nor how it intended to vote. Gruss Partners, of the US, with 14 per cent of the prefs, had still not shown its hand.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / As they say in Europe: Why Britain was mugged IN GENERAL things get worse if a sensible policy is attempted. The week started with a rush of brains to the head when the Bundesbank and others cut interest rates and devalued the lira. That seems a long time ago now, but the German move was overshadowed by later events. It should have meant the end of the crazy myth foisted on us by the markets. It runs thus: the D-Mark is supreme because of high German interest rates. Those rates are high because of the huge expense involved in financing the reconstruction of the old East Germany. So the lesson is that if you want a truly powerful currency you have to take over a totally bankrupt, broken down economy a tenth the size of your own. Ireland does not match these demanding conditions but if Britain were to attempt to re-absorb even that not wholly unsuccessful economy into the Union one would not expect sterling to go through the roof. It all comes down to the Bundesbank, we are told. Its role had been to ensure that the experience of financing unification is as painful as possible, not just for the government which had carried it out in defiance of the Bank's wishes but for everybody. So an interest rate went to 75 per cent and then 500 per cent in Sweden. The reason is that the Germans alone were paying for unification  - had the rest of the Community stumped up a few billion, German interest rates could have come down much earlier. So the Bundesbank banged its friends' heads against the wall in a determined attempt to let us all share in the German experience and bribe it to go away. A small concession meant everything else has fallen apart while the German problem is worse than ever. But at least the British will now pay a quarter per cent less on their 10bn Ecu loan to shore up the pound, even if it costs another billion or so in pounds to pay it back. That loan is interesting for legal reasons: it will be used to help cover the large the budget deficit. In the Maastricht Treaty, Britain says it 'funds its borrowing requirement by the sale of debt to the private sector' (see the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the UK). How that statement can be squared with borrowing from German state banks is hard to see. It is fortunate that the Maastricht Treaty is not in force, otherwise we would never be able to meet its demand for currency stability. Tomorrow France votes on British public debt sales and even on Danish legislation on second homes (yes, that appears in the treaty too). It is an interesting thought, in view of the likely narrowness of the outcome, that the referendum could be settled by a few hundred Frenchmen who are worried about their holdings of British government stock and who are considering buying a summer cottage in the lee of Elsinore castle. But there is one item that should sway a few votes into the Yes camp: Article 130 deals with 'maintaining competitive markets' and states that regulations 'shall be aimed at encouraging an environment favourable to co-operation between undertakings.' Which of course has always provided the basis of French competition policy. But in the end the French may vote No because they fear for the future of Camembert or hate the government. It is hard on President Mitterrand, because France has been the best run country in the Community since around 1983. Inflation is low, the balance of payments is in surplus. The awful level of unemployment, come boom or slump, is the one blot on the landscape, but the French are lucky to have only one blot when the rest of us have to put up with half a dozen. None of last week's craziness can be blamed on France. But if the French are sensible tomorrow, all of next week's will be. European unity is dear to heart of the Frankfurter Allgemeine. It carried a report of last Sunday's, as always nationalistic, Last Night of the Proms in London which was seen live by German viewers. 'It is fine, in our Europe, how far the bows stretch,' wrote Hans Scherer, 'from the unbounded happiness of the British to the over-enthusiasm of the Sicilians, each jealously guarding its national idiosyncracies. But on the other hand there is the recognition that superficial observations about national character do not work. Thus one cannot really imagine us Germans waving little flags . . . and we are energetically working so that we never will.' James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

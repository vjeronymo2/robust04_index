			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Sectors where the market agreements came - The US-Japan pacts reached at the weekend The US and Japan struck a series of market-opening trade agreements at the weekend, averting a threatened trade war between the world's two largest economies. The US administration, which had been pressing Japan to open key markets, hailed the accords - covering telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and glass - as landmark deals to result in billions of dollars of new sales of US goods and services. Agreement was reached in the following sectors: MEDICAL EQUIPMENT For the Dollars 2.5bn-a-year medical equipment government procurement market, the pact provides for the use of open and transparent procedures and decisions based on 'overall greatest value' of bids. This means highly sophisticated medical technology made by foreign companies will not be automatically excluded because of their initial price. Japanese hospitals will have to publish annual information on the top 10 medical technology products it plans to buy that year. The pact also has a comprehensive complaint mechanism for dealing with 'unfair' bids. INSURANCE Japan promises more transparency in its regulatory system, import procedural protection, specific liberalisation measures and a stronger anti-trust policy. It also agreed to introduce the broker system to diversify and promote competition. Japan has the world's second largest insurance market, with approximately Dollars 320bn in premium income annually; foreign companies take only a 3 per cent share of this. The government agreed to implement a three-stage deregulation plan to expand sales opportunities for foreign companies. FLAT GLASS A Dollars 4.5bn-a-year market, dominated by three big producers with separate, tightly controlled distribution arrangements. Japan's glass window market is the second largest in the world, and the US has less than 1 per cent of it - compared with global shares exceeding 25 per cent in Europe and Latin America. US and Japan have agreed to 'a set of principles' and will seek to flesh out the agreement in the next 30 days. Failing that, the US will then bring a unilateral trade action against Japan's flat glass market. VEHICLES AND PARTS The US sets aside many of its demands and brings a unilateral trade action against the regulatory regime for car replacement parts. This will become lucrative as foreign sales gain market share in Japan. The licensing process blocking imports is 'so obvious and pernicious that it cries out for relief', Mr Kantor said. TELECOMMUNICATIONS Two pacts were agreed. One covers the sale of telecommunications products and services to Japanese government agencies (a Dollars 2bn-a-year market) and the other, sales to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, (65 per cent government-owned), a market of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.6bn) a year. The pacts are similar. Japan agrees to provide early, detailed information of procurements; to allow foreign suppliers input on purchase plans before tenders are finalised; to use international standards when available; to reduce the number of sole-source contracts, which tend to go only to Japanese companies; and to institute a modern 'overall best-value' bid evaluation system. The US promises its own industries to closely monitor the NTT pact and consult with Japan, as needed.</p>

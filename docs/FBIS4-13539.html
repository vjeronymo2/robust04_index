			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rida Hammad] </F>   [Text] The Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] last  Wednesday issued its second report this year. The report  revealed numerous violations of the rights of prisoners and  detainees in Egyptian jails and noted an alarming increase in  these violations compared to previous periods. The report,  which monitored the situation in the prisons on the basis of  testimonies by inmates and detainees, reports by the  organization's representatives about their visits to the  prisons, and complaints by the families of prisoners and the  testimonies of lawyers, said that these violations clearly  contravene legislation governing the treatment of prisoners.    The report said that the security forces do not abide by  prison laws, particularly those that provide guarantees to the  inmates. The most significant of these violations is the  constant presence of State Security Investigations officers, who  deal with everything that concerns political inmates and monitor  all visits to them. This is contrary to Article 140 of the  Criminal Procedures Law, which prohibits the prison commissioner  from allowing policemen to contact prisoners except with written  permission from the Public Prosecution Office specifying the  length of and reason for the visit. Article 79 of Law 396 of  1956 states: "This ban aims at providing protection to the  prisoners against an attempt by the police to influence them."    The report also referred to the violations of legislative  provisions by the Public Prosecution Office. The law stipulates  that officials of the Public Prosecution Office should pay  periodic visits to the prisons to make sure that they do not  violate legislative provisions. However, the report notes that  a large number of detainees who spent various terms in prison  have testified that they have not been visited even once by  Public Prosecution officials. This is regarded as extreme  negligence on the part of the office.    As for collective punishment, the EHRO has ascertained that  the security forces have repeatedly imposed collective  punishment on inmates on the pretext of safeguarding security  and hygiene, particularly inside the prisons where detainees or  convicts from the political Islam groups are held. During these  campaigns, the security forces used tear gas, batons, and whips,  which is considered a flagrant violation of prison laws and  regulations. Collective punishment campaigns were carried out  frequently in the prisons of Abu Za'bal, al-'Aqrab, al-Marj, and  al-Hadrah in Alexandria. The most violent of these campaigns  took place in Abu Za'bal and al-Marj prisons. It began in Abu  Za'bal on 28 August 1993 with a ban on recreation and visits by  families or lawyers, the prevention of medical treatment, and  the confiscation of the personal effects of the inmates.    The second raid was carried out the following month in  which large number of soldiers and special forces were used.  Violent and various forms of punishment were meted out to the  prisoners. The forces entered Wings A and B and brought out  prisoners from their cells and started beating them. Police  dogs were also unleashed on them and, as a result, six prisoners  were injured and evacuated to the al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital.  The prisoners immediately went on a 14-day hunger strike during  which they were punished one by one. This was followed by two  similar disciplinary raids during which 15 prisoners were  injured and four others were killed. The second flagrant  example of collective punishment took place in the al-Marj  prison when the security forces' raids injured 10 prisoners  after they were beaten and dragged around.    The second violation that prisoners are being subjected to  is  bad health care. The report confirms the grave deterioration in  the prisoners' health as a result of the small number of doctors  and the shortage of medicine. The EHRO stressed that this  represents a form of punishment by prison authorities.  Contagious diseases, such as scabies, have spread in the Abu  Za'bal prison, in addition to individual cases of serious  illnesses resulting from inadequate medical care.    The order banning visits began with the escalation of what  they termed "the rioting" in the Abu Za'bal prison last August  during which three prisoners were killed and 76 others were  injured. The ban was then extended to many other prisons.    The EHRO report also monitored the deteriorating living  conditions inside the prisons, including the inedible food given  to them. The report stressed that around 88 percent of the  prisoners do not rely on prison food but discard it. The report  also monitored the shortages of beds and covers, in addition to  the small spaces where prisoners are crammed.    At the end of the report, the EHRO made several  recommendations addressed to the president of the republic, the  legislative authorities, and the Interior Ministry. The  recommendations underlined the need to respect the laws and  rules that govern the prison authority. It also called on the  public attorney to initiate an immediate investigation into the  complaints made by groups and individuals about attacks made on  detainees. It demanded the repeal of some laws that justify  these measures and the repeal of the president of the republic's  authority to establish prisons and his sole prerogative to  define the groups that will be housed in them.    The EHRO's first report of 4 August 1991 also detailed the  bad living conditions in prisons.</p>

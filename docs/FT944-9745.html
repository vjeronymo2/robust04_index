			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Tokyo - Other markets James Capel's technical analysis team last week said large-scale investment decisions were not taking place in Japan: 'the largest percentage movements are currently in stocks like Sega and Nintendo.' However, this week investors have another opportunity to relent. Economic data include trade figures and wholesale prices tomorrow, and money supply on Friday. The results list takes in Matsushita Electric Industrial tomorrow and East Japan Railway on Wednesday; on Thursday, Sony reports, with a clutch of trading houses, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Marubeni. In a review of trading houses Baring Securities says the sector should be aggressively overweighted in the light of recent strong moves in world commodity markets, and the beginnings of recovery in the domestic economy.

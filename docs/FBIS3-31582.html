			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At this hour groups of miners, although in smaller  numbers as compared to previous days, are gathered in the square  next to the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation, where they  are waiting for the arrival of Miron Cosma [leader of Romania's  Miners' Free Trade Unions], who on Friday [18 February] night  let them understand that he would arrive today at 1200 [1000  GMT].    Today the Targu Jiu Court of Justice admitted the request  forwarded to it by the aforementioned public corporation and  declared illegal the strike held between 14-18 February [by the  Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation members] in the square of  the Gorj County Prefect's Office. The court of justice  established that its ruling may be appealed within 48 hours.    Following that decision Mr. Nicolae Mihu, the chairman of  the  Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation stated that he will  appeal the sentence and that the strike will continue despite  the fact that it is considered illegal. The halting of the  strike depends on who will be the members of the government  commission [to be sent to inquire about the causes of the  strike] and the beginning of the investigations to find the  irregularities at the brown coal public corporation.    Within a few minutes a news conference is scheduled to begin  at the Gorj County Prefect's Office headquarters, which is to be  attended by Gorj County Prefect Gheorghe Caralicea-Marculescu  and the representatives of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public  Corporation.    Our correspondent accredited to Victoria Palace [government  headquarters] learned from sources at the Ministry of Industry  that this morning four general directors of the aforementioned  ministry left for Targu Jiu to examine, in the light of the  written complaints sent to the ministry by the Lignitul Mining  Trade Union Federation, the activity of the administration board  of the brown coal public corporation . They will also discuss  the issues raised by that trade union federation in connection  with the collective labor contract.</p>

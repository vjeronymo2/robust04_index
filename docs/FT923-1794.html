			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / East's pollution 'threat to Germany's targets' THE former East German states are a huge obstacle to German environmental plans, according to Mr Klaus Topfer, environmental minister. He told the Financial Times Germany had 'a hell of a job' to meet environmental targets on reducing the emission of carbon gases announced by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Earth Summit in Rio in June. He said a carbon tax to help cut those emissions 'is absolutely necessary - and very soon. Germany cannot meet the targets without it.' Germany has said that it plans to cut emission of carbon dioxide by 25-30 per cent by 2005 compared to 1987 levels. However, he admitted that 'the German government's position is in favour of a tax, but parts of German business are against it'. East Germany was emitting roughly twice as much carbon dioxide per head of population as the west, because of its use of lignite fuel. He also expected the number of cars in the former east Germany to double to the west's level of one car for every two people. Mr Topfer added that he supported the plans of the UK environment minister, Mr Michael Howard, for more vigorous enforcement of EC environmental policy but that the methods chosen could still pose problems for German federal structure. 'We would have a problem with a central green police,' he said. However he added that enforcement 'is vital for the credibility of the community and for environmental department'.</p>

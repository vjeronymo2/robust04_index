			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAVANNA BLOCKS A FIELD GOAL, SALVAGES TIE WITH LAGUNA HILLS  </P> <P> Savanna High School blocked a 25-yard field goal attempt by Laguna Hills' Marc  Brodbeck with seven seconds remaining in the game to preserve a 7-7 tie Friday  night at Mission Viejo High School.  </P> <P> The Rebels' (3-1-1) defensive front penetrated the Hawks' offensive line and  several players smothered Brodbeck's low kick.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills (3-1-1) moved the ball into field goal position after Mark  Bochenek recovered a fumble by Savanna's Randall Morgan at the Rebel 44-yard  line with 1:52 left. Marwan Saba gained 14 yards in two running plays, and then  quarterback Casey Sullivan hit tight end Kirk Brown for a 19-yard gain to the  Savanna 10 with 16 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> An off-tackle run by Saba moved the ball into the middle of the field at the  eight, but the blocked kick ended Laguna Hills' would-be winning drive.  </P> <P> Savanna took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Jeff Ragos' one-yard touchdown  run. Ragos' score capped a 34-yard drive that was set up by Hien Nguyen's  19-yard punt return.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills tied the score in the third quarter. Savanna fumbled away the ball  at its 23-yard line. Saba finished the eight-play drive with a one-yard  touchdown run with 4:21 left in the quarter.  </P></p>

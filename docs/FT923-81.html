			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Chairman of Skanska resigns THE chairman and chief executive of Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction and property group, resigned yesterday, accepting his share of responsibility for the estimated SKr1.2bn (Dollars 222.2m) losses suffered by the company as a result of alleged unauthorised foreign exchange speculation and the high Swedish interest rates. Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson, head of Skanska since 1986, said he was leaving immediately. He will be replaced as chairman by Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of Asea Brown-Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering conglomerate, who has been on Skanska's board for the past six years and became vice-chairman in 1991. Mr Sven-Eric Hersvall will remain as Skanska's president but the post of chief executive will be subsumed in the organisation. The sudden change at the top of the company followed an emergency board meeting yesterday. 'Skanska is a well-run company strong on the contracting business side with a number of industrial companies and a good stock of real estate companies', said Mr Barnevik. It was important to concentrate harder on key operations and restore confidence in the company, he said. Mr Hakansson's abrupt departure from Skanska follows the dismissal of the head of the group's financial subsidiary earlier in the month for alleged currency speculation during the summer that cost Skanska an estimated SKr1bn.</p>

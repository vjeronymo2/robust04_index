			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Hotels and nursing homes behind rise at Vaux A strong performance in hotels and nursing homes helped Vaux, the Sunderland-based brewer, to a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 10.7m for the six months to March 19. The price war in the wholesale beer trade continued to take its toll, with a 10 per cent fall in Vaux's volume sales to the free trade. Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman, said the overall beer market had fallen by 3 per cent, and by 10 per cent over the past three years. Vaux had resisted pressure to cut prices, he said. 'We weren't prepared to trade margin.' Sales to Vaux pubs were also down 1 per cent. However, this was more than offset by the start-up of a contract to brew Heineken lager for Whitbread, which helped contract brewing volume to double. The net effect was a 7 per cent rise in beer volume and a 3 per cent rise in trading profit to Pounds 8.7m, on sales up 1 per cent. Group turnover was up 3 per cent at Pounds 109.1m. Profits from Swallow Hotels were up 13 per cent at Pounds 6m, with room rates held steady over the period and occupancy rates up slightly at 58 per cent. Profits from St Andrew Homes, the nursing homes chain, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 2.3m. Profits from Vaux pubs were up 4 per cent at Pounds 2.4m. Net debt was Pounds 125m (Pounds 132m) at mid-year, resulting in gearing of 33 per cent. After interest charges of Pounds 6.23m (Pounds 6.16m) and tax of Pounds 2.13m (same), earnings per share emerged 12 per cent higher at 6.09p. The interim dividend is raised 3 per cent to 3.35p. Sir Paul criticised the government for inaction over beer imports. 'The brewing industry is looking at difficult times ahead', he said. However, though the strength of recovery in consumer spending remained uncertain, Easter trade had been up to expectations and profits were ahead in the year to date. COMMENT Though the shares dipped 9p to 278p, there was nothing in the figures to surprise. The dividend increase looks mean, but Vaux is on record as wanting to rebuild cover to 2 to 2.5 times. Coming at the start of the brewers' results season, the profits performance may compare favourably with the rest of the sector. Assuming a full year pre-tax rise of some 10 per cent to Pounds 29.5m, the shares are on 15 times earnings. Though this is not hugely attractive, Vaux has the advantage of exposure to an apparently reviving hotels sector, in which it invested heavily through the recession.</p>

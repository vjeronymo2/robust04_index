According to estimates, as a result of accidental and in  many  cases intentional exhausts there are now over 3.5 million  artificial objects and particles in the circumterrestrial layer  of outer space. Such a cosmic ``debris'' presents a danger to  astronauts as well as to spacecraft.    Passive methods and active methods of cleaning outer space  of  this debris are now being investigated. Removal of debris  fragments by active methods requires use of devices which detect  particles and impart either energy or momentum to them so as to  ensure their deceleration and descent from the orbit. This  problem can be solved in a cardinal way, namely by vaporization  of fragments with the aid of high-energy systems. Such a system  may be a spacecraft which carries an electric reaction engine  which propels it, a nuclear power plant which supplies power to  the engine, and a laser set which imparts energy to a particle  in space.    Under consideration is the possibility of using for this  purpose a spacecraft which carries a nuclear power plant  consisting of a heat emitting reactor-converter and a built-in  laser set with nuclear pumping /1/.    The basal nuclear power plant has the following main  technical and technological characteristics /2/:    1. Use of heat emitting fast-neutron reactor-converter with  a  moderating reflector and with an emitter shell formed by  tungsten single crystals.    2. Use of a high-temperature cooling system with lithium as  the coolant.    3. Transmission of the heat ejected during the thermodynamic  cycle through the surface of a cooler-radiator consisting of  sodium heat exchanger tubes.    4. Use of only one structural material, a niobium alloy,  throughout the entire nuclear power plant.    5. Layout of the nuclear power plant based on the radiation  path principle, with use of shadow-type radiation protection.    One envisages a compound reactor regulation system  consisting  of rotating cylinders inside the lateral reflector in addition  to control elements and protective devices ensuring radiation  safety directly inside the reactor-converter core. Inside the  core is also located a protective nuclear safety system  consisting of devices which absorb neutrons and ensuring nuclear  safety in all emergency situations, these devices being  withdrawn from the core into their functional orbit only before  the power is turned on. The nuclear power plant is both started  and cooled by a startup cooling system which ensures economical  melting of lithium in the tubes by the heat coming from the  reactor-converter during startup.    An array of laser cells is mounted in the lateral reflector  of the heat emitting reactor-converter, its electric power  rating being 150 kw. The reactor generates both the voltage  necessary for sustaining the discharge in the discharge chamber  of the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the neutron flux used for  boost-excitation of the active laser medium. Each cell is a  discharge chamber, a 700 mm long cylindrical tube 110 mm in  diameter, its geometrical axis coinciding with optical axis of  the laser. The electrodes are disposed along that optical axis  and produce a transverse discharge, perpendicular to the  direction of gas flow. The active medium is a  CO[.sub]2[/]-N[.sub]2[/]-He mixture driven through the  discharge tube, its temperature and pressure at the inlet being  500 K and 4500 Pa respectively. A laser set with an exit beam  power of 15 kw requires 10 such cells inside the lateral  reflector. The cells can be cooled either by an independent  cooling system or by a cooling system combined with the cooling  system for the protective shields. It is also feasible to use a  cooling system withe heat exchanger tubes.    Design estimates indicate that the mass of such a nuclear  power plant with an electric power rating of 150 kw will not  exceed nine tons.    Estimates regarding the effectiveness radius of such a power  plant indicate the following. Inasmuch as most of the artificial  objects in outer space are made of aluminum and are within the  0.1-10 mm size range, they require correspondingly 0.00023-200  kJ of energy for vaporization.    Owing to divergence of the laser beam, the intensity of  radiation reaching the surface of a particle will depend on the  distance to that surface. The intensity of radiation incident on  a particle is   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-17A>      FORMULA </FIG>     The intensity levels (watts) of incident radiation from a 15  kW laser, depending on the radius of a particle (cm) and on the  distance to a particle (km), are listed is the Table. The  numbers in parentheses represent the time (seconds) needed for  vaporization of a particle:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-17B>      FORMULA </FIG>     Evidently such a system is very effective at least within  the  10-30 km range of distances.    Such systems operate now in radiation-safe orbits within the  800-2000 km range of altitudes, where most of the mass of debris  fragments is located. The rocket-carrier ``Proton'' puts a  spacecraft with a dry mass of 11.2 tons into a circular orbit at  800 km altitude, whereupon the nuclear power plant on the  spacecraft is turned on so that search for and vaporization of  particles can begin. The spacecraft then moves from 800 km to  2000 km altitude and back to 800 km altitude with an only small  change of the orbit inclination angle, propelled by the 150 kW  electric reaction engine with xenon as the working medium. It  takes the spacecraft about 960 h to make one such sweep and,  with a 5-6 tons supply of xenon, it can make 40-50 sweeps during  its 5 years long life. Complete removal of fragments within the  800-2000 km layer requires 8-10 such spacecrafts.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-18A>      Spacecraft for Cleaning Circumterrestrial Space Layer of Debris Fragments </FIG>   Bibliography    1.

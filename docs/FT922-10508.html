			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Call for fuller company reports: Accountancy body seeks disclosure of more details by all quoted groups COMPANIES should help share-holders by providing far more detailed comments on their activities in annual reports, says the UK accountancy standards body. A new 'operating and financial review' statement should give a balanced, objective statement of good and bad news, the Accounting Standards Board recommends in draft proposals issued yesterday. It should include operating results, financial needs and resources and shareholder value, and should be written in an accessible style. Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, said: 'What we're after is management going behind the numbers and helping people understand their business. I suspect many private shareholders will read this rather than the accounts.' The suggestions are likely to lead to a statement of best practice rather than the legally enforceable accounting standards the board has been producing until now. It would not be audited because it is not part of the accounts. But one option being considered is whether auditors should be required to approve the statement to ensure it complies with the guidelines. Discussion of the ideas will lead to an exposure draft in the late autumn and could be converted into a formal statement early next year. The board would like this to apply to all the quoted companies, as well as other businesses, including the private companies and large entities in the public sector. Among the more important items which the discussion paper says companies should discuss are: the main risks and uncertainties facing the company, including environmental protection costs and liabilities; dependence on important customers or sources of scarce raw materials; and the impact of exchange rate changes on the results; the current capital structure of the enterprise including the purpose and impact of financial transactions undertaken; acquisitions and disposals; and current solvency and liquidity, with details of peak borrowing requirements and facilities; the strengths and resources of the business with value which is not adequately reflected in the balance sheet, such as brand names and other intangible items. The statement will not require profit forecasts and future projections, but should look forward as well as backward and help users in making their own projections of future results. The review should be the responsibility of all the directors, and might ultimately replace either the existing directors' report or the chief executive's review included in existing annual reports. * Operating and financial review discussion paper.

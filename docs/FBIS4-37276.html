			<p>BFN     [Text] There is great hope that the foundations of concord  will be established during the coming months now that the  institutions of the transitional phase have been put in place,  especially in that dialogue is continuing with all  sides--including those who continue to refuse to take part in  the aforementioned institutions.    This was stated by Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salah  Dembri, in an interview with an Al-HAYAT correspondent in  Tunisia that was published today.    During this interview, Dembri indicated that the resumption  of the electoral process is planned in three years' time;  however, the date could be moved forward if conditions allow.</p>

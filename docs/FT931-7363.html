			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Air-drops to land in a political minefield WHATEVER the humanit-arian motives behind the US decision to parachute relief supplies into east-Bosnia Moslem enclaves, such an operation entails some very real political, and military, risks. Although the US administration has indicated that it would also be dropping supplies to isolated Serb and Croat communities in Bosnia, the general perception that Washington is concerned mainly to help the Moslems is unlikely to help the peace process. That process, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, is already in dire trouble following the failure of the leaders of two of the three warring factions to participate in face-to-face talks in New York for the past three weeks. However, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, was more optimistic yesterday when he said the talks could be resumed 'no later than Monday'. The refusal of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to return to New York as promised has been attributed to concern about his security following the UN Security Council's decision to set up a war crimes court and the actions filed against him by three US human rights organisations. This, however, seems to be only part of the story. His reluctance is almost certainly motivated, too, by the realisation that US participation in the peace talks can only increase the pressure on him to make compromises. Despite this, reports from the UN last night said that Mr Karadzic was expected to return to New York by the weekend. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has also failed to turn up in New York, or in Washington where he was due to meet Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, two days ago. The Bosnian leader, whose UN delegate said yesterday was 'definitely committed' to come, has made no attempt to hide his disappointment with Washington's policy stance. It was an open secret that President Izetbegovic and Mr Haris Silajdzic, his foreign minister, hoped the US would announce military intervention on their behalf. Instead, President Bill Clinton did little more than announce US participation in a peace process already underway. All the signs are that the Bosnian government, while welcoming the US decision to parachute relief supplies, is still hoping the air-drops will merely be the first step towards military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs. The risk is that the Moslems may try to bring this about by firing at the US transport aircraft and making it look as if the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the attacks. Threatening noises from the Serbian side have also underlined the risk of an escalation of the conflict, even though Washington said yesterday that combat aircraft would not be used to escort air-drops. If the US operation is no more than a 'one-off' action, and is carried out without incident, it could possibly help the long-term peace process. It would answer the Bosnian government's complaint that the international community is not doing enough to alleviate the Moslems' suffering and would thus deprive it of a pretext for not attending the peace talks. For the moment, however, the mutual suspicions and recriminations that the intended air-drop has aroused have merely complicated a peace process which was already in the doldrums.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Attendance up prices down - Nicholas Powell talks to dealers at Paris's contemporary art fair TRADING at Paris's huge annual contemporary art fair, the FIAC (Foire International d'Art Contemporain) officially totalled FFrs 400m in 1989, dipped to FFrs 300m a year later and in 1991 came to only FFrs 200m. Attendance at this year's 19th FIAC, which closes tomorrow night, was huge, and prices the lowest in years. Yet most of the 162 dealers will consider themselves lucky is they cover costs. Andrew Kalman of London's Crane Kalman Gallery, one of five British dealers present and a first timer at at the FIAC, sold seven works, including three by London based South African artist Jenny Franklin and two by Mary Newcomb, both virtually unknown in Paris. Leslie Waddington of Cork Street's Waddington Galleries meanwhile was more upbeat, reporting a turnover of nearly Pounds 600,000 - three times what he expected - by the middle of last week. 'We have been utterly amazed to get out of London, which is dead and depressed, to discover people who look at paintings and are ready to spend money, too' he said. Twenty-five Italian galleries were guests of honour of this year's FIAC: Galleria Annunciata of Milan showed 23 drawings, museum worthy (if not exactly contemporary) by the futurist Carlo Carra, dated 1910-15 priced at FFrs 120-150,000. Sperone of Rome showed the most recent work of Mimmo Paladino - five unusually small canvases mounted in box-like frames resembling medieval altar pieces for FFrs 200,000. Artiaco from Naples brought recent work by arte povera artists such as Anselmo - two huge granite blocks strung perilously over a canvas on steel wire - and Penone. Germany's 15 galleries shone by the pluck and the quality of their exhibitions: Springer from Berlin showed the harsh, photographic work of Deiter Appelt and steel sculptures by Prague-born Vladimir Skoda. Sfoir-Semler from Keil juxtaposed works by Scottish sculptor Ian Hamilton Finlay, former Cobra painter Lucebert and the first wire sculptures by Gunter Haese to be seen on the market for a long time. Denise Rene, France's most active champion of abstract art since the war, organised a display of works, full of moving parts, flashing lights and optical illusion, by the op artists she first promoted when they were unknowns in the 1960s and '70s such as Vardanega, Schoffer, Boto, Demarco and Garcia Rossi. Nearby, Galerie Gmurzynska from Cologne had an array of drawings and oils by Russian futurists Malevitch, Souetin and Tshashnik. The recession is at least encouraging galleries to back younger talent. Willy d'Huysser from Brussels gave the work of Glasgow-born Calum Colvin, famous elsewhere in Europe but not in France, its first airing in the country. Paris's Gutharc Ballin mounted a one man show of large abstract figures in bright velvet and wood by British artist Stephen Hepworth. Aline Vidal from Paris showed melancholy photomontage works by the German Edmund Kuppel at FFrs 25-50,000 alongside sculptures and drawings by a little known 35 year old Frenchman, Jean-Marc Andrieu, for FFrs 5-50,000. Air de Paris, a gallery from Nice, showed work by Philippe Perrin - a French artist whose offerings included paintings of Sarajevo done in blood at FFRs 4,000 each. Leading contemporary dealer and FIAC veteran Holly Solomon from New York said she had once again made exciting contacts with collectors and curators. 'Four years ago there were runners making a fortune selling from one stand to another. But I sell to collectors, not speculators and my prices have not dropped because they were never inflated. The market has not gone to pot. Now is the time to buy. If you have the money,' she said.</p>

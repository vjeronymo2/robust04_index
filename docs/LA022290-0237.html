			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LOCAL BUYERS BID FOR NORTH STARS  </P> <P> A group that includes Minnesota businessman Harvey Mackay today expressed  interest in negotiating for local investors to buy the Minnesota North Stars,  whose owners have said they'll move the NHL team to the San Francisco Bay Area  if a buyer cannot be found to keep it in the state.  </P> <P> "We are optimistic that a deal can be struck to keep the North Stars in  Minnesota, but this is far from a completed transaction," the group, which  calls itself North Star Hockey Partners of Minnesota, said in a prepared  statement released before a news conference late this morning.  </P> <P> According to the statement, Mackay called North Stars co-owner Gordon Gund on  Wednesday night to tell him about a letter Gund would receive from the Mackay  group. The statement said the letter "indicated an offer to open direct and  serious negotiations for the purchase of the Minnesota North Stars by a group  of local investors."  </P> <P> Mackay also talked with NHL Commissioner John Ziegler and sent him a copy of  the letter.  </P> <P> The North Stars have arena offers in Oakland and San Jose.  </P></p>

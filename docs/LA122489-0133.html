			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNCIL'S APPROVAL OF EASTERN DEVELOPMENT PLAN  </P> <P> In the late '60s and early '70s, the issues of the day facing the city of  Orange were parks and open space, density and traffic and the City Council  attitude toward petitioners.  </P> <P> Arising from these issues, the city proclaimed four-acres-per-thousand as a  standard for local parks. The density issue was resolved in favor of lower  densities because nothing could be done about the traffic problem.  </P> <P> Two new members of the council were elected, replacing one hard-liner who was  against parks and people and was pro-developer. The era of James Jackman, Joe  H. Temple and Jess F. Perez was ushered in -- a kinder, gentler council.  </P> <P> Last week, the old terrorism returned to the council. Citizen petitioners were  treated with disdain, disrespect and disinterest. The disinterest in open space  and local parks returned again.  </P> <P> The disinterest in the traffic and transportation problems were again evident  when the council approved the East Orange General Plan. The council rejected  even those few caveats the Planning Commission thought were essential, i.e.  three-acres-per-thousand population instead of four and 5,000-square-foot lots  instead of 6,000.  </P> <P> This council went to bed with the Irvine Co. and got raped. The hills of east  Orange will soon be bulldozed. Traffic will be at a standstill. Irretrievable  open space will be gone.  </P> <P> It's deja vu all over again (apologies to Yogi Berra). Who will be the new  Temple, Jackman and Perez?  </P> <P> GERALD PODOLAK  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

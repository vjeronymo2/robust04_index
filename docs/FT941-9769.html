			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke/Burford Ladbroke's sale of a parcel of properties for Pounds 103m provides comfort on two fronts. First, it highlights the new management's determination to reduce its Pounds 1.3bn debt by selling off the more extreme parts of Mr Cyril Stein's sprawling empire. Second, it hints that Ladbroke's properties may indeed be worth what the accounts suggest, which has been a worry in the market. That said, the deal has more significance in terms of sentiment than substance for Ladbroke. The cash inflow is unlikely to prevent the company from chopping its dividend. Ladbroke retains another Pounds 760m of commercial property which may prove more difficult to shift. It is easy to understand Burford's delight. The company has been quick off the mark in securing a deal with one of the few sellers in the market. Moreover, Burford is issuing new paper at a 27 per cent premium to its net asset value to buy properties with an initial yield of 8.4 per cent. That equation will immediately enhance asset values and earnings. The package of properties contains a fair mix of investment grade assets and dull office buildings. But it would be surprising if Burford failed to push the yields higher with more active management. The expansion of Burford's equity base should also enable it to gear up to buy riskier but more rewarding secondary sites. That is where the investment money is now heading.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Taganrog Metallurgical Plant Halted"] </F>   [Text] The Taganrog Metallurgical Plant, the largest  enterprise in southern Russia, closed on Tuesday. It  specialized in the production of pipes, mainly for the oil  industry.    The main reason for the closure is that consumers owe the  plant more than 20 billion rubles for output. The Taganrog  plant does not have the means to pay for fuel for the  open-hearth furnaces.</p>

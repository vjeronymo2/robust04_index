			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Italian Elections, March 27: Pollsters keep eye on Italy's red-belt frontier - Robert Graham visits a microcosm of the country's fast-changing political geography The medieval city of Viterbo once bristled with 240 defence towers. From its strategic position on the slopes of Mount Cimino, 50 miles north of Rome, Viterbo has historically controlled the main access to the city from northern Italy. Today Viterbo still serves a strategic function but of a rather different nature. The town and its unspoiled agricultural hinterland represent the southern frontier of the so-called red belt - the swathe across central Italy dominated throughout the post-war era by the Communist party, transformed since 1991 into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). As campaigning moves into top gear for the general elections on March 27, this electoral college of 245,000 voters has become a microcosm of Italy's fast-changing political geography. The left is struggling to retain its hegemony, the once powerful centre parties are in retreat and the right is pushing up from the south claiming new respectability under the umbrella of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. 'This has always been the frontier with the red belt where upper Lazio touches the border with Tuscany,' says Dr Ferdinando Signorelli, three times senator for the neo-fascist MSI. 'Now they and the centre parties are paying the price for having wasted money with such poor results in local administration.' Dr Signorelli, a prominent local surgeon working in a private clinic, cites the example of Viterbo's new state-run regional hospital. It was started in 1970 and since 1990 has been left unfinished at a cost of L180bn (Pounds 72m). Dr Signorelli is of the old school, proud to talk of Mussolini's achievements in health-care and paying little heed to the two month-old metamorphosis of the MSI into the National Alliance. He claims he is sufficiently known to spend little on his campaign for the one senatorial seat of Viterbo backed by Forza Italia. Mr Berlusconi's movement first appeared on the scene in this town last November. In four months over 40 Forza Italia support clubs have been set up in and around Viterbo. The technique has been the same as elsewhere in Italy. The prime mover has been Publitalia, the advertising arm of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media holding. The network of Publitalia's representatives and contacts has been used to recruit Forza Italia members, often through Lions and Rotary clubs. A dentist from a well-known local family, Mr Giuseppe Lazzarini, was persuaded to enter politics as the Forza Italia flag-bearer. He is now contesting one of two Viterbo seats in the chamber of deputies backed by the National Alliance. Mr Berlusconi has never visited the region to spread his promises of creating jobs and preventing the wicked left from entering government. He does not need to. His message and catchy Forza Italia's campaign song came here via the television. The right has had a strong niche in Viterbo ever since Mussolini established it as a separate province in 1927. But since 1946 the Communist party either held power alone or shared it discreetly in local administrations with the parties in the national government. This state of affairs continued after the Communists transformed themselves into the PDS in 1991. After provincial elections last June, it looked as though the PDS had once proven its superior organisation. A PDS-led alliance with other left-wing parties won 63 per cent of the vote. The Christian Democrat and Socialist vote slumped, while support for the MSI almost doubled to nearly 20 per cent. The threat of the PDS-dominated Progressives repeating this triumph in the general elections has provoked a backlash which in turn has helped polarise local opinion. The Christian Democrats split in January with the mainstream forming the Popular party (PPI) and part of it, the newly-baptised Christian Democratic Centre, allied with Forza Italia and the National Alliance. 'We feel squeezed in the centre,' says Mrs Luisa La Malfa, an educationalist running for the chamber of deputies for the allied central grouping of the PPI and Mr Mario Segni's Italian Pact. 'The traditional catholic electorate is confused. The rural vote we feel will hold up for us; but for the rest we have to rely on people mistrusting the left and finding the new right distasteful,' says Mrs La Malfa, the sister of Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican party. She feels possessing an easily identifiable name is a clear help; but she also believes local issues are important. The main local issue is the extent to which Viterbo should be drawn into Rome's commuter orbit. There is also a big environmental problem. The fate of the power station at Montalto di Castro near Civitavecchia - blocked by the 1987 nuclear power referendum - has put the Greens at odds with their allies, the PDS. Here as elsewhere, the PDS also enjoys an uneasy relationship with the hardline communists who split to form Reconstructed Communism. All this suggests a closer contest than in the provincial elections of June. The PDS has been placed on the defensive; and if the right does well here and captures a seat in the chamber it will mark a big shift in political allegiance.</p>

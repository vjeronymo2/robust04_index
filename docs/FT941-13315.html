			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Motorists a target for 'green' taxes, says Major Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that more 'green' taxes could be on the way as he unveiled the government's long-awaited policy statement on safeguarding the environment into the next century. Indicating that road pricing and higher motor fuel taxes were prime targets, Mr Major said that 'sometimes quite painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental objectives'. 'People may not always be able to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as before - (they) will have to reconcile their desire for travel with their desire to protect the environment for future generations,' he said. Earlier this week, Professor David Pearce, head of environmental economics at London University and a former government adviser, criticised the government for charging road users too little. In research published tomorrow he says the 'social cost' of road use - pollution, congestion and accidents - has been between Pounds 23bn and Pounds 26bn a year, twice the amount raised in taxes on road users. Yesterday's publication of four strategy papers - together nearly 500 pages long - fulfils one of the government's commitments made at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992. They set out the UK's policy on climate change, biodiversity (preserving the diversity of the world's plants and animals), forests and sustainable development. Mr Major also announced that a panel would be set up to give the government 'frank, external advice of the very highest quality' on environmental issues. The panel, which will meet four times a year, will be headed by Sir Crispin Tickell, Warden of Green College, Oxford, and former British permanent representative to the United Nations. The other members are Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank; Lord Selborne, chairman of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the government's conservation advisers; Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; and Ms Anne Mclaren, foreign secretary of the Royal Society. Opposition MPs and environmentalists attacked the reports for failing to draw up new policies or specify targets. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'It is all very well to set up distinguished committees, but that does not amount to very much action.'

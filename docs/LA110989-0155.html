			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> CITY TURNS ATTENTION TO REPLACING VOSS  </P> <P> As recall organizers took down campaign signs and savored their victory in  ousting City Councilman Fred Voss, city officials said Wednesday that they will  move quickly to name a replacement for the man who was mayor until he solicited  a prostitute in January.  </P> <P> In addition to removing Voss from office by a 2-to-1 margin, voters Tuesday  also decided that his replacement will be appointed by the City Council rather  than chosen by a special election that would have cost $45,000. The council  could name a successor as soon as Nov. 14, the day election returns are to be  certified by the county, according to the city clerk's office.  </P> <P> "The (Election) Code said the City Council shall appoint at once," said City  Atty. Alan R. Burns.  </P> <P> City Council members said Wednesday that it was too soon to speculate about who  might replace Voss. "I really don't have any idea," said Councilman James E.  Neal. "The election was just yesterday."  </P> <P> Bob Moss, chairman of the recall committee, said that his group has concluded  its involvement in city politics and will not suggest a successor.  </P> <P> Voters "knew the issues and made their wishes known," Moss said. "I feel sorry  that Fred Voss' political career had to end in this manner."  </P> <P> Voss did not return calls Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Fred is, of course, very disappointed, but he believes in the will of the  people," said Karen Ackley, treasurer for Say No on Recall for Fred Voss. "That  one isolated incident did not affect his decision-making process, and we as his  supporters knew that. We are just sorry that the rest of the community didn't  get an opportunity to realize that too."  </P> <P> Voss, 52, a telephone systems manager, was arrested by Santa Ana police during  a well-publicized crackdown on prostitution on Harbor Boulevard in January.  After offering $20 to an undercover officer disguised as a prostitute, Voss was  arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex.  </P> <P> He later pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge, was fined $300 and  sentenced to three years of probation. Voss resigned his ceremonial post as  mayor but refused to give up his council seat. MARY LOU FULTON and ALLISON  SAMUELS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jean-Bertrand Aristide solicits the renewal of the  mandate of the civilian mission in Haiti. In a letter addressed  to the UN secretary general, the Haitian president-in-exile  asked for the renewal of the mandate of the International  Civilian Mission in Haiti, according to the terms of reference  already negotiated with Dante Caputo.    Referring to a deterioration of human rights and democracy  in  Haiti, Aristide hoped that the presence of the mission is  contributing to an improvement in the human rights situation and  helping create a favorable environment for political dialogue in  the country.</p>

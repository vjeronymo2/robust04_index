			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Spring Ram shareholders face further uncertainty SHAREHOLDERS in Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, face continuing uncertainty after a week of inconclusive bid talks and growing tension at board level. Masco Corporation, one of the largest building products groups in the US, last week met Mr Roger Regan, the Yorkshire company's new chairman. However, Spring Ram said the Masco executives only spoke in general terms about the industry and returned to the US without making any offer. The Yorkshire company denied reports that Masco had said it could only offer 45p a share. Last Monday Spring Ram's shares rose 15p to 69p after it confirmed that talks had taken place with several parties, including Masco, but emphasised that the approaches were of a preliminary nature. However, the leaking of Masco's approach at the beginning of last week has not helped the working relationship between Mr Regan and supporters of Mr Bill Rooney, the co-founder of Spring Ram who lost his job as chairman but is continuing as chief executive. Mr Rooney's role as executive chairman was taken a fortnight ago by Mr Regan, a building industry veteran. He was approached by institutions, led by Prudential Corporation, after the company issued three profit warnings within eight months, causing a collapse in its share price. Mr Regan is working with Mr Rooney on a trial basis and if the relationship does not work out, then Mr Regan has enough votes on the new board to sack him. The new chairman is now concentrating on preparing for Spring Ram's interim results announcement on September 22, and has said he is not interested in 'bargain-hunters'. Mr Regan and Mr Martin Towers, his new finance director, are being assisted in their investigations into the company by the Liverpool office of Price Waterhouse, the accountants. Price Waterhouse is likely to replace Spring Ram's existing auditors, Arthur Andersen, which signed off the annual accounts without qualification.</p>

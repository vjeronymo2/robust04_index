			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Angry Bush denies allegations of affair: Claims likely to sour presidential campaign PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday angrily denied he had an extra-marital affair with a personal assistant eight years ago in Switzerland. Asked at a press conference with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, for his reaction to a New York tabloid newspaper report, he snapped: 'I'm not going to take any sleazy questions like that from CNN. I am very disappointed you would ask such a question of me.' He went on: 'I will not respond to it. I haven't responded in the past. I am outraged but nevertheless in this kind of screwy climate we're in I expect it. But I don't like it and I'm not going to respond other than to say it is a lie.' Mrs Barbara Bush, who was at the press conference, said that 'fortunately' she had not seen a copy of the newspaper in question. Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, whose campaign was nearly derailed earlier in the year by allegations of marital infidelity, expressed sympathy for the president. 'I didn't like it (the newspaper story). I don't think it has any place in this campaign,' he said in Miami. 'I feel for him. I like him on a personal level, I like his wife.' Earlier Ms Mary Matalin, the Bush campaign's combative political director, as good as accused the Democratic party of being responsible for publication of the story in the New York Post. 'They've been peddling this trash book to reputable newspapers for years,' she said. The newspaper account, spread over front and inside pages, was lifted from a footnote in the 14th chapter of a new book about power broking in Washington. In it the husband of the author, Ms Susan B. Trento, reports a 1986 conversation with Mr Louis Fields, who was a former US ambassador to Geneva arms control negotiations but who died in 1988. This purportedly described Mr Fields arranging a tryst for the then vice-president with Ms Jennifer Fitzgerald. Rumours of Mr Bush's liaison have been the stuff of cocktail party gossip in Washington all year, but US news organisations have failed to unearth any evidence. English-born Ms Fitzgerald, now a protocol officer at the state department, was said yesterday to be out of the country. The most obvious impact on the presidential campaign is to make it dirtier, as had been predicted and as Ms Matalin's initial reaction demonstrated. Much will depend on how the US media treats the latest developments.</p>

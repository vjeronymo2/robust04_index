			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon delivered by Ayatollah </F> Mohammad Emami-Kashani, spokesman for the Guardians Council, in  Tehran on 13 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The arrogant West and the  enemies of Islam are scared of this system, a system based on  theology and justice, a system whose nation is so alert and  vigilant. Therefore, there are conspiracies. Installing the  device at the Iranian Embassy in London -- which, as you heard,  our Foreign Ministry explained to the people -- by Britain, that  old, decrepit, fallen, and defeated politician, is one of the  plots. That "Satanic Verses" book written by that despicable  person, whom I do not want to name, was another, and so on.    These are the conspiracies the arrogant world is hatching  now. International forums and organizations are under its  control. Decision-making centers are under its thumb. With  great regret, certain governments of Islamic countries are in  its service. It can control the ebb and flow of the resources  of many Islamic countries. This is the situation that the  arrogant world has created.    It is scared of Islam, so you see how it treats Muslims in  Bosnia, Palestine, Algeria, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and other  Islamic countries, and inside Islamic countries.    There exists an evil triangle: on the one side is world  arrogance, led by America; on the other, the residues of the  collapsed East, and the third side is Zionism, which by its  nature is an ally of the other two sides of the triangle. They  have created this situation in the world of Islam.    What Islam and the Koran offer as a solution is that victory  is the triumph of right, and God's triumph is success.  Deviation from the path of God brings failure and wretchedness.  Jihad, alertness, self-sacrifice, selflessness, and solidarity  are among what we see liberating nations, and their inception is  from Islamic Iran, the land of Islam. That is why the world of  arrogance has risen against it. We should recognize such  conspiracies. God be praised, our nation is aware of such  conspiracies and is still brave. We should go on knowing that  God's victory is with us, God's triumph is with us, and the last  word is said and will be said by Islam, God willing. [crowd  chants: "God is great," "Death to America," "Death to Israel,"  other indistinct slogans] [passage omitted]    I wish to say prayers to plead with God to remove the  difficulties facing the Islamic world. I also wish to pray for  the speedy recovery of those suffering illness, particularly for  Ayatollah Khaza'ali, who is hospitalized and is suffering from a  heart ailment. May God cut off the hands of blasphemy. May God  turn the evil of oppressors onto themselves and may He assist  the suffering Muslims, particularly in Bosnia, Palestine, and  other regions. May God assist the dear leader of the  revolution. [passage omitted]</p>

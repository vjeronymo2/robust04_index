			<p>BFN     [Text] Achille Occhetto has resigned as secretary of the  Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] in a letter to Giglia  Tedesco, the chairman of the party's commission.    "I want to avoid groundless objections and controversy by  submitting my resignation," Occhetto wrote. "My decision is not  capitulation, but an act of pride and struggle in the name of  the PDS and the Left."</p>

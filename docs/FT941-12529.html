			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus looks to joint ventures Proteus International, the computerised drug design company, yesterday hailed joint ventures as the key to profitability after three successive years of losses. Although pre-tax losses more than doubled to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.21m) in the six months to September 30, the Macclesfield-based group said such ventures would give it 'ultimate access to profits'. Since March last year the USM-traded company, ultimately controlled by Imseco Medical Services and which specialises in molecular modelling for drug development, has formed five new joint ventures to produce and market drugs for the human and animal health sectors. Most recently, it joined forces with Medeva, the pharmaceuticals group, to set up Beavermade - a new company to develop synthetic vaccines and therapeutics for humans. Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said the group's long term prospects had been further enhanced by its strategic alliance with American Home Products, the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical group. The multi-product agreement with AHP, from which Proteus will receive 50 per cent profits and retain patents over drugs in clinical development, was typical of the deals it is pursuing, he said. 'The agreement also gives us the opportunity for substantial future potential earnings whilst limiting downside risk,' he added. In spite of his optimism, the shares fell 19p yesterday to close at 423p. Losses per share rose from 4.73p to 10.08p. Mr Gilmore, said, however, that the results were broadly in line with expectations and represented only a small increase over a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.34m in the second half of last year. Most of the losses were incurred as the company increased product development.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRISH TAKE TO CONCEPT OF THE B&amp;B&amp;B -- THAT'S BED &amp; BREAKFAST &amp;  BLARNEY  </P> <P> The Irish may not have originated the bed and breakfast concept but they  certainly have taken to it.  </P> <P> For some families, the most difficult part of the B&amp;B system has not been  fixing up their extra rooms or adding amenities, but charging money for what  they offer.  </P> <P> "The first time we asked people to pay was like a complete revolution," said  Nancy Fitzgerald of Knockraha in County Cork. Fitzgerald is one of 20 farm  women who started taking in guests in 1965 as an experiment suggested by the  Irish Tourist Board.  </P> <P> "Accepting money was not in keeping with our farming family ways," she said,  "even though we were only asking 15 shillings (about $1.20) per person ." Today  the average rate is $15 to $20, with a maximum of about $50 for a night in a  castle setting.  </P> <P> The prices are hard to beat, because a guest gets a clean, furnished and heated  room and is welcomed to the family hearth like a long-lost friend.  </P> <P> The rate also includes a traditional Irish breakfast that may include hot  cereal, home-baked breads and scones, farm-fresh eggs, bacon and sausages or  fresh fish and pots of coffee or tea.  </P> <P> In 25 years, the quality of Irish B&amp;B accommodations has improved  significantly. More than 400 farmhouses open their doors to guests, and another  800 homes categorize themselves as "town and country" lodgings.  </P> <P> Rooms are available at dairy, sheep, fish or vegetable farms, as well as in  modern split-level houses, seaside villas, mountain retreats, thatched-roof  cottages, country manors and the occasional castle.  </P> <P> Staying in a B&amp;B offers guests opportunities that no hotel can provide,  such as the chance to share in the life style of the host family.  </P> <P> "People just accept us as we are -- no valet service, bellmen or other hired  staff," said Fitzgerald, who is chairman of an association of farmhouses.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald's farmhouse, nine miles north of Cork, is a secluded Georgian home  known as Ashton Grove. It has been in the family for four generations. The  Fitzgeralds open their doors (and four spare bedrooms) to guests from April  through October, and concentrate on raising cattle the remaining months.  </P> <P> By contrast, horses are the focus at Horetown House, the B&amp;B of Vera and  Theo Young and their three sons. Built in the 17th Century for a Quaker family  with 22 children, this 53-room house is set on 223 acres at Foulksmills, about  half an hour's drive west of Wexford in the southeast corner of Ireland.  </P> <P> With more than a dozen horses, the Youngs operate an equestrian center that  attracts riding enthusiasts from throughout Ireland, as well as the rest of  Europe, Australia and the United States.  </P> <P> The Youngs, veterans of the B&amp;B business, were among the original core of  farm families to take in paying customers. Horetown has 12 guest bedrooms (no  private bathrooms) furnished with hand-carved armoires and chests and beds  piled high with fluffy pillows and comforters.  </P> <P> Those who prefer a castle can head south from Shannon Airport to Rathkeale,  County Limerick, and down a wooded path to the Earl of Desmond's 15th-Century  Castle Matrix.  </P> <P> Now the residence of Sean O'Driscoll (a former New Yorker and Air Force officer  with Irish roots) and his Irish wife Elizabeth, this restored stone fortress on  the River Deel has welcomed guests for centuries (Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund  Spenser met here), but has been a B&amp;B for only two decades.  </P> <P> Visitors interested in history come to this fairy-tale setting to see the suits  of armor, antique musical instruments, 400-year-old furniture, tapestries,  vaulted ceilings, rooftop battlements, winding 83-step staircase and dungeon  with shackles. In addition, there is a private chapel and a 12,000-volume  library, with books on Irish heraldry, mythology, art, architecture, medieval  military technology, chivalry and knighthood.  </P> <P> Although this B&amp;B is at the top end of the price scale, guests receive  every 20th-Century comfort. Each of the six bedrooms has been modernized to  include a private bath/shower; three of the rooms are equipped with saunas.  </P> <P> A couple of hours' drive away the dramatic scenery of the Ring of Kerry draws  overnighters to Muxnaw Lodge at Kenmare, a gabled country house built in 1801  and named after a nearby mountain.  </P> <P> Along the shore of Kenmare Bay, this idyllic retreat is the home of William and  Hannah Boland, a doctor and nurse team.  </P> <P> Five bedrooms are available, three of which have private facilities, brass beds  and views of the bay. A tennis court and three acres of mature garden walks  surround the house.  </P> <P> Muxnaw is a small home, with a cozy drawing room where guests congregate each  evening, listening to harp, piano and tin whistle music played by the three  young Boland daughters -- Faye, Nina and Sally Ann.  </P> <P> At Waterford, famed for its hand-cut crystal, antiques and collectibles are an  attraction at Blenheim House, set on four wooded acres beside the River Suir  estuary. Built in 1763, Blenheim is the home of Claire and Greg Fitzmaurice,  who bought the house nine years ago and filled it with their own Waterford  crystal, china and objets d'art.  </P> <P> Although its six bedrooms have modern, private bath facilities, Blenheim  retains its Old World charm and stately ambience. A walk on the grounds is a  celebration of palms, roses and trees as old as the house.  </P> <P> Because no visit to Ireland is complete without a day or two in Dublin,  consider Anglesea Townhouse, a 1903 Edwardian-style B&amp;B in the residential  Ballsbridge section of the city, within walking distance of the U.S. Embassy  and the Royal Dublin Society Showgrounds.  </P> <P> Owned by Sean and Helen Kirrane, this house is equipped with modern  conveniences, from an enclosed sun deck to central heating. Each of the seven  bedrooms has a private bath, direct-dial telephone and television.  </P> <P> Anglesea is furnished with comfort in mind -- rocking chairs and settees and  lots of flowering plants.  </P> <P> The lady of the house greets each arriving guest with a cup of tea and homemade  cake. She also rises every day at 6 a.m. to bake bread and prepare gourmet  breakfasts of fresh-squeezed juice, eggs, fish, baked fruit and an exotic  version of warm cereal with whole meal, nuts, raisins and kiwi fruit. All of  this is served on fine china, crisp Irish linens and the family silver.  </P> <P> Other Irish B&amp;Bs offer a variety of attractions, from organic cuisine to  private golf courses and fishing lakes.  </P> <P> Whether a house is big or small, antique or contemporary, cottage or castle,  the B&amp;Bs of Ireland have one thing in common -- a tradition of genuine  hospitality for visitors. The Irish aptly call it cead mile failte -- 100,000  welcomes.  </P> <P> Rates below are based on bed and breakfast charges per person, per night.  </P> <P>  -- Nancy Fitzgerald, Ashton Grove, Knockraha, County Cork.

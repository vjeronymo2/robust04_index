			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Investors seek signs of new policy direction GILT investors are feeling the full effects of the general malaise over the direction of UK economic policy. Last week long-dated gilts dropped 1 1/2 points as worries piled up about how Britain intends to cope with the loss of its central economic plank in the shape of membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Much of the malaise in the market was connected with the pound's 11 1/2 pfennig loss against the D-Mark during the week. On Friday night in London it was quoted at DM2.43, more than 50 pfennigs below its former central rate of DM2.95 in the ERM from which it was suspended nearly three weeks ago. In the immediate aftermath of the suspension, the gilt market strengthened, especially at the short end of the market on thoughts that the floating pound would permit a rapid lowering in base rates, now 9 per cent. Such a move might help the limping economy move out of recession, and generally restore confidence in UK economic policies. However, since Black Wednesday on September 16 the government's economic policy-making machine has been in a state of torpor. Senior ministers have had to worry about how to re-orient policy towards Europe, and have also become embroiled in a dramatic argument with the Bundesbank over who was to blame for sterling's ERM exit. Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said many in financial markets were worried by lack of direction in UK government policies over the economy. 'We are seeing a policy vacuum. No one has any clear idea about the Treasury's policies over interest rates and the pound.' Last week, while short-dated gilts remained steady, and even gained in price by a small amount at the very short end of the market, long maturing bonds saw their yields rise. As well as the worries over policy, there is also a nagging suspicion among some gilt market experts that inflationary pressures, which for some two years have been kept in check by the the ERM discipline, may in the months ahead become re-ignited if interest rates come down too quickly. The concerns pushed down the price of the long maturing 9 per cent Treasury bond due in 2008 to 96 9/16 on Friday night, some 1 1/2 points less than a week previously. Its yield climbed consequently to 9.42 per cent from 9.21 per cent. Mr Philp Tyson, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, is looking for further rises in yields especially at the long end of the gilt curve in the next few months. The price falls for such classes of gilts could be expected to spill over to the 10-year benchmark stock, which generally had a good month in September as yields fell. The yield on a 10-year UK government stock declined by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) during the month, while on a comparable basis yields on French, Japanese and US government securities fell by rather less - 21 basis points, 11 basis points and 9 basis points respectively. During the month German government bonds performed best of all, yielding 50 basis points less at the end of September compared to the start. Much of this good performance in German bonds is related to the rise in the value of the D-Mark against most other European currencies, a development which is likely to continue in the next week or so after the decision by the Bundesbank council on Friday to leave credit rates unchanged, against expectations of an easing in monetary policy.</p>

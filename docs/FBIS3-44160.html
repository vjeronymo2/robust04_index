			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The second batch of 168 officers and men of the  NRA [National Resistance Army] contingent to the ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] forces in Liberia left this morning on a chartered flight  to join their colleagues already in Buchanan. Speaking to the  troops before their departure at Entebbe International Airport,  the chief of combat operations, Brigadier Joram Mugume, urged  them to be good ambassadors of Uganda. He said that the people  of Uganda expect a successful execution of their peace mission  with the highest discipline ever. [passage omitted]    Today's company, which was drawn from [the] 305th Brigade,  was led by Major (Sam Lusuba), and this brings the total number  of NRA troops in Liberia to 338 out of the expected total of  1,000 troops.</p>

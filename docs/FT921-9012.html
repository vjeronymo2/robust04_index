			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Fujisankei may sell Virgin Music stake FUJISANKEI Communications, the Tokyo media group which holds 25 per cent of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group, is likely to sell its stake if negotiations to bring in a new majority shareholder for the business are successful. Discussions, which could be concluded by the end of the month, are continuing with German media group Bertelsmann and UK-based electrical and entertainment group Thorn EMI. A third US-based company is understood to have entered the bidding in the past week. Mr Branson is attempting to negotiate a joint venture or phased reduction of his stake. He is keen to retain some investment for what one observer of the deal described as 'sentimental reasons' - he created the division 20 years ago, and built his airline and retailing empire around it. Fujisankei, which paid Dollars 150m (Pounds 96m) in 1989 for its 25 per cent stake, is not a bidder for the music division. Prices under discussion - understood to be more than Dollars 1bn - would represent a considerable profit over the Japanese group's initial investment. The division's turnover has risen in that period - to around Pounds 350m - and so have valuations of cashflow from libraries of copyrights. The division is the world's largest remaining independent label, but it has lacked manufacturing or distribution, which the interested bidders could contribute. Fujisankei is believed to be reluctant to remain a minority partner if a new company takes majority control. Last night Fujisankei was unavailable for comment. My office, Page 10</p>

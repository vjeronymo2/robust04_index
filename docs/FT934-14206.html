			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Inflationary pressure shrugged off THE GILT market took a relaxed view of last week's higher than expected figures for inflation, with long-dated bonds barely moving and prices of short-dated securities edging higher. The overall effect of a spate of data about the UK economy was to flatten the yield curve slightly, as investors reasoned that signs of a faltering in the recovery were more likely to push Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for an early cut in interest rates. Perceptions that inflationary pressures in the UK remain weak, in spite of a relatively big move upwards in the retail prices index and also in prices for factory goods at the wholesale level, were behind the modest increase in yields for gilts with maturities of more than 10 years. On Friday night the yield for the 8.75 per cent bond payable in 2017 was quoted at 7.18 per cent, compared with 7.17 per cent the week before. At the other end of the yield curve, the 10 per cent gilt dated 1996 had a yield on Friday night of 5.9 per cent, comfortably down on the 6.06 per cent quoted the week before. The move fits in with the feeling that, on the back of evidence of a sluggish economy, Mr Clarke may reduce base rates from the current 6 per cent around the time of the Budget on November 30, possibly to offset the effects of a fiscal tightening. However, the changes in the yield curve have to be put in the context of moves in other European bond markets. With investor interest in French and German bonds fairly strong, 10-year gilts fell back last week in relation to equivalent German bonds. At the end of the week, yields on the UK instruments were around 106 basis points higher than those on corresponding German securities, after a yield difference of just 96 basis points seven days earlier. This took the yield spread back to the levels seen in July, after which the difference had come down as a result of the relatively good performance of UK bonds during the summer. With the future direction of gilt prices somewhat uncertain, a firmer clue as to likely levels of demand for the bonds may come today when the Treasury announces how much the government had to borrow last month to make up the shortfall between spending and revenues. City analysts reckon this will come out at around Pounds 5.3bn, a number large enough to reinforce worries about the large volume of gilts to be issued over the next few years. A figure of this magnitude could easily lead to a sell-off in gilts, a day ahead of the announcement tomorrow about the volume of bonds the Bank of England is due to auction on October 27. It appears likely that the Bank will decide to auction about Pounds 3.25bn of these bonds, in the maturity range 1997 to 2001. Last week was marked by heavy two-way gilt trading as investors wrestled with the contradictory messages from the UK economic data. On one hand, the move up last month in the Treasury's preferred measure of underlying retail inflation - the year-on-year increase in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - gave the impression that price pressures were increasing. The change in this measure from 3.1 per cent in August to 3.3 per cent last month, while the year-on-year change in the RPI itself went up from 1.7 per cent to 1.8 per cent, came after news that prices of finished manufactured goods - excluding the volatile elements of food, drink, tobacco and petrol - rose by 3 per cent in the year to September after advancing by 2.7 per cent in the year to August. However, giving a different view to gilt investors were further Central Statistical Office figures showing that growth in industrial production faltered during the summer, with manufacturing output down 0.7 per cent in the three months to August 31 compared with the previous three-month period. Some gilt analysts paid more attention to this element of the week's data - which backed up recent anecdotal evidence of subdued business activity throughout the economy - especially in view of the perception that the RPI figures seem to have been distorted by unusually high prices of second-hand cars.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THOSE WOMANIZERS NEED LOVE, TOO  </P> <P> Sen. Tower is gone but the word womanizer lives on. The senator was falsely  accused of being one. Even Sam Donaldson doesn't know what a womanizer is.  </P> <P> My Webster's dictionary doesn't seem to know either. It defines womanizing as  "to pursue freewheeling relationships with women."  </P> <P> I decided to ask some friends what they thought a womanizer was.  </P> <P> Ella Brennan told me, "A womanizer is a man a woman can't stand."  </P> <P> "Supposing she likes him?"  </P> <P> "Then he's a teddy bear."  </P> <P> Lisa Johnson said, "A womanizer is someone who has no respect for anybody. For  example, if a guy in my office takes me out on a date and then the next night  has a date with my roommate -- he is a low-life rat."  </P> <P> "And if he called you two nights in a row, what would he be?"  </P> <P> "Mr. Right."  </P> <P> Bob Hefty spoke up, "The whole business of courting is full of jokers. I enjoy  dating girls, but so far my mother hasn't liked any of them. Does that make me  a womanizer?"  </P> <P> I replied, "People believe that if a man has to go from woman to woman, he is  fatally flawed."  </P> <P> Bob protested, "But if a man's not married, there is nothing wrong with going  out with a lot of women. Everyone has to go somewhere to eat."  </P> <P> I asked Sarah Temple if she thought womanizers were evil people or just poor  little sheep who had lost their way.  </P> <P> "I deal with it on a case-by-case basis. Some guys who start out as womanizers  can easily be tamed. In a way, it's more fun because it's a challenge to win a  man over for yourself. Then there are men who are incorrigible and will never  change. They should not even be confirmed as a member of Bush's Cabinet."  </P> <P> John O'Donnell was sputtering mad. "The whole mating game is based on female  pursuit. Everything from Opium perfume to Victoria's Secret is used to trap us.  After spending so much money on themselves, women get mad if the bait doesn't  work. So they start bad-mouthing males around the water cooler. What do they  call a woman who dates more than one guy?"  </P> <P> "An environmentalist?" I suggested.  </P> <P> I then asked Arthur Buckingham, the lobbyist, "Do certain professions have more  womanizers than others?"  </P> <P> "Of course they do. Defense consultants are in a very high stress business and  womanizing is the only way they can wind down."  </P> <P> Roz Ripple thought womanizers should be hung.  </P> <P> "They serve no useful purpose, and they're always spoiling your fun on a  Saturday night."  </P> <P> "It sounds as if you're bitter because there are no messages on your answering  machine," I said.  </P> <P> "I can get all the womanizer dates I want. But I wouldn't waste my time with a  man who is interested in going to a movie with me one night and validating his  parking ticket with someone else the next."  </P> <P> Steve Trilling added, "You can't label a person a womanizer just because he  wants to take you out. Underneath his Ralph Lauren sport jacket, he might be as  honorable as Ollie North."  </P> <P> Bob Hefty couldn't have agreed more. "What everyone forgets is that men who  take out more than one woman need love, too."  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Electricity surplus of 60 per cent is predicted ENGLAND and Wales will have a 60 per cent surplus of electricity by 1997, the National Grid Company (NGC), which manages the countries' electricity system, disclosed in its annual statement yesterday. More than 10,000MW of plant - the equivalent of 10 medium-size power stations - would have to close to achieve a more reasonable 30 per cent margin, the company's figures show. That will support British Coal's fears that the many gas stations being built will force older coal-fired stations to close. Twenty-eight power stations are due to be built in England and Wales by 1997, the company said. All except the Sizewell B nuclear station will run on gas. NGC emphasised, however, that some of the planned stations could be cancelled. Half will be built by small private-sector generating companies that have emerged since the electricity industry was privatised two years ago. The remainder will be built by National Power and PowerGen, the two big generators created at privatisation. Their construction is controversial because British Coal, National Power and PowerGen think many will be more expensive than existing coal-fired plant and should not be built. They believe the new gas stations will survive only because they have managed to sign contracts to sell power to regional electricity companies at what will prove to be above market prices. That means they will take market share from National Power and PowerGen's older stations, although those may actually be generating cheaper power. Most vulnerable are smaller coal and oil-fired stations, such as National Power's Padiham, Willington, Uskmouth and Staythorpe stations, and PowerGen's High Marnham and Drakelow B stations. National Power said it would fight to keep good coal stations open. Nuclear Electric is on course for another profitable year, Mr John Collier, the company's chairman, said yesterday. Results for the financial year just ended, which will be announced in July, would be 'very rosy indeed'. The state-owned company, which owns and operates the nuclear power stations of England and Wales, produced a record amount of electricity in the year to last month, Mr Collier said. It generated 45,000 megawatt-hours of electricity, compared with 42 the previous year. Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, yesterday amended the market rules to allow more companies to choose their electricity supplier, rather than having to buy from their local company. The rules allowed only companies buying more than 1MW to choose their supplier. The amendment enables companies that are subsidiaries of the same group and occupy the same site to add together their purchases to push them over the 1MW limit.</p>

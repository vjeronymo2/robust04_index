			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RON KOVIC'S POSSIBLE BID FOR ELECTION TO CONGRESS  </P> <P> As a conservative Midwest transplant, I must object to Rep. Robert K. Dornan's  comment that it is the "Hollywood Left" that is out to get him.  </P> <P> It is time for him to open his eyes and his mind and to take note of the fact  he is out of step with what is happening in the world today. Because of his  non-thinking attitude, little old ladies transplanted from all over are out to  get him. It does sound like he is getting a trifle nervous. We can only hope.  </P> <P> KAY STRATE  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / 'Crash landing' predicted for W German economy: Deutsche Bank economist criticises 'inappropriate' Bonn policy THE western German economy is heading for a crash landing, dragged down by tumbling industrial production, high unemployment, and 'inappropriate' policy responses in Bonn, according to Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. Gross domestic product in the west will fall by up to 2 per cent this year and numbers without work will rise by a further 500,000, he told the Financial Times. Another 100,000 will lose their jobs in the east, pushing the unadjusted pan-German total above 4m next January. By then some 1.5m people - an increase of 400,000 on latest levels - will be working short time, he added. He predicted unemployment would remain at around 4m during 1994, and downgraded his forecast for economic growth next year from 3 to 2 per cent. Fearing political paralysis due to federal and state elections starting in February next year, he said: 'It is difficult to see when anyone in politics will have the chance to think and act. I have never yet seen any major policy changes in an election year.' He was confident of further cuts by the Bundesbank in leading interest rates, and said he was assuming the Lombard and discount rates would each fall 200 basis points to 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively by the end of the year. However, rate cuts alone could not bring recovery. In the short term, only exports - mainly to north America and south east Asia, which account for 20 per cent of overseas sales - could help bring relief. Mr Walter's forecasts represent an almost complete reversal of his stance in a matter of weeks. From being one of the most optimistic commentators, he has switched to being one of the most pessimistic. In an article written for the FT in early January he predicted nil economic growth and 3.25m unemployment during 1993. He later adjusted his growth forecast to minus 1 per cent, in line with government expectations. 'We are heading into a deeper trough than we had assumed,' he explained, 'and the economic policy reaction has been too small to correct the imbalances.' While there had been some surprising positive developments, including wage settlements around or below the expected rate of inflation and the Bundesbank's recent interest rate cuts, their benefits had been obliterated by further worsening of domestic and external conditions. The government's proposed solidarity package, comprising mainly tax increases, was an 'almost completely inappropriate' response under conditions which called for public spending cuts, privatisation of state assets and an increase in the retirement age, he said. Mr Walter enjoys privileged observer status in Germany's biggest private bank, which has intimate links with the country's top companies. He said business and consumer confidence was 'crashing'. Apart from the effects of the cyclical downturn, western Germany faced structural deterioration with de-industrialisation, nil foreign investment and 'an extended period of increased unemployment'. Despite his gloom, he said he could not imagine that the people, politicians and business community would not react this year. Union restraint on pay, which has led to deals of 3-4 per cent this year, showed labour leaders had reacted more rationally than politicians. Mr Walter said he had a faint hope that Germany would 'fight back' if the failings of Europe's 'model' economy threatened the national reputation with international ridicule. However, he added, next year's elections loomed as 'a deadly threat to my hopes'.</p>

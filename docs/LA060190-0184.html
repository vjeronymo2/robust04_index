			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGASSI SEEING RED OVER CHARGE THAT CLOTHES ARE TOO COLORFUL  </P> <P> Andre Agassi clashed angrily with International Tennis Federation President  Philippe Chatrier after sanctions were threatened today against players wearing  colorful clothes at the French Open.  </P> <P> A statement by Chatrier, head of the French Tennis Federation, said several  members of the tournament organizing committee "have been very disturbed by the  dress of Agassi, for example."  </P> <P> Chatrier said the authorities were considering introducing new clothing  regulations next year.  </P> <P> Agassi, who has been wearing black denim shorts and pink tights throughout the  first week of the tournament, retorted: "Chatrier, he's a bozo."  </P> <P> The third-seeded Agassi, speaking to reporters after his third-round victory,  said tennis authorities should get out from behind their desks and ask  spectators if they enjoyed watching him play, rather than criticize him.  </P> <P> "The way Chatrier is handling the situation is a perfect example of why the  tennis players wanted to start their own tour," he said in a reference to the  Assn. of Tennis Professionals tour, which began this year.  </P> <P> Agassi said he was not concerned about missing the French Open in the future.  "It would be one less tournament to play," he said.  </P> <P> As Agassi was speaking, the authorities reissued their statement and dropped  all references to the 20-year-old American.  </P></p>

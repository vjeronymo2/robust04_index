			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CONVICTED OF THROAT-SLASH MURDERS OF TWO WOMEN, BOY, 3  </P> <P> After eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted a suburban carpet cleaner  Wednesday of the throat-slash murders of three people and the attempted murder  of another.  </P> <P> The jury of six men and six women who convicted David Lucas, 33, of Spring  Valley found that the murders were committed with special circumstance, which  could mean the death sentence. The jurors will return to deliberate on the  sentence next month.  </P> <P> Lucas, originally accused of a string of six murders in the San Diego area, sat  impassively as the verdicts were announced.  </P> <P> Lucas was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1979 deaths of Suzanne  Jacobs, 31; her son, Colin, 3, and the 1984 death of Anne Catherine Swanke, 22.  Jacobs and her son were found with their throats slashed inside their San Diego  home. Swanke, a San Diego State student, was found with her throat slashed on a  remote hillside in Spring Valley.  </P> <P> The jury also convicted Lucas of the attempted murder of Jody Santiago  Robertson. Robertson, a Seattle woman, survived a June 9, 1984, attack in which  she was strangled and her throat slashed. Lucas was also convicted of kidnaping  Robertson, who testified for the prosecution, and Swanke.  </P> <P> Lucas was acquitted in the death of Gayle Roberta Garcia, a Point Loma realtor  who was found with her throat slashed in a vacant Spring Valley house Dec. 8,  1981.  </P> <P> The jurors were deadlocked on charges that Lucas killed Rhonda Strang, 24, and  Amber Fisher, 3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child when their  throats were slashed Oct. 23, 1984. The jury foreman told Superior Court Judge  Laura Hammes that after taking four or five votes, jurors were split, 11 for  conviction and one for acquittal.  </P> <P> Lucas had served a four-year sentence at the California Youth Authority for the  1973 rape of a young woman. The woman was abducted and taken to a remote  recreation area where, authorities said, Lucas raped her and used a knife to  cut her hands and throat. She survived the attack.  </P></p>

The students, who last Monday began a "sit-in" strike at the  embassy and who have disrupted activities at the mission,  Wednesday sent a telex message to authorities in Niamey on their  grievances, Adamou Tahirou, Vice President of the Union of Niger  Students in Nigeria, told AFP.    Niamey has also yet to pay the students, who are studying  sciences, banking, engineering, computer science, business  administration and arts in Nigerian universities, registration  fees for last year and this year as well as other allowances,  Adamou said.    In a telex message Wednesday by the embassy, a copy of which  was shown to AFP, the mission urged the government of Niger to  send buses to Nigeria to "repatriate" the students immediately  because the embassy might not be able to take care of the cost  of the hospitalisation of the students, some of whom are already  suffering from "physical weakness".    "The students are in a catastrophic situation" following  non-payment of seven months of arrears of their allowances,  according to the embassy.    Niger's ambassador to Nigeria, Maman Mansour, confirmed to  AFP the "sit-in" strike of the students and the debt of seven  months arrears of grants to the students.</p>

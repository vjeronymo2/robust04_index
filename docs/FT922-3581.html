			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Rembrandt associates limit earnings growth to 8% REMBRANDT, the South African tobacco group, has posted a modest earnings increase of just under 9 per cent for the year to end-March as weak results from associate companies held back its overall performance. Net income before tax rose by 22 per cent to R1.17bn (Dollars 416.3m), with the after-tax figure up by 21.4 per cent to R747.7m. These figures primarily reflect the performance of the group's unlisted tobacco interests, the diversified industrial group Huntcor and interest income. The pre-tax figure also includes R221.3m of dividend income. Analysts estimate that tobacco earnings grew by 10 to 12 per cent and that interest earnings were boosted considerably by the sale last year of Rembrandt's stake in the Stanbic banking group. The group's share of net income retained by associates dropped by 16 per cent to R269.9m. The decline reflected the poor performance of the group's mining and industrial interests. Gold Fields, in which Rembrandt has a 17.4 per cent stake, reported flat earnings in the six months to December, while Gencor's earnings were 26 per cent down in the year to February. Rembrandt has a 25.2 per cent stake in the parent, Gencor Beherend. There were also weak performances from other Rembrandt industrial associates, including Huntcor, Dorbyl and Metkor. As a result net income from Rembrandt's normal business operations was only 8.8 per cent higher at R941.1m. Earnings per share were up by a similar margin at 180.3 cents, with a total dividend of 32.6 cents a share. A special dividend of 30 cents a share was also declared earlier this year. The results are modest by Rembrandt's standards, reflecting the weak state of the South African economy. Most of the growth appears to have come from tobacco operations. Rembrandt has about an 80 per cent share of the South African tobacco market.</p>

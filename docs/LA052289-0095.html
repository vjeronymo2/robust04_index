			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAGIC NAMED MVP 2ND TIME;  </P> <P> JORDAN EDGED OUT IN CLOSEST VOTE IN 8 YEARS  </P> <P> Magic Johnson of the Lakers won his second NBA Most Valuable Player award  today, edging out Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in the closest voting in  eight years.  </P> <P> Johnson, who won the award two years ago, received 42 1/2 first-place votes and  664.5 points from a panel of 85 writers and broadcasters. Jordan, the  three-time scoring champion and league MVP last season, had 27 1/2 first-place  votes and 598.8 points. Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz was third with five  first-place votes and 362 points.  </P> <P> Each voter selected a top five and points were awarded on a 10-7-5-3-1 basis.  </P> <P> The Lakers point guard averaged 22.5 points, led the league in free-throw  accuracy with a .911 percentage and was second in assists with 12.8 per game.  He posted career highs in 3-point goals (59) and assists (988) and led Los  Angeles to a 57-25 record and an eighth straight Pacific Division championship.  </P> <P> Johnson, a 10-year veteran, had a league-best 17 triple-doubles and decided  three games with buzzer-beating shots.  </P> <P> Jordan averaged 32.5 points, 2/10 of a point below his career regular-season  average.  </P> <P> "Winning, that's what it's all about," Johnson said in a release from the NBA.  "I may not be the greatest, but I'll tell you what: I've got a whole lot more  diamonds (in championship rings) than a lot of guys who play this game and  that's all I'm concerned about.  </P> <P> "That's how I want to be remembered."  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks was fourth with eight first-place votes  and 200 points. Akeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets was fifth with two  first-place votes and 179.3 points.  </P> <P> Nineteen players were named on at least one ballot.  </P> <P> The margin of 65.7 points was the smallest since 1981, when Julius Erving of  the Philadelphia 76ers beat Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics by 31 points.  </P> <P> Johnson finished third in the MVP balloting a year ago behind Jordan and  Boston's Bird.  </P> <P> "Magic is the best player around; I don't think there's any question about  that," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He's a winner. He does whatever is needed  to win."  </P> <P> Since joining the Lakers in 1979, Johnson has helped them win five NBA titles,  including consecutive championships in 1987 and 1988. The Lakers, bidding for  three in a row, now are ahead 1-0 in their Western Conference title round  against the Phoenix Suns.  </P> <P> The Laker guard suffered a partially torn left hamstring Feb. 8 and missed the  All-Star Game.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind that Magic Johnson is the best player in the  game and the best player I've ever seen," said Bird, Johnson's rival going back  to their NCAA championship game in 1979. "He plays the game the way I like to  see people play and the way I like to play. He rebounds, passes, is a leader --  whatever it takes, that's what he does to win basketball games."  </P> <P> Detroit Pistons Coach Chuck Daly praised Johnson as a "coach's dream."  </P> <P> "He can dominate any game from any position he wants to," Daly said.  </P></p>

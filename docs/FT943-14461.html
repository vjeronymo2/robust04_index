			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques stake agreement expires The standstill agreement between Control Techniques and Emerson Electric of the US, which holds 29.37 per cent of the Powys-based electronic drives and controls company, expired yesterday. Under the agreement, struck in 1991, Emerson undertook not to increase its shareholding in Control Techniques. Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman of Control Techniques, said yesterday he was 'not aware of Emerson's intentions.' The US company was unavailable for comment. However, Control Techniques said it was holding talks with Emerson over the US company's 20 per cent stake in CT Drives, the drives systems manufacturer based in Grand Island, New York. Control Techniques acquired 80 per cent of CT Drives from Emerson in 1991. Under the agreement, Control Techniques had the option to increase its stake in CT Drives, payable in cash or shares. Control Techniques said it understood that Emerson did not wish to take up the option to lift its stake, which would trigger a takeover bid for it by the US company. Control Techniques shares closed 9p down at 394p. Pre-tax profits at Control Techniques in the six months to March 31, were Pounds 3.84m after US reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000. In the comparable period profits were Pounds 3.72m after reorganisation costs of Pounds 200,000.</p>

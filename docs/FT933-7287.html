			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Sharp rise in housing association rents HOUSING association rents for new lettings showed rises of more than 10 times the prevailing rate of inflation with an average increase of 20.8 per cent in the year to April. The rise, partly caused by continuing falls in government grants for housing association developments, means that rents have increased by nearly twice the rate of inflation in the past five years. Over the same period the average income of new tenants has fallen behind the rise in the retail prices index, in spite of a 10 per cent real increase in average earnings. The figures, in the National Federation of Housing Associations' quarterly bulletin, are based on returns from associations responsible for about 95 per cent of lettings in England. Associations manage about 650,000 properties in England. The number is rising as local authority housing stocks fall and government funding for social housing is channelled through the associations. The average rent for lettings in the first quarter of this year was Pounds 43.06 - Pounds 50.17 for new lets and Pounds 36.59 for re-lets. The average rent for a new three-bedroom property in London and the south-east was more than Pounds 60 a week. Only in the north and Merseyside were new lettings for three-bedroom homes available for less than an average of Pounds 50 a week. Across England, lettings of new housing association properties on assured tenancies - the most common form of tenure for new lets - exceeded Pounds 50 a week for the first time. Mr Charlie Legg, head of the federation's research division, said: 'The government has been driving up rents by reducing grant rates for developing new homes on the basis that housing associations will take the strain.' For the next financial year (1994-95), the Department of the Environment has set a national average ceiling of 62 per cent for its contribution to new developments. The balance must come mainly from private loans. Two years ago the government funding ceiling was set at more than 70 per cent. It is set to reduce further, to 55 per cent by 1995-96. The federation claimed that by mid-1995 rents would have to rise by a further 28 per cent in real terms to compensate for the reductions. It said: 'There is no sign yet that the rate of increase is levelling out.' The average net weekly income of new housing association tenants was Pounds 102.33 for the first quarter of this year - 5.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. For households with at least one person in work the average was Pounds 169.54 and for those with no working members, Pounds 79.84.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Former Spring Ram chief raises Pounds 6m from sale of shares Mr Bill Rooney, the former chairman of Spring Ram, yesterday raised some Pounds 6m with the sale of almost a quarter of his stake in the kitchen, bathroom and furniture group from which he was ousted last year. The sale comes just two weeks after Mr Rooney, who recently announced a Pounds 6.6m deal to take control of Atreus, the bathroom goods supplier, denied he was actively seeking to sell his shares. However, he is understood this week to have approached Spring Ram's brokers, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, for help in placing them. Mr Rooney had agreed with Spring Ram's management that any sale would be conducted through the brokers to ensure an orderly market. It is understood the shares have been placed with a range of institutions. Mr Rooney and associated family trusts sold 15m shares, representing 3.3 per cent of the company, at a price believed to have been 42p each against last night's close of 43 1/2 p, down  1/2 p. The sale leaves the Rooney family with 46.4m shares, or 10.2 per cent of Spring Ram. The company's largest shareholder is now Prudential, with just over 11 per cent. Mr Rooney was forced off the Spring Ram board by institutional investors 14 months ago following revelations of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary and three profits warnings in eight months. Before this, the group had enjoyed 13 years of rapid growth. See Market Report</p>

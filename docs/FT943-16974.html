			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Observer: Tripe in the knapsack One day it's random shelling by the Serbs, the next it's goat for supper; who'd be a Bosnia-based British squaddie? Among the weighty topics pondered by the House of Commons' defence committee's statement on Britain's 1994 defence estimates, paragraphs 42-45 consider the rations of British forces serving in former Yugoslavia. The British army is apparently under pressure from the United Nations to adopt a (cheaper) UN rationing system. The UN is fed up with paying the Brits 'twice the UN per capita rate'. Mind you, they have funny ideas about these matters at the UN. A UN 'food week' is either six or seven days; 'even-numbered' weeks have six days, 'odd-numbered' seven. On six-day weeks the poor old UN campaigner must eat the rations he carries with him - 'to turn over stocks'. Leaving that little problem aside, there is the question of the UN's menu. Its idea of a square meal is 'faloukorv without garlic', while such delicacies as black pudding, Marmite, steak and kidney pudding, shredded wheat and muesli, are off-limits. This is a 'far from trivial concern' thunders the defence committee, which is counting on ministers to intervene to prevent any deterioration in either quality or quantity of food on British mess tables. So okra-bashing may not replace the spud awhile yet.</p>

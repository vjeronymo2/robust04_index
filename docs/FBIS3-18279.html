			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Christian Brondum report: "Criticism of Spain's EU </F> Demands"]    [Text] Denmark is exerting maximum pressure to make it  possible to reach agreement with Sweden, Norway, Finland, and  Austria on the terms for accession to the EU [European Union].    This happened at the EU Commission's annual EU conference at  Vilvorde Course Center near Copenhagen.    Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic  Party)  and EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen both stressed Spain's  demand for fishing rights off Norway as one of the biggest  problems that must be solved in the current round of marathon  negotiations before the EU's deadline for the negotiations runs  out on Tuesday [1 March].    Henning Christophersen warned that if the EU does not  succeed  in reaching agreement with the four applicants countries, this  will have "far-reaching consequences" for the future of Europe  and for the chances of bringing in Europe's closest neighbors to  the east. And the prime minister was sharply critical of Spain's  demand for Norwegian fish:    "I believe that Spanish interests will not in the final  analysis block a solution. I quite simply consider Spain's  demand for fishing rights up there in the north to be impossible  to achieve. It is possible that Spain itself knows this. I  believe that they will realize this at a certain point," Nyrup  Rasmussen said.    Nyrup Rasmussen thinks that the problems surrounding support  for the three Nordic countries' agricultural production are  minor problems. Their agricultural production amounts to only 1  to 2 percent of the EU's total agricultural production. And  with a little imagination and dynamism there could also be a  solution to the Nordic countries' regional problems in the  northern regions.    "There will be a great deal of drama in the final straight.  But I do not think that this drama will be the final word.    "The Danish Government will put all its efforts into  achieving a reasonable result.    "If things go as I hope, not long after the end of the  century the EU will embrace 20 or more states," Nyrup Rasmussen  added.</p>

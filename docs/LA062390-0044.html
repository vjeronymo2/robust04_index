			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LORRAINE'S 2-HITTER LIFTS CALIFORNIA ALL-STARS, 7-0  </P> <P> Andrew Lorraine of Hart High pitched a two-hit shutout Friday to lead a  California all-star team to its first win in the Sunbelt High School Seniors  All-Star Baseball Classic, a 7-0 victory over Maryland.  </P> <P> California (1-3) supported Lorraine with an 11-hit attack, including a solo  home run by Chris Larson of Orange.  </P> <P> Lorraine struck out 11 and allowed no walks. Maryland's Andrew Sreboski singled  in the first inning, but was picked off by Lorraine. Bill Dunn doubled in the  fourth to become Maryland's only other baserunner in the seven-inning game.  </P> <P> California lost twice Thursday, 9-8 to Georgia and 4-3 to Florida. California  also dropped an 8-6 decision to Ohio on Friday.  </P> <P> Georgia (3-0) is the only undefeated team in the tournament. Ohio is 3-1,  Florida 2-1, Oklahoma 2-2 and Maryland 0-4.  </P> <P> California will play two more games today.  </P> <P> "What a relief it was for us," said the 6-foot-3, 190-pound Lorraine. "We've  been coming up so close. I just knew I had to pull one out."  </P> <P> California's Darvin Traylor of Riverside Poly was three for four with a triple  and two runs batted in. Damon Lumbi of Burlingame had two doubles and one RBI.  </P> <P> "I think we're just as good (as the other teams)," said Lorraine, whose team  will face Oklahoma today. "The pitching doesn't seem to be as strong as ours,  yet they come up with the hits."  </P> <P> Lorraine, bound for Stanford, was 9-0 with six saves and an earned-run average  of 0.91 last season.  </P> <P> The left-handed Lorraine, The Times' Valley Pitcher of the Year, was the only  Valley-area player to be selected for the U.S. Olympic Festival, to be held  from June 30-July 11 in Minneapolis.  </P></p>

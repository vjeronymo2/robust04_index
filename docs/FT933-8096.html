			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / India to ease currency curbs India is planning further liberalisation of currency regulations after successfully floating the rupee early this year, according to bankers, Reuter reports from Bombay. Measures being considered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) include permitting cross-currency options and letting local banks invest in short-term deposits with banks overseas, they said. 'Dismantling of these restrictions could be the first steps towards the full convertibility of the Indian rupee on current account and later on capital account,' a banker said.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (17): ERM gamble pays dividends for funds - Barry Riley discusses investment strategy in the past seven months since Black Wednesday A YEAR ago it seemed that the consensus among British pension fund managers in respect of their investment strategy was threatened by the UK's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Typical exposure to equities had topped 80 per cent of portfolios, with nearly 60 points of that in the UK stock market. It was a strategy well justified by investment experiences in the 1980s but pension funds appeared badly positioned for the 1990s if that meant an ERM-type environment of high exchange rates and low inflation. In those conditions fixed interest securities might do just as well as equities, and be less risky. In the event the UK was forced out of the ERM and the pension funds' gamble paid off. The UK is back in an environment of a fluctuating (and generally declining) currency and inflation which appears to be stuck for the time being at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent on an underlying basis and may, quite a few economists believe, drift up to 5 per cent or more in the medium term if the economic recovery is at all vigorous. Pension fund strategy has not changed at all. Certainly, pension fund portfolio managers do not appear to be taking at all seriously the pledge of the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, to bring underlying inflation down within a range of 1 to 2 1/2 per cent by the end of the present parliament - say, by late 1996. Yet pension funds that shifted their investment strategies in favour of bonds a year ago would not have done at all badly. In the year to the end of April the total return on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index was about 12 per cent, while the corresponding return on long-dated UK government securities was more like 15 per cent. The returns on Japanese, US, German or French government bonds were much higher, expressed in terms of sterling. Conventional wisdom at present is that only equities offer an appropriate match for the liabilities of pension schemes with benefits linked to final salaries, and with at least a degree of inflation-proofing (through limited price indexation of up to 5 per cent, soon to be compulsorily applied to pensions in payment as well as to deferred pensions). The underlying assumption here is that in the long run dividends will grow in line with nominal national income. Until the 1950s, however, the view was quite different. Bonds were safe, and equities were unacceptably risky. This conventional wisdom was overturned because inflation became a persistent problem and once pensions became linked to final salaries the mismatch was apparent. It is important to realise, however, that the change in attitudes in the 1960s was related to a particular problem of negative real interest rates that reached its most acute phase in the 1970s. During that decade the average annual rate of return on gilt-edged was 8.1 per cent while inflation averaged 13 per cent. Once exchange controls on portfolio investment were removed late in 1979, however, the real returns on sterling bonds had to rise to somewhere in line with the positive levels offered by other leading countries. Indeed, in the 1980s the annual return on gilts was 14.7 per cent compared with inflation of just 6.9 per cent. Admittedly equities performed better still during this period. If pension fund trustees can rely on consistently positive real returns on bonds then their strategic dependence on equities can be reduced. After all, there are also risks in equities - for instance, that dividend growth may be very low over the next few years, because payouts have grown too large, and also that tax policies may be further tightened so as to discriminate against dividends, as has already happened in the latest Budget. However, pension scheme trustees and their fund managersoften perceive risk in different terms to the risks of particular investments. They are aware of their own personal and business risks. The low risk position is to do what other similar funds are doing, and if this turns out to be wrong it will be a mistake emulated by many others. In these terms, a risk shared is a risk largely evaded. But for the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries, of course, the risk is not reduced at all. The question therefore is how shifts in strategy can be achieved in a smooth and orderly way, rather than in response to some investment disaster which would make change an imperative. The best solution is probably presented by the growing maturity of many pension schemes - that is, they have fewer young contributing members and more and more older and retired members. This opens the possibility of a natural shift to a less risky and shorter-term investment strategy, matching the change in the liability profile. However, the actuarial science of asset-liability modelling is still flawed, and views on the appropriateness of matching investments is subject to fashions and distortions. For trustees it is a challenging time. They are justifiably more comfortable with the league table approach to performance measurement, in which the comparison is with comparable peer funds, than with individual benchmarks which may seem of limited relevance, and may make comparisons difficult. The underlying fear is that the actuaries and fund managers will hide their poor performance behind a smokescreen of mumbo jumbo which amateur trustees cannot penetrate. The story is told of the trustees who were discussing with their fund manager a change to an index-related benchmark rather than a median fund-related target. The investment manager wished to make his position quite clear. 'We are quite happy to accept the change, but it will, of course, mean that you will no longer be able to compare us with the median fund,' he declared. From somewhere at the far end of the room the low voice of one of the trustees could clearly be heard. 'You see,' he muttered to his neighbour, 't'buggers are making excuses already.'</p>

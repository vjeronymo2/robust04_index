			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Subtle style is back in fashion - Lanvin plans a comeback in the luxury goods market, despite the recession For months two of the swankiest stores on the very swanky rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore in Paris have been hidden behind bright blue screens as teams of builders have beavered inside. On Sunday the screens will be whisked away for a lavish launch party to celebrate the reopening of Lanvin's men's and women's wear stores. The reopening is the first phase of the multi-million pound relaunch of Lanvin as a leading player in the global luxury goods market. The timing is scarcely propitious. The industry, already suffering from the US recession and Europe's economic slowdown, now faces the additional problems of Japan's instability and this autumn's currency crisis. Michel Pietrini, who joined Lanvin as chairman two years ago from Chanel, one of the most successful French fashion houses, purports to be unperturbed. 'The market is certainly not easy at the moment, but we're here for the long term,' he says. 'There are still opportunities for companies to do well, providing they have the right strategy.' Lanvin, Pietrini hopes, has defined a strategy which will become a role model for luxury groups in the 1990s, just as Chanel did in the 1980s. The story starts two years ago when Lanvin was bought by L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics company, and Orcofi, a consortium representing the family interests of Henry Racamier, who had just lost a bitter battle against Bernard Arnault for control of the LVMH luxury goods group. Lanvin was then at the nadir of its fortunes. It had flourished in the 1910s and 1920s under Jeanne Lanvin, its founder, but had floundered after her death. By the late 1980s, when other Paris fashion houses, notably Chanel and Hermes, were thriving, Lanvin was struggling. It was bought by Britain's Midland Bank which sold off assets and drafted in Claude Montana, one of the most inventive Paris designers, to revive its exclusive haute couture collections. But the luxury market proved more complex and costly than Midland had expected. It sold Lanvin in 1990 to L'Oreal and Orcofi, each with 50 per cent stakes, for more than FFr400m (Pounds 46.9m). Orcofi saw the Lanvin deal as a chance to add one of the oldest names in French fashion to its portfolio of luxury products. It also offered an opportunity for Racamier to strike back against his old foe, Bernard Arnault, whose fashion interests include Christian Dior and Christian Lacroix. L'Oreal was more interested in Arpege, the perfume created by Jeanne Lanvin in 1927, which, despite decades of neglect, is still one of the handful of classic French fragrances. L'Oreal, already a leading player in perfume, hopes to restore Arpege to the same status as the successful classics, Chanel No5 and Guerlain's Shalimar, both of which generate sales of about Pounds 50m a year and huge profits. But before Arpege can be relaunched, L'Oreal and Orcofi need to re-establish Lanvin on the Paris fashion scene. In recent years the management and marketing of luxury products has been dominated by the strategy devised for Chanel in the early 1980s by Alain Wertheimer, its reclusive owner, and Michel Pietrini. The Chanel formula is to use the fashion collections as a flagship for the scents, cosmetics and accessories bearing the company's name. The collections, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, the prolific German designer, need not necessarily make money - their role is to create the correct aura of chic for Chanel's other products. Chanel's strategy has been so successful that many of the other European luxury houses - including Gucci, Pucci and Ferragamo of Italy  - have copied it. Midland hired Montana in the hope that he would create the same frisson for Lanvin as Lagerfeld had at Chanel. Dunhill, the British luxury group, went one step further in the imitation stakes this summer by bringing Lagerfeld back as chief designer of Chloe, though he still works for Chanel. Pietrini is convinced that a new strategy is needed for the 1990s. 'The days of ostentatious fashion are over,' he says. 'People no longer buy things just to show off. They want quality and service.' He sees Lanvin's fashion activities as a self-standing business, not a shop window for the brand name. Whereas Chanel and Hermes aim their fashion only at the very top of the market - a Chanel suit costs from Pounds 1,200 and an Hermes Kelly bag at least Pounds 1,000 - Lanvin is directed at a broader spectrum. The men's shop stretches across seven floors from sports wear in the basement to made-to-measure shoes on the top floor. It sells off-the-peg suits from FFr4,000 and bespoke suits from FFr24,000. There is a special lift so the made-to-measure customers can avoid hoi polloi on the lower floors. The style of the stores is subdued. An Anglo-French design team under Sir Terence Conran has decked them out in blues and browns with Art Deco details. The refined effect is strikingly different from the opulent marble of the Gianni Versace shop across the street, or the glossy monochrome of Chanel around the corner. Lanvin has chosen the same subtle style for its fashion collections. Montana was dropped as the couture designer and Dominique Morlotti hired from Dior to design men's and women's ready-to-wear. After Sunday's opening, Lanvin will accelerate its new strategy. Its new ranges will be introduced to its 50 sales outlets in the Far East this autumn. Arpege will be relaunched in Europe next spring and in North America in 1994, when the company also plans to reintroduce its fashion collections to the US. Lanvin will not comment on the cost of the relaunch, which has presumably been colossal, not least because it had to close its men's store for almost a year and the women's store for six months. All Pietrini will say is that the losses to date - L'Oreal disclosed a FFr60m loss on its 50 per cent share of Lanvin in its 1991 accounts - are in line with expectations. Pietrini is convinced that the new Lanvin is a formula for success in the luxury goods market of the 1990s, just as Chanel was in the 1980s. But Chanel staged its revival at a time when the economic environment was favourable to the luxury trade. A decade later, Lanvin is being relaunched into a much more competitive climate. The fate of the new Lanvin will depend as much on the fluctuations of Japanese share prices and on whether American tourists are prepared to pay more for their weekends in Paris, as on Pietrini's new strategy.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST CHARGES FILED TO TEST STRICT GUAM ABORTION LAW  </P> <P> Guam's attorney general, seeking a constitutional test of the U.S. territory's  day-old anti-abortion law, on Tuesday filed a complaint against a New York  woman who had disseminated information here about terminating pregnancies.  </P> <P> Guam's law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on Monday, is the most restrictive  abortion legislation in the United States and has riveted national attention on  this tiny South Pacific island.  </P> <P> The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion even in cases of rape, incest  and fetal abnormality. An abortion is allowed only if two independent doctors  determine a pregnancy would endanger the life of a mother or gravely impair her  health.  </P> <P> It also makes it a misdemeanor to have an abortion or "knowingly solicit"  pregnant women to have one.  </P> <P> In the complaint filed in Superior Court here, Atty. Gen. Elizabeth  Barrett-Anderson said that Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Rights  Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, violated the law when she  encouraged pregnant women seeking abortions to leave Guam for Honolulu.  </P> <P> Barrett-Anderson had previously advised both the governor and the Guam  Legislature that the abortion law was unconstitutional and said Tuesday that  her action was designed to force a constitutional test.  </P> <P> "My decision to bring a criminal charge under the new law will provide the  basis for the courts to decide the question as quickly as possible. I believe  this will be in the best interests of the government and of all persons  affected by the new law," Barrett-Anderson said.  </P> <P> Voters in Guam have an opportunity to repeal the legislation in a referendum  scheduled in November. The law was passed by the territorial Legislature after  the archbishop of Guam had threatened to excommunicate those who opposed the  measure, although most of the legislators said they were unaware of the threat.  More than 90% of the population on the island is Roman Catholic.  </P> <P> In signing the legislation on Monday, Gov. Ada had insisted the law was a local  issue. "I am not taking this action today to affect anyone's life in the 50  states. I believe that this is a community issue and a community concern, first  and foremost."  </P> <P> But abortion foes and abortion rights supporters have seized upon the law as a  possible test of the Supreme Court's willingness to temper or undo its historic  Roe vs. Wade decision, which guaranteed women a right to an abortion.  </P> <P> Idaho and Maryland are currently studying abortion legislation, but the Guam  law caught activists by surprise. Benshoof arrived in Guam over the weekend  proclaiming that the new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade and likened  the bill to a "Pearl Harbor for women."  </P> <P> On Tuesday she acknowledged that she was breaking the law in providing the  name, address and phone number of a Honolulu group that could help women get an  abortion. The attorney general's complaint was filed Tuesday afternoon.  Benshoof's arraignment was set for today.  </P></p>

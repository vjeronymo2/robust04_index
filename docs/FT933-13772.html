			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / LWT criticised on brands' exposure THE Independent Television Commission yesterday criticised London Weekend Television for 'serious errors' in giving undue prominence to commercial products. The commission said that successive programmes in the popular Cilla Black series Surprise Surprise gave undue prominence to company names or products such as Delta Airlines, EverReady and Mothercare. It also decided that the promotion of the restaurant Planet Hollywood on Aspel and Company went beyond acceptable 'plugging'. This occurred when its owners, the actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, appeared on the show. LWT has accepted that editorial mistakes were made and is appointing a compliance officer to ensure the rules are observed. The commission also issued a general warning about ITV companies giving branded products undue prominence.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): The high price of shelf-edge labelling The easiest way for supermarkets to alter the price of goods is to use shelf-edge labelling, in which a liquid crystal panel, fixed next to the appropriate goods, displays the price electronically. Now a Swedish company, Pricer, of Uppsala, has developed a shelf-edge labelling system powered by in-store lighting, eliminating cables, which are difficult and expensive to install, and batteries. To alter the price of an item the store's computer sends the new information to a ceiling-mounted infra-red transmitter which sends the data to the light-powered labels. The computer simultaneously sends the new prices to the check-out system. Each shelf label has built-in memory retention to ensure it does not lose data at night. Pricer: Sweden, 18 18 81 00.</p>

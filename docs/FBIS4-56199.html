			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de Las </F> Casas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] The National Action Party's [PAN] presidential  campaign tour through Chiapas today could be described as a  three-part operation. The first part was a meeting between  presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and San  Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz. It was funny because those of us  trying to follow him found this rather difficult. By driving a  little fast, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos managed to avoid the  reporters' pursuit. We later learned what he discussed with the  bishop during the meeting. His main question about the peace  process was why we have someone who has no relation with Chiapas  on one side and someone whose identity is unknown on the other  negotiating peace and reconciliation in Chiapas? Diego  Fernandez de Cevallos called on the political parties to  participate in the process because it is urgent and necessary  for them to be a part of the talks.    After midday, he moved on to the community of Navenchauc and  met with PAN members, who voiced their woes and petitions. They  complained that they were not allowed to go to a specific  temple, just for being PAN members. The people say they are not  allowed to build any community projects. The municipal  presidents of San Juan Chamula and Xinacatan, primarily, will  not grant them any loans or provide the resources they need  because they are not members of the Institutional Revolutionary  Party. They also say they are barred from the community  decisionmaking process. They believe they are worth nothing.  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said something that caught many  people's attention: I am not God, nor do I have the gift of  magic, but I hereby promise to talk with you and settle these  differences, especially with your authorities.    Without a doubt, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos' main event of  the day was to take place in San Cristobal de Las Casas. And  that it was, because it has already concluded. He gave what he  called his famous San Cristobal de Las Casas Proclamation of  April 1994. These are the six main points of his proclamation,  which was broadcast live by a local radio station here in  Chiapas and beamed nationwide, via satellite. These are his  words:    [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] Ladies and  gentlemen: I deeply thank you for being here, and I thank Radio  640 for the opportunity to broadcast this message to the people  of Chiapas. It is also being broadcast to the whole nation via  satellite. This is a manifesto to the people of Mexico from the  PAN.    1. The PAN hereby and definitively reaffirms today, as it  always has, its humanistic, pacifist, and democratic proposal.  We therefore call upon all Mexicans of good faith to join a  grand national effort directed at giving the nation a truly  democratic government, a government that will promote unyielding  respect for human rights, encourage the community to produce for  the benefit of the people, contribute to improving our judicial  system, and guarantee the full implementation of the state of  law.    2. We strive for a profound change in the way the government  exercises its power, so that power will always and without  excuse be subjected to just laws for the benefit of the people.    3. We reject the current economic model, because it has  concentrated wealth in a disgusting way and has impoverished 40  million Mexicans. We demand and propose an economic system that  will serve all human beings, always be subjected to ethical  standards, and generate equal opportunity for all in the  generation and distribution of national wealth.    4. We intend to seriously and extensively promote the states  of the Federation and all of the country's municipalities, by  way of a true political, economic, and social federalist system.  Presidential centralism is the source of all the evil and  injustice that oppress and degrade the nation's life. It denies  the sovereign rights of the states of the Federation; it  subordinates the country's municipalities by way of a rampant  and often murderous autocracy.    5. We call for an educational program, in which the  government and the community must work together. We must  encourage the overall development of all human beings, but with  respect for their dignity. This we must attain while  strengthening the cultural, ethnic, religious, and ideological  plurality that characterizes Mexico.    6. The PAN, in keeping with its history of democratic  civic spirit, strongly says no to violence. It supports an  honest, respectful, and sincere dialogue in favor of justice and  peace. We reiterate the need to achieve the maximum  participation of Mexican society and its institutions in a  dialogue based on truth that can lead us to a national  understanding. We emphasize the importance for peace of a  dialogue between the government and the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN]. We categorically support the dialogue  and we hope honorable agreements result from it. We refuse,  however, to even believe that representatives of the president  of the republic and of the EZLN can define and compromise the  life and institutions of Chiapas and of Mexico.    In our opinion, ladies and gentlemen, from this dialogue we  must expect a civilized agreement between the government and the  EZLN to legally promote without delay the duties aimed at  resolving the conflict. We believe the argument that hunger and  injustice generate violence. We insist that peace cannot be  attained if justice is not achieved first. True peace is based  on reason. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message of the PAN  in San Cristobal de Las Casas on 25 April 1994.    [Signed] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate to the  presidency of the republic.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Spoonful of sugar for drugs sector: Paul Abrahams explains why a 2.5% price cut is letting the industry off lightly DRUGS GROUPS are becoming accustomed to receiving bad news about prices. Cuts in Germany and Italy this year have brought the European market, which expanded last year by 10 per cent, to a sudden halt. Yesterday it was the turn of the UK to announce a 2.5 per cent cut, which will add to the industry's woes. But the impact of the measures, for most groups, is unlikely to be significant. Britain has a small market in pharmaceuticals, worth Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3.28bn) last year, less than either Italy or Spain. The French and German markets were each worth Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to IMS International, the market research company. Few companies are heavily exposed to the UK market. Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs company, generates 10 per cent of its sales in Britain. Zeneca's UK turnover represents 7 per cent of sales. At Wellcome it is 6.5 per cent and at SmithKline Beecham it is about 5 per cent. For non-UK groups, the significance of the British market is even less. Merck, the world's biggest group, generates only 0.5 per cent of its drugs sales in the UK, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US's second-biggest group, only 0.2 per cent. The UK market is not only small, but the price cut is far less than had been feared. 'We had been expecting something far more draconian. There had been talk of cuts of up to 6 per cent,' said Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Morgan Stanley. The cut is certainly far less dramatic than that in Germany, where a package that included a 5 per cent reduction in prices sent the market into sharp reverse, dropping 11 per cent during the first five months this year. In Italy, health reforms introduced in April led to a decline of 1.8 per cent over the same period. Industry concerns that there would be a cut in the maximum return on capital governed by the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme have proved unfounded. The scheme controls drugs groups' profitability. The limit is being kept to between 17 per cent and 21 per cent. So why does Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, appear to have let the industry off so lightly? After all, the UK government is facing the same problems of rapidly rising healthcare bills as those elsewhere. Around the globe, health spending is spinning out of control as populations age and technology becomes more advanced and expensive. Although it represents only about 10 per cent of NHS spending, the drugs budget is increasing rapidly. NHS drug purchases rose by 14 per cent last year, far more than the rate of inflation. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry is quick to point out that prices contributed nothing to that growth. One reason for Mrs Bottomley's apparent generosity is that she may be concerned about the impact of reforms on the health of the drugs industry. It is one of the UK's few technological success stories and creates significant revenues for the UK, even generating a trade surplus with Japan. The problem faced by the government is to balance the need to save money on drugs with the requirement to provide adequate treatment for patients while protecting an important strategic industry. However, more likely is that Mrs Bottomley has other, more flexible, ways of controlling drugs spending. British doctors are already intensely conservative prescribers of medicines. Each year British doctors sign 7.6 prescriptions a head compared with French doctors who fill in 38 and Italian doctors who sign 20. The Department of Health is encouraging such parsimony by introducing indicative budgets for general practitioners. Mrs Bottomley's department is also negotiating with the industry over the introduction of blacklists of products for which the NHS will no longer pay. These involve 10 therapeutic categories, including oral contraceptives and skin treatments. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American group, this week announced it was cutting the price of a sleeping pill called Zimavane by 82 per cent in an effort to keep off the blacklist, and warned that other companies would have to follow its example. Mr Klaus Behrendt, director of pharmaceuticals at Bayer's UK operations, is warning that the blacklists could be extended to all medicines. The industry has won one drugs price battle, but it is unlikely to win the war.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG SALES 1992 (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company           Total         Germany         Italy         UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bayer             3,800             500           350        200 Ciba              4,693             336           243        212 Fisons              736              75            58         51 Glaxo             7,786             407           605        774 Hoechst           6,095             650           552        130 Marion MD         3,233             156           133         60 Merck             8,215             238           551        175 Pfizer            4,557             100           267         80 Roche             4,180             256           354         93 RPR               3,400             220           230        230 SKB               5,057             174           400        250 Wellcome          2,608             153           176        172 Zeneca            2,844             175           160        210  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Lehman Brothers estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

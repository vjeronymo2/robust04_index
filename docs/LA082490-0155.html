			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM REOPENS AFTER WATER LEAK  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum closed Tuesday after officials discovered 18 inches of  water from an underground spring in an elevator shaft and strong fumes that  reportedly smelled like gas.  </P> <P> No damage was reported, however, and the Fire Department, though still  monitoring the situation, was not concerned about fire or other hazards.  </P> <P> The museum reopened Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I am about 90% sure it's not a problem, and today (Thursday) I authorized them  to go ahead and run the elevators," Laguna Beach Fire Department Battalion  Chief Joe McClure said Thursday.  </P> <P> McClure said the leak probably stemmed from the failure of a worn, 5-year-old  sump pump, designed to continually drain the elevator shaft area below the  three-level museum's basement floor.  </P> <P> The flooding probably caused a container of elevator hydraulic fluid to spill,  causing the noisome fumes, said McClure, who intended to check the site again  today.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos  Lage today received Christine Stewart, Canadian minister of  state for Latin America, who also met with other prominent Cuban  officials and held talks termed positive.    Ricardo Alarcon, Ernesto Melendez, and Jose Luis Rodriguez,  foreign investment, cooperation, and finance ministers  respectively, also received Stewart during the first day of her  two-day working visit to Cuba, which has a full agenda. An  official from the Canadian Embassy in Havana said these were  constructive and "very smooth" talks.    As she arrived in the Cuban capital last night, the  official,  also in charge of African affairs in Prime Minister Jean  Chretien's liberal administration, pointed out one the  objectives of her trip was to broaden bilateral ties. She also  underscored that common programs could stem from these  conversations.    Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said the  Canadian Government today ended the 16-year suspension of  official economic aid to Cuba, convinced that "now is the time  to turn the page" on Cuba.    This aid was canceled on 1978 due to the Cuban military aid  offered to Angola in view of the South African aggression. This  decision, however, did not hinder bilateral relations,  especially commercial and tourist relations, which thrived  without difficulties.    According to Ottawa government sources, Canada will grant  Cuba over $1 million worth of foodstuffs, mainly for children,  between 1994 and 1995. Stewart is expected to make a public  announcement regarding this aid tomorrow morning in Havana.</p>

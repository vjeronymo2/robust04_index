			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Japan looks for action on economy PROGRESS BY Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party towards agreeing the size and shape of this month's supplementary budget, and expectations that the package would exceed last August's Y10,700bn plan, underpinned the strong performance by Japanese equities last week. The stock market news from Tokyo had its ups and downs. After a strong start, aggressive profit-taking as the yen appreciated against the dollar followed during the Tuesday and Wednesday sessions. However, by Thursday, the market was moving sharply ahead as investors concentrated once again on government plans to stimulate the economy: Friday's trading volume, at 1.5bn shares, had risen to levels not seen for more than three years. Among analysts bullish about the outlook for Japan, Mr Nicholas Knight at Nomura in London sees an imminent rise in the Nikkei index above 20,000. That could be just the cue that foreign investors, currently underweight in Japan, might take to buy, ready for a ride on the Nikkei to a minimum of 23,000 by June and 28,000 later in the year. 'To talk about selling a market that could still go up a further 50 per cent this year clearly sounds crazy, but then so would the market be at those levels,' Mr Knight states in the latest Nomura global strategy note. 'This does not mean that it will not get there, but we do not want to be in it when it does.' he says. Overall, the World Index moved modestly ahead, with Europe flat, North America turning easier but the overall strength coming from the Pacific Basin. Among the Europeans, Scandinavia continued to turn in strong performances but Austria was a weak spot with interest in shares poor and volumes low. Italy, also weak, found itself with a government in limbo, awaiting the country's electoral reform referendum on April 18.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change     % change in                 % change in local currency**    sterling**  US Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of   Start of      Start of                                         1993       1993          1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.73   -8.31  -18.72     +0.36      +1.29         +1.53 Belgium      +1.33   +4.85   +8.59    +14.68     +15.11        +15.37 Denmark      +3.86   -0.78  -12.36     +9.59     +11.10        +11.36 Finland      +4.47   +2.11  +37.51    +26.84     +14.41        +14.68 France       -1.20   +0.55   +3.18     +9.33     +10.53        +10.78 Germany      -0.03   -1.55   -5.96     +8.58      +9.32         +9.57 Ireland      +0.18  +10.43  +11.38    +24.81     +16.36        +16.62 Italy        -2.72  -11.83   -0.30     +9.41      +0.87         +1.11 Netherlands  +0.45   +0.96   +9.73    +10.92     +11.58        +11.84 Norway       -2.98   +6.16   -4.41    +10.43     +11.59        +11.84 Spain        -0.39   -0.95   -4.59    +11.56     +10.92        +11.17 Sweden       +1.54   -2.74  +12.22     +6.12      -1.28         -1.05 Switzerland  +1.37   +2.67  +18.57     +6.40      +4.72         +4.96 UK           +0.50   -1.66  +20.58     +1.75      +1.75         +1.98 EUROPE       +0.17   -1.06   +9.68     +6.13      +5.59         +5.84 Australia    +0.24   +3.94   +5.43     +8.25      +9.81        +10.06 Hong Kong    +0.80   -2.26  +24.97    +15.49     +15.37        +15.63 Japan        +6.92  +20.54  +17.79    +16.77     +27.43        +27.72 Malaysia     +2.65   +1.64  +21.98     +8.13      +8.92         +9.17 New Zealand  -0.69   +0.46   +9.52     +3.59      +6.81         +7.04 Singapore    +2.41   +0.95  +11.22     +5.70      +5.52         +5.77 Canada       -0.39   +1.25   +1.08     +5.10      +5.73         +5.98 USA          -1.47   -1.06  +10.23     +1.18      +0.95         +1.18 Mexico       +0.96   +8.24   -3.51     -1.61      -0.98         -0.75 South Africa +0.85   +7.40   +0.33    +11.78     +19.40        +19.66 WORLD INDEX  +1.43   +4.68  +11.80     +7.11      +9.43         +9.68  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on April 2nd, 1993.

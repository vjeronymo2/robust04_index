			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SOVIETS VISIT TRW LAB FOR PRECEDENT-SETTING BRIEFING ON SDI WORK;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE U.S. HOPES THE TOUR FURTHERS ITS PROPOSAL FOR REGULAR LAB VISITS  BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS AS PART OF A 'STAR WARS' TREATY.  </P> <P> A 10-member delegation of Soviet scientists and arms negotiators broke new  ground in East-West relations on Saturday by touring a vital component of the  United States' "Star Wars" research.  </P> <P> The Soviets' visit to the 2,770-acre TRW Inc. laser testing facility, nestled  in the grassy hill country one mile north of San Clemente, capped months of  planning between Soviet and American arms reduction negotiators.  </P> <P> "The Soviet delegation was very pleased and interested in the tour," said a  senior Bush Administration official who attended the precedent-setting visit to  a U.S. laboratory conducting sensitive research on the controversial Strategic  Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> He added that the visit "went a long way to demonstrating the value" of a new  atmosphere of scientific cooperation that is being proposed in ongoing arms  reduction talks in Geneva.  </P> <P> The official, who asked not to be identified, was referring to a United States  proposal that was put on the table in Geneva about two weeks ago. The proposed  Defense in Space Treaty would set up ground rules for the development of  space-based defense systems.  </P> <P> One of the elements of the proposal is reciprocal laboratory visits. U.S.  officials believe that the visit will set the stage for annual data exchanges  between the two superpowers, and will convince the Soviets of the value of  regular laboratory visits.  </P> <P> First announced in September, Saturday's tour and inspection of the "Alpha"  chemical laser system was billed as an extension of the Geneva strategic arms  reduction talks, said Marine Lt. Col. Alan R. Freitag.  </P> <P> Other than holding an impromptu press conference when the Soviets arrived  Friday at the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro, organizers of the tour  maintained strict control over information about the tour. Neither the news  media nor local officials were allowed to accompany the group on the tour  Saturday.  </P> <P> Officials have even declined to say where the visitors spent the night on  Friday, or whether they returned to the Marine base after the tour of the  plant, located in unincorporated land at the end of Avenida Pico.  </P> <P> The TRW facility is home to the Alpha laser, a component of SDI's Zenith Star  program, company officials said. Under the Zenith Star program, American  researchers are hoping to develop a satellite-based laser that would detonate  nuclear warheads in mid-trajectory.  </P> <P> From the laser testing facility, the Soviet group was expected to move on to  tour the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, another center where SDI  research is being conducted.  </P> <P> At Los Alamos, the Soviets will examine the BEAR, or Beam Experiment Aboard  Rocket, a project that is developing rocket-mounted devices that would generate  powerful beams of atomic particles. The particle beams would be able to either  identify or destroy incoming missiles.  </P> <P> Whisked into South County without any fanfare, the Soviets were led by  Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to the strategic arms  and space defense talks in Geneva. They were briefed by American scientists,  company executives and military personnel, said Julie Wright, director of  public affairs for TRW Inc.  </P> <P> "It was a very good exchange," Wright said about the all-morning meeting. After  lunch, she said, the 30-member contingent of scientists, government  representatives and military personnel boarded a bus and drove for five minutes  to the laser testing site that is built on a corner of the sprawling facility.  </P> <P> Once there, the group examined parts of the Alpha laser testing equipment for  about three hours, she said. Dressed in sterile "bunny suits," the Soviets  climbed inside a 50-foot-tall vacuum chamber that houses the hydrogen fluoride,  high-power laser, Wright said. The vacuum chamber simulates a space  environment.  </P> <P> The group then returned to the center's main building for a "wrap-up," and left  the site at 4:15 p.m., Wright said.  </P> <P> The Soviets were allowed to examine segments of the laser system that is still  in early stages of development, Wright said, but were not allowed to see the  apparatus at work.  </P> <P> It marked the first time Soviet officials have been privy to any part of  America's controversial Strategic Defense Initiative project, proposed by  President Reagan as a shield against nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The $250-million Alpha device, under research for more than a decade, has long  been described as the Pentagon's most promising technology for a small,  lightweight laser that could be built with enough power to operate as a weapon  in space.  </P></p>

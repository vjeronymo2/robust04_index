			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COPENHAGEN BATTLES BICYCLE THEFTS BY OFFERING 5,000 BIKES FOR FREE USE AROUND  CITY  </P> <P> Officials in the Danish capital believe they have found a way to stop bicycle  thefts -- let people use them for free.  </P> <P> Starting in May, 5,000 bicycles carrying advertising from sponsors will be  placed in 900 bike racks throughout Copenhagen.  </P> <P> They'll be available for use by anyone who needs them, tourists, shoppers,  businessmen late for an appointment or commuters who have missed the bus.  </P> <P> "You take a bike, drive around as long as you want it and put it back in a  special-built rack. No charge," explained Ole Wessung, a 30-year-old  chiropractor and an originator of the Bycykel (City Bike) project.  </P> <P> "I had enough of getting my bicycles stolen. Five of them have disappeared  within three months," he said.  </P> <P> According to police, 101,288 bicycles were reported stolen in 1989 in Denmark,  a loss of $1.74 million.  </P> <P> Wessung and publisher Morten Sadolin, 30, spent two years developing the  project, and hope to make money by selling the advertising space on the  bicycles.  </P> <P> The Copenhagen City Council -- interested in reducing air pollution, traffic  congestion and bike thefts -- has given permission for placement of the bicycle  racks on almost every other street corner.  </P> <P> A similar plan was proposed for Amsterdam in the 1970s but never caught on in  the Dutch city. However, a similar free-bike plan is operating successfully at  the Hoge Veluwe national park in the Netherlands. In the closed-off area,  visitors can pick up a bike for free and drop it off anywhere else on the  grounds.  </P> <P> Eight companies have put up the first $1.7 million to get the Copenhagen  project going.  </P> <P> "They sign a three-year contract and during that period bicycles with their  brands and colors will be seen in the streets," said Wessung.  </P> <P> The clumsy-looking bicycles have big, flat central tubes where sponsors'  advertisements will be placed. But the ungraceful appearance also has another  purpose.  </P> <P> "They are easily recognizable and were designed so no one would steal them,"  said Wessung. "Everyone can see it's a Bycykel. If you are spotted 200  kilometers (125 miles) away from Copenhagen, you're either a good rider or a  thief."  </P> <P> Would-be thieves are discouraged from stealing the bike for refitting because  standard saddles, wheels and other parts do not fit the Bycykel, which means  "city bike" in Danish.  </P> <P> Wessung said the bikes are easily maneuverable, but are not multispeed.  </P> <P> They can be obtained in the way travelers get luggage carts at international  airports.  </P> <P> Users insert a coin worth $3.50 in a slot on the bike, and are then able to  unlock it from the stand. A coin of the same value is returned when the bike is  relocked into another rack.  </P> <P> Wessung and Sadolin plan to test their Bycykel next year in Paris and Rome,  where authorities are trying to discourage use of cars in the city centers.  </P> <P> "We hope businessmen, tourists and everyone will borrow our bicycles to get  around in Copenhagen. People are screaming about pollution and the Copenhagen  municipality wants a car-free city," Wessung said.  </P></p>

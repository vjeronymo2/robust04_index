			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- China expects to set up  a framework for a new science and technology system that will  meet the requirements of a market economy drive at the turn of  this century.    This goal has been set out in a document jointly issued by  the State Science and Technology Commission and the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy.    China will first introduce a set of personnel, employment,  medicare and old-age social security systems in high-tech  development zones, pioneer cities singled out to experiment with  new economic and scientific and technological reform measures,  as well as in regions that have a large number of scientists and  technicians.    A public housing fund for the benefit of young scientists  and  technicians will be initiated in scientifically and  technologically- advanced areas so as to tackle worsening  housing shortages.    According to the document, the central government will  increase scientific and technological input in central and  western China in a bid to narrow the widening economic gaps  between those regions and the coastal areas.    China will also reinforce the scientific and technological  muscle of small and medium-sized enterprises, rural and township  undertakings and poverty-stricken rural areas, the document  stressed.    It said that the central government is encouraging  scientific  research institutions to become technology-intensive modern  enterprises. Well-positioned high-tech enterprises will be  allowed to issue and list stocks in and outside the country,  with shares in the form of technology allowed to account for as  much as 30 percent of the total registered capital.    Meanwhile, foreign trade enterprises and scientific and  technological bodies will be given the green light to organize  multi-functional international commercial firms and foreign  trade enterprise groups, according to the document.    It notes that China encourages scientific and technological  departments to increase overseas capital and set up equity and  cooperative ventures, scientific and technological businesses,  as well as development funds for other industries.    According to the document, another development priority will  be given to non-governmental scientific and technological  undertakings. The government will choose some non-governmental  high-tech enterprises to raise funds and invest abroad so as to  help translate them into transnational companies.    To promote international cooperation, China will allow  research institutes, institutions of higher education and  enterprises with foreign trade rights to invest, run branches  and engage in other activities abroad, such as research and  development, production and marketing.    They are also allowed to jointly set up research institutes  and laboratories with foreign partners.    At the same time, the document said, China allows and  encourages overseas enterprises, organizations and individuals  to set up technology-intensive enterprises and solely or jointly  run, with their Chinese counterparts, research institutes, labs,  experimental centres and other development projects.    Starting from this year, China will set up a new national  award for research achievements in the agricultural sector.    China will also raise the salary standards for scientists  and  technicians to an internationally comparable level by the end of  this century, without ceiling.    To make the bold reform measures a success, China will raise  the national scientific and technological development and  research fund to above 1.5 percent of the gross national product  by the year 2000.    Meanwhile, China will promulgate a complete set of laws and  regulations to guide the country's scientific and technological  development.</p>

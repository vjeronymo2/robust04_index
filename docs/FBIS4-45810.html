			<p>Decision   <F P=102>   PM0306134494 Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 1 Jun 94  p13 </F>  <F P=103> PM0306134494 </F> <F P=104>  Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET </F> <F P=105>  Swedish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Oresund Bridge Causes War of </F> Words"]    [Excerpt] A new war of words has broken out between the  Swedish and Danish prime ministers -- this time over the Oresund  bridge.    "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is making dealing with the issue more  difficult. It will not be decided by diktat from Denmark," Carl  Bildt said when he received reports of his Danish counterpart's  remarks at the annual national conference of the Federation of  Swedish Farmers in Karlstad yesterday.    After a Danish cabinet meeting yesterday morning Nyrup  Rasmussen had spoken of "the delay which has already affected  the project" and urged the Swedish Government to reach a swift  decision:    "I would ideally like to avoid an expression like `weeks,'  he  said, wanting to talk more in terms of days if not hours now  that SMHI [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]  and its Danish counterpart, DHI [Danish Hydraulic Institute],  had in their calculations confirmed a zero solution for water  throughflow.    "To be frank I am surprised that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is  holding press conferences about what is Sweden's business,  before the Swedish Government has even been able to read the  relevant material," Bildt said adding, in a travesty of  "something rotten in the state of Denmark," that there is  "something strange going on in Denmark." (A comment on a  statement from Nyrup Rasmussen about changes in the planned  construction of the bridge.)    Yesterday afternoon neither the Swedish Environment Ministry  nor the Prime Minister's Office had received the documentation  which the Oresund Bridge Consortium had posted in Malmo on  Monday.    Carl Bildt and [Environment Minister] Olof Johansson are  agreed in one respect about handling the issue in the future.  It will be treated as an administrative matter -- hence the  irritation with the Danes' stressing Sweden's political will to  arrive at a swift decision.    The Swedish Environment Ministry's strategy is to be  pedantic  and correct.    "We do not want a complaint to the Supreme Administrative  Court," said one of Olof Johansson's experts, who is "almost  certain" that the professional fishermen in the area will appeal  if the examination of the environmental effects of the bridge is  not carried out to the letter.    Olof Johansson himself said that he will not allow himself  to  be rushed and that the bridge issue is such that it ought to be  decided in an election.    There is, however, a sensitive point in the Swedish  Government's future handling of the bridge question. According  to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, the Environment  Ministry is going to want to send the new calculations of  south-flowing water currents in the Baltic Sea back to the Water  Rights Court. Reference is made here to the press statement of  13 January which states that the court's ruling will be of  decisive importance when the government comes to reach a  decision on the issue.    Carl Bildt on the other hand has said that he finds it  "difficult to see" why the issue must be brought before the  Water Rights Court again. [passage omitted]</p>

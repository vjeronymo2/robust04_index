			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The head of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] said Monday [20 June]  the second largest opposition party will join forces with the  main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form a stopgap  government in the event the SDP's coalition talks with the  present minority government break down.    Tomiichi Murayama made the comment at a meeting of former  SDP  lawmakers at a time when the fragile coalition led by Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata is preparing to hold talks with the SDP to  lure it back into the fold.    The SDP chairman told the meeting the proposed alliance with  the LDP would be temporary, limited to governing until House of  Representatives general elections which may follow a threatened  no-confidence motion by the LDP against the Hata government.  The SDP has indicated it may support a no-confidence vote.    The SDP left the governing alliance in April after the  establishment of a new parliamentary group by some coalition  parties, excluding the SDP.</p>

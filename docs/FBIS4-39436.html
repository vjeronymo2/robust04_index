			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Russian foreign minister stressed in an interview  with Interfax that the NATO Partnership for Peace program was no  panacea for Russia. "We are not stuck on this program," he added.    Kozyrev announced that he was going to discuss the issue at  the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council (NACC) in Istanbul  in which he would arrive from Paris. "We believe that the NACC  is maybe of even more importance than the Partnership for Peace  program," he pointed out. We do not agree that the role of the  NACC be brought down to that of a NATO adjunct. The NACC has  its own future. It lets NATO reorganize itself and launch  multilateral cooperation. This is quite an independent direction  making a part of pan-European partnership, Kozyrev said.    He also announced that in the near future Russian President  Boris Yeltsin would put forward Russia's initiatives on  development of pan-European partnership where the CSCE would  play the key role.    Kozyrev stressed that Moscow regarded the Russia-NATO  document recently introduced in Brussels by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev as much more important than the  Partnership for Peace program. Kozyrev stated that the Russian  formula in the political sphere of cooperation would be made  known in Istanbul. "Afterwards, we will calmly negotiate with  NATO, sign the frame document they are proposing and reach an  agreement on our Russia-NATO program which is certainly more  comprehensive and serious. We take the Partnership for Peace  program into account. It is not primarily important for us.  However, it is not least important for either," Kozyrev  emphasized.</p>

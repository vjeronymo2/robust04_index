			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Clash over reform of counties THE LOCAL Government Commission will today publish its final recommendations for reorganising local authorities in Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire in a move that is likely to spark a clash with Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The commission is expected to recommend maintenance of the two-tier structure in Durham and much of Derbyshire, rejecting the government's preference for unitary single-tier authorities.</p>

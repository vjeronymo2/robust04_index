			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> UNZIPPED PROSECUTOR DEMOTED  </P> <P> A ranking Dade County prosecutor was demoted for "offensive and intolerable"  conduct in unzipping his trousers in front of a woman helping defend an accused  killer.  </P> <P> State Atty.  </P> <P> Janet Reno stripped Abe Laeser of his chief assistant for major crimes title  and cut his salary from $88,740 to $85,000.  </P> <P> "I expect persons in your position to set an example for all lawyers in the  office by conducting themselves in a dignified, professional and courteous  manner," Reno wrote in a reprimand to Laeser.  </P> <P> Laeser acknowledged that the April 17 incident happened but said that the  gesture was directed at a male attorney and that he had not realized that trial  consultant Rebecca Lynn was in the room.  </P> <P> Laeser said the gesture was made in reply to a male public defender when he  asked Laeser, "What do you have for me?"  </P> <P> "I unzipped and rezipped in a tenth of a second, and then I told him what I had  for him were some witnesses."  </P></p>

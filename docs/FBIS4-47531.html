Rasulzade and Russian Food  Industry Correspondence Institute, Moscow; UDC 547.962:541.63]    [Abstract] An earlier study of the structural-functional  organization of the molecule of such opioid neuropeptides as  Met- and Leu-enkephalin, _a_-, _g_-, -, and  _b_-endorphins,  etc., is continued, and an attempt is made to solve the primal  and inverse structural problems of another compound in this  series--adrenorphin--an octapeptide whose N-terminal segment has  the Met-enkephalin sequence. The adrenorphin molecule's optimum  conformational states are determined on the basis of the  conformational theory of native peptides and the corresponding  analysis method. The amino acid sequence of adrenorphin was  treated as [Met[.sup]5[/]]-enkephalin with a tripeptide  fragment attached to its C-terminal. The relative conformation  energy of the tripeptide fragment, the relative energy and  energy contributions of nonvalent, electrostatic, and torsional  interactions of adrenorphin's optimum conformations, the  geometrical parameters of the preferable conformations of  various shapes of the peptide skeleton, and the relative energy  of optimum adrenorphin conformations and its synthetic analogues  are summarized. These synthetic analogues are examined; each of  them may assume a rather limited number of conformations  (sometimes only one) from the set of low-energy conformations  and, consequently, physiologically active spatial forms of the  native peptide. The proposed analogues differ from the native  peptide only by their conformational abilities and as a group,  are consistent with the structural-functional organization of  the native molecule.

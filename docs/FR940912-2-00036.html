Dental, the owner of Dental's Automotive Center (Dental's), in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Mr. Dental's refund application had been denied because the DOE determined that the business was not a purchaser of Texaco products, but a consignee of an independent Texaco distributor. In the Motion, Mr. Dental demonstrated that, because the per gallon margin Dental's received for sales of Texaco products fluctuated, the business was susceptible to Texaco price increases and market pressures. Accordingly, the DOE granted Mr. Dental a total refund of $13,908 under the medium-range presumption of injury.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Houston &amp; Davidson Texaco, 5/3/94, RF321&hyph;20557  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying an Application for Refund filed by Mr. William E. Davidson on behalf of Houston &amp; Davidson Texaco in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. The DOE found that the applicant had not shown that he had had any ownership interest in the outlet located at 300 N. Euclid St., Fullerton, California, either as a partner or otherwise, and therefore concluded that he was not eligible for a refund based on the purchases made by that outlet.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Jerry's Texaco, Kelly's Texaco, 5/4/94, RF321&hyph;19200, RF321&hyph;19308  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Applications for Refund were filed by Jerry Mittler on behalf of Jerry's Texaco (Case No. RF321&hyph;19200) and by Jack Fensterheim on behalf of Kelly's Texaco (Case No. RF321&hyph;19308) requesting refunds based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products. Each applicant estimated that he purchased 32,000 gallons of Texaco motor gasoline each month he was in business, and requested that his refund be based on this estimate. In considering this request, the DOE found that this estimate was not reliable, since it was based solely on the applicants' recollection of the size and frequency of gasoline deliveries. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order denying the Applications for Refund filed by Jerry Mittler and Jack Fensterheim.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Wathke's Interstate Texaco, Haak's Texaco, 5/3/94, RF321&hyph;20937, RF321&hyph;20965  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refund filed on behalf of Wathke's Interstate Texaco (Wathke) and Haak's Texaco (Haak) in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Both applications were postmarked after the February 28, 1994 deadline for submitting applications in the Texaco proceeding. The applicant's representative, Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), argued that Wathke's application should be considered as filed timely because Wathke mailed RRI its application in an envelope postmarked February 24, 1994 and that RRI did not receive Wathke's application until March 2, 1994. RRI argued that Haak's application should be considered timely because Haak mailed material needed to complete its application to the wrong address. The DOE held that, with respect to Wathke, it was immaterial that its application was delayed in its transmission to RRI since Wathke itself elected to send its application to RRI by mail instead of sending it to the DOE directly, and that RRI could not be considered an agent of the DOE for purposes of satisfying the deadline. In addition, the DOE held that Haak's negligence in sending information to the wrong address was not a sufficient excuse to justify its late application. Because Wathke's and Haak's applications were filed after the February 28 deadline and no equitable considerations existed in excusing their lateness, the DOE dismissed both applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK is 'less attractive' destination for German waste: Paper recycling THE DECLINE of sterling has come as welcome news to at least one part of British industry - the companies that collect and recycle waste paper. The relative rise in the value of the D-Mark is expected to help staunch the inflow of German material from recycled cardboard boxes which has been playing havoc with the pricing structure of the UK market. But Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of the David S. Smith paper and packaging group, believes the pound's fall against other European currencies is likely to bring only temporary respite to his industry. 'The devaluation has relieved some of the competitive pressures, making it less attractive for continental Europeans to ship here,' he says. 'It will help attenuate our problems, but it will not solve them.' Spurred on by a big national recycling scheme, the German paper packaging industry has benefited from an unlimited supply of cheap raw materials. But surplus collected materials have moved out of Germany, driving down prices across Europe and undermining the market economics of paper recycling industries in other countries. 'The fundamental problem remains that many continental European countries have state-driven mandated recycling systems whereas we have a market-based system which is vulnerable to price pressures,' Mr Williams says. The Italian waste paper collection and recycling industries, which have been similarly hit by the glut of German materials over the past year, are also likely to experience some temporary relief following the lira's decline against other currencies. However, UK companies which buy recycled paper to convert into cardboard boxes are likely to face increased cost pressures as a result of sterling's decline.</p>

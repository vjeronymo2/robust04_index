			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / People: Buckley shines on Sun Life Henderson Administration, the fund management company, has moved to bolster confidence in its investment skills by recruiting Ian Buckley from Sun Life Asset management to head its group investment business. Ben Wray, who has been heading that section, will remain Henderson's deputy chairman and chairman of the investment policy committee. Henderson, following patchy investment performance in the late 1980s, has had a net loss of its key pension fund clients. In 1991, it listed 187 pension funds for which it managed money, down from 246 in 1989. Buckley, 43, who had a reputation as a no-nonsense manager at Sun Life, was in charge of global asset allocation policy there. At the moment, Buckley says, his portfolio is heavily invested in cash awaiting the outcome of the election - presumably the emergence of a Labour government could present some handsome buying opportunities among UK equities. Significantly, his new job at Henderson does not begin until May.</p>

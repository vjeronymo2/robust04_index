			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Investors search for a pallid flicker of flame amid the gloom - London Markets As I sat opposite the Treasury bench, the ministers reminded me of one of those marine landscapes on the coasts of South America. You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes; not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest, but the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes, and ever and anon the dark rumbling of the sea. Benjamin Disraeli WE cannot expect rhetoric of that quality in this election campaign - they just do not make sound-bites like that any more. None the less, a ghostly echo of that famous condemnation has lurked unbidden in the stock market's subconscious all week. On the face of it, nothing could be less like an exhausted volcano than John Major's irrepressible grin this past week, or the eager efficiency with which the Conservative party machine is gearing up for the campaign. Yet the markets are worried, as their deterioration since Norman Lamont's Budget, shown in the charts, reflects. On balance, the brokers' analysts who commented on the Budget seemed to feel that it was, at best, one of Disraeli's dark rumblings. A handful of headlines from the flood of post-budget reports illustrates the point: 'Lacklustre UK Budget increases risk of 'hung' parliament,' says Chase Manhattan. 'Too honest by half?' asks NatWest. 'No kick start for the Tories,' says Goldman Sachs. 'A timorous wee beastie,' says Robert Fleming. Comments from some of the more heavyweight houses - SG Warburg, James Capel, BZW - are more favourable, praising Mr Lamont for making the best of a bad job. But they still stress the economic difficulties ahead. The tone of the market comments reflects a two-fold disappointment with the Budget: that the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement for 1992-93 is higher than expected, and that it does not represent the sort of Budget giveaway that can be guaranteed to win the election for the Conservatives. This double whammy has pushed long term interest rates up sharply and left equities weak - though stock market volume is low, indicating that there has been no panicky rush to sell. The FT-SE index, which dropped 52 points the day after the budget and 29 points the day after that, closed the week at 2476.0, a drop of 77 points on the week. The market appears to have started to discount the possibility of a Labour win - or at least of a Conservative defeat. Evidence for this comes in the shape of the FT Election Share Index, designed to track market reactions to the likely consequences of a change of government. It consists of ten stocks which might outperform in the event of Neil Kinnock's arrival in Downing St or John Major's departure; and another ten stocks which stand to be relative beneficiaries from a Conservative victory and the removal of the threat of a Labour government. The index will be published each day from Tuesday on the FT's election news pages. It is as much an aid to thought as a serious stock market index, and is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index - which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement. The base for the index is the closing prices of the day the election was announced, Wednesday March 11. Both the 'Labour gainers' and the 'Conservative gainers' sections of the index are set to 100 at that date. On the next day, Thursday, the Labour gainers dropped by 1.2 per cent - in line with the market as a whole - and the Conservative gainers dropped by 2.3 per cent, nearly twice as far. The Labour gainers closed on Friday at 98.7, with the Conservative gainers at 97.4. A similar trend - outperformance by the Labour gainers - is evident since the beginning of the year, as the election has drawn closer and the opinion polls have reflected a Labour lead. Between January 2 and the day the election was announced, the Labour gainers rose 3.3 per cent and the Conservative gainers rose only 1.3 per cent. The composition of the index represents some common themes among investment analysts as they try to work out the impact of the election. Because the Conservatives have been in power for 13 years, the list inevitably revolves around the advantages and disadvantages of Labour's policies. Companies which analysts reckon might gain, relative to other UK shares at any rate, from a Labour government include those which derive most of their profits from overseas and are thus impervious to domestic political upsets; companies in Labour's favoured manufacturing sector; and companies that might benefit from higher infrastructure spending. There is also a pools promoter, Zetters, which might gain if the Conservative threat to introduce a national lottery were lifted; and the biggest, staidest of property companies, Land Securities, which would see the value of its existing holdings rise if Labour adopted more restrictive planning policies. Analysts reckon that gainers from a renewed Conservative mandate are those companies that would benefit from the removal of the threat posed by individual Labour policies. The policies Labour is pledged to introduce will not be known for sure until the manifesto is published next week, but they are likely to include de-privatisation of water, tighter utility regulation, a minimum wage, discouragement of corporate takeovers and stronger consumer-protection rules on life insurance. If the index works properly, it will track the equity market's view of the way the campaign is going. Another sensitive indicator is the FT-SE futures contract, which on Friday was stuck at a persistent discount to the cash market. This happens from time to time, but a discount throughout the day is unusual. On Friday, it reflected the difficulty a few big houses were having in unwinding long positions in the future. Whenever rumours circulated that the holders were trying to sell the FT-SE future, market-makers marked down the underlying shares, leaving the two markets leapfrogging each other downwards. This is one of the mechanisms that pushes prices down without a lot of volume. It leaves the market very vulnerable if a wave of real selling materialises and also exposes it to rumours of good or bad opinion-poll results. These have become a standard feature of election campaigns, and this time they have started unusually early. There will be a lot of telescopes in use over the next three weeks, as the markets attempt to discover whether the Tory volcanoes are exhausted - or still very much alive.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT ELECTION SHARE INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour win/Tory defeat stocks  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

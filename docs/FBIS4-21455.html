			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fedor Orlov: ``Leading the Whole Planet -- Tens </F> of Thousands of Pesticides: Lots, Even for a Big Country'']    [Text] God willing, soon there will be yet another program  to alleviate the effects of our ill-conceived efforts to wrest  from nature more than it can or will give. In this case the time  factor is particularly important, because at issue are  pesticides, for which the season of massive use is fast  approaching. When using the word ``massive'' one should not only  bear in mind the tonnage involved but also the array of this  type of agricultural chemical that exists -- the list of  permitted pesticides contains over 500 names, but in reality,  counting all the possible combinations, the number is in the  tens of thousands. This wide choice, like its legalized status,  definitely does not please either ecologists or farmers.  Evidence of this were the heated discussions that occurred at  two board meetings of the Ministry of Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources, even though the professionals gathered  there are usually pretty much unfazed by (as the ``green'' press  likes to phrase it) the latest evidence of ecocide.    One thing remains quite clear: a negative situation with  regard to this super-toxin can be found in a majority of  Russia's regions. However, it is difficult to say anything  specific about each oblast -- of the 206 functioning analysis  offices only 24 are capable of monitoring pesticides in the  soil, and only 30 can monitor pesticides in water.    A Russian State Committee for Hydrometeorology soil study  done in 17 krays and oblasts found that soils were most polluted  in forests (37-52 percent of area) and in cropland used to grow  vegetables (18 percent) and grains (11 percent). The most  pesticides are applied in Krasnodar and Stavropol krays and in  Voronezh, Kursk, Ryazan, Moscow and Nizhegorod oblasts. In terms  of environmental effects the situation is worst in the Northern  Caucasus, Rostov Oblast, the upper and middle Volga regions,  Maritime Kray, the area around Moscow and Chelyabinsk and Kurgan  oblasts.    It is not only soils that are polluted: according to data  from regional environmental protection agencies, in 1992 alone  there were 994 cases in which bodies of water were poisoned. As  a result, the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing recorded  massive fish kills in the watersheds of the Volga River and the  Sea of Azov. Pesticide runoff from adjacent fields into the  Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast) killed as many as two million  pike, carp, knottyhead and perch. A total of 84,000 fish died in  the Anna River, which flows into Cheboksary Reservoir, as a  result of hops cultivation along the river's banks.    Insects are of course harmed by pesticides, but not just the  harmful ones. For example, in Bryansk and Ryazan oblasts there  have been instances of large number of bees being killed,  resulting in a sharp drop in the yield of crops pollinated by  them.    The reason for the deadly effects of agricultural chemicals  is not only their excessive use, but also a lack of modern  equipment and insufficient knowledge about equipment servicing  and chemical storage. According to available statistics, 52  percent of storage facilities do not meet environmental  protection requirements. In a majority of cases that  classification means that chemicals are stored virtually out in  the open.    As for equipment service, as a rule little time is wasted on  that --equipment is sent directly out to the fields, loaded  there and washed out there without ever being properly  decontaminated.    In addition to all this, the Ministry of Agriculture finds  itself the owner of 100,000 tonnes of unusable pesticides. No  one knows how to destroy them safely, and the problem is a heavy  burden on the Waste Program.    The whole grim list of Russia's pesticide users should  immediately suggest some obvious conclusions: firstly, creation  of an adequate map of pesticide usage distribution, particularly  since the most likely sites can already be predicted. Secondly,  establishment of an effective system for monitoring the storage  and efficient use of pesticides. Thirdly, provision of an  effective legislative foundation that will require violators to  take responsibility for eliminating damages caused by them, if  only by paying for recovery efforts. And, finally, a fundamental  answer to the question of why we need such a vast array of  pesticides, a number out of proportion even to the rich palette  of our immense country's natural conditions. But accomplishing  all this will be a truly monumental task.</p>

			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Black cab revisited The latest design for a London taxi hit the road yesterday (above). But its design is far from futuristic - it is inspired by a 1930s taxi. Asquith Motor Carriage Company, which makes the new taxi, aims to combine 1930s style with 1990s comfort in the cab. The new taxi - which will cost about Pounds 30,000 - boasts air suspension, power steering and a Ford gear-box. But perhaps most importantly for London's taxi drivers, the new Asquith can still turn in a 25-foot circle. The new taxi, built in Essex, joins the two other designs - the 1950s Austin FX4 and the Metrocab - on the streets of London.</p>

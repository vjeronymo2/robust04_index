			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Output of Western German industry recovers by 1.5 per cent The output of western German industry recovered by 1.5 per cent in August after five months of steady decline, according to the latest government statistics, writes Quentin Peel from Bonn. The seasonally adjusted monthly figure was not enough, however, to offset an overall decline in the year-on-year figure to July/August 1992 of 1.2 per cent. There was a 1.0 per cent cut in output in both electricity and gas supplies, and in the mining industry, in August.</p>

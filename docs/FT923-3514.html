			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Orbicom seeks leave to trade ORBICOM, the Shrewsbury-based trading company which during 1990-91 made a number of deals in Russia, is seeking protection from its UK creditors through a company voluntary arrangement. This device allows a financially wounded company, with the agreement of its creditors, to continue trading while it works its way out of debt. Newland Mallett Garner Woodbury, the Bristol accountants, will on September 24 present a business plan to the group's creditors outlining how it intends to clear the Pounds 1.3m debt by the middle of next year. Formed in 1990 by Mr Mark and Mrs Natalya Jones, Orbicom was engaged in the barter trading of Siberian liquid natural gas, the sale of Rover cars in Russia, joint ventures with Russian partners on the development of Yamal Peninsula oil and gas, the supply of medical equipment to Siberia and engineering projects in Moscow and Siber-ia. Mr Jones yesterday attributed Orbicom's difficulties to the fact that 'the Russians are not paying their way.' The company was hurt, he said, by the collapse of the Bank for Foreign and Economic Affairs in Moscow and of Orbicom's LNG business following the break-up of the Soviet Union. But, he added: 'We are not closing the company, we are not liquidating the company, we are not running away from our UK creditors.' Newland Mallett noted that the potential turnover of Orbicom's signed contracts in Russia was Pounds 22m, but 'at the moment it is unlikely to achieve this turnover.' Orbicom's inability to extract funds from Russia has meant that its deal to buy 4,800 Montego cars from Rover for onward sale in the Siberian area of Tyumen fell by the wayside. Only 32 cars were delivered, Orbicom could pay for no more. The Orbicom deal offered Rover a route into the Russian market. But at the Moscow motor show a month ago it said: 'It seems unlikely that this opportunity will develop any further.' Rover said yesterday that it was exploring how to set up independent dealerships in Russia, but that it had no intention of setting up a manufacturing plant. Orbicom's ability to satisfy its UK creditors seems to depend largely on an engineering contract which, Newland Mallet said, it had 'brought back on line.' The accountants would not specify the contract, but previously Orbicom announced a joint venture with Moulinex Swan Holdings to build an electrical appliance plant in Tyumen and a Moscow city government contract for a waste recycling plant.</p>

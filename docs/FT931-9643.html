			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: No shortage of government support for projects in Leeds Sir, As minister with special responsibility for Leeds and Bradford, I was very pleased to see your special feature on Leeds on January 28. However, Stewart Dalby's article leaves the impression that the city is not getting support from central government. Nothing could be further from the truth. Recently, Tony Baldry, housing minister, announced government support for one of the largest ever housing estate action packages - worth Pounds 63m. The housing improvement plan will link in with training and crime prevention measures. The government is also channelling resources to housing associations in the city at an annual rate of some Pounds 20m as well as providing the council with spending allocations of some Pounds 25m on its own stock. As your other articles make clear, the government has so far invested some Pounds 39m in the Leeds Development Corporation, which has levered in three times that amount in private sector support and has generated thousands of jobs. The government has also pledged Pounds 20m to help develop the new museum for the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Following the Autumn Statement, we announced a Pounds 22m package of road and transport measures, on top of resources for the Leeds/Bradford rail electrification. A major boost has been given to Leeds hospitals with the Department of Health approving expenditure of Pounds 11m at Chapel Allerton and Pounds 70m for phase 1 of the redevelopment of the Leeds General Infirmary. The list goes on, but there are limits on your space. It all amounts to very substantial help from the government. Baroness Denton, Department of Trade and Industry, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6RB</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Viatteau] </F>   [Text] Benkovac, Croatia, April 4 (AFP) -- Serb forces  Monday [4 April] withdrew large numbers of artillery and tanks  from the front line in their self-proclaimed republic of  Krajina, as a ceasefire with Croatian forces came into effect.    A column of T54 tanks, 130mm guns, light mortars and  military  trucks loaded with ammunition pulled away from the front line in  clouds of black exhaust smoke on the road between Benkovac and  Knin, in southern Croatia.    Smiling young Serb soldiers sat astride their hardware next  to the red, white and blue flags of Krajina, waving the victory  sign. Crowds of local people came out to greet them in the town  of Kistanje and its neighbouring villages, hailed in return by a  loud chorus of honking horns.    The withdrawal was supervised by the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) at several control points, in accordance with the  Russian-brokered peace accord signed last Wednesday.    According to the agreement, which took effect Monday  morning,  Croatian army forces and secessionist Serbs have until 0700 GMT  on Tuesday to withdraw all their heavy weapons from an agreed  demarcation line.    Mortar and anti-aircraft guns must be withdrawn 10  kilometres  (six miles) and artillery and tanks by 20 kilometres (12 miles)  although some are to be redeployed at specified locations.    At one UN control point on the edges of Benkovac, by 1100  GMT  Canadian troops had counted 10 T55 tanks, eight T34s, eight  105mm guns, nine 152mm guns and other weapons.    The checkpoint was visited by the commander of the 92nd Serb  Brigade of Benkovac, Lieutenant-Colonel Uzelac, and the  commander of the Canadian UNPROFOR unit stationed here, Major  Andre Lefebvre, who confirmed that the withdrawal was going as  planned.    They were both mindful of the Croatian offensive of January  22 last year, which broke the first UN-backed ceasefire between  the two sides.    After repeated demands by Uzelac for confirmation of the  Croatian withdrawal, the Canadian commander contacted his  counterpart on the other side by radio and reported, "They're at  exactly the same point as here."    People living in the mountain town of Knin, the capital of  the self-proclaimed Krajina republic, said they hoped the  ceasefire would bring them peace and better supplies. "Perhaps  we'll have chocolate at last for the children," said one young  woman in the main street.    The leaders of Knin, which wants to join with Serbia proper,  refuse to see the military agreement as a political concession  to Croat sovereignty as Zagreb seems to think, a senior interior  ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told AFP.    In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said the troop withdrawal included in  the  military accord would begin Monday afternoon.    Troops from both sides -- at some points only a few metres  (yards) apart -- are to withdraw one kilometre (just over half a  mile) from the confrontation line, forming a two-kilometer  buffer zone to be controlled by UN forces.    The buffer zone line was drawn on a series of 35 maps during  painstaking negotiations at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. The  overall operation is to be completed by 0700 GMT Friday.    The UN Protection Force deputy commander General John  MacInnis said last Thursday that the first task, "difficult if  not impossible," would be "transforming what was written on the  map to precise locations on the ground, the establishment of  (...) joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which will have the task  of confirming precisely where those lines of separation are to  be."    The commissions will also determine the number of Serb and  Croatian police who are to be deployed in limited numbers  between the two separation lines, said MacInnis, who hinted that  the stated deadline might not be met.    To enable UNPROFOR troops to move into the buffer zone, the  Croatian and Serb separatist adversaries are to provide maps  setting out the location of mine fields between the separation  lines.    They are to clear the mines themselves, under UNPROFOR  supervision, removing several thousand mines that have been  placed in the zone since the conflict erupted in June 1991.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Swiss vote in favour of VAT Switzerland's voters yesterday approved the introduction of a value added tax, indicating a new willingness to align fiscal and economic policies with those of other European countries. The majority for the introduction of VAT was a surprisingly strong 65 per cent, and was unusually consistent across the culturally diverse cantons. On three previous occasions in the past two decades, the latest only two years ago, Swiss voters rejected government proposals to replace an outmoded goods turnover tax with a universal VAT. However, the VAT issue had a more urgent context this year. Swiss companies have complained of the excessive burden of the old goods tax at a time when they faced increasing difficulties competing in European markets. For its part, the government pleaded for a broader revenue base to meet its increased responsibilities. Government spending has soared during the recession, mainly to cover the costs of unemployment insurance. This in turn reflects its more humane policy towards guest workers. Government revenues have declined, with revenue from the goods tax falling 14 per cent. The federal deficit is likely to exceed SFr7bn (Pounds 3.1bn) this year, more than double the initial estimate. The introduction of VAT is estimated to bring in SFr1.7bn in new annual revenue. Voters also replied positively to vigorous appeals from government leaders for the higher of two VAT rates, opting for setting the VAT rate at 6.5 per cent instead of the current 6.2 per cent for turnover tax. There was also heavy backing for government advice to veto a proposal to ban tobacco and liquor advertising, which was advanced by a petition supported by Swiss doctors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry is being  received in Almaty today following his visit to Moscow.    Correspondent Dukesh Baimbetov: Today, after a  meeting at the republic's Ministry of Defense, the American  military delegation headed by William Perry was received by  Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. As is known, during  the recent visit of Kazakhstan's leader to the United States the  sides signed a number of documents between the two countries on  economic, political, and military issues.    President Clinton and Vice President Gore have charged me  with paying particular attention to the practical implementation  of these programs, Perry said. Today, in particular, issues  were discussed regarding the United States in the conversion of  defense industry enterprises in Kazakhstan, inspecting the  territory of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and the  allocation of aid to its population. Incidentally, the first  aid has already arrived. The Americans brought with them very  valuable diagnostic equipment and medicines. They also spoke  about tripartite space cooperation between Kazakhstan, the  United States,and Russia.    [Begin recording]    Nazarbayev: There is nothing to delay on the part  of the Kazakh side. At the present time we are holding talks  with Russia. We hope that we will sign these agreements this  month, in which all the issues will be agreed on.    We have reached agreement both with the United States and  with Russia that Kazakhstan will be compensated for the cost of  the highly enriched uranium that is in the warheads.

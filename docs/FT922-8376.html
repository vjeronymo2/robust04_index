			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Management: The French connection / Charting the dealings of Japanese companies with Parisian protectionists and finds they are getting a warmer welcome these days Ever since General de Gaulle insultingly described one Japanese prime minister as a transistor salesman, France has had a schizophrenic attitude to Japanese investment. Yet it hosts more Japanese factories than any European country except Britain. A year ago, corporate planners in Tokyo were scratching their heads over the protectionist and anti-Japanese remarks of Edith Cresson, France's former prime minister. More recently, the new premier, Pierre Beregovoy, has been trying to convince the Japanese that they are, after all, welcome in France. Which one really represents French policy; the hostile Cresson or the nice Beregovoy? The experience of three very different kinds of Japanese investors in France  -Canon, the office equipment group, Nissan cars and Ajinomoto, the food processor - suggests that the truth is somewhere in between. Japanese - indeed any foreign - investors are welcome, so long as they do not disrupt local competition. Several lessons for newcomers can be drawn from the 10 years or more that each company has spent in France. First is the power of the industrial lobbies, which are strongest in telecommunications, cars and electronics. The civil service is sensitive to them, employs some of their top people, and exerts an all-pervasive influence. Nissan and Canon found local partners to guide them through the system, while Ajinomoto got on by striking a joint venture with a pillar of the French industrial establishment. Second, government policy switches are only a brake on foreign companies, rather than a deterrent to them. They are seen by Canon as a costly irritant and offered by Nissan as one reason why France has missed the wave of Japanese investment in European car plants. 'The political changes just make us hesitant,' says Hiroshi Nakamura, who recently became president of Richard-Nissan, the Japanese group's French distributor. Despite the difficulties, the trio are increasing their commitment to France. They say they are there for the long-term, rather than making a dash in under trade barriers. Canon, for example, opened its European research centre in Brittany last month, which it claims makes it the first Japanese manufacturer to have all its functions represented in France. Nissan has just bought control of its French distributor, while Ajinomoto and its French partner, the Lafarge Coppee subsidiary Orsan, plan to open a new Italian plant in Venice to make animal food protein supplements. They are not alone. Elsewhere, Sony has opened its fifth plant in France, Hitachi will in July open a disk-drive centre in Orleans, and Toyota is planning to take a minority stake in its distributor. Getting into France was the least of the three investors' problems. The French administration welcomed Canon to Liffre, Brittany, in 1983, because government attempts to create a French-owned photocopier industry had come to nothing, says Jacques Le Gall, an adviser to Canon France. Since then, Canon has followed a classic Japanese step-by-step investment pattern. Starting with local assembly of imported components, it has built up a broad base of local suppliers and has set up a club to keep them up to date on its rigorous quality requirements. Local content is around 60 per cent and Canon recognises it is politically advisable to keep it high, says Le Gall. The new research centre in Brittany completes the chain. Canon's difficulties began in 1987, when its electric typewriter production in Brittany was subject to European Community anti-dumping duties on the grounds that it contained a high proportion of dumped components. More seriously, Canon found it impossible to get government approval to sell its facsimile machines in France, a product that faces competition from politically-influential French companies like Alcatel, Matra and Sagem. The reason given again was not enough local content. It was at that point that the Japanese group head-hunted Le Gall, an adviser to the then regional development minister. Canon had to export its French- made fax machines for two-and-a-half years until mid-1989, when the government was at last satisfied that the local content was high enough to sell faxes in France. Inside the plant itself, Canon has found it surprisingly easy to persuade a mainly French workforce and management to adopt Japanese methods, such as total quality control and consensus decision-making. Instead of reacting to fast decisions from the top, French executives have had to get used to making their own input to a very slow decision-making process, says Le Gall. Out of the 750 staff at Liffe, 30 are Japanese, mostly in management. The French staff have adapted well: the plant is 97 per cent as efficient as its counterpart in Japan and more efficient than Canon's German operation. Nissan's experience is similar to Canon's; years of frustrating resistance from officials, but a harmonious relationship with French staff and customers. Its entry to France started in the early 1980s when the Japanese company appointed a French distributor, Jean-Pierre Richard. At first, Nissan wanted a 34 per cent interest in the new company, Richard-Nissan, but the government refused. 'They never gave us a reason,' recalls Akinari Okabe, marketing director. Nissan waited until 1986, before taking 9.55 per cent, below the threshold then needed for official clearance. Then, three years ago, Richard told Nissan that he wanted to retire and sell his 72.09 per cent stake to the Japanese car group. Nissan was granted permission to buy last summer, with no conditions attached. 'The atmosphere has dramatically changed since that agreement,' says Okabe. Nissan's path was also eased by getting Societe Generale, a leading French commercial bank, to present its case. With that hurdle out of the way, Nissan is now setting about transforming its French dealer from a small company with 'one man top-down management' to a group where responsibility is widely spread, says Nakamura. Since Richard's retirement, the group has brought in four Japanese managers to join the 250 staff, heading up new departments, from sales to marketing and personnel. So far, the French staff are taking well to the change, says Herve de Villeplee, Richard-Nissan's vice president. Ajinomoto's 19-year-old joint venture with Orsan never experienced such bureaucratic teething problems. This could be because the market for animal food protein is free, with no government interference, argues Alain Crouy, chairman of Eurolysine, the joint venture with Orsan. The French partners reckon they have benefited from adapting Ajinomoto's production methods to their jointly-owned plant in Amiens, which has increased productivity by a third in three years. They have kept a French union structure and workforce, but the management is split equally between Japanese and French staff. 'What we try to do is to marry French creativity with Japanese methods,' says Crouy. On one thing all three agree. France has been getting less protectionist over the last decade as the government has become anxious not to fall behind on foreign investment of all kinds. The door may be swinging open. But the trio's experience shows that an inside track to the establishment is still useful, whether it be a head-hunted government official, an influential bank or a joint venture partner. * The Evolution of Japanese Direct Investment in Europe - death of a transistor salesman; Harvester Wheatsheaf</p>

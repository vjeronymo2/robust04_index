In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper published today,  Mr. Ramadan said we want to lift the embargo and resume oil  export in the manner that could not infringe our independence  and national sovereignty.    Mr. Ramadan added "We want to have Iraq sell and buy without  interference of any other forces pointing out that the current  formula for resuming the export of oil is rejected, since it  constitutes a flagrant interference into Iraq's sovereignty.  [no end quote marks as received]    Mr. Ramadan said that all oppressive formulas they (enemies)  have placed under various covers and which were considered a  mask to carry on the imposition of the embargo and preventing  Iraq from exporting its oil had ended. There should be a serious  consideration to lifting the embargo from Iraq and allowing it  to export it abroad, he said.    Mr. Ramadan said that he was optimistic that the embargo  would end through patience of Iraqis and determination to  restore life to its normal.    Mr. Ramadan said the embargo would be eliminated through the  building of self-capabilities of the society and will be lifted  once and for all when the criminal enemies be convinced of the  impossibility to achieve the objectives that had urged them to  impose this embargo on Iraq.    Mr. Ramadan added that Umm al-Ma'arik [the Mother of  Battles]  represents the beginning of a new stage and a new growth not  only on the level of slogans and principles but on the level of  starting the correct mobilization pointing out that impact of  Umm al-Ma'arik would also be realised in eras to come.</p>

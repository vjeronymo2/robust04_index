			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Another alternative will be one which proposes no activities in the McKay Creek Roadless area. Additional alternatives will be developed to address comments and suggestions raised by the public. The alternatives will examine varying levels and locations for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present, and projected activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7), which will occur March 1994 to April 1994. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. No public meetings are scheduled at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be used to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identify potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as the Kootenai Forest Plan EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative effects). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some public comments have already been received in conjunction with Cabinet District Open House meetings in January 1994. The following preliminary issues have been identified so far: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. What are the effects of sediment from logging activities on the fisheries within Rock Creek? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. What effect would the proposal have on wildlife habitat and security? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. What effect would the proposal have on the roadless character of McKay Creek Roadless Area  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 676 and the Cabinet Wilderness? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. What would be the effects on the visual quality of the area as viewed from Highway 200 and the Clark Fork River? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Are there any sensitive, threatened, or endangered plant or animal species in the area? How would this project affect them if they are present? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. How will this project, in conjunction with the proposed Asarco Rock Creek mine, affect grizzly bear security? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other issues commonly associated with timber harvesting and road construction include: Effects on cultural resources, soils, and old growth. This list may be verified, expanded, or modified based on public and internal scoping for this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Arts: Schumann and friends - Concert Evidently somebody at BMW has a sense of humour. In the week that the company surprised many observers in the car industry by revealing itself as the buyer of Rover, it was also playing a game of hidden identities with London concert-goers at the Barbican. The English Chamber Orchestra is giving seven concerts in its spring season at the hall, each of which includes a mystery item. The audience is invited to guess what the pieces are and the overall winner gets a prize to the tune of Pounds 1,000, sponsored by BMW (GB) Ltd. Of recent marketing ploys, this is undeniably the most novel, though if its aim is to win audience loyalty for the series, attendances were not encouraging. The 'Schumann and friends' series incorporated four orchestral concerts. Each included one of the four Schumann symphonies, paired with some shorter pieces by his contemporaries. This was an interesting period, when some composers still felt an allegiance to the musical language and forms of the classical period, while others were taking flight into the boundless skies of romanticism. Of all Schumann's 'friends' Berlioz was the most fully liberated. On Friday Ann Murray sang his 'Nuits d'ete' with delightful poise, shaping long and liquid phrases where most singers need to stop for breath. These seemed to be carefree summer nights, warm but not sultry, cooled by a light breeze. The most imaginative performances venture beyond that. The striking orchestral sonorities that Berlioz imagined were largely smoothed over by the conductor Raymond Leppard, which was to prove his style throughout the series. Any music that gained from lightness, fluency, dancing rhythms fared well; where a score asked to be probed more deeply, its demands were likely to be passed over. Mendelssohn's concert aria 'Infelice', well sung by Murray, kept its drama strictly within bounds. As an archetypal early 19th-century composer, Schumann himself looks both backwards and forwards. The fourth movement of the 'Rhenish' Symphony, inspired by a visit to Cologne Cathedral, harks back to the solid, Teutonic counterpoint of Bach and Buxtehude. A freer work like the Fantasie in C for violin and orchestra opens its arms to embrace romanticism. At Saturday's concert Leonidas Kavakos played the Fantasie with sweet tone and threw in some spectacular technical feats in Paganini's 'Le streghe' variations for good measure. The Schumann symphonies (Nos 2 and 3 at these concerts) went according to form. After performances by full-scale symphony orchestras which inevitably sound heavy, Leppard's springy, light-on-its-feet style was welcome, even while one was wishing that he would dig into the music more. The ensemble was not spotless, but the ECO can still field first-class soloists. Neil Black and Thea King, oboe and clarinet, made the Second Symphony's Adagio unadulterated pleasure.</p>

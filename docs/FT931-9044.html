			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Contestants expect close finish to NY exchange leadership race THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange, best known for its huge crude oil futures ring, is engaged in a leadership struggle that could result in the redefinition of the way exchanges return profits to their member-owners. Mr Lou Guttman, the flamboyant Nymex chairman, is elaborating a plan to redistribute exchange earnings directly to members in a bid to gain a third term at the helm of the nation's third-largest futures exchange. While similar proposals have been made before, tax and legal factors have prevented their implementation. The Nymex, with its robust volume and history of successful new products, may be more financially suited to the scheme than any other US exchange. The Nymex chairman is in a hotly-contested race to remain in the post after being passed over by an exchange nominating committee. The committee recommended Mr Daniel Rappaport, Nymex vice chairman and long-time director, as the next chairman. The election will be held on March 16. While it is usual for nominees to run opposed, Mr Guttman will stand against Mr Rappaport as an independent candidate. His candidacy, some exchange members say, will be coloured by his continuing difficulties with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry watchdog. Mr Guttman took a leave of absence from his chairmanship in July, when the CFTC told him that it was planning civil charges against him for violating trading regulations. The agency has not filed the charges, and Mr Guttman returned to the chairman's office December. During his five-month absence, Mr Rappaport filled in as chairman. Mr Rappaport vows to keep Mr. Guttman's legal problems out of the debate. 'It would be unfair even to raise (them),' he says. 'Many of our members believe he has not been treated appropriately by the CFTC.' Both Mr Guttman and Mr Rappaport are supporters of the Nymex's move to new quarters in Manhattan in late 1994, and both say they would welcome a marriage with the New York Commodity Exchange should a Chicago Board of Trade take-over fail. The contest, they agree, will be close, and is likely to be decided by appeals to members' wallets. While the Nymex had a record volume of 47m contracts in 1992, and record profits of Dollars 27m, floor traders and member firms complain of declining profits, a malaise shared by their counterparts at other US futures exchanges. Mr Rappaport believes that better administration would remedy the situation. 'We have deficiencies in long-term planning, staff inefficiencies, and more needs to be done in the way of member benefits,' he says. Mr Guttman, despite his 5-year tenure as chairman, is also running on a reform platform. Saying his leadership has been hampered by a divided and politically apathetic membership, he is designing a limited partnership that would distribute operating profits to members annually. 'I see it as a way to re-involve members in exchange financial affairs. It would provide a focus, make them demand more accountability,' he says.</p>

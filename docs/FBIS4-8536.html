			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, the president  of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], sent a letter today to  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander General Bertrand de  Lapresle expressing his surprise after being informed of  UNPROFOR's intentions to deploy UN troops along the state border  between the RSK and the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia  [APWB].    Such a deployment, Martic says in his letter, is absolutely  unacceptable and out of the question for us. The same goes for  other RSK borders except those along demarcation lines with the  Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the Zagreb agreement.    Reminding UNPROFOR Commander de Lapresle that he was one of  the signatories of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, in his  letter Martic also points out: The governments of the RSK and  the APWB have signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation;  there have been no incidents in the border area and there is no  need for your presence in this area, Martic says in conclusion.</p>

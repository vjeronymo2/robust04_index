			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mino Fuccillo: "And Now the Left Puts Itself in </F> the Dock"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] After a dazed fortnight on the  sidelines, it has fallen to [Democratic Party of the Left  Secretary] Occhetto to attempt to lob a ball or two into his  opponents' court. Yesterday, he picked up his racket bravely,  although it visibly proved heavy in his hand. He joked about a  recalcitrant microphone: "Nothing works here any more." But he  failed to warm the atmosphere up. Then he accused [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi of a large number of unacceptable  "about-faces." The first ball made it over the net: Occhetto  pointed out that Forza Italia has already forgotten its promises  of tax reductions. The second was not so lucky: "Berlusconi  conducted his election campaign on the Right, and now he is  making a beeline for the Center," said Occhetto. True, but this  only shows Berlusconi's open-mindedness and rapidity while the  Left is still at the stage of appeals to form a single  parliamentary progressive group. Third ball: "Berlusconi is  changing his mind on the electoral law; now he wants a straight  single-vote system just to knock all the others out; he is  turning against the two-tier system merely because it suits  him," said Occhetto. True, but this is the very problem facing  the Left: It is Berlusconi who is hitting the balls, it is his  serve, and the most the Left can do is return it. That was the  way it went during the election campaign, and so it continues  now.    "I have been watching television for two weeks," said the  secretary of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "And I have  seen the shambles: Bossi's outbursts, Berlusconi's about-faces,  and above all a spirit of inurement, the cessation of all  criticism, as if this were political normality. I have watched  Berlusconi say that the dream he sold the voters will be  difficult to translate into reality, I have watched him tell us  not to get excited because it is unlikely to come true. I have  seen the telecracy, and I have seen that no one is rebelling."  Thus Occhetto reacts to the long winter that is freezing the  Left, pointing out that the spring experienced by others is a  mere sham. But they are the same arguments that he used during  the election campaign, and indeed the conclusion that they lead  to is a return match to be won by the Left, scheduled for a date  that does not depend on the Left: "When Italy wakes up from its  dream, when it becomes aware of the deceit, it will know that we  did not pull the wool over its eyes."    Occhetto is fighting back, angrily and energetically. He  denounces the "piecemeal, factious attacks on the judiciary, the  RAI [Italian Radio and Television], and the Bank of Italy." He  denounces the "proscription lists," he denounces the "lies," he  denounces the intention to reduce fascism and antifascism to the  level of simple, symmetrical "matters of opinion." He is  fighting back as he himself and the Left as a whole have not  done for a fortnight. But after its defeat, the Left still does  not know what action to take. It does not know: Might it be  suicidal to wait for the others to make mistakes? Would it be  rash to change the names and faces in the party leadership? Is  going in search of the voters lost at the polls a matter of  necessity or demagogy? What about founding the democratic  party? But at the present time this might be the umpteenth  christening for an unborn party. The Left's long winter has set  in, and neither attacks on Berlusconi nor the paper balls made  of faxes bearing exhortations to "demonstrate together" that the  Left is throwing into its little stove of self-consolation will  be sufficient to keep it warm.</p>

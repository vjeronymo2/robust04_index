			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> THE ARROGANCE OF POWER;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SHERIFF DIVERTS $300,000 TO SECRET BANK ACCOUNT  </P> <P> Each time San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy thumbs his nose anew at standards  of ethical conduct, we come away worried about what the man is going to do  next.  </P> <P> This is an elected official whose past includes illegally using deputies to  distribute post cards opposing former Chief Justice Rose Bird; who lost a civil  suit (and was ordered to pay damages) for maliciously firing a deputy from a  teaching job; who accepted campaign contributions from members of his  department in violation of policy -- then changed the policy to allow his  protege to do the same -- and who did not report income from private consulting  contracts.  </P> <P> But Duffy may have surpassed his own benchmark for arrogance with the  revelation this week that he diverted more than $300,000 seized in drug raids  to a secret bank account -- and used more than $70,000 in other seized drug  money to pay a private attorney in a civil suit filed by a deputy. This despite  a specific prohibition from county supervisors that Duffy spend no more of the  seized money.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller concluded Friday that there is no reason to  investigate. But we believe that the latest Duffy affair should be reviewed by  the state attorney general's office.  </P> <P> Miller should stay out of the matter. His office received a share of the seized  drug funds from Duffy, and on Friday Miller endorsed Duffy protege Jack Drown  in Tuesday's election to succeed the retiring sheriff.  </P> <P> Federal guidelines governing expenditure of the funds are vague; they mandate  only that the money be used for "law enforcement" purposes. Orange County  supervisors and Sheriff Brad Gates have wrangled over Gates' expenditures of  forfeited drug money.  </P> <P> Unlike grant money, the expenditure of forfeited drug assets is not monitored  by the federal government. It remains an open question who is ultimately  responsible for decisions about the money.  </P> <P> As for the swaggering Sheriff Duffy, he will leave in January after 20 years in  office, tarnished by the bizarre behavior of his last years there. What remains  to be seen is whether the latest episode harms Drown at the polls Tuesday.  </P></p>

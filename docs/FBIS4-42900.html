			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "sig.": "Special Troop on New Drug Route"] </F>   [Text] Klagenfurt -- At the Thoerl-Maglern checkpoint, the  Austrian customs authorities have established a new six-member  special unit against international drug smuggling. "Since the  beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia, a new drug route has  developed from Turkey to the port of Trieste," Helmut Gram,  chief of the Carinthian customs guard, reported on Monday [6  June].    Direct ferries from Turkey with up to 140 truck trains on  board arrive in Trieste three times a week. As international  investigators know, for the major part of illegal drug  smuggling, these new opportunities are used for supplies to  Germany. About 50 percent of the arriving trucks cross the  Italian-Austrian border in Thoerl-Maglern. For some weeks, five  male and one female special officers, with the most modern  equipment and a drug sniffer dog, have been on duty around the  clock. Three members of the drug squad have had experience in  Burgenland, where the first Austrian special unit against drug  trafficking was established and is working successfully.    There will also be more controls on tourist traffic. "If  there is any suspicion, it might take hours to search a  passenger car," Gram said, "but in general it will been seen to  that there are no major obstructions of the tourist traffic."  Cooperation with the Italian customs and port authorities has  is going well, the drug specialists reported.</p>

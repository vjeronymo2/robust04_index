			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Fuller's law of film-making - Nigel Andrews meets a legendary American film director / Screen IN PARIS there is an advanced college for education in narrative film. It is called Sam Fuller's flat and it is tucked away near Les Halles. The only degree you need to get in is a degree of nerve. The 80-year-old director barks discouragement over the phone and is not noticeably gentler when you arrive armed with a box of his favourite Romeo Y Julieta cigars. Once there, though, you receive an earful about how films should be made: which is synonymous with how they used to be made in Fuller's day, the 1940s and 50s. America's most famous independent low-budget film-maker specialised in slam-bang classics like The Steel Helmet, Run Of The Arrow and Shock Corridor. Venerated today for their visceral power, they have given Fuller a passport to every film festival in the world; plus encomia like that in David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of The Cinema: 'No other American director has described American experience with such unremitting and participatory relish for its competitive corruption.' Though not always B-movies - many topped the bill - the films were made on a wing, a prayer and a tiny budget, usually in locations far from the studio's nannyish eye. For the 1955 House Of Bamboo, for example, the first big US movie shot in postwar Japan, Fuller used real bombs and bullets. "Oh-h-h YES]' - Fuller's eyes take on a tigerish blaze when I quiz him about this. 'In America, you unnerstand, you weren't allowed to use real explosives. But when I heard we could use them in Japan, A-A-A-HHH]' Fuller recounts the scene where his stars ran an explosion-dodging gauntlet. 'I asked, what does the range have to be for them to be safe from shrapnel? I was told 65 yards, so we kept to that. More or less. But it was a dangerous run.' Daring was one of Fuller's gifts to cinema. The other, a product of his pre-movie apprenticeships as a crime reporter and wartime marine, was his ability to see through smoke screens of hypocrisy and attitudinising to the core of a dramatic action. A film like Pickup On South Street (1953) is still shocking today because there is no scrim of piety. Hero Richard Widmark is a petty crook who spits on patriotism and refuses to surrender an accidentally stolen Communist microfilm. But he sees right from wrong more clearly than the Establishment bigwigs who bear down on him, much as their real-life cousins bore down on Fuller. 'J. Edgar Hoover came to Fox when we were making Pickup and he said to Zanuck, 'Look, Darryl, we don't like this line where the hero says, Don't wave that goddam flag at me.' And Zanuck said, 'You're right' and he turned to me and said, 'Just have him say, Don't wave that flag.' And Hoover was furious. He said, 'You know I don't mean that Darryl. I don't want him to say anything unpatriotic about the American flag.' So Zanuck said, 'That's his character in the film. Sam wrote the story, he knows the people he put in it. Are you guys out to censor character now?'' 'Now' was the McCarthy era and they were. In the early 1950s film-makers with even faintly Leftward leanings were pushed off the payroll. Fuller survived because he was never identifiably either left-wing or right-wing. He was a non-denominational enfant terrible whose moral outlook even today has a terrifying simplicity. Listen to his account of how he and fellow soldiers dealt with enemy confrontations in the war: you discern in embryo the no-nonsense ethics of Fuller's cinema. 'In war you're not supposed to shoot a POW, but we had a rule. If an enemy surrendered to us while he still had bullets in his gun, we took him in. But if he put his hands up after emptying his gun and killing your friends, we'd shoot him. Because, gee, isn't that cute? He's out of bullets and now he wants to make peace with us?' Slap-in-the-face morality vitalises Fuller's films. The cinema's answer to primitive man, he shocks us into thinking again. Whom should we root for in House Of Bamboo - the patriotic CIA informer (Stack) or the ex-army rebel who makes his own moral code (Robert Ryan)? Or in Pickup On South Street - the crook or the government cabal? 'In most movies,' insists Fuller, 'there's too much good guy/bad guy stuff. Doesn't interest me. Are you telling me the politician is more honest than the pickpocket? Or that the businessman who's cheating a little on his expenses is less crooked than the thief? 'We are so unimaginative that we have to have labels for everything. But when I was a crime reporter, what I learned was that the criminal has his own creed. Everything he does is right by the light of the life he has chosen. And only another criminal will understand that creed and code.' Likewise, it takes a special kind of sympathetic heretic to understand Fuller's inspired delinquencies of style: the soaring crane shots, the whirlwind montage sequences. No wonder today's gifted-loner directors like Wim Wenders or Aki Kaurismaki give Fuller guest roles in their movies. The walnut-faced veteran with the rasping voice has played cameos in The American Friend, The State Of Things and La Vie De Boheme. Fuller thrived in an age when independent directors were true heroes. He did his own thing regardless of prevailing caveats, whether related to moral shibboleths or new screen systems. 'When CinemaScope came in - 1953 with The Robe - the theatre owners got into a panic because they said there was no movement. With a screen that wide you can't move the camera too often. So they felt it was like watching a filmed play. 'But when we say 'movies', the movement isn't in the camera, it's in the characters. When two people lean towards each other to kiss, that's movement] You look at Brief Encounter - phenomenal] The violence there isn't John Wayne shooting up Indians in Monument Valley. It's the terrible flavour of guilt in two people being afraid to touch each other's hands.' For Fuller, cinema's elasticity of scope, encompassing the miniaturist and the majestic, makes it unique. 'It's number one in the arts. Hundreds of thousands of years from now they'll still be making movies. They'll be showing them to more people and more planets. It's the universal language. If I want to show Goya in action, or Liszt, or General Patton, I will see it and hear it and dramatise it on film. It's the only art form in the world in which all arts and all life are up there on the screen.' There will be a tribute to Sam Fuller at this month's Edinburgh Festival.</p>

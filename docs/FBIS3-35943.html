			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy by NHK Moscow correspondent Kazuo Kobayashi in  Moscow; date not given -- recorded; Zhirinovskiy and Kobayashi  speak in Russian, with Japanese subtitles provided for  Zhirinovskiy's statements]    [Text] [Kobayashi] Immediately after the elections, you  demanded the [posts of] important ministers such as defense,  security, finance, and foreign affairs, but you have received  nothing so far. Are not the voters disappointed now?    [Zhirinovskiy] I did not demand the posts that you have  mentioned. I meant that if we are asked to participate in the  government, we would specifically like to occupy the posts of  powerful ministers: defense, internal affairs, security,  foreign affairs, and finance, the key posts, but according to  the Constitution, it is the president who forms the government.  He is changing the lineup now, and it is even to our advantage  for the people to understand that even if the Democratic Russia  people [demorosy] and the reformers are removed, the government  figures under the leadership of Chernomyrdin will not hold out  for long. Thus, our ascent to power as a single-party government  will be unavoidable. All other possibilities have been  exhausted; the president addressed various political forces, and  the only possibility left is the party that has won the  elections -- the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. I think  that we will be able to participate in the government by this  fall.    [Kobayashi] What period of time do you think will be  necessary to implement your program?    [Zhirinovskiy] We think in terms of months; we do not talk  about 20 years or 15 years, we say: Had we formed our  government in January, living standards would have increased by  30 percent by summer, by 70 percent by the end of the year, and  twofold in a year or in a year and a half -- for every Russian  citizen.    [Kobayashi] But, excuse me, seeing the inflation rate today  and the state of the economy, I am afraid that raising living  standards by 30 percent by summer is quite impossible. What do  you think?    [Zhirinovskiy] We can solve the crisis by utilizing our  formula: resume military factories' complete production  immediately. Everything that they produce will be exported:  planes, automatic rifles, submarines. Thus, we will at once  earn $5 billion or $6 billion a year. Plus, we will sharply  change our foreign policy; we will withdraw from the embargoes  imposed on Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Libya. This will give us $15  billion. Thus, we will have $20 billion in 1994. We will also  end aid to the nearby foreign countries, which is about $5  billion more; 25 billion is a huge amount.    [Kobayashi] Do you not think that this promotes the arms  race, or the race in arms production?    [Zhirinovskiy] We choose the lesser evil. I said immediately  and openly that some of our neighbors will not like our new  policy, but we really will carry out our program, and the lives  of Russian citizens will improve. I am telling the truth. If  people vote for this program, I have the right to carry it out.  If I had not discussed but implemented it, I would be  misleading them. But I said this before the elections, and I  won on 12 December because of this, and I am saying it now. I  now have 64 deputies. To carry out the program, I need 264  deputies. Then I can carry it out.    [Kobayashi] After the elections, Western states treated you  with caution. What relations with the West do you envision?    [Zhirinovskiy] There is a certain amount of apprehension  because we are a new party. They have gotten used to  communists, and during the past two and a half years they have  gotten used to the democrats. But we are a new political force.  People do not fully know me, and sometimes my image is  distorted, and our program is distorted. Therefore, a kind of  fear of the new is invoked. But I openly say everywhere: There  is no need to fear us. We are against violence, against war.  All we support is peace, cooperation in the areas of the  economy and culture, and regional cooperation. We are against  superpowers. We support getting along well with our neighbors,  including Japan.    [Kobayashi] You have said that you support peace, but they  say that you mentioned a war with Japan to someone.    [Zhirinovskiy] We have concluded a peace treaty with  Germany, and we have concluded a peace treaty with everyone in  the world with whom we fought -- also with Finland. We have no  peace treaty only with Japan. I was simply stating the  situation as a lawyer: The lack of a peace treaty means that in  a certain, narrow sense, we are in a state of war with this  country. There is no third possibility. Can you name a third  possibility? No peace treaty was concluded, yet there is no  war. So what do we have? What do we have? We have a  hermaphrodite -- neither a man nor a woman -- but that is the  worst possibility. It is the same here. The relations between  Japan and Russia are like a hermaphrodite -- neither war nor  peace. Which is it? War or peace?    [Kobayashi] Why do you want to become president? What ideas  would you like to realize in this country?    [Zhirinovskiy] If I assume the post of head of state, we  will  fulfill our minimal program in several months and then move on  to a broader program of reforms in the country. Therefore, one  must assume the highest post -- the head of state. Because  today, all right, I am the head of the party of the  parliamentary majority, a winning party. The next step is  participation in the government, and finally, the post of head  of state.    [Kobayashi] Do you envision early presidential elections?    [Zhirinovskiy] Without a doubt. Elections will be held next  year, and maybe even this spring.    [Kobayashi] This spring?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes.    [Kobayashi] And through what means?    [Zhirinovskiy] Through the resignation of the president.    [Kobayashi] And for what reason? He has already expressed  his intention to continue until....    [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] May God give him health and let  him continue until the end, but the parliamentary elections were  also supposed to be held in two years' time. After all, the  parliament was elected for five years, but the elections were  held two years early. They also wanted to continue until the  end, until 1995, but they were made to go, they were forced to  go in 1993. The situation in the country is getting worse every  day, and it will force the president to form another government  while relying on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in  which case he may continue until the end of his term.    [Kobayashi] And you are ready....    [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] We are ready, and I have  informed him of this, him and Chernomyrdin. We are ready to  participate in the government, but we do not....    [Kobayashi, interrupting] And the elections?    [Zhirinovskiy] We are also ready for elections.    [Kobayashi] Some say that you demand money for interviews  with journalists. Does this mean that you have lost the support  of voters?    [Zhirinovskiy] Support from the voters is still coming in.  Thousands of money orders arrive every day at Moscow post  offices, but because a lot of correspondents want an interview,  in order to regulate this queue, I say that I am willing to give  interviews to those who pay for them. Very often there are  correspondents who say: Let us interview you, and we will pay  you. I do this to regulate the queue. If I started giving  interviews to everyone -- I do not have the time. So, because  you have propelled us toward the market, and because market  relations are a commodity-money-commodity thing, and because my  commodity is my working time; a person must rest, yet I am  working with you. So, you are paying for spending my working  time. I do not care if this is an interview, a book, or a  conversation. My working time is worth money. I must receive  compensation for my expenses for communicating with you, whoever  you might be. This does not apply to an interview as such; this  is my work, my working time.    [Kobayashi] You have mentioned that you will travel abroad  in  the next few days. Where and what for?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am leaving for Slovenia on Thursday [27  January], then for a 2-million-person rally in Belgrade, and  then the Poles are waiting for me. I am touring all the Slavic  states of East Europe. This is a burden for me, and they pay me  money to go there. My journey is paid for in full, and I get  30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 [currency not specified] to go to them  and meet them there. I will not go anywhere just like that, but  only when it is paid for in full. For example, I am going to go  to Turkey, and they are paying for a 15-person staff. This  includes a doctor, guards, press secretary -- 15 people. They  are paying for everything--15 people.    [Kobayashi] Excuse me, you mentioned a doctor. What kind of  illness do you have?    [Zhirinovskiy] I have no illness. Simply, there is the  doctor, the guards, and my coach. We exercise in the morning.  The doctor takes my pulse. I would not be taking my own pulse,  would I? Let him take my pulse and say: more effort, less  effort. Dietetic food. I do not eat just anything. I like  dietetic food: shrimp, octopus, boiled tongue, turtle soup, and  things like this. The doctor must check it, taste it, and then  I can partake of it. But me, I am healthy. What I mean is, my  daily schedule is under medical control.    [Kobayashi] You drink a lot.    [Zhirinovskiy] I drink one and a half liters of water a day.  I drink no alcohol and do not smoke. But I am supposed to  drink one and a half liters of water a day.</p>

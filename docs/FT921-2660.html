			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Brokers protest at lack of cover for Names: Allegations of inadequate backing for stop-loss protection A ROW has broken out at the Lloyd's of London insurance market over the refusal of many leading underwriters to back schemes providing stop-loss insurance - or personal reinsurance policies  - for Names, the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital. Brokers argue that the lack of realistically priced stop-loss insurance could undermine the market's capital base by leading many Names to leave. Last year 12,500 Names bought stop-loss insurance - which covers a band of losses beyond an amount usually equivalent to between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the amount of premiums underwritten by a Name. This year many underwriters have declined to back a scheme developed by two brokers, Harrison Stuart and Holman Wade, which is intended to provide cover for more than 8,000 Names. Underwriters, who are wary of high-risk business in view of the losses recently suffered by catastrophe syndicates, are demanding rate increases of up to 100 per cent and reducing cover by as much as 50 per cent, which makes stop-loss cover expensive and unattractive for Names. According to Mr John Harrison, chairman of Harrison Stuart, the insurers' attitude that stop-loss is 'not an underwriting proposition' is sending the 'worst possible signal' to Names. Mr Michael Wade, chairman of Holman Wade, wrote last November that in the absence of stop-loss insurance as many as 8,000 Names might leave Lloyd's. It said this would place the market under 'extreme and possibly unsustainable, pressure'. Senior brokers last week visited Mr Richard Hazell, a leading underwriter and deputy chairman of Lloyd's, to urge him to back the Harrison Stuart/Holman Wade scheme. Mr Jim Payne, a broker with EW Payne who is confident that the Holman Wade/Harrison Stuart scheme will be placed, said yesterday: 'People must get their act together.' Mr Harrison said: 'There is no doubt that the big brokers have the ability to concentrate the market's mind.' It emerged yesterday that syndicate 932, one of the biggest marine syndicates at Lloyd's with 3,102 Names, is to leave its 1989 year open. The syndicate, which is managed by Janson Green, has Been unable to assess its liabilities arising from exposure to US legal cases involving pollution and asbestosis with sufficient accuracy to be able to close its accounts. Mr Richard Youell, underwriter, said that the number of notifications of pollution claims rose by 10 per cent last year. The claims have emerged on policies written between 1950 and 1985. Some US courts have ruled recently in favour of insurers in pollution cases, supporting arguments that the cost of cleaning up a polluted site cannot be claimed on an insurance policy. However many of these verdicts have been appealed against, and according to Mr Youell there is still considerable uncertainty over the size of future claims. A decision to close the syndicate's accounts would have involved the establishment of large reserves and would have meant heavy losses for Names. Investigations by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee into an insurance broker are continuing. An employee allegedly 'skimmed' insurance premiums by charging his client more than the real cost of the premiums and retaining the difference.</p>

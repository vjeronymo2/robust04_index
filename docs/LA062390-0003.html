			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EGGS-ECUTION DATE;  </P> <P> RELEASE OF STERILE MEXFLIES MAY MATE THE PEST OUT OF EXISTENCE  </P> <P> El Cajon's first shipments of sterile Mexican fruit flies arrived Thursday for  five days of incubation before being released as the vanguard of an effort to  mate the pest out of existence locally.  </P> <P> Sixteen million sterile Mexflies will be released weekly in El Cajon through  the summer during the second phase of the state's eradication effort.  </P> <P> Three aerial sprayings of malathion during the past month were designed to kill  most of the fertile wild flies, and the steriles are supposed to take care of  the rest within two to three generations.  </P> <P> The first release is scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The sterile flies are just as important as the spraying and need to be just as  effective to eradicate this pest," said Bill Routhier, area manager of the  California Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Two shipments of pupae -- the fly's third growth stage -- arrived Thursday at  the state's Mexfly headquarters in Santee, including one batch that had been  scheduled to arrive late Wednesday. Each shipment has 4 million pupae.  </P> <P> Mexfly officials were irritated that the shipment was bumped from a Continental  Airlines flight that ran out of luggage space, but the delay caused only minor  damage to the pupae and will have no significant effect on the overall  eradication effort, said John Worley, director of the Mexican Fruit Fly Rearing  Facility near Mission, Tex., the only place in the world that raises sterile  Mexflies.  </P> <P> About 10% of each batch never reach sexual maturity for a variety of reasons,  but the delay probably ruined another 10% of the pupae, Worley said.  </P> <P> Any interruption of the lab-raised flies' carefully controlled growth stages  increases their mortality rate and diminishes the adult insects' flying  ability, sexual aggressiveness and life span, Worley said.  </P> <P> Mexfly officials chastised the airline for leaving the first shipment behind  and have decided to pay a priority shipping cost of $20 per 50 pounds of pupae  to ensure that no more batches are delayed, Worley said.  </P> <P> Several pupae from each shipment are placed in small cages to measure the  percentage of pupae that emerge into adults, the rate of emergence and the  overall physical quality of the adult flies, Routhier said.  </P> <P> The first shipments of pupae -- irradiated and dyed orange to distinguish the  steriles from wild flies -- were placed in paper bags and small cardboard  buckets where they will incubate for five days in one of the many mobile  trailers that make up the temporary Mexfly headquarters near Gillespie Field.  </P> <P> After hatching, the adult flies will feed briefly on a gelatinous mixture of  sugar and yeast in the buckets. They will be released from trucks moving slowly  through the infested areas, Tuesdays through Fridays.  </P> <P> Although more than 200 million flies will be released in El Cajon during the  summer, they will pose little problem for local residents and pets, Worley  said. The flies are not aggressive and do not bite but might be attracted by  the strong odor of wet paint and the shade of carports to escape the summer  heat, he added.  </P> <P> Sixteen million pupae -- or 1 million per square infested mile per week -- are  scheduled to arrive weekly in Santee. Trapping has been intensified to monitor  the success of the sterile mating program.  </P> <P> In Compton, officials released the first batch of sterile flies Tuesday, where  14 square miles were found to be infested with the Mexfly this spring.  </P> <P> Mexflies, natives of northern Mexico, destroy citrus by laying eggs in the  fruit. The eggs develop into larvae, which feed inside the fruit before  crawling out to burrow into the ground and develop into mature flies.  </P> <P> They are prolific breeders during their typical four- to six-week life span.  Females are capable of laying 1,000 to 2,000 eggs.  </P> <P> Each shipment of sterile flies contains males and females, but the success of  the eradication program is based primarily on the sterile males numerically  overwhelming the wild females so only non-viable eggs are laid.  </P> <P> Mexflies prefer grapefruit but also lay eggs in other types of citrus.  </P></p>

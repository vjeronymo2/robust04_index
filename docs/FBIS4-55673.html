			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Novak Vulic: "From Loser to Accomplice"] </F>   [Excerpts] The merchant navy is in agony! We reported  this almost eight months ago, yet the spasm and fear of losing  the fleet is increasingly great. The immense effort of the  Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidba companies and the state  to improve the position of the shipping trade with loans  essentially boils down to buying time. Chances of the fleet  surviving until the end of the year are realistic only if the  government decision on a $30 million loan is implemented. In  addition to the loan, saving the installations that are of  strategic interest for Montenegro (and therefore, for the  federal state) also call for the immediate end of the embargo.  Since chances for a change of policy are slim, there remains  only a glimmer of hope that perhaps one day at least a part of  the vessels of the current fleet will sail under our flag.    On the eve of the second anniversary of UN Security Council  Resolution 820, the Montengrin fleet is poorer by four vessels,  while the threat of a mortgage and auction is looming over the  bow of the remaining 37. Ships age faster than people, they  diminish in value, sailing ability, and the ability for equal  market competition. Debts, on the other hand, like all  misfortunes, progressively multiply and oppress. It was warned  long before the first results of the international isolation  were apparent that a moored boat was the most expensive for its  owner. It was also warned that a loss of sailors would ensure.  And that the moorings in the Bar harbor and the docks of the  Bijela Shipyard were already too quiet, even without boats. In  the course of last year, the amount of goods that passed through  the "southern gates of the Balkans" corresponded to the amount  that in normal circumstances is unloaded in a matter of 15 days.  For the sake of not completely forgetting work after the  overhaul of the Sumadija [name of vessel], in Bijela nowadays  they keep themselves busy with occasional interventions on  smaller vessels. The majority of employees are on compulsory  leave. Since there is no way of charging fees for services  rendered, the shipyard regularly applies for assistance with  payment of the minimal salaries. All development programs have  been postponed and are already covered with a thick layer of  dust. [passage omitted]  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  The Effect of the Sanctions </H5>   Up until the sanctions, the maritime economy contributed to  a  fifth of the foreign currency revenue in the republic.    The information on losses accrued under sanctions still  treats results achieved after surveying the situation at the end  of October as current. The amount involved is $217 million, but  only for maritime companies. However, we need at least to add  to this the $60,000 for daily maintenance of vessels and loans  from domestic sources, which also need to be repaid.    In line with a decision of the Montenegrin and Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia's governments, by the end of October and  on various bases, the maritime economy was granted almost $15  million.    It is interesting, for example, that former Montenegrin  companies Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidbva (in the  meantime they changed their flags, reregistered, and changed  their mooring port), in addition to calculating losses on  freight which amounted to almost $100 million, also registered  and calculated losses incurred by devaluation of property. The  result can only surprise the uninformed. By the end of October  1993, it surpassed $35 million. This will rapidly increase,  because after two years of being moored, vessels are more ruined  than if they had been in use for five years.</p>

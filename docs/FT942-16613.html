			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Public rues a lost chance The Japanese public, like a kabuki audience moved by a familiar plot, found their disappointment at Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation yesterday tempered by a sense of the inevitable. 'It is regrettable,' said one man in Kumamoto, Mr Hosokawa's home prefecture. 'But it can't be helped since, for a prime minister, integrity is crucial.' To a public that had become accustomed to the whims of their leader, the sudden change of mind by Mr Hosokawa, who had spent a good part of the week denying he would resign, appeared perfectly in character. Mr Hosokawa's approach to government, criticised by his enemies as lightweight and irresponsible, still had its fans. Many citizens could not hide their regret; they had hoped he would change not just the substance of Japanese politics but its style as well. 'It is very disappointing,' said Mr Eiji Hirabayashi, a businessman in Tokyo. 'His policies were good, his image was good and, compared with his predecessors, he was relatively clean.' There was also sympathy for the man whose public rating, even in the midst of scandal, remained high. But that popularity could not help Mr Hosokawa overcome his inability to run the country. 'As a person he is good, but I would have preferred a more effective leader,' Mr Hirabayashi said. Business leaders were more scathing. Many vented their frustration and criticism not at Mr Hosokawa alone but at the entire government. 'It is imperative that the government gets its act together to prevent any further delay in the critical areas of deregulation and economic stimulus,' Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, said. 'We can only (insist) that the Japanese government quickly composes itself and starts acting to address responsibly the needs of the country and the international community during this crucial period.' Many people nevertheless give Mr Hosokawa credit for starting to address those very needs. Tainted though he was by the shadow of scandal, the youthful prime minister photographed walking with US President Bill Clinton during last year's Apec conference in Seattle is likely to be remembered as the man who initiated much-needed change in Japan.</p>

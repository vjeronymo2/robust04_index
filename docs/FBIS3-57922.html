Late Wednesday  morning, the Kurds -- who met yesterday with the European  commissioner responsible for external relations -- are due to  hold talks with members of the European Parliament, then give a  news conference. Afterward, without having held a  demonstration, they are scheduled to leave Belgian territory.  Some already left yesterday, though.    Louis Tobback was satisfied with this outcome: "I listened  to the explanations and demands of the Kurdish representatives  here in Brussels. These questions fall under the scope of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I personally am responsible for  public order. I am happy we have found some common ground, and  I have no reason to fear that the agreements we reached will not  be respected."    Otherwise, however, the interior minister stuck to his  previous statements. From his point of view, according to the  information gathered by the Gendarmerie and the National  Security Service, there are serious reasons to believe that the  events in Brussels are not spontaneous. The presence of several  agitators, including the Turkish nationalist movement called  Grey Wolves, had been established. Nonetheless, Louis Tobback  says the information at his disposal calls for discretion, but  he is prepared to pass it on to Parliament.    According to our sources, the Gendarmerie and National  Security Service think they noticed "personnel" with close links  to the Turkish Embassy (or its consulates) at the riot sites.  These persons supposedly "guided" the crowds, sometimes pushing  them onto the streets, sometimes persuading them to return home.  On the Kurdish side, as Louis Tobback confirmed, the police  also noticed a strong presence of members of extreme left-wing  Belgian groups.    Furthermore, it would seem that in 1993, and to an even  greater extent in 1992, the famous Grey Wolves actually received  subsidies from both the cultural administration and the  administration of social affairs of the French-speaking  Community! This fact was confirmed Tuesday by the cabinets of  Minister Robert Collignon and Minister Magda De Galan, who at  the time were in charge of granting the subsidy in question.  The reaction of a dumbfounded Louis Tobback was as follows:  "Surely it is not true? In the French-speaking community?  Ah!" Then, in a humorous tone, he said: "Because the national  government would not do such a thing."    Admittedly, the subsidy awarded in 1993 was virtually  symbolic: 90,000 Belgian francs [BFr], transferred to the  Turkish Cultural Association, a nonprofit association located in  Rue Josaphat. This association represents the orthodox wing of  the Grey Wolves, which has always remained faithful to Colonel  Alparslan Turkes. However, the subsidy the year before was at  least double this amount.    This BFr90,000 subsidy in 1993 was the subject of veritable  reports -- all the more so since it was called into question  when the French-speaking community learned, in the course of an  inspection, that the promised work had not been carried out  properly. As a result, the association had to complete work on  a grammar school, as well as work involving training and  integration. The De Galan cabinet confirmed that the  integration appeared not to have taken place as it should have  according to the concern of the association. So why was it not  simply withdrawn? Because the inspectors were supposedly  uncertain that the association was a front for the Grey Wolves  -- even though this is a fact of which the members of the  association make no secret.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia-Herzegovina </F> Ambassador to the UN, by Lidia Cerni; place and date not given:  "I Do Not Believe in Just Peace"]    [Text] If I had to single out the person with whom I most  enjoyed talking during my professional career while at the same  time having the biggest technical problems, then this would  definitely be Muhamed Sacirbey, the young (born in Sarajevo  1956) Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to the UN. Although, as he  says himself, "he speaks Bosnian with more difficulty than he  should have and his thoughts are always running ahead" he asked  me to forgive him if he used any English words in the interview.  His very successful two-year diplomatic career speaks of him  personally and professionally more than any biography. Sacirbey  graduated from law school in 1980 and a year later finished the  Columbia Business School. Before his diplomatic assignment he  worked as a very successful lawyer in a U.S. company  specializing in international law. What probably predetermined  Sacirbey for the diplomatic post in America were his manner,  diplomatic skill, perfect English, and feeling for the right  time and place.    [Cerni] The latest U.S. Congress resolution about the  lifting of the arms embargo for the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government has fully demonstrated the duplicity of the U.S.  policy. The administration with the exception of verbal  statements about the need to lift the unjust embargo has not  done much so far while the Senate and the Congress have been  faced for the second time with the decision whether or not to  lift the embargo. How do you assess the latest resolution?    [Sacirbey] I believe that this is an important political and  also symbolic decision. It is much more important than the  actual implications on the battlefield. This resolution places  a certain pressure on Europe and Russia, and also on Serbia, to  reach a sort of peace settlement. I believe that some of the  commentaries in Europe and even in the U.S. administration that  the Congress resolution is not the right way are wrong. We in  Bosnia care about peace and not war, as some think, wrongly  anticipating our moves if the arms embargo were lifted. We  would like to create a sort of equilibrium and make the peace  talks proceed. Neither Europe nor America were willing to  provide us with the necessary balance of power and the U.S.  Congress has demonstrated a better understanding of the Bosnian  problem than the U.S. administration. This is not merely a  problem of "the victim of the Serbian aggression" which has a  legitimate right to self-defense but a problem of principles and  tactical conceptions, so to speak. This is the equilibrium of  which I speak. We care a lot about peace, however, a peace that  can last.    [Cerni] Russia, some European countries, and Canada are  opposed to the unilateral U.S. lifting of arms embargo, and even  President Clinton, although the decision is binding, can pass a  veto. What will happen if he does so?    [Sacirbey] President Clinton must accept the consequences of  this resolution because it is binding. I believe that he will  also find it difficult to use his veto because this resolution  is linked to a whole "package" of documents that give money for  the U.S. defense and the Pentagon. I understand that numerous  European countries, and even Canada, are not thrilled with the  latest resolution because their soldiers are deployed in Bosnia.  Many in the West, who have been "pushing" for "peace  agreements" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have with their  stance in a way recognized the Serbian conquests in Bosnia and  the results of a genocide, they have acknowledged that Serbia is  the most powerful and the mightiest in the former Yugoslavia.  The resolution could now shake up this concept and the victim  of the Serbian aggression could finally get the opportunity to  achieve the same position on the ground. This would be a direct  threat to Serbian military predominance in this war.    [Cerni] If America lifts the arms embargo for Bosnia  unilaterally then could this give impetus to consultations and  talks in the UN Security Council about the passing of a similar  decision?    [Sacirbey] This is a truly interesting question. I have  talked to numerous people in America and the Security Council  these days and the fact is that Americans do not have a  determined plan, that is to say, strategy in this situation yet.  I believe that they should put pressure on their friends and  allies in the world to create a new strategy on  Bosnia-Herzegovina that would penalize the Serbian aggression  and the genocide more. This means that they would have to  deploy bigger forces, for example through NATO or the systems of  the UN Security Council, and truly lift the embargo. The worst  thing that can happen is that the U.S. Congress would work in  one direction and the U.S. administration in another. This  would have direct consequences on the UN Security Council.    [Cerni] Many who are opposed to the lifting of the arms  embargo claim that you are receiving arms from your Muslim  friends in the world despite the embargo.    [Sacirbey] The lifting of the embargo would contribute to a  peaceful solution for Bosnia and not to war. The peace process  is a lengthy process and for the first time it gives the victim  the right to self-defense. On the other hand, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government was always of the opinion that the  embargo imposed on it was unlawful and not binding for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we have, thus, so far been forced to  seek aid from anyone who wanted to help us. These are our  friends and one cannot demand from any country in the world that  has been the victim of aggression not to defend itself. This is  stipulated in Article 51 of the UN. Naturally, we have accepted  the aid that was offered to us for the defense of our country.  Many would like to portray us as an Islamic country that has  linked itself with the Islamic countries worldwide, which is not  true. We are receiving aid and political support from various  different countries. One should actually look where Serbia is  getting its aid from. There are numerous gaps in the embargo  against Serbia, it is smuggling oil, arms, and all other  produce. On the other hand, the countries that speak most  feverishly against the so-called Islamic danger in this region  most frequently help the Fascist regime in Belgrade. However,  this fact sheds a light on something else. Namely, a new  alliance of the former communists and the neo-fascists is being  forged in the former Communist Europe. This is connected to a  desire to preserve the old "regimes," their infrastructure, and  their armies. In the new system of free exchange of goods and  democracy there is no need for Russia or Serbia to have such big  armies and so many arms, especially if one bears in mind their  "economic strength."    [Cerni] You have numerous friends among the Jews and the  Americans and many ascribe the success of the latest Congress  resolution to the powerful lobbying of the  Muslim-Jewish-American circles. How big is this influence in  fact?    [Sacirbey] The main man behind this Congress resolution is  Senator Bob Dole. There is a Croat woman, a great friend of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, working in his office. The truth is that we  have some influence, however, in general the Muslims have not  had too great an influence on the creation of U.S. policy.  However, the Jews have a huge influence in America and we are  very grateful to them for everything that they have done so that  this resolution could see the light of day.    [Cerni] Let us return to Bosnia. What are your conclusions  about the observation of the four-week cease-fire that has  recently been agreed in Geneva?    [Sacirbey] Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about this  because I do not have the information that is currently going on  in the military sphere. However, it is important to emphasize  that I personally was very satisfied with the talks with the  contact group and [UN envoy] Mr. Akashi, and especially  satisfied with the cooperation of the Croats and the Bosniaks in  these talks. This has all led to a certain strengthening of our  position in the peace talks. The talks about a political  solution with the contact group are the most important as  without them no concept of cease-fire is possible. There must  be a powerful connection between our political talks here in  Bosnia and the international factors, especially the contact  group and Mr. Akashi.    [Cerni] Can you comment on the scope of present talks of the  warring sides with the contact group. I am particularly  interested in the maps of division and the issue of the Serbian  corridor through the Bosnian Sava Basin.    [Sacirbey] I believe that it is too soon to discuss such  issues because the contact group has not yet finished its job. I  think that the issue of the so-called gray zones is very  important. This is an opportunity to find a solution for the  refugees and their permanent return to their homes. This is not  merely a question of the Muslim refugees but also of the Croats  who have escaped from the Serbian terror in Bosnia to Croatia.  Unfortunately, it is forgotten that numerous Croats have been  the victims of ethnic cleansing and genocide. We believe that  these people should not seek permanent shelter in Croatia but  should return to their homes. For this reason the concept of  the gray zones can be applied in those regions where the Croats  and the Muslims constituted the majority before the war, these  are the towns such as Prijedor, Visegrad, Zvornik, and so forth.    [Cerni] What do you think about the scope of the  Croatian-Bosniak Federation, that is to say, the results of the  Washington agreement? How do you view the visit of [Croatian]  President Tudjman in Sarajevo?    [Sacirbey] I am satisfied with the results so far and it  seems that they are improving increasingly. The most important  thing is that there is peace, that the people are not dying.  However, we must go further. Some elements, especially in  Herzegovina, are not exactly thrilled with this peace and we  should, therefore, appease all the sides so that this peace may  live. I am satisfied with the cooperation of Zagreb and  Sarajevo so far, even though the cooperation in the Federation  itself is proceeding somewhat slowly.    [Cerni] Finally, do you believe in a just peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina or can the term of a just peace be viewed  only philosophically. Bearing in mind the situation on the  field -- the Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnian territory and in  the negotiations with the contact group 51 versus 49 percent to  the advantage of the Federation are being offered -- do you  believe in a just peace after this war?    [Sacirbey] The concept of the so-called just peace can be  accomplished only with difficulty in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this  moment. However, we cannot agree to a concept that would offer  less than a lasting peace, that is to say, what we call "a just  and lasting peace and such a country." Just peace would be if  the Chetnik forces were definitively defeated. For as long as  the Serbs are behind the negotiating table I find it difficult  to speak about it. We must seek peace in which  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to constitute itself as a  country that will be fully functional and will be a country in  the true sense of this word. We are aspiring toward a country  that will reintegrate itself in the international processes like  all other countries that have emerged from the inferno of  Yugoslavia's disintegration. For this reason I am glad about  the normalization of the relations in the Croat-Bosniak  federation because the people are slowly returning to their  homes. However, for as long as [republic of Srpska president]  Karadzic and [republic of Srpska army commander] Mladic lead the  Bosnian Serbs it will be difficult to achieve a just peace.  They are the chief creators of this war and they must be held  accountable for it. In its efforts, Europe is looking more for  a realistic than a just peace in Bosnia. If we look for a  realistic peace, then this must contain at least a certain  degree of fairness and above all "a concept of the functioning  of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina." We can never agree to the  reality if Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a crippled country.</p>

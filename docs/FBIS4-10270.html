			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gonzalo Marroquin] </F>   [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 9 Apr (AFP) -- A wave of violence  in Guatemala, which intensified over the past few weeks, has  forced President Ramiro De Leon Carpio to request intervention  by the Army, which will "take to the streets" to support the  police as part of a government security plan.    Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez today confirmed to  AFP that the Army is willing to participate in the struggle  against violence, "which has surpassed the limits of normalcy,"  and he explained that a rapid deployment platoon will be created  to support the National Police.    Enriquez and Government Minister Danilo Parinello yesterday  addressed Congress to explain the measures that will be  implemented to counteract the wave of violence. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dowding &amp; Mills declines 23% to Pounds 6.5m Dowding &amp; Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair group, blamed the recession for a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.53m for the year to June 30. Mr Jim Cole, chief executive, said yesterday he was 'disappointed' that this was the second year the recession had seriously affected trading and profitability. Turnover slipped by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 74.7m (Pounds 79.6m) and operating profits fell to Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 9.01m), but gross margins were maintained. After allowing for tax and an extraordinary Pounds 633,000 charge related to the cost of the group's failed bid for Torday &amp; Carlisle, attributable profits fell to Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 5.46m). Dowding and Mills retains an 8.7 per cent stake in Torday. Earnings per share slipped to 3.12p (4.09p) but the proposed final dividend is increased to 1.58p (1.52p) for a total of 2.5p (2.4p). Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said business remained tough 'and there is no sign yet of any improvement or when it will occur'.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROSPECT OF NBA, NHL IN S.D. STILL UNCERTAIN;  </P> <P> COMPETITION FROM OTHER CITIES, LACK OF ARENA ARE PART OF OBSTACLES FACING  MILLIONAIRE COOPER  </P> <P> Early this year, a little-known La Jolla multimillionaire named H. G. (Harry)  Cooper seized the attention of the financial, political and sports communities  of San Diego with the public announcement of his vision: a 22,900-seat,  $120-million, privately funded sports palace that soon would lure the National  Basketball Assn. and the National Hockey League here.  </P> <P> In the four months since the announcement, the NHL and, to a lesser extent, the  NBA have taken stock of his moves. Cooper's people have been studying the  written and unwritten rules for expansion or relocation of franchises in the  two leagues.  </P> <P> San Diego's chances of getting a professional hockey or basketball team are  uncertain at best. Though there appears to be a slim possibility of landing an  NHL franchise, the NBA seems a far less likely prospect.  </P> <P> "If I had Harry Cooper's kind of money, I'd retire and live happily," said Vin  Ciruzzi, president of the Sports Arena and a supporter of Cooper's efforts.  "But, if his plans don't go through, it won't be because he didn't try."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Relations Disaster  </P> <P> Ciruzzi has spent five years trying to repair the public relations disaster  caused by Sports Arena tenant wars and the loss to Los Angeles of the NBA's  Clippers on May 15, 1984.  </P> <P> He met with the NHL's Board of Governors last December and visited privately  with John Ziegler, the league's president.  </P> <P> The meeting was set up by Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, who would love  to see an NHL franchise in San Diego. It would cut down the travel grind for  his players and create an instant geographical rivalry.  </P> <P> "The NHL in San Diego has good potential," McNall said. "But there are a lot of  factors involved. A lot will depend on the strength of the offer. The one thing  the league does not want to do is expand into a city that may be a problem  area."  </P> <P> At its April meetings, Ziegler announced plans for expansion. He didn't say  when or where or how many teams the 21-franchise NHL figures to add. But the  smart money says the league will add either three or four when its Board of  Governors meets this December.  </P> <P> One of the things the board is waiting to review is a report from the NHL's  Franchise and Market Analysis Committee, of which McNall is a member.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Cities Lead the Pack  </P> <P> At least nine cities have expressed interest in obtaining an expansion  franchise. Milwaukee and Hamilton, Ont., are well ahead of a second tier of  cities -- including San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle -- in the  battle for expansion grants.  </P> <P> Even more than Hamilton, Milwaukee has everything going for it: an on-line new  arena, local ownership, lots of money and, in point man Lloyd Pettit, a guy  with longtime NHL contacts.  </P> <P> By contrast, San Diego's arena is still a blueprint. Its ownership hasn't been  identified, though Cooper says a group led by "somebody with semi-deep pockets  who we all know in San Diego" will step forth in the next 30 days.  </P> <P> An NHL expansion franchise in San Diego would almost certainly have to play its  first year or two in the existing, less-desirable Sports Arena, which seats  13,600 for hockey.  </P> <P> The NHL's average attendance was up to 87% of capacity this year, from the  1987-1988 season, when its average of 14,425 per game represented 86% of  capacity.  </P> <P> A remote alternative is convincing an existing NHL franchise to move to San  Diego. But, says Jerry Helper, the league's director of information: "We have  made every effort to dissuade people from relocating. Only under the direst of  circumstances do we want to do that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticized Arena  </P> <P> When Cooper, 56, first announced plans to simultaneously buy the Sports Arena  lease and set about finding a site for his "palace" -- which would be designed  by architect Gino Rossetti and patterned after the Palace in Auburn Hills,  Mich., where the Detroit Pistons play -- he denigrated the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "This might sound silly," Cooper said in February, "but it doesn't have a  winning feel to it. You could move a successful team like the Lakers into that  place, and the next year they'd be losers."  </P> <P> That statement didn't sit well with the local politicians Cooper was apparently  bypassing in his one-man crusade to bring more professional sports to San  Diego. Nor was it encouraging to the dogged Ciruzzi, who had spent five years  trying to eradicate animosities left behind by predecessor Peter Graham and  Clipper owner Donald Sterling, who moved the NBA from here to the Los Angeles  Sports Arena.  </P> <P> By last week, Cooper had done an about-face. Sort of.  </P> <P> "If you walk through the Sports Arena," he said, "it's clean. It's more than  just fresh paint. Three million dollars in the past three years have been put  into that place."  </P> <P> But moments later he was talking about the dangers of owning the company that  runs the Sports Arena in the infant years of the hoped-for NHL team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Just Buying a Lease  </P> <P> "I'm dealing with a company (San Diego Entertainment Inc., which owned the  Sports Arena lease) that has had a history of people having trouble that have  dealt with it. So I've been very cautious about it. You're buying a company  that can have gorillas behind every door. It's not like you're just buying that  lease."  </P> <P> Cooper says that, once San Diego gains an NHL franchise, it will be the green  light investors need to break ground for his sports palace. Then, it's just a  matter of time. The Pistons were playing in Auburn Hills 26 months after ground  was broken there.  </P> <P> "I think we have a good chance of a hockey team playing in the Sports Arena by  1991," Cooper said.  </P> <P> By most accounts, that's optimistic, but there have been hints that it is  possible.  </P> <P> Cooper recently brought former Montreal Coach Scotty Bowman into San Diego as a  consultant. Bowman, the winningest coach in NHL history, professed to be  impressed with Cooper and his business partner, Richard Esquinas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Secret Formula  </P> <P> "I didn't realize they had a master plan here," Bowman told the San Diego  Tribune. "And, from what I've seen, it's going to be very tough for the league  to turn them down.  </P> <P> "I can't give them a secret formula, but if they're aggressive, and they're  dedicated, they'll succeed. From what I've seen, this group really wants an NHL  franchise and will go to any end to get one."  </P> <P> The history of professional hockey in San Diego is strong. From 1966 to 1979,  three teams -- the Mariners of the World Hockey Assn., the Gulls of the Western  Hockey League and the Hawks of the Pacific Hockey League -- all thrived by  sub-NHL standards. Average attendance ranged from 5,500 to 8,000. What failed  were the leagues in which the teams played, not the local support for the  teams.  </P> <P> Ciruzzi says many of the NHL people he has talked to remember how well San  Diego supported minor league hockey. One is Jim Rutherford, a former NHL goalie  and now director of hockey operations for Compuware, a Detroit-based computer  software company. Compuware's publicly expressed desire is to own an NHL  franchise. The company is waiting to see where the NHL expands before it swoops  in and makes any purchase offers.  </P> <P> But, Rutherford told The Times, "If San Diego was one of those cities, we'd  definitely be interested."  </P> <P> Said Ciruzzi: "He who comes up with the biggest bucks is going to get the  team."  </P> <P> The late Ray Kroc owned the Mariners for a short time. But he got out when the  team was caught in the escalating salary war between the NHL and the WHA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough Travel Schedule  </P> <P> In 1981, Ron Ingram, who coached both the Mariners and the Hawks, said, "If Ray  Kroc had kept the team, I think San Diego would be in the NHL right now."  </P> <P> Esquinas, 33, sees new reasons why the NHL belongs in San Diego. He cites what  Wayne Gretzky has done for the Kings and hockey in the United States. He points  to a Kings travel schedule that is 50 tougher "than for other teams."  </P> <P> "They (the NHL) owe Bruce (McNall) an expansion team" in Southern California,  Esquinas said flatly.  </P> <P> Cooper said that more than 600,000 former Canadian residents live in Southern  California.  </P> <P> "But winning is the key," said Brad Buetow, former hockey coach at United  States International University and now coach at Colorado College. USIU last  year folded its program, which had been making great strides at the NCAA  Division I level, because of budget problems, the same day Buetow announced his  resignation.  </P> <P> "San Diego doesn't have a hockey tradition," he said. "But it's a great sports  town."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Announcement Alienated Some  </P> <P> It's also a town where the sports establishment has been firmly in place for a  long time. And that's why the sudden flurry caused by Cooper's surprise  announcement alienated certain members of that establishment.  </P> <P> "I don't agree with the way Cooper started," local sports promoter Irv Grossman  said at the time. "You don't call a press conference, turn on a flashlight,  then go out and begin gathering information. You get the facts first."  </P> <P> Said Cooper: "We didn't intend to make that kind of splash. I didn't know that  us buying the Sports Arena (lease) would be news."  </P> <P> "We didn't design the splash," Esquinas said. "We just wanted to make an  announcement."  </P> <P> "We understand now we have to be a little more quiet about all this, and that  we have to have substance to it," Cooper said. "We threw it out and made it  look like it was a little premature."  </P> <P> There was nothing premature about Cooper's decision to found General Computing  in 1965. He sold the company at a huge profit several years later. It is a  corporation that today boasts annual sales of more than $840 million.  </P> <P> Esquinas, a 1978 graduate of Ohio State University who has worked in the  direct-mail marketing industry, is Cooper's partner (33%) in the arena venture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Regrets  </P> <P> "We don't regret anything we did," Esquinas said. "But now we're walking a  little more cautious. We're trying to be a little more methodical and  thorough."  </P> <P> The NHL and potential investors are watching closely.  </P> <P> "The investors want to know if there is support from the mayor, the City  Council and the local sports associations," Ciruzzi said. "If not, why should  they put their money at risk?  </P> <P> "The city has to show it wants a franchise. How do you think the league people  react when they read that city won't support it? That the press won't support  it? We've just got to get ourselves in a positive mind set.  </P> <P> "It's getting down to the Cooper organization and the city working together,"  Ciruzzi said. "Without those seats (the new arena) in escrow, the NHL and the  NBA will look askance at their proposal. The crucial thing for both leagues  will be the commitment that the new arena is coming on line."  </P> <P> Somebody has to budge first. Cooper says ground breaking will start once San  Diego gets a franchise. Ciruzzi says the NHL and the NBA want ground broken  before committing themselves to a franchise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Control Sought  </P> <P> Much will depend on the financing, the organization and the reputation of the  leader of the local hockey group Cooper insists is about to surface.  </P> <P> "He doesn't want to be the deep-pocket owner even though he's pretty  deep-pocket," Cooper said. "But he wants to see a team here, and he's willing  to head it up. He's also willing to turn it over to anyone else that steps up  that would like to take majority ownership."  </P> <P> Could that mean Compuware?  </P> <P> "We're trying to keep as much of the ownership local as possible," Cooper said.  "Whether or not we accomplish that is another thing. Local ownership keeps the  community involved and the team rooted."  </P> <P> Local ownership, say most NHL experts, will also have to be prepared to lose $5  million a year for the first five years.  </P> <P> Cooper hates to hear that kind of talk. He is a gentle man who speaks in the  easy rhythms of his native Mississippi. And he recently implored a reporter to  accentuate the positive things he's trying to accomplish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not an Avid Sports Fan  </P> <P> "Hopefully, by December we will have presented to the NHL a very strong story  about San Diego," Esquinas said. "And hopefully we will have the financing in  order for the team and the story about the financing and plans for the arena to  take to the NHL. You've got to have an arena that's as nice as many and nicer  than a lot of the NHL houses across the league."  </P> <P> Cooper is not particularly athletic or an especially avid sports fan. He has  lived quietly in La Jolla since the early '70s. But he has come out of  semi-retirement for this project.  </P> <P> He finds himself going to meetings early in the morning for the first time in  years. And he says he is perfectly willing to accommodate the city's wishes for  a downtown arena if that's what the city wants. Originally he wanted it on a  38-acre tract he owns in Sorrento Valley's Golden Triangle.  </P> <P> "I want to go where the energy is," he said. "This (San Diego) is home for me."  </P></p>

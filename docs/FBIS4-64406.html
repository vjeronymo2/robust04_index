			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ricardo de Querol] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Spain seems to favor new cuts in  unemployment benefits on grounds that in amount and duration  they are currently still "relatively generous in Spain, despite  the fact we have the highest unemployment in the European Union."    A study of protective coverage for the jobless published in  the central bank's most recent economic bulletin says "Spain's  welfare benefits are among the highest in the European  Community."    The report says that continuing with the present system of  benefits "will not eliminate certain general and inherent  problems," including the apparent indifference of unemployed  Spaniards to finding a job, the onerous fiscal burden the  situation imposes on the state, and the high cost to employers  of personnel-related overhead. All these tendencies seem to  become more pronounced in times of recession, says the bank,  which is headed by Luis Angel Rojo.    The central bank points out that due to a substantial  augmentation of protective coverage during the last years of the  economic boom, economic authorities were forced to introduce  cutbacks later on.    Without expressly arguing for new cuts, the article makes  clear that those already made are not enough to dispel  uncertainties about the future.    In 1992, a decree-law known as the "decretazo" reduced  unemployment payments from 80 to 70 percent of prior wage level,  at the same time as it shortened maximum duration of payments  from one-half to one-third of the time that the worker had been  contributing to the unemployment insurance system.    Just three months ago, the 1994 budget companion measures  included a reduction of the minimum unemployment benefit to 70  percent of minimum wage for jobless persons without dependents,  whereas earlier the floor had been set at 100 percent.    Moreover, beginning this year, jobless persons have been  required to contribute to Social Security [out of their  unemployment benefits] and pay income tax on those subventions.    But the Bank of Spain argues that unemployment benefits in  Spain are still too generous.    "The problem lies in having a level of protection that  covers  the contingency of unemployment without downward pressures to  contain costs. In the case of Spain, it does not appear that  this critical factor of cost containment has been realized, and  maintaining the system is very costly" in this respect, the  report asserts.    "The high level of unemployment makes it all the more  difficult to efficiently manage available resources--inadequate  as they usually are--and to keep INEM [National Employment  Institute] running on a sound financial basis," the report  continues.    In the central bank's opinion, the high ratio of jobless to  workers "presupposes substantial financing from sources external  to the system itself."    The report compares unemployment protection in Spain with  the  rest of the European Union, a comparison that shows systems vary  substantially from one country to another.    For example, a head of family in Holland may collect as much  as 99 percent of his previous salary, and in Denmark up to 90  percent. On the other hand, in Greece the figure is 40 percent  and in Ireland only 35 percent, for unmarried persons. In Italy,  surprisingly, the portion of prior wage an unemployed person can  collect varies from as low as 20 percent to as high as 80  percent.    Many countries in the Union have systems in which benefits  are determined by a complex calculation factoring in the age of  the unemployed person, sectoral agreements, etc., while in some  countries the amount of benefit does not even depend on the wage  the beneficiary had been paid. In some countries the unemployed  pay taxes, and in others they do not. Many countries, Spain  among them, vary the amount of benefits according to the size of  the jobless person's family.    Only Belgium maintains payments from a  contribution-supported  unemployment insurance fund indefinitely; in other states,  insurance benefits are eventually exhausted and  replaced--usually by welfare allotments, i.e., payments that  bear no relation to earlier contributions to the insurance fund.  The report concedes that unemployed Spaniards are disadvantaged  in two respects: the minimum pay-in period before eligibility  for benefits, and housing assistance.    Spain is among the countries that require employees to have  worked the longest time before being entitled to benefits from  the contributive plan, and it is one of the few countries, along  with Greece and Portugal, that provides no housing assistance.  <H5>  Spanish Employers Pay Highest Employee Taxes in European </H5> Union    Spanish employers pay proportionally more into the national  unemployment protection system than their counterparts elsewhere  in the European Union. Employers in all Community countries  contribute more to the fund than employees, but in the case of  Spain the employer contribution is quintuple that of workers  (5.6:1, to be precise).    This is a much higher ratio than obtains in the countries  that followed Spain into the Community--Greece (3:1), Ireland  (2.5:1), and Portugal (2.2:1). In Germany, employers and workers  contribute equally to the financing of unemployment subsidies.    Despite INEM's large deficits, our country's system is not  one of the most heavily state-financed. In countries such as  Denmark, Ireland, Holland, and France, public subventions  contribute more to financing of the system than do employer and  employee withholdings, while in the United Kingdom and Portugal,  the state's contribution is only just enough to cover any  deficit.    Of course, Spain is experiencing a higher rate of  unemployment than any other Community country--in fact, ours is  twice as high as the Community average of slightly over 10  percent.    Spain has an additional liability: A relatively smaller  percentage of its total population is in the work force,  primarily because of the still very limited assimilation of  women into the labor market.</p>

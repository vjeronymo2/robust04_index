			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Portugal completes bank privatisation PORTUGAL's first significant privatisation this year was completed successfully on Monday with the sale of Sociedade Financeira Portuguesa-Banco de Investimento (SFP), an investment bank, to a Portuguese group headed by Mr Jose Manuel de Mello. The sale raised just over Esc16bn (Dollars 107m), nearly 50 per cent more than the bank's initial valuation, for the Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, a state-owned bank and SFP's only shareholder. The de Mello group paid Esc14.5bn for about 89.5 per cent of the shares in a joint bid with Mr Carlos Monjardino, head of the Fundacao do Oriente, a diversified investment group, who paid Esc1bn for about 6 per cent of the shares. The sale gives the two Portuguese entrepreneurs 95.5 per cent of the bank's shareholding. This was a higher proportion of shares than expected due to a low take-up of shares by employees and other small investors.</p>

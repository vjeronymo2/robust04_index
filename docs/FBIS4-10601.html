			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luz Arcelia Camarena M.] </F>   [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and  industrial development, said yesterday that Mexico emerged  stronger from the Uruguay Round because it provides a firmer  multilateral framework for Mexico's efforts to diversify trade  with countries with which it has not negotiated free trade  agreements.    Shortly before departing for Marrakech, Morocco, where the  signing of the Final Document of the Uruguay Round of GATT is  scheduled to take place, the secretary of commerce and  industrial development said that "the agreements of the Uruguay  Round will be crucial in promoting world trade of goods and  services, as well as in facilitating the flow of capital and the  transfer of technology." The GATT will reportedly go into effect  on 1 January 1995.    Serra highlighted that "the creation of this new framework  for world trade complements Mexico's free trade agreements with  other countries." Additionally, Serra stressed that "the  Uruguay Round will considerably improve expectations for a more  favorable international arena, creating jobs and greater  business opportunities for Mexican exporters."    The basic objective of Mexico's participation in the Uruguay  Round, he said, was to obtain at the multilateral level stable  and safe access for our exports to international markets, in  reciprocity for the autonomous measures of trade liberalization  adopted in the last few years.    According to the GATT Secretariat, world trade of  merchandise  will increase 12.4 percent between 1995 and 2005 as a result of  the agreements reached at the round, generating an annual  increase in the world's gross domestic product of $230 billion  for the same period.    In this regard, the secretary of commerce and industrial  development affirmed that Mexico has the potential to increase  its participation in world trade because the country has a  comparative advantage in some sectors where growth is predicted,  particularly textiles, clothing, agriculture products, prepared  foodstuffs, and beverages.    Serra remarked that "political stability and international  security depend on the permanent generation of wealth through  international trade and the equitable distribution of that  wealth. The changes undertaken by most countries pose great  challenges to the world society. The process of globalization  requires a trade system that facilitates the exchange of goods  and services to permit all countries to benefit from the  scientific, technological, and cultural contributions that  appear in the different areas of the world," Serra concluded.</p>

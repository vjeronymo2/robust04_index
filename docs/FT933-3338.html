			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Financial problems take the bloom off a Colombian success story - Effective reversal of the country's devaluation policy is eroding profit margins for the flower industry THE DAZZLING displays of roses, carnations and chrysanthemums at Colombia's recent flower fair brought approval from foreign buyers and so did Colombia's success in adapting to an extremely competitive market. Second only to Holland in flower exports, Colombia has increased sales steadily over the past 20 years, earning more than USDollars 320m in 1992. However, growers are glum about an effective reversal in devaluation, which is eroding profit margins. 'In the past Colombia wasn't market driven. Now the industry is maturing,' said Mr Rex Thompson of CCI farms, the US company that handles sales for one of Colombia's biggest growers. 'Our own trend is to have a much wider range of products - calla lilies, Queen Anne's lace and limonium, for example. These were not traditionally produced here.' Carnations and roses are still the mainstays, with 37 per cent and 24 per cent of exports. But Colombian companies produce about 40 different types of flowers. Its geographical position at the crossroads of Central and South America, with habitats ranging from lowland rainforest to misty Andean woodland, puts Colombia high in the world league of floral diversity. Most of the flower plantations are about 2,500 metres up on the green plains outside Bogota. Temperatures and the number of daylight hours fluctuate very little, and there is only the occasional frost. Expensively heated greenhouses are not necessary - flowers can be produced all through the year under cheap plastic tenting. 'We have 4.200 hectares of flowers now and I think exports will grow by 8 to 10 per cent this year,' said Juana Maria Unda, president of the flower exporters association, Asocolflores. 'But the overall area is not expanding because of the economic situation. Eight companies have gone under - they're only small ones but it's the first time this has happened, it shows the effect of the revaluation of the peso in the last two years.' The combination of revaluation (the devaluation rate is nearly ten points below inflation) and greater competition from other countries is forcing growers to look into their costs very carefully. Production is becoming more intensive, with less space for paths and careful control of labour. According to one medium-scale grower with 20 hectares, 'the margin is so small that you must export greater volumes to get your income. We are trying new varieties of carnation - but this year it's a question of just hanging on.' The flower plantations employ 75,000 people, mainly women who live in rural areas and towns near Bogota. The heavy use of pesticides - required if flowers are to meet most import standards - has caused health and environmental problems. Growers are responding with stricter controls on pesticide management and on the disposal of contaminated debris. They also sponsor family welfare programmes, housing improvements and environmental projects. Women employed on the plantations say that standards vary widely from company to company: 'Some have practically no security measures and even let people take the waste to feed their animals. Then another company fired somebody because she had a sweet in her overall pocket, and that was against security regulations,' explained one worker. 'Nobody realised the flowers would use so much water. The spring where our water came from is dry and buildings are cracking because there's no water left in the earth,' she added. Agrochemicals were very much in evidence at the fair - but so was protective clothing. Airlines were also well represented. The increase in the number and destinations of flights has been a boon to exporters who want to open up European sales and send direct to US cities other than Miami. British Airways flies over 20 tonnes of flowers a week to Britain, which has become one of Colombia's biggest carnation markets. Three quarters of all flower exports (about 80,000 tonnes) go to the US. 'The mass market is growing, there's been a lot of promotion. It's high quality and very professional,' said Mr Thompson. 'Growers are opening up their own American offices for marketing.' The Colombian Flower Council, created by Asocolflores and the US importers, is trying to boost flower consumption in the US all the year round. But production still has to be geared primarily to certain dates, especially St Valentine's Day and Mothers' Day. Although Ecuador, Mexico and other Latin American producers are expanding, Colombia has far more sophisticated infrastructure and the best agronomists. At the same time, exporters have woken up to the need for more diversified products and markets. Looking around the multi-coloured stands at the Bogota' fair, a Dutch carnation specialist noted that all the main international carnation and rose breeders were present - a good sign for Colombia's prospects.</p>

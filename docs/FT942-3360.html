			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / People: Owen flies off to PPP Peter Owen, 47, who has just spent a year trying to transform the fortunes of Aer Lingus, where he was group chief executive, is joining PPP, one of the UK's leading providers of healthcare finance, as managing director. He starts his new job with PPP on August 1. A year ago Aer Lingus was losing IPounds 1.2m a week. Those annual losses of Pounds 62.4m have been reduced, though the current year's figures (which will be announced in October) are still likely to show losses in the region of IPounds 56m. Owen joined Aer Lingus in May 1993, having been director of operations with British Airways from 1985 to 1990. He left BA to become chief executive of Innocan, a Canadian holding company with businesses in textiles, distribution, communications and specialist cleaning and consultancy. Owen spent a total of 21 years with British Airways, his time there culminating in his assisting in the management of the acquisition and merger with British Caledonian in 1987. At PPP he succeeds Roy Forman, who announced his retirement on July 1 1993, after 14 years with the company. PPP provides private medical care insurance for almost 2m people. In 1993 group income was Pounds 500m, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 40m.</p>

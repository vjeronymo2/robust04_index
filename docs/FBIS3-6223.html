Hosokawa made the call in a morning cabinet meeting in  response to pressure from the United States and elsewhere for  Japan to harmonize its economy with that of the rest of the  world.    In the Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations, Washington  has proposed dozens of new targets for deregulation.    Hosokawa called deregulation a vital component of the  government's economic reforms and said it must be actively  tackled to promote harmonious economic relations with other  countries.</p>

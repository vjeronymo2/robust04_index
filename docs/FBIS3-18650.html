			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: "Why May Defense Goods Be Exported </F> to Indonesia and Turkey?"]    [Text] Vammas Oy received permission from the government to  export 60 mortars to Indonesia. Sisu-Auto Oy in turn received  permission to export bulletproof Nasu all-terrain trucks to  Turkey.    In the explanation of the law regulating the exportation of  defense goods from the country it is stated, among other things,  that exportation of the goods is not permitted to crisis regions  or to countries in which there are serious human rights  violations.    Aapo Polho, office director in the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, asks if it is not true that human rights violations of  the type that occurred with the Indonesian occupation of East  Timor would prevent arms exports to Indonesia.    "The matter cannot be simplified in this way. The government  has decided that the CSCE and EU [European Union] criteria,  which are considerably more precise than the Finnish law, which  leaves a good deal of room for interpretation, will also be used  as bases for licensing. At present neither Indonesia nor Turkey  is the object of sanctions by the UN Security Council or the EU.  Finland condemns human rights violations in East Timor just as  elsewhere.    ``A working group headed by the Ministry of Defense recently  considered how the EU and CSCE criteria would be applied in  Finland. In practice it would mean that supervision would expand  to cover many more products than at present, for example cameras  and computer programs intended to be a part of certain weapon  systems.''    Has the export licensing policy been relaxed or is it being  relaxed somewhat?    "Licensing policy is neither being tightened nor relaxed in  applying the EU and CSCE criteria -- it is just being made more  precise. The present law permits a situation in which the  interpretations change even monthly. In this case it is  difficult for manufacturers to plan their output. For preserving  Finland's defense capability it is important that Finland also  have an arms industry."    Bulletproof all-terrain trucks may be exported to Turkey.  Are  the Nasus of such a civilian nature that they may be exported  anywhere at all?    "It depends a little on how they are equipped. Those that  are  bulletproofed require a license, but those that are not  protected do not."    May Nasus without bulletproofing be exported to Sudan,  Somalia, or Burundi, for example?    "Their exportation in principle does not require a license  at  all, but according to the new lists that are being prepared,  they too will be included in the monitoring without further ado."    May mortars be exported to Great Britain although it is  waging war in Northern Ireland?    "Yes. There is no state of war there but rather the  disturbances in Northern Ireland involve problems of internal  security."</p>

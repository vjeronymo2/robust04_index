			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCRAMBLES TO GUARD AIR FORCE BASE;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE FACILITY HOUSES A PRIZED RESEARCH UNIT. OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE  EAGER TO BE ITS NEW HOME.  </P> <P> Apart from the guards at the gate, the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo  resembles a corporate headquarters more than a military installation -- no  whirling radar dishes, no thundering jets. The facility's main feature: a  six-story office complex.  </P> <P> What the base lacks in Top Gun appeal, though, it more than makes up in  scientific and engineering prowess. Housed inside is the 3,200-employee Space  Systems Division, a highly prized Air Force research and development arm that  oversees procurement of much of the military's space hardware.  </P> <P> That explains why Los Angeles-area business and political leaders are  scrambling to block a proposal to close the base and relocate the space  division, possibly to Colorado or New Mexico.  </P> <P> Three communities -- Riverside, Colorado Springs and Albuquerque, N.M. -- have  mounted vigorous campaigns to land the unit.  </P> <P> The proposal, among tentative cost-reduction moves announced by Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this year, also contemplates relocation of the  Aerospace Corp., a 4,000-employee research and development center in El Segundo  that works closely with the Space Systems Division.  </P> <P> The proposal comes as some local aerospace firms, hit by defense cuts, are  shifting operations to less-costly communities. This has raised fears that the  Air Force's departure would accelerate the trend.  </P> <P> It has also galvanized local business leaders who believe the Los Angeles area  should do more to protect its high-tech industries -- assets, they say, it has  foolishly taken for granted.  </P> <P> "It's a new ballgame," said James Miscoll, vice chairman of Bank of America and  chairman of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "We have to be willing to  cut some deals to keep these people here. We can't keep saying we don't have to  make deals because in California the sun shines every day."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Air Force Base is among seven domestic air bases the Pentagon is  studying for closure to help trim the defense budget. The others: Bergstrom Air  Force Base in Texas, Eaker Air Force Base in Arkansas, Myrtle Beach Air Force  Base in South Carolina, England Air Force Base in Louisiana, Wurtsmith Air  Force Base in Michigan and Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Cheney and  Air Force Secretary Donald Rice are expected to make final recommendations on  all seven bases in December. Options include moving only part of the space  division. A decision to close Los Angeles Air Force Base outright would require  the approval of Congress.  </P> <P> The Air Force cites several reasons for targeting the El Segundo facility.  Among them are high costs of local services and a scarcity of land for  expansion of the space division, which is expected to experience long-term  growth.  </P> <P> The problem the Air Force mentions most often is that high housing costs in the  Los Angeles area, coupled with an inadequate federal pay scale, makes life  difficult for the division's work force.  </P> <P> Though the base has 574 housing units in San Pedro for uniformed personnel,  more than 1,000 of its military employees and all 1,450 of its civilians must  find living quarters in the Los Angeles area's high-priced housing market.  </P> <P> As a result, the department says, the space division has trouble hiring and  retaining qualified civilian personnel, and some employees -- both military and  civilian -- commute from distant, lower-cost communities to make ends meet. An  Air Force captain with eight years' experience must support a family on $3,468  a month in Los Angeles. A middle-level civilian aerospace engineer with eight  years' experience receives a monthly salary of $3,031, the Air Force said.  </P> <P> "These factors detract from the goal of producing a professional management  team for future space systems development," the Air Force said in a draft  economic impact statement released in July.  </P> <P> Such talk frightens local supporters of the Space Systems Division, which  oversees procurement of military hardware ranging from heavy-lift rockets to  spy and navigational satellites.  </P> <P> According to the Air Force, closing the base would cost the local economy $1.25  billion a year and mean a loss of 17,000 direct and related jobs.  </P> <P> The two space units are also valued for stimulating high-tech research in the  local aerospace industry and area universities.  </P> <P> Frank Wazzan, dean of UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science, said  his graduate students and faculty have access to experts and laboratories at  the Aerospace Corp., bolstering their work in areas such as communications,  laser technology and high speed electronics.  </P> <P> Wazzan said scientists and engineers at the Space Systems Division and the  Aerospace Corp. routinely conduct brainstorming sessions involving local  aerospace companies and universities.  </P> <P> "Literally, I can hang up the phone and in an hour be down there," he said. "I  would not be able to do that if they are in Colorado or in New Mexico. It would  be even worse for a student."  </P> <P> "They are a fantastic catalyst," he added. "To dismantle that, my God, why? . .  . It would damn near be a catastrophe."  </P> <P> Sam Iacobellis, chief operating officer of Rockwell International Corp., said  the proximity of the Space Systems Division gives an advantage to Los Angeles  defense contractors.  </P> <P> He notes that a $1.3-billion program under which Rockwell is building 28 global  positioning satellites for the Defense Department has often required daily  contact with space systems personnel overseeing the project.  </P> <P> Losing that next-door relationship, Iacobellis said, would give aerospace  companies one less reason to concentrate their resources in the Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> The proposed relocation "could be the beginning of the unraveling of the  nucleus of the aerospace industry we have in the Los Angeles Basin," he said.  </P> <P> While spreading such warnings, area business and political leaders have  launched an aggressive drive to dissuade the Air Force from moving.  </P> <P> The enlistees include the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, South Bay  chambers and city governments, a bipartisan coalition of 17 area congressmen  and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Their chief argument is that the tentative plan to close the base, far from  being economical, would waste tax money. Instead of a conventional  base-closing, they point out, the plan involves the relocation of large and  highly complex operations.  </P> <P> The Air Force declines to say how much such a relocation would cost, but  opponents of the move assert that the price would approach $1 billion. They  question whether economic pressures affecting the base come close to justifying  such an expenditure.  </P> <P> Col. Edwin Peura, third in command of the Space Systems Division, says that it  may not be cost-effective to relocate both the space division and the Aerospace  Corp.  </P> <P> "There are no economic advantages to the government to move a work force of  7,000 people," he said. But Peura agreed that a move might mean better off-base  housing, easier commutes and other improvements for employees.  </P> <P> Lifestyle will be a factor in the department's final decision, according to  Col. Peter Bogy, the Air Force representative in recent community hearings.  </P> <P> "Certainly, not to be slighted is the quality of life of our military and  civilian employees," Bogy said.  </P> <P> Bogy also said that the division will not be moved unless Congress passes  legislation allowing the Air Force to use proceeds from the sale of its El  Segundo and San Pedro property to help cover relocation costs. Currently,  income from the sale of military property is used to purchase land for parks or  wildlife refuges, or for general government purposes.  </P> <P> Local supporters of the base have promised to help resolve what the Air Force  calls the base's most pressing need -- 250 more military housing units.  </P> <P> The cities of El Segundo, Hawthorne and Los Angeles all said they are looking  for government or other land for such living quarters. Hawthorne said it may  use redevelopment money to build a military housing complex on one of several  sites, among them surplus school property and a large plant nursery that is for  sale.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's office, at the urging of Los Angeles chamber officials  and aerospace executives, is studying how state housing programs could help  finance construction.  </P> <P> "These are very highly skilled employees who represent much of what our Los  Angeles economy is all about," said Kenneth Gibson, director of the state  Department of Commerce. "You're talking about losing a critical mass here which  could be extremely damaging to the economy."  </P> <P> And extremely helpful to the community that might land the Space Systems  Division.  </P> <P> The Air Force is considering several sites: Vandenberg Air Force Base near  Lompoc, March Air Force Base near Riverside, Kirtland Air Force Base in  Albuquerque, and the Peterson and Falcon bases near Colorado Springs.  </P> <P> Officials said the strongest lobbying is coming from the Inland Empire,  Colorado and New Mexico. In each of those areas, boosters say the Space Systems  Division represents the "clean" high-tech growth they are trying to foster.  </P> <P> "When an economic development group has the chance to attract this many jobs  that are clean industry, our eyes light up," said Stephen Albright, chairman of  an Inland Empire business coalition seeking the space unit and a member of the  Southern California Air Quality Management District governing board.  </P> <P> Kenn Holzer, head of a state-appointed panel working to lure the space division  to New Mexico, said, "This would put the state of New Mexico on the map as far  as our high-tech capabilities are concerned."  </P> <P> The suitors have sweeteners. Colorado Springs is offering 200 acres of free  land outside Peterson Air Force Base. The state may provide low-cost loans for  construction of space division facilities, according to Wanda Reeves, member of  a state task force promoting Colorado's defense industry.  </P> <P> Holzer said the New Mexico task force has low-cost private financing in place  to assist the Aerospace Corp. in building facilities. The group is also  considering a plan to offer special home financing for employees moving east.  </P> <P> In Riverside County, Albright said, several cities with redevelopment work  planned near March Air Force Base are willing to use those projects to build  support facilities for the space division.  </P> <P> In all three areas, officials are saying that their housing costs, availability  of land, and lifestyle for military and civilian families would be a big  improvement over Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Los Angeles area business leaders said they are determined to meet the  challenge.  </P> <P> "In the past, we've opened the door and aerospace growth has just fallen in,"  said John Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.  "Now we're going to have to fight for what we've got."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Defense officials are scheduled to decide the fate of Los Angeles Air Force  Base in December. Closure of the facility and relocation of the space systems  division would require congressional approval. U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa  Monica) expects lobbying over the issue to become intense in Washington. "I  think we have a serious fight on our hands," he said.  </P></p>

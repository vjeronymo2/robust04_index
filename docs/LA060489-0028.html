			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE KITCHEN: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> A WINE CLUB  </P> <P> WINE AUCTIONS HAVE become very chic with the sort of people who like to impress  their friends at the dinner table. If you like wine and but are not in the  Latour league, consider joining Winewrights, an organization whose members  drink some of the world's most unusual wines -- and don't pay a fortune for  them.  </P> <P> Winewrights is a sort of limited-editions club for wine drinkers. The company  deals in wines made by dedicated wineries too tiny to distribute their wines  through ordinary channels. These are not ma-and-pa places that make swill that  one would be embarrassed to serve. To the contrary, some of the country's most  prestigious wines (Bonny Doon, Kalin, Laurel Glen and Randy Dunn) were first  distributed through Winewrights. Recently, Winewrights members were offered the  latest Chardonnay from Merry Vintners for only $99.50 a case.  </P> <P> A membership with Winewrights includes "The Winewrights Register," a 256-page  book profiling the wine makers whose wines are sold through the club. (This is  more than a mere catalogue -- it's a fascinating tome.) Members also receive a  market report six times a year; it contains a variety of information, but its  primary purpose is to inform members about the current wines that the club has  for sale. They are good wines at good prices: Belonging to Winewrights offers  wine aficionados one of the nicest ways to shop by mail.  </P> <P>  Membership in Winewrights is $40. Write 175 B Cascade Court, Rohnert Park,  Calif. 94928. Or telephone (800) 321-4300.  </P> <P> </P></p>

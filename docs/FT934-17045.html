			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: A jewel of a show in the City READERS WHO have been faithful followers of the annual jewellery and silverware fairs at London's Goldsmiths' Hall should note that this year's fair runs from October 4-9. The fair used to be called Loot. It has always been a mecca for those looking for jewellery or silverware for themselves or for presents and, possibly more important, it is a chance to see a wide range of work from Britain's most talented designers. This year's fair is no exception - from the glimpses I have had the standards are as high, the innovations as interesting and the designs as fine as ever. You could spend as little as Pounds 30 on a pair of ear-rings, or a great deal more on commissioning a set of table silver. Two of the most exquisite pieces on show are photographed here. Do not be discouraged by their prices, there is a great deal of choice at less than Pounds 100 and even more at less than Pounds 300. The brooch, by Stephen Webster (above), is in 18 carat gold and features a carved citrine in the form of a lion with blue / green tourmalines and matching enamel highlighted with pave set brilliant diamonds for Pounds 7,000, while Maureen Edgar's silver pepper pot (right) is turned into an object of great beauty by fine cloisonne enamelling. It costs Pounds 2,500. The exhibition starts on Monday 4 and is on until Saturday 9. It is open every day from 11 am to 7 pm except Saturday when it closes at 5 pm. The Pounds 1 entrance fee includes the catalogue. The Goldsmiths' Hall is in Foster Lane, London EC2V 6BN.</p>

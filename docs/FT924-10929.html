			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Warning from SIA as profits fall SIA, the parent company of Singapore Airlines, warned yesterday that business for the rest of this year would be 'mixed'. Demand on many routes was low 'because of the sluggish economic climates in the major industrialised countries.' The warning came with the company's interim figures. Tough competition, the world economic slowdown and a strong Singapore dollar pushed first-half operating profits 8.9 per cent lower to SDollars 477m (USDollars 298m). The fall at the pre-tax level was a sharper 21.5 per cent to SDollars 498m, depressed by the absence of aircraft sales, which produced a surplus of SDollars 88m in the same period in 1991. Shareholders' funds, however, climbed 5 per cent to SDollars 7,398m, while the dividend was maintained at 15 cents and the company announced a one-for-one scrip issue. Investors had feared worse, and the 'foreign' shares - those tradeable by non-Singapore holders - rose 40 cents to 1,430 cents, outperforming the local stock market. SIA has increased its capacity by more than one-fifth over a year ago as new routes to Johannesburg, New York and Madrid were opened. The effect of the rise in capacity on sales was, however, limited by heavy competition, said the company. First-half turnover rose only 3.8 per cent to SDollars 2,753m, while the load factor - a measure of how full the average aircraft is - fell 3 percentage points to 67.4 per cent. This is a large fall by industry standards and was largely attributable to the cargo division. The yield - the revenue earned per passenger or tonne of freight - dropped almost 10 per cent. This meant that the break-even load factor, a closely-watched figure reflecting margins and the strength of cost controls, rose 0.7 percentage points to 61.3 per cent. Group costs rose 7 per cent to SDollars 2,276m, pushed up by depreciation, fuel prices, in-flight meals maintenance and overhaul. The airline itself, excluding engineering, cargo and other subsidiaries of the group, saw operating profits fall 22.4 per cent to SDollars 359m. The decline was especially sharp reflecting payments to new subsidiaries created at the start of the company's financial year in April. SIA Engineering, for example, is now charging the airline commercial rates for its services.</p>

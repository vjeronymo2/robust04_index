			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Energy efficiency deteriorating in Britain BRITAIN'S performance in using energy efficiently is showing signs of deterioration after two decades of almost continual improvement, the Association of Conservation for Energy has found in an analysis of government statistics. The 'energy ratio' - the amount of primary energy needed to produce a unit of gross domestic product as measured by the Department of Trade and Industry - declined every year but one between 1970 and 1989. But Mr Andrew Warren, association director, said: 'Since 1989 there has been a 3.7 per cent rise in the ratio.' Ironically it was in 1989 that the government called for a 2 per cent annual improvement in energy efficiency, against the average of 1 per cent.</p>

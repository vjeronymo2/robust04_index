Luck was on his side. He went to Washington uncertain how  much longer he could insist on dialogue to resolve the nuclear  issue. When he left Seoul, a nagging fear of war was spreading  here and hard-liners were demanding action, not negotiations,  against North Korea.    The nuclear issue was on the brink of being tossed to the  U.N. Security Council, which likely would have initiated steps  for sanctions against North Korea.    Then Pyongyang announced this week it would accept  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections -- after a  one-year hiatus -- of seven sites.    The announcement helped turn the mood around. South Korea  and the United States confirmed during Han's visit that they  would continue with dialogue.    This stroke of luck eventually proved that the foreign  minister's insistence on a diplomatic solution was the right  choice. The "experience" and success gained should prove  invaluable for the new administrations in Seoul and Washington,  for whom the row was the first major hands-on encounter with the  unpredictable North Korean regime.    With a changed mood and heightened confidence, the foreign  minister and U.S. officials sat down to chart their future  course.    They focused not only on deterring North Korea's nuclear  development but on preventing Pyongyang's nuclear card from  getting out of hand.    Seoul and Washington's conclusion was to stick to their  principles and seek a package solution. As far as principles,  North Korea must allow unrestricted IAEA inspections and engage  in meaningful dialogue with South Korea on denuclearization.    To stop North Korea from prolonging the situation, the two  countries agreed to resolve the nuclear problem in its entirety  at the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks in exchange for  improved political and economic relations.    With their initial success and added credibility to trumpet,  they must nonetheless begin anew their wrestling with North  Korea.    The sour note to Han's U.S.-Canada visit was the  overshadowing of its original purpose -- strengthening relations  with members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).    Han's visit to Mexico was canceled at the last minute, and  his meetings with trade officials in Canada and Washington were  played down in comparison to the nuclear negotiations. But the  foreign minister was still able to register his country's  concern that the regional trade agreement should not  discriminate against non-members, asserting that South Korea  wants to participate in NAFTA in the long run.    Han and Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet agreed on a  "special partnership" to cement bilateral trade relations. In  Washington, Han conveyed Seoul's worries that any return of the  U.S. Super 301 trade legislation could throw cold water on their  economic ties. But the highlight, obviously, was the  breakthrough in the nuclear impasse.</p>

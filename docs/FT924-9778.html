			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Opposition strike disrupts business in India Market porters sleep on their push-carts outside shuttered shops in New Delhi yesterday. A nationwide strike call by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) disrupted commercial activity and some clashes were reported in parts of India yesterday, Shiraz Sidhva reports. The strike was called to protest against a decision by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to raise fertiliser and petroleum prices. Most markets and businesses in New Delhi and the four BJP-ruled states were closed and rail and bus services were partially disrupted. Elsewhere the call by the Hindu right-wing party to paralyse the country was ignored. In Bombay, the office of the chief minister was ransacked by political activists who gatecrashed the state headquarters. In Bihar, BJP leaders alleged that police used force to disrupt peaceful processions. The strike is part of a BJP attempt to increase its support among farmers in a party made up mostly of traders.</p>

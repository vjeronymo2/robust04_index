			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Chile-EU fruit tariffs lowered Chile has won agreement for lower tariffs on its apples and pears exported to the European Union, David Pilling writes from Santiago. In return Chile has dropped its request that Gatt investigate EU restrictions on its fruit. Chilean fruit producers, who account for 12 per cent of EU consumption, say the European system of countervailing duties last year caused them losses of Dollars 100m-Dollars 120m (Pounds 66.6m - Pounds 80m). Tariffs will be lowered by 50 per cent under the agreement reached in Brussels on Tuesday. The reference price - the level at which import surcharges come into effect - will also be raised. Chile will be allowed to export 12 per cent of fruit below this price, against 8 per cent previously.</p>

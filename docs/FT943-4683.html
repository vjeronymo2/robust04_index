			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Aggressive selling in the futures and options market and rumours of a heavy sell-off from a US hedge fund took the September FT-SE 100 contract down to break through the 3,200 barrier, writes Clare Gascoigne. The morning opened cheaply with the September contract at 3,246, after closing at a premium on Monday, with expectations of a quiet day because of the Jewish new year. But after touching the day's high of 3,248 it was almost immediately traded down, taking the cash market with it to reverse early morning gains. The real weakness came through late in the afternoon, as the German bund came under pressure and with the added burden of the US hedge fund rumours. In spite of some buying from independent traders, it was not enough for the September contract to recover, and after dipping briefly below the 3,200 level it closed at 3,201. Volume was good, with 16,415 contracts traded by the close. After-hours' dealing took the September contract down still further to 3,196, with around 1,500 lots transacted. However, the December contract was more in favour and held its value better, finishing at 3,215. A busy day for options took turnover to 29,511 lots, with the banks heavily traded; HSBC at 2,787 contracts was the most active stock option.</p>

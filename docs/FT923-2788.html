			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Shredded paper In one sense the stock market deservedly got its come-uppance yesterday from Arjo Wiggins Appleton. UK income funds, in particular, have been guilty of bullying companies into maintaining expensive dividends in the face of deepening recession. The obvious threat of a collapsed share price if they step out of line, though, counts for nothing if the victim displays little regard for City credibility. That is an inescapable conclusion after the wholly unexpected 20 per cent cut in Arjo's interim payout. The Anglo-French paper maker must have known that the reaction would be severe - Pounds 400m off its market capitalisation is vicious by any standards - and that investors would be puzzled by its motives. Cover on an unchanged payout for the year, after all, would probably have been 1.5-1.7 times earnings: short of its desired 2-2.5 times target but perfectly respectable in these difficult times. The balance sheet is far from stretched - gearing may be 30 per cent by the year end - and the Pounds 13m cash saving on the dividend is dwarfed by acquisitions and capital spending. Simple miscalculation seems an unlikely explanation for a Footsie company. The sudden assertion of continental long-termism looks equally implausible, though few can be in any doubt now that the French are in full control. St Louis' 39 per cent stake, however, does not provide access to the huge cash flows of which Arjo will one day be capable, which is why a full takeover may yet be the ultimate aim. It does not take a conspiracy theorist to recognise that a lower share price helps in this respect. The trouble with buying the shares at 129p is that patience may be required. On fundamental grounds they look cheap relative to the market, there is no obvious black hole and the overcapacity problem which lies at the root of weak European earnings should be mostly resolved by the end of next year. Given the market's disenchantment, though, it is hard to see a stampede of takers.</p>

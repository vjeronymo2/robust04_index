			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIA AGENT WHO DEFECTED IS EXPELLED FROM HUNGARY  </P> <P> Edward Lee Howard, the former CIA agent who defected to the Soviet Union after  allegedly passing vital U.S. secrets, has been permanently expelled from  Hungary as a result of the pro-democracy upheaval there and is now in another  East Bloc country, U.S. sources disclosed Wednesday.  </P> <P> The expulsion has prompted U.S. officials to redouble efforts to apprehend  Howard, but it is not clear whether those prospects are good.  </P> <P> Hungary revoked Howard's asylum at least a month ago at the urging of U.S.  officials and over the protests of the Soviet KGB, government sources said. It  was not known where in the East Bloc he is now living, or whether he is still  under Moscow's protection.  </P> <P> Howard allegedly told the Soviets key information about CIA operations in  Moscow, including names of agents and technical equipment being used. He evaded  an FBI surveillance team in New Mexico in 1985 and then turned up in Moscow. It  was not clear when he began spending time in Hungary.  </P> <P> "The idea (for encouraging his expulsion) goes back some months," said a U.S.  official aware of the effort, "but they (the Hungarians) have acted only in the  last month or so. Our argument was: 'Here's this guy who cast his lot with the  Soviet Union but tried to avoid the hardships of Gulag socialism.'  </P> <P> "Our purpose was not to have him turned over to us," the official said. "We  never thought they would do that."  </P> <P> Disclosure of Howard's expulsion came after CIA Director William H. Webster  made a guarded reference to the case, without mentioning Howard's name, in a  speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Webster was asked how recent political changes in Eastern Europe have affected  cooperation between intelligence services of those countries and the KGB.  </P> <P> "I can think of one instance, and I'll not mention a name because it may be  classified, in which a prominent defector from the United States was finally  permanently expelled from a bloc country which had provided him comfort and  sanctuary in the past," Webster said. "And that would have been contrary to the  wishes of the KGB. So, we are seeing some indications of independence."  </P> <P> Other government sources confirmed that Webster was referring to Howard.  </P> <P> Howard had an important patron in Moscow, Vladimir Kryuchkov, who now heads the  KGB, and was said to enjoy a comfortable living situation there because of  Kryuchkov's influence.  </P> <P> But David Wise, a Washington writer and author of "The Spy Who Got Away," an  account of the defection of Howard, conducted his 1987 interviews of Howard in  Budapest. Howard is the only CIA agent ever to flee to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "He liked Hungary more than Moscow," Wise recalled in an interview Wednesday  night. "It was a lot more Western -- the closest he could get to the West."  </P> <P> Wise said that when he interviewed Howard in Budapest in June, 1987, the  defector planned to spend his summer there. "He has been back there several  times, including August of 1988, and his wife has visited him there for as long  as three months," Wise said.  </P> <P> Howard's wife, Mary, who lives in St. Paul, Minn., with their daughter, could  not be reached Wednesday. Wise said he last spoke with Howard by telephone more  than a year ago but added that he had heard reports of an American encountering  Howard in Budapest and describing him as "drunk and unhappy." Howard was widely  reported to be plagued with a drinking problem when he was with the CIA.  </P> <P> "If it's true that he is drinking heavily again, that might be a peg for them  (Hungarian officials) to want him out," Wise said.  </P> <P> "Hungary was the closest he could get to the West in atmosphere, but he was  nervous when he was there," he said. He recalled Howard's saying that all it  would take would be "a hypodermic needle by the CIA and then over the Austrian  border."  </P> <P> At the time of his interviews with Howard, Wise said, the defector was  protected by both the KGB and local security.  </P> <P> Howard's alleged spying was discovered through the 1985 defection to the United  States of Vitaly A. Yurchenko, a high-ranking KGB officer who was in charge of  all operations in the United States and Canada. Yurchenko, who subsequently  redefected to the Soviet Union, disclosed the existence of a former CIA mole.  </P> <P> Although Yurchenko did not know the man's name, he related enough details,  including that the mole had been sent on an assignment to Moscow that was  called off by the CIA, to lead counterintelligence officers to Howard.  </P> <P> However, the FBI, which is responsible for counterintelligence in the United  States, was not immediately informed of Yurchenko's revelations. Howard, using  techniques taught him by the FBI when he underwent CIA training for his aborted  Moscow assignment, then managed to escape an FBI surveillance team and flee to  Moscow.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Don Shannon contributed to this story.  </P></p>

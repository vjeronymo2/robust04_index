			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ljubljana, 5 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of  Communications of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] has banned the Slovene company, Adria Airways, from  transporting passengers and goods from the FYROM to third  countries.    From today, Adria's aircraft may fly from the FYROM only on  regular flights to Slovenia and back. Air crews are allowed to  stay overnight in Skopje.    The FYROM is demanding from Slovenia the same conditions for  its air passengers [sentence as received].    In a liberally minded way, Skopje and Ljubljana have until  recently been promising great tolerance in reciprocal business  and other contacts, especially in trade. Over the past few  months, however, there have been an increasing number of  obstacles to business between the two economies with each  wanting to make a profit off of the other.

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Pension ruling referral urged Unison, Britain's biggest union, is to urge an industrial tribunal to refer a test case on pension rights to the European Court of Justice. Unison wants to establish future pension rights for public-sector workers transferred to private companies under compulsory competitive tendering. The case involves Mr Richard Doughty, a gravedigger whose job was contracted from Rotherham borough council to a company which did not offer a pension scheme. Unison will ask an industrial tribunal in Sheffield tomorrow to refer the case to Europe for a ruling that the company should provide a comparable pension to the local government superannuation scheme.</p>

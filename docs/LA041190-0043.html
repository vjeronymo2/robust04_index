			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HARTLEY'S OFFICE GETS TOUCH-UP  </P> <P> San Diego city workers have begun re-covering Councilman John Hartley's office  with new wallpaper little more than a month after Hartley delayed purchase of  the wall coverings because of concerns about the cost.  </P> <P> Hartley decided to go ahead with the $4,400 wallpaper installation after  comparing the city price with an estimate from a private contractor, said  Raquel Beltran, Hartley's top aide.  </P> <P> The private contractor estimated that the job would cost $4,962, she said.  </P> <P> Hartley will stand by his decision not to purchase $33,000 worth of work  stations for his staff, keeping the total cost of his office renovation at  about $16,000, Beltran said. Instead, partitions taken out of city storage will  be used to divide the office, Beltran said.  </P> <P> Hartley announced that he would not install the work stations and postponed the  wallpaper purchase at a March 1 press conference, calling the $50,000 cost of  the office remodel "offensively high." The announcement came as newly elected  council members Hartley and Linda Bernhardt were receiving intense public  criticism for authorizing the renovations at a time when the city was beginning  to address a $60-million deficit for the fiscal year that begins July 1.  </P> <P> Bernhardt, whose $32,450 renovation was nearing completion at the time, called  Hartley's announcement "a cheap political ploy."  </P> <P> At the time of the announcement, the wallpaper installation was estimated at  $6,100. By having city workers do the recovering during daytime work hours, the  cost was reduced to about $4,400, Beltran said.  </P> <P> Hartley also announced that he would not accept a salary increase voted by the  council that will bring the eight council members' pay to $49,000 by July 1,  1991.  </P></p>

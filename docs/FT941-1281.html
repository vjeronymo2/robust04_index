			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Veba slips 9% but increases dividend Veba, the German energy conglomerate, saw profits slip by 9 per cent in 1993, but the dividend will nonetheless rise DM1 to DM13, Mr Ulrich Hartmann, chief executive, said yesterday. Net profits fell to DM825m (Dollars 489m) from DM906m, while group turnover was marginally higher, up 1.4 per cent at DM66.3bn. Preussenelektra, Veba's electricity arm and strong-est performer, increased profits by 6 per cent to DM833m. Mr Hartmann noted that Veba had spent DM500m buying stakes in six region-al electricity suppliers in eastern Germany, and looked forward to completing negotiations for a 26.25 per cent stake in VEAG, the east Germany electricity net-work. However, turnover in the transport and trading division fell 2 per cent, slightly worse than at Huls, the group's chemicals company, where sales dipped 1.1 per cent to DM10.1m. A further 3,000 jobs will be shed in the chemicals sector, but Veba said it does not expect to see any profit until 1995. A new company, Veba Telecom, will bring together the group's interests in corporate networks and the mobile phone and cable sectors, and continued investments in tele-communications would see the Dusseldorf-based group expand into a fifth division alongside its electricity, oil, chemicals and trading arms, Mr Hartmann said. However, Mr Hartmann was non-committal on the timetable for Veba's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The group is widely tipped to become the second German company to seek a listing, following Daimler-Benz last October. Feasibility studies on the listing have yet to be completed.</p>

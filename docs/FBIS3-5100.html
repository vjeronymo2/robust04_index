Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, told  a  press conference after a morning cabinet meeting that the U.S.  way of trying to resolve trade issues through unilateral  measures carries the risk of shrinking trade as a whole.    "It is worrying that the U.S. strengthened the trade  retaliation authority at a time when the international community  is trying to boost free-market rules," he said.    Kumagai said the top priority for Japan now is to wrap up  market- opening measures by the end of March as planned.    "I don't think the Japanese market is unfair or exclusive,  but nevertheless there is a need to create a market with greater  transparency," he said.    Japan needs to act voluntarily "to prevent Japan-U.S.  relations from lapsing into a vicious cycle," he said.</p>

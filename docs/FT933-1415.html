			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / KIO, BP and the Dollars 5bn shell game: How a ruse by Kuwait may have cost the Inland Revenue over Pounds 600m VERY few people in the City of London have ever heard of the late Trevor Ball. Even fewer know that for a decade this east Londoner who left school at 16 was one of the most powerful money managers in the world. Officially Ball was the chief investment manager of Kuwait's international investment arm. In reality looking after the Kuwait Investment Office's mainstream investments - on behalf of the state fund, the Reserve for Future Generations - was only a part of his responsibilities. Until his sudden, premature death in 1991, he controlled Dollars 5bn on behalf of a secret client, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the emirate's national oil company. The KIO's investment activities are enormously discreet. But secrecy was particularly important in the case of Ball's activities. He worked from a cramped office on the fourth floor of St Vedast House, an anonymous City block. From here he played a central role in an elaborate stock market ploy during late 1987 and early 1988, in which the KPC, hiding behind the KIO, bought a 21.7 per cent stake in British Petroleum, then the world's third largest oil company. It was a ruse that may have cost the British taxpayer at least Pounds 600m. Failure to disclose the true ownership of a stake in a UK company is also an offence under the Companies Act. So disclosure of KPC's role in purchasing the BP stake is likely to embarrass both Britain and the oil-rich Gulf state for whose freedom from Iraqi occupation British troops fought in 1991. At the time of the Dollars 1.7bn BP share raid, Kuwaiti officials and ministers insisted this was just the biggest of a series of substantial KIO investments in blue-chip companies around the world. Kuwait also said the KPC was not involved at all. Even so the move stirred up great political controversy. BP was concerned that a substantial shareholding was being acquired by the investment arm of one of the world's biggest oil producing countries. The raid was particularly embarrassing for the UK government, since it had only been made possible by the flop of the stock market sale in October 1987 of the government's 31.5 per cent shareholding in BP. However, the fact that KPC was the real purchaser of the near 22 per cent stake means that the position for the British oil company BP was even more perilous than it believed. A former high ranking Kuwaiti official has confirmed to the Financial Times that the KPC was indeed the real purchaser. He has asked not to be named because he is concerned about reprisals from the Kuwaiti government. The former official says that Kuwait deceived the UK government, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which investigated the investment, and BP itself. His account has been corroborated by a past Kuwaiti minister and two former KIO employees. This version of events is also supported by copies of Swiss bank statements which show that the KIO manages KPC's funds, a fact confirmed for the first time by Mr Rashaid Al-Badr, current president of the KIO. In what seems to be more than a coincidence, the KPC's annual report for the year to June 30 1988 shows an increase in its holdings of marketable securities of Dollars 1.7bn, which is precisely what the BP investment cost. Another possible tell-tale sign of the true ownership of the shares is given by a computer print out (made by Mr Ball in early 1990) of all the securities owned throughout the world by the KIO. If BP was a normal portfolio investment by the KIO it should appear on this list. It does not. KPC ownership of the BP shares is disputed by one former Kuwaiti minister. He admits KPC funds were used to make the purchases, but says that the KPC gave the money to the KIO in return for a portfolio of 'money market securities'. He insists that the KIO then made the BP investment, as originally claimed, on behalf of the Reserve for Future Generations. If this were the case, it is odd that income earned on the BP shares has been deposited in the KPC account and even odder that, at the time of the raid, BP shares already owned by the Reserve for Future Generations were transferred to the KPC account. Even the former minister cannot dispute that at the very least the KPC facilitated the BP investment by providing funding for it, which contradicts what British ministers and the MMC were told at the time. This latest controversy over KIO activities comes on top of a bitter battle between the KIO's new management and its predecessors. Legal actions have been brought in Spain and the UK against Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah - the former KIO chairman and a distant cousin of the ruling Emir - and against Mr Fouad Jaffar, its urbane former general manager. They are accused of being part of a conspiracy to defraud the KIO through its lossmaking Spanish operations. The former KIO managers say, however, that the new Kuwaiti government is deliberately choosing to ignore evidence that the missing funds were paid to an assortment of governments all over the world during the Gulf crisis in late 1990, to ensure their support for the war against Iraq. Before the Spanish embarrassment, the KIO had an impressive record as manager of the international investments of the Reserve for Future Generations, set up to generate income for when Kuwait's vast oil reserves are depleted. Between 1981 and 1991, the KIO received Dollars 9.1bn of funds from the reserve and remitted Dollars 45.2bn back to Kuwait - generated by a combination of investment income and asset sales. War expenditure reduced KIO assets to around Dollars 25bn at the end of 1991 and less today. At its peak, in the late 1980s, it was more than Dollars 40bn. The KIO has never paid taxes anywhere in the world. Because it manages the Reserve for Future Generations it has benefited from the international convention that sovereigns do not pay tax. In 1989, a particularly good year, the KIO earned around Dollars 6bn in income and capital gains from its main funds, on which it paid no tax. Other well known beneficiaries of this sovereign immunity from tax are the oil producing states of Brunei and Abu Dhabi, which have built up substantial portfolios of securities and property in industrialised countries. The justification for a country like the UK providing this tax immunity is that vast amounts of capital are attracted to its markets, which might otherwise go elsewhere. The price in terms of lost tax revenue - running to billions of pounds in some years, according to tax experts - is thought to be worth paying. The KPC, however, is not a sovereign entity as far as the Inland Revenue is concerned, even though it is ultimately controlled by the state of Kuwait. It is a company - set up like any other by issuing shares - and is therefore a separate legal entity. The KPC's assets and investments belong to the KPC and revenue earned from those assets should be liable for tax. But a former Kuwaiti official says that KPC has improperly received tax immunity by hiding behind the KIO. As a result, it may have made tax savings of around Dollars 150m a year, excluding a Pounds 458m special BP tax credit but including the credit on normal BP dividends. The Inland Revenue, which is considering the new evidence on the ownership of the BP shares, is in a very uncomfortable position. Before giving tax immunity to the KIO on the BP investment, it received a written assurance from the Kuwait government affirming that the shares were directly held by the state through the KIO - and therefore not by the KPC. 'It is not easy to challenge a statement made by a sovereign,' commented a UK official, 'especially one of our main allies in the Gulf.' At the centre of this web of complicated stock market deals was Sheikh Ali Al-Khalifa Al-Sabah. The KPC's investment in BP was his initiative, according to a former Kuwait official. Sheikh Ali Khalifa, a man whose impatience and sharp tongue has made many enemies, is a clever and mercurial member of Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family. He spent most of the 1980s as oil minister and chairman of the KPC. He refused to comment on the record for this article. The KPC generates huge amounts of cash. At the end of June 30 1991, it held marketable securities worth Dollars 3.5bn and cash and bank deposits of Dollars 5bn. According to a former official, the KIO received a mandate to manage KPC's cash and investments in the early 1980s. The KPC's funds were held at Swiss private banks, including Lombard Odier, a highly reputed and discreet bank in Geneva. A special KPC account, called the 'Number Two Account', was set up. Only a tiny number of individuals knew that the KPC was the beneficiary of the Number Two Account, though there is a tell-tale clue on the statements sent by Lombard Odier to the KIO. A statement copy headed 'Number Two,' breaks down the investments in the account into different categories according to currency. Each category is designated by a code and each code contains the initials 'KP' for 'Kuwait Petroleum'. The total balance shown in the statement, which is not dated, is Dollars 1.27bn. The Number Two Account was managed by Ball, who had spent most of his working life with the KIO, making his way up from clerk to become the second most powerful non-Kuwaiti at the organisation after Mr Bruce Dawson, the deputy general manager, since retired. Lombard Odier's statements were sent directly to Ball who was assisted by a couple of clerks and a junior Kuwaiti fund manager. Ball's instructions came from the KPC in Kuwait. For a short period, he set up a series of other Swiss accounts to manage the funds of KPC subsidiaries. But this made the job too onerous for him and his small clerical staff, so eventually all KPC investments were combined into the Number Two Account. Almost from the moment the KPC was founded in 1980, Sheikh Ali Khalifa wanted to build it up to rival the western oil multinationals, such as Shell and Exxon and BP. The opportunity to buy a significant BP shareholding was presented in October 1987 by the flop of the stock market sale of the British government's stake in BP and a simultaneous rights issue. Around 2bn BP shares were left in the hands of underwriters facing losses of several hundred million pounds - and many of them were desperate to sell. The price of the shares on the stock market was hovering around 70p, compared with the underwriting price of 120p. Said one former KIO employee: 'We thought it was crazy that something which only days before was thought to be worth 120p could now be bought for 70p.' The KIO had already acquired 13.2m BP shares as one of the underwriters of the issue. Sheikh Ali Khalifa was in London at the time and was enthusiastic about buying more BP shares. He told the KIO to acquire at least 10 per cent of the company. 'He said: 'Use my funds.',' recalled a former Kuwaiti official. What Sheikh Ali Khalifa meant, according to the official, is that cash in the Number Two Account should be used for the operation. The KPC eventually bought even the KIO's original holding. When the KIO on behalf of the KPC went into the stock market as a buyer of BP shares, it attracted a stampede of sellers. The most astonishing buying spree took place on just four trading days between November 13 and November 18 when 441m shares were bought for around Pounds 350m. According to a Kuwaiti official, the BP shares were divided between the Number Two Account and a then dormant account originally used for a KPC subsidiary, called the Number Four Account. However, to prevent any leak of the ownership of the shares, statements for the Number Four Account, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, do not include the 'KP' initials on the classifications. There were widespread rumours that the KIO was buying, but only a handful of individuals at the KIO and in Kuwait knew what was really going on. Not even the Kuwait Investment Authority, to which the KIO reports, was aware of the buying until long after it had started. A former Kuwaiti minister said: 'The council of ministers (Kuwaiti cabinet) was not informed until it became a political problem.' On November 18, BP disclosed that the KIO had acquired just over 10 per cent of its shares. BP was appalled. Its chairman, Sir Peter Walters, was concerned that the Kuwaitis would use the shareholding to put pressure on BP to do deals which would benefit KPC and Kuwait's oil interests, but would not necessarily be in BP's interests. The attitude of the British government was initially more ambivalent. Following the share flop, it made a general offer to investors to buy back shares in their partly paid form at a price of 70p. The Kuwaiti purchases saved it from the embarrassment of buying back more than a few shares. As the Kuwaiti stake moved towards 15 per cent, however, the then Mr Nigel Lawson, chancellor of the exchequer, became increasingly uncomfortable about the potential for Kuwait to influence BP. However, neither he nor Sir Peter ever thought that the owner of the shares might be the KPC. All through the winter and early spring, the KIO on behalf of the KPC, continued to add to its shareholding. But Sheikh Ali Khalifa was becoming increasingly isolated from his colleagues by his decision to continue buying aggressively. Sir Dennis Walters, the former Conservative MP who is an adviser to KIO, Mr Jaffar and Mr Jasem Al-Kherafi, the then finance minister, all became increasingly unhappy as the size of the stake increased towards 20 per cent. Then from the end of December to the end of March, the British government tried to secure undertakings from Sheikh Ali Khalifa that Kuwait would limit the BP holding to less than 20 per cent and would not interfere in the management of the company. But a voluntary agreement could not be reached - and as if to rub salt into the wounds of the British government, Kuwait continued to buy, till the shareholding reached 21.7 per cent for a cost of Dollars 1.7bn. The British government refused to let the matter drop. On May 3, the MMC was asked to investigate whether the investment was in the public interest. Its report, published in October 1988, says that the Kuwaitis told the MMC that 'although BP operated in an industry in which Kuwait had substantial interests, principally through KPC, the BP shareholding was not bought for that reason'. The Kuwaitis also told the MMC that the BP shareholding was 'purchased and held by the KIO without any prompting or instruction of the government of Kuwait'. Though the MMC was misled about the real ownership, it might in fact have come up with the same recommendations even if it had known the buyer was the KPC. Its report concluded that the stake could be used to exert pressure on BP to do deals beneficial to Kuwait's oil interests. The KIO was ordered to reduce its holding to 9.9 per cent within a year. The Kuwaitis were horrified. There followed an intense period of political lobbying and Mr Jaffar went to the US to hawk the stake to any oil company which might be interested in it. He persuaded Pennzoil, the US company, to buy it - but inserted a clause into the agreement which said the contract was void if within a fortnight the Kuwaitis found a purchaser prepared to pay more. There was indeed such a buyer in the wings - BP itself. For two months, BP had been talking to the KIO about buying enough shares to reduce the KIO holding to 9.9 per cent. In mid-December, Sheikh Ali Khalifa rang Sir Peter. 'My price is 305p,' he said. That was the price allowing for the payment of the two further instalments due to the UK government on the shares it had sold. At that price, the Kuwaitis would have made a small profit. BP's tax department had, however, come up with a way of reducing the cost to the company. It pointed out that when a company buys back its own shares, the Inland Revenue usually treats the payment as though it was a dividend. Dividends are paid after deduction of basic rate tax, which at the time was 25 per cent. But a non-tax payer such as the KIO can claim back the 25 per cent. BP tried to put pressure on the Treasury to ensure that this tax structure for the deal would be agreed, because it meant that part of the cost for buying back the shares would be carried by the government. But the Treasury refused to put pressure on the Inland Revenue. In the event, the Inland Revenue received a statement from the KIO that the BP shares were held directly by the Kuwait state, a sovereign, and so it confirmed that it would pay Kuwait a tax credit of 58p per share. In the spring of 1989 the KIO, on behalf of the KPC, sold 790m BP shares, receiving Pounds 1.95bn from BP and a further Pounds 458m from the Inland Revenue. Without the sovereign immunity from tax, the deal would have been far less attractive to Kuwait. Indeed, Kuwait continued to benefit from the sovereign immunity in respect of the dividends it has received from BP on the remaining stake of near 10 per cent. Tax credits on these dividends have been worth an estimated Pounds 156m. If the Inland Revenue were to conclude that the investment in BP was in fact held by the KPC and did not deserve sovereign immunity, Kuwait would owe the UK government more than Pounds 600m in tax on the BP investment alone. But a UK public official says that the Inland Revenue cannot on its own decide to re-examine whether tax should be paid by Kuwait in respect of its BP adventure. 'We would be questioning the good faith of a very rich ally,' he said. In the end, the British government will have to judge whether it is worth offending a very old friend for the prospect of perhaps reclaiming several hundred million pounds.</p>

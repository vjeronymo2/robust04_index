			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Leading Article: France's air of confusion IN THE overall economic scheme of things, the skirmishing over the future of Air France between the French government, the company's management and its workforce may seem of limited and local significance. Politically, however, it represents a reversal of large and ominous proportions. By climbing down under union pressure and scrapping the rationalisation plan it had six months ago encouraged Air France management to adopt, the government has not only demolished the position of the chairman, Mr Bernard Attali. It has sent out the clearest possible signal of its own weakness in the face of the multifarious special interests that recession and economic restructuring have brought clamouring to its door. Those of France's European partners who want the Community's industrial structures to continue adapting to competition within and without, rather than retreating behind a wall of subsidy and trade protection, have a right to be concerned. That would be an excessively harsh judgment to hang on the events of the last two days if the government's handling of Air France were the only sign of its confusion. The trouble is that it is not. Over the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, over economic and monetary policy and even potentially over his programme to privatise state-owned industry, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, looks increasingly adrift in a sea of conflicting pressures and demands. Hobson's choice In this he is, of course, not exactly alone. All EC governments are grappling to a greater or lesser extent with problems of rising unemployment, uncompetitive industry, sluggish growth and high public sector deficits. From Wolfsburg to Wolverhampton, companies and their workers are having to look afresh at the structure and costs of labour, and politicians are struggling to redefine the role of the state. In France, however, the difficulties seem especially acute - in part because of the more prominent role the state has traditionally played in the economy, but also in part as a result of Mr Balladur's failure to explain the consequences of his own policies. On the Gatt, he has himself admitted the Hobson's choice he faces: between the domestic crisis that would result from his accepting the terms likely to be on offer from the EC and France's other trading partners, and the international crisis that would ensue if he refused. But although this is a dilemma in part of his own making, he has barely begun to point a way out of it, or to tell protesting farmers that, Gatt or no Gatt, their industry is in secular decline. Job losses On monetary policy, the government is still behaving as if the currency crisis of this summer never happened. By failing to take advantage of its new-found freedom to cut interest rates, it is prolonging and deepening the recession - and fuelling the clamour against job losses. Over time, this could seriously complicate the privatisation policy that has thus far been the government's one big success, by preventing necessary restructuring at such companies as Groupe Bull and Air France. Instead of decisively reducing public ownership and increasing the ability of French industry to compete in the European market, Mr Balladur may thus find himself endlessly juggling demands for subsidies from badly managed state companies - and coming increasingly into conflict with France's EC partners as a result. That is why Air France is such an important test case. Until Sunday, the government agreed that Mr Attali's painful restructuring programme was 'indispensable' if the airline was to be able to compete with other streamlined carriers in the liberalised EC aviation market. Now it appears to be suggesting that a softer option exists. Worse, Mr Balladur's volte-face has merely encouraged public sector unions to try their luck against other tough but necessary management decisions in future. It is certainly true that decisions of this kind can only be implemented if a political consensus can be mustered behind them. But by giving in on this occasion, the government has not taken a step towards creating such a consensus; it has merely postponed the evil day, and given encouragement to those who urge the EC to turn away from the market.</p>

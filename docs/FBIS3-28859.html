			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An official from the Kingdom of Cambodia's Foreign  Affairs and International Cooperation Ministry has said that SRV  Foreign Minister Mr. Nguyen Manh Cam will pay a three-day  official visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia -- from 16 to 18  February -- accompanied by senior Vietnamese officials. The  official said that the official visit is being made at the  invitation of Prince Kromluong Norodom Sirivut, minister of  foreign affairs and international cooperation, and will pave the  way for the Vietnamese prime minister to visit Cambodia in March.    Analysts say the exchange of visits is necessary for the  sake  of relations between the two countries following the Thai prime  minister's visit to Cambodia. Vietnam and Cambodia are  entangled in a great many problems, such as the problem of  Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and the border problem, not to  mention past racial problems. It is expected that the two  countries will be able to maintain good relations for the sake  of their own development.</p>

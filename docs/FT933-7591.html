			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: France Useful though its jobs package will be, the French government is not stimulating the economy as fast as investors would like. True, the reduction in payroll taxes, at a cost to the government of some FFr105bn (Pounds 11.95bn) over five years, will provide some impetus. But the more important, if politically explosive, issue of the high minimum wage has been skirted. Since the minimum wage has recently risen faster than average manufacturing wages, French workers have been priced out of jobs. Yet the rise in French unemployment to 11.6 per cent, may stem less from labour market rigidities than a sheer lack of demand. Here, the government is constrained from doing much because of budgetary pressures. But its continuing reluctance to cut interest rates hardly helps. Still, investors appear remarkably sanguine, despite the government's refusal to move faster on interest rate cuts. Both equity and bond markets appear convinced that the economy will recover even if they remain uncertain about the timing. Moreover, the rise in the Paris bourse has lagged the fall in bond yields over the year. There may well be more headroom for equities once short-term rates fall. The huge quantities of cash held in French money market funds will then have nowhere else to go.</p>

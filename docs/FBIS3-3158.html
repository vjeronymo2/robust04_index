			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has succumbed to tough lobbying by the  state sector and scaled down plans to overhaul chronically  unprofitable government enterprises. Executive Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji has also encountered stiff resistance to his plans to  change the ownership system of public-sector firms.    In speeches to delegates attending the National People's  Congress (NPC) yesterday, Prime Minister Li Peng concentrated on  shoring up ailing state-sector units instead of radical surgery,  such as transforming them into quasi-private shareholding  concerns. And despite the Government's just-announced measures  to fight inflation by controlling money supply, the People's  Bank of China yesterday announced new loans to bolster the  depressed coal, metal and electricity industries.    While addressing NPC members from northeastern Jilin  province  yesterday, Mr Li hinted more government funds should be  earmarked to prop up state companies. "The Government must  ensure a beneficial external environment for enterprises and  help them transform their management mechanism," XINHUA (the NEW  CHINA NEWS AGENCY) last night quoted Mr Li as saying. The  premier urged various levels of government to help boost the  competitiveness of large and medium sized state enterprises.  Chinese economists said Mr Li was in effect asking that more  investment be pumped into the chronically inefficient state  sector.    Vice-Premier Mr Zhu also recommended prudence in "pushing  (state) enterprises towards the marketplace". While talking to  deputies from Hunan province yesterday, Mr Zhu expressed more  determination that Mr Li over restructuring the state sector.  [sentence as published] "Do not link the existing difficulties  of state-owned enterprises with the reforms of today," Mr Zhu  said. He admitted, however that it would be unrealistic to  expect the problem of public-sector inefficiency to be solved  soon. "Of course, the central authorities will still adopt  practical measures to solve the question of the historical  burden of the state sector," Mr Zhu said, hinting that Beijing  was not about to cut its grants to public- sector companies,  which will come up to 16.63 billion yuan (HK$14.77 billion) this  year.    In an earlier talk to Hunan delegates, Mr Zhu also indicated  large-scale bankruptcies for government-run business units,  which had been advocated by liberal economists, were not a  practical solution. The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO  yesterday quoted Mr Zhu as saying "we don't have a mechanism for  bankruptcies at this stage". Mr Zhu said each county should not  have more than one bankruptcy because "bankruptcies do not mean  we can stop taking care of the (laid-off) workers".    But the Vice-Premier stressed that Beijing must push ahead  with experiments in "changing the ownership system of government  enterprises", a euphemism for quasi-privatisation. Chinese  sources said yesterday central planners including conservative  elder Chen Yun had recently insisted that public-sector firms  remain the mainstay of the economy lest the socialist nature of  China be adulterated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>   [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] will not be  ready by election day on April 26, says its commanding officer,  Major General Gabriel Ramushwana. He spoke to SOWETAN last  Friday [4 February], shortly before startling allegations of a  lack of discipline, desertions and drunkenness within the NPKF's  3,500-strong force outside Bloemfontein hit the headlines. The  force was originally scheduled to complete its training at the  end of March for deployment in troubled townships in the last  four weeks of the election campaign. The force was aimed at  ensuring non-partisan policing and was envisaged to grow to  10,000 men and women.    Ramushwana was particularly critical of the standard of  training of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military  wing--MK] soldiers in the NPKF. This was also against the  background of claims that four MK cadres were dismissed from the  De Brug base where the NPKF began training two weeks ago. "I am  not hopeful that the national peacekeeping force will be ready  in the remaining six weeks it has to prepare for elections,"  Ramushwana said.    He was appointed NPKF commanding officer by the Transitional  Executive Council last month. He said he found no basis for  allegations that MK soldiers had shouted racist slogans. With  regard to problems at NPKF headquarters, ANC spokesman Mr Carl  Niehaus said yesterday's news reports were "an overstatement and  were calculated to put MK in a bad light". He rejected  Ramushwana's claim that MK training was below standard, saying  any soldier would have difficulty adjusting to new forms of  training. ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela told journalists in  Bloemfontein he was confident Ramushwana would be able to sort  out the problems.</p>

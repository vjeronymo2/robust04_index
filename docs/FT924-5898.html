			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Astra awaits an uncertain future  -Shareholder changes at the Indonesian group Astra International, Indonesia's second largest company, which dominates the country's automotive sector, has a reputation to protect. Brokers have repeatedly named it Indonesia's best managed company and, as of last June, foreign banks had afforded it loans and facilities of more than Dollars 900m. A financial crisis, however, has hit the Soeryadjaya family, Astra's majority shareholders, with the recent suspension of their privately-owned Bank Summa carrying bad debts of over Rp1,000bn (Dollars 487m). To raise new finance, the family have sold 40m of their 178m Astra shares - or 74 per cent of the company's issued shares - and are expected to sell more, thereby losing majority control, before the end of the year. Uncertainty over the company's ownership coincides with depressed car sales and a slump in profits from Rp210bn in 1991 to, brokers forecast, about Rp75bn this year. A declining share price has seen Astra's market capitalisation fall 41 per cent in five months to Rp2,034bn. Since Astra went public in 1990 - about 13 per cent of the 242m issued shares are actively traded - it has been regarded as Indonesia's pre-eminent blue chip stock. It sells more than half of Indonesia's vehicles and has the distribution licence for Toyota, the market leader. While the automotive sector accounted for 80 per cent of the company's Rp4,933bn 1991 sales, Astra also has agribusiness, financial services, heavy industry and electronics subsidiaries. Comprising 10 per cent of the Jakarta stock market's total capitalisation, for many investors and bankers Astra is synonymous with Indonesia. The current difficulties of Astra and the Soeryadjayas lie in a rise in interest rates in 1991 following a tightening of monetary policy in 1991. For Astra, this led to a sharp fall in car sales as consumer credit contracted. Central bank officials say Bank Summa broke banking regulations by over-lending to private companies owned by the Soeryadjayas. These had invested heavily in real estate, the value of which subsequently dropped. High interest rates left the companies unable to service Bank Summa's loans. Astra has minimal financial exposure to Bank Summa, its officials stress. To underline the separate nature of the businesses, in September Mr William Soeryadjaya, the company's founder, stepped down as chairman. He was replaced by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former finance minister and father-in-law of Siti Herijadi, daughter of President Suharto. In the past two weeks, however, it has become clear Bank Summa's financial crisis will, as the Soeryadjayas attempt to cover its debts, have a direct effect on Astra's future. On November 13, the Soeryadjayas sold two blocks of 20m shares to a pension fund of state-owned Bank Dagang Negara - the bank to which the shares had previously been pledged against loans - and Newark of Hong Kong. Brokers say the sale of shares to Newark was financed by Danareksa, an Indonesian state-owned investment fund. Hong Kong company records show Newark's two registered directors to be Soeryadjaya family members. Astra says Newark will hold the 20m shares while negotiations with a foreign buyer are finalised, Toyota being the preferred party. It is not clear who now has authority over these shares. The sale leaves the Soeryadjayas with about 138m Astra shares. Of these, businessmen close to the family say at least 129m have been pledged against loans. They say 100m shares are pledged against a Rp500bn loan from a consortium of three banks led by state-owned Exim Bank. The other members are Bapindo, also state-owned, and Bank Danamon, a listed company. Another 29m shares are pledged, the businessmen say, to Bank Universal, 51 per cent owned by Astra, against loans totalling up to Rp300bn. The Soeryadjayas declined to comment on these details. While the family have taken these loans, the central bank say a September deadline to inject new money into Bank Summa was missed. A Rp150bn rescue package, backed by a consortium of private banks, last week allowed Bank Summa's small scale depositors to clear their accounts. The next key date for Astra and the Soeryadjayas is end-December when, bankers say, the loan from the Exim Bank consortium matures. Unless this is repaid, the banks may take up the shares and look to on-sell them, with the state banks taking political advice. Brokers say two businessmen have declared an interest in taking a stake: Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who heads the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest conglomerate, and is a close associate of President Suharto; and Mr Hashim Djojohadikusumo, son of Astra's new chairman. An Astra executive acknowledged a potential conflict of interest for Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, but said the chairman remained independent. An executive of the Salim Group, which is a shareholder in Indomobil, Astra's main competitor, declined to comment. Bankers to Astra have expressed their concern, for as one European banker explained, 'We would never have contemplated lending to Astra, if it were a Salim Group company.' In June, Astra had long and short-term debt of Rp2,456bn, giving a 1.54 debt to equity leverage. Bankers consider the choice of new shareholders critical to Astra's future financing and question whether changes in the company's ownership may be sufficient to affect the status of their existing loans. Astra says no foreign loan has a provision requiring the Soeryadjaya family to maintain a majority holding. Its aim is 'to see that no one party holds a majority, so Astra can be a fully public company,' explained one Astra executive. But he conceded the company has little control over who the new shareholders will be, and acknowledged Toyota is unlikely to purchase the Newark-held stake until other shareholders are finalised. The choice of shareholders is now 'a national matter' and 'in the government's hands,' the executive noted. Those looking for part of the Soeryadjaya stake will be knocking on the doors of government ministers.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOOZE-FREE DANCES APPEAL TO TEETOTALERS  </P> <P> Dance music pulses through the mirrored, Art Deco-style nightclub as the  bartenders hurriedly stir, shake and blend exotic refreshments.  </P> <P> A crowd of adults is partying this Friday night, but they are all sober. There  is no alcohol in the drinks.  </P> <P> "It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze," said Joseph W.  Perugini, one of the managers of Club Soda, a no-alcohol alternative for adults  who want to socialize without drinking on Friday nights.  </P> <P> "There are people out there that just can't drink, and they have nowhere to  go."  </P> <P> Many night spots offer dancing in an alcohol-free club ambience for teen-agers,  but a boozeless bar for adults is unusual, Perugini's partner, Thomas Rowlay,  said.  </P> <P> "We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's not what we were  looking for," Rowlay said.  </P> <P> On other nights of the week Club Soda is the Night Life VIP Lounge, a  full-service bar. The decision not to serve booze on Friday nights, typically a  busy night for bars, was something personal to Perugini, who is a recovering  alcoholic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fun Without Drinking  </P> <P> "I'm recovering, and I've met, through my past two years out there, a different  breed of people (who) enjoy life without the sauce," Perugini said.  </P> <P> "I'm just tired of reading, 'Just say no to drugs and say no to booze.' You've  got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time we show people how to  live. I feel real good about it."  </P> <P> Perugini credits Night Life owners Pat Scarpa and Dave DeStazio, his employers  for a number of years, with giving the no-booze night a chance.  </P> <P> It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager Lester J. Szmajlo endorses.  </P> <P> "You've got people that maybe shouldn't be drinking, that don't want to drink  and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have that same atmosphere, a  party night, and not get drunk," Szmajlo said.  </P> <P> Does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd? No, according to Club Soda's two  managers.  </P> <P> "It's like 'Is there life without drinking?' Yeah, there sure is," Rowlay said.  "The important thing is, people who don't drink are no different from people  who do -- I mean in terms of dullness -- because you have some people who don't  drink who are dull and you have some people who do drink who are dull."  </P></p>

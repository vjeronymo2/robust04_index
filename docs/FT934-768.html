			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Business confidence plummets The Japanese finance ministry's index of large companies' business confidence hit a record low of minus 21.8 in the quarter from September to December, down from 18.6 in the previous three month period. But medium sized companies and service industries reported a slight improvement, offering a glimmer of hope for Japan's embattled government, whose popularity is starting to suffer from its failure to tackle the recession. A majority of the sample of just over 11,000 businesses thought conditions would improve in the next few months. Corporate profits in the three months to the end of September fell by 21.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, declining for a record 13 quarters running, said the ministry. However, the problems ahead were underlined yesterday by the latest poor statistics from the car industry, confirming heavy surplus capacity. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association estimated that production in the first 11 months of the year reached 10.4m vehicles, down 9.5 per cent on the same period in 1992. Jama believes output for the year will reach 11.2m units, which compares with maximum production of 13.2m vehicles. Output in November fell 12 per cent against 1992.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> CHARGES FILED IN THEFT  </P> <P> The San Bernardino County district attorney's office has filed felony grand  theft and misdemeanor charges against three San Gabriel Valley men and one  Rancho Cucamonga resident who allegedly stole about $150,000 worth of equipment  from an Ontario computer warehouse where they worked.  </P> <P> The employees admitted to undercover investigators at Tech Data Corp. that they  took personal computers, software and other accessories over a period of  several months last year, Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Larry Balderrama said Friday. They allegedly sold the equipment to friends or  wholesalers, he added. During a sting operation, one was videotaped selling  equipment to a United Parcel Service driver, he said.  </P> <P> "They were selling to anybody and everybody who would buy a computer,"  Balderrama said. "If they wanted a computer, they'd hide it in the trash  outside and come back later and pick it up." Some employees also admitted using  a variety of drugs while on the job, including cocaine, but no evidence of drug  use was found, he said.  </P> <P> The four people charged last Wednesday are: Greg Jack Aragon, 23, of San Dimas;  Marciano Cuellar, 29, of Hacienda Heights; Ignacio Flores, 23, of West Covina,  and Lawrence Odum, 36, of Rancho Cucamonga. They are to be arraigned in Rancho  Cucamonga Municipal Court on Feb. 26.  </P></p>

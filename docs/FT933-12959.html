			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brand concerns return FRESH shivers of apprehension were sent through companies with strong brand products as Philip Morris, the US tobacco group, announced that the provisional price cuts it made earlier this year would now be extended to some of its other premium brands. It also said that the reduction in the price of its top-selling Marlborough cigarette brand would be made at the wholesale level. BAT Industries, Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes all fell sharply on the news, although BAT later recovered on speculative buying. Fears over the effect of price cuts by leading brand manufacturers in reponse to cheaper alternatives has been plagueing related stocks for some time. Earlier this month, Procter and Gamble caused dismay among its peers by announcing a series of price cuts, which impacted in particular on Unilever, one of its main competitors, Although yesterday's news affected sentiment, speculation ahead of the move last week had already put implications of the day's developments into the BAT price and the stock soon rallied. Dealers also pointed out that the issue was not finally decided and that Philip Morris was also raising some cigarette prices. BAT finished just a halfpenny off at 430p, after 418p, following hefty turnover of 10m shares. Unilever had a more torrid time, its shares tumbling 17 to 949p, the lowest price since September last year. Cadbury weakened 11 to 433p.</p>

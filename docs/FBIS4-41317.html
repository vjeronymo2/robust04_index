			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Oleg </F> Velichko]    [Text] Washington June 23 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin said that they managed to convince the U.S.  Administration that Russia should be granted the status of a  country with a transitional market economy. According to the  prime minister, this was on of the main results achieved as a  result of the work of the integovernment Russo-U.S. Commission  for Economic and Technological Cooperation which met in session  on Wednesday.    Late on Wednesday, Chernomyrdin answered journalists'  questions. He came out for lifting restrictions impeding the  establishment of normal trade and economic relations between  Russia and the United States. Chernomyrdin mentioned  Jackson-Vanik's amendment which is still in effect as one of  these obstacles.    Touching upon the problem of the possible shut-down of  Russian reactors for the production of plutonium and a ban to  use them for the production of nuclear weapons, the prime  minister made it clear that "Russia fulfills its international  commitments." According to Chernomyrdin, during the talks with  the American delegation an agreement was reached "on the U.S.  participation in the construction of special storages on  Russia's territory." The sides agreed that Russia would shut  down double-purpose reactors, while the United States, in turn,  would partially recompense the cost.    Chernomyrdin confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin would  pay  an official visit to the United States in September, adding that  third session of the Russo-U.S. commission which is currently  under way in Washington can be regarded as the first stage of  the preparation for the Russo-U.S. summit.</p>

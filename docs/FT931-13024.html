			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Serbs and Croats fan the flames THE renewed outbreak of fighting between Croats and Serbs in Croatia's Serb-occupied enclave of Krajina has once again underlined the difficulty of dealing with the various elements of the Yugoslav crisis in isolation of each other. Just as progress was beginning to be made on a negotiated solution to the bloody conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the attention of the negotiators at the Geneva peace conference was diverted by an explosion in a region of Croatia which had remained relatively calm since the end of Serb-Croat hostilities a year ago. 'We were so busy putting out the fire in the living-room that we did not notice it had spread to the attic,' in the words of a diplomat close to the Geneva conference. Yet it was in Croatia that the conflagration had broken out in the first place, and where the embers have continued to glow even after the main blaze was extinguished. The agreement of January 1992, which ended the Serb-Croat civil war and opened the door to the presence of the United Nations Protection Force in the region, was no more than a glorified ceasefire accord. Even its author, Mr Cyrus Vance, who is one of the co-chairman of the current Bosnian peace negotiations, would not claim that it offered a durable political solution. By allowing parts of Croatia conquered by the Serbs to remain under effective Serbian control, albeit with an inadequate UN force to keep the two sides apart, supervise heavy weapons and 'guarantee' the peace, the signatories were merely storing up trouble for themselves and sowing the seeds of future conflict. It was essentially Croat frustration with the constant procrastination of the Serbs in handing back, as they had undertaken, the Maslenica bridge and Zemunik airport - vital communication links between northern Croatia and the Dalmatian coast - that sparked the Croat offensive in Krajina. That could have been foreseen, and there is every indication that President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia gave advance warning to the international mediators in Geneva, and by implication to the Serb leadership, of what he intended to do if the Serbs did not meet their obligations. It was not for nothing that Lord Owen, who is habitually strictly impartial in his public utterances, on this occasion expressed understanding for the frustration of the Croats, without however excusing their recourse to force. What the whole affair has shown is that the right priorities are not necessarily being respected in the efforts to achieve a peace settlement for the former Yugoslavia. It is understandable that the most burning problem of the moment, which is Bosnia with all its attendant horrors of ethnic cleansing and brutality, should be the focus of peace negotiations. Yet there can be no guarantee whatsoever that even a solution of this complicated problem, unlikely as that seems at the moment, would necessarily lead to an overall Yugoslav peace settlement. While the negotiators are busy with constitutional principles, maps and provincial boundaries for the future state of Bosnia, the problem of a political settlement between Serbia and Croatia is crying out for attention. Without such an understanding, which would doubtless require territorial trade-offs, it seems improbable that lasting solutions can be reached for more limited regional problems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhou Jingyu (0719 2529 3157): "Xi </F> Jinping Talks on Plans for Infrastructural Construction"]    [Text] Fuzhou, 30 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- On the eve  of the lunar new year, Xi Jinping, member of the standing  committee of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee and secretary  of the Fuzhou City CPC Committee, told this reporter about plans  for Fuzhou's infrastructural construction.    Fuzhou will work mostly at the construction of Changle  International Airport, the enlargement of the Min Jiang Bridge,  the construction of the second beltway, sewage and garbage  disposal, the expansion of the capacity of program-controlled  telephones, and so forth. In developing this projects, the  proportion of foreign capital utilized will increase  considerably. Fuzhou's investment in infrastructural  construction last year totaled 5.8 billion yuan, the largest in  history, and this year's infrastructural investment will exceed  that of last year.    Xi Jinping said: The construction of Changle International  Airport, a Sino-foreign joint project, is the biggest project  for the year. It will entail a total investment of 2.3 billion  yuan. American and Spanish banks, as well as British, Singapore,  and Malaysian consortia, are showing very great interest in it  and are negotiating with us. The removal of the 1,800 mu of  land all has been finished and the airport runway project will  begin in April. Its passenger terminal now is being designed by  famous Singapore experts, and our requirements are that the  airport should have ethnic and local characteristics, and that  it must attain top international standards.    To match the airport project, a special 18-km expressway  will  be built from Fuzhou to Changle International Airport, and the  Qingzhou Bridge straddling the Min Jiang will be constructed.  Their total investment comes to 1.7 billion yuan. The projects  are being prepared vigorously and foreign capital will be  utilized.    Last year, Fuzhou built the 4,400-meter third Min Jiang  Bridge and the 2,600-meter Wuliting Overpass, which have greatly  alleviated traffic moving into and out of Fuzhou. This year,  the Min Jiang Bridge (the second Min Jiang bridge) project will  be carried out through the expansion of the bridge surface by  seven meters. The bridge will be closed for the project and  will be finished this year. Xi Jinping said: We are building  the bridge with bank loans and will repay the debt with the  bridge tolls and income from its neighboring sections. We will  continue to build the fourth bridge over the Min Jiang in the  future.    Fuzhou will complete the main part of the second beltway,  which stretches a dozen kilometers or more. Moreover, it will  repair and construct several main passages in the city,  including Guloujintai, Cangshanguanhai, Yangqiao West, and  Guohuo Roads. These projects will entail an investment of 200  million yuan.    Furthermore, Fuzhou will step up electricity development  this  year. Xi Jinping said they are "very determined" about this  because power shortages are detrimental to Fuzhou's development  and to attracting capital. This year, Fuzhou first will  complete 100,000-kw of the large, 180,000-kilowatt power plant  in Fuqing. Moreover, the Changle power plant will generate an  additional 50,000 kw by the end of this year. In this way,  power shortages in Fuzhou can be alleviated.    Fuzhou's program-controlled telephones will have seven  digits  from March onward. This year, the city will have another 50,000  citywide phone call sets and 20,000 international telephone call  sets, and will complete the main post and telecommunications  building so as to ensure that Fuzhou leads in telecommunications.    Xi Jinping also specifically stressed environmental  protection. He said that Fuzhou will actively seek loans from  foreign governments, the Asian Development Bank, and the World  Bank to strengthen environmental protection and development, and  that the city will spend 100 million yuan building a  50,000-tonne sewage disposal plant and will construct a huge  garbage site in Hongmiaoling. Xi said that is a "100-year plan."    This series of important infrastructural projects will  enable  Fuzhou to eliminate traffic problems and power shortages, and to  prepare for a new takeoff. Xi Jinping said, with a very  resolute tone and full of confidence: "We have many  difficulties regarding capital and the projects, but we will  forge ahead in the face of the difficulties and do our work in  earnest, and we absolutely will not sit and theorize, and thus  lose the opportunity!"</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Gilat: "Here and There in the Land of </F> Autonomy"]    [Text] Sufyan Abu-Zayidah and Hisham 'Abd-al-Razzaq were  invited to a symposium at a Tel Aviv theater earlier this week.  'Amira Hess, an HA'ARETZ reporter who was also slated to  participate in the symposium, proposed to meet them in Tel Aviv  before the event. The problem was that Abu-Zayidah and  'Abd-al-Razzaq, with approximately 30 years in prison between  them, do not visit Tel Aviv very often. Where should they meet?  "You decide," they said. "No, you two decide," Hess replied.  There is one place in Tel Aviv every Gazan knows. That is  where they go to collect bodies; where taxi drivers take them to  introduce them to foremen of construction sites; where the  authorities throw them when they are caught without a permit to  stay in Israel. "Let's meet at Abu-Kabir [site of a forensic  institute and a lockup facility]," the two men proposed.    At the very same time, thousands of Gaza Strip residents  were  anxiously waiting along the roads leading to the Rafah border  checkpoint for the first contingents of the Palestinian police.  Abu-Zayidah and 'Abd-al-Razzaq did not have to work hard to  convince their Tel Aviv audience of the need for a strong police  force. A few minutes after they began taking questions from the  audience, five youths who had up to that moment taken cover  behind "Peace Now" T-shirts and "There Is A Mandate for Peace"  stickers, leapt up and shouted: Sufyan, go back to Gaza, you  murderer. A scuffle ensued and the police were summoned to see  the rioters out. An Israeli police officer, who looked  exhausted, had to stay until the end of the symposium to make  sure that the two Palestinian leaders would be permitted to  speak without interruption.    "I understand you," Abu-Zayidah bitterly told the right-wing  rioters. "It is hard for you. A lot of Palestinians also find  this peace hard to swallow. Even though there is peace, your  soldiers still shoot us every day in Gaza and Dayr al-Balah.  So, some people find it hard. But, it will not help them, just  as it will not avail you. There will be peace."    The Gaza Strip is changing from day to day, sprucing up,  erasing the soot, dust, and agony of the occupation. It is  still not the ideal place to live, but its quality is improving.  People are thinking about tomorrow, not just about today, and  this is having an effect.    In recent weeks, thick ropes have been stretched on the  roads  in the streets of Jabalyah. This is the local version of road  humps to force drivers to slow down. As is known, it has been a  long time since Gaza has observed any traffic rules. There, a  child opens his front door and he is already in the middle of  the road. There have been cases when a child ran after a friend  and found himself run over by a car. So, they are stretching  ropes.    Construction work can be seen in every corner. Housing  projects are being built. Carpet dealer Hamis al-Halawi, not a  well-liked man in Gaza -- he owns a four-story clothing and  carpet store -- covered the whole building with a huge Palestine  flag, just as the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv was once covered  with the Israeli flag.    'Abd-al-Qadr al-Husayni Street in the Rimal neighborhood  already looks like a government ministry compound: offices of  the Engineers Association, the Development Society, the Family  Planning Society, the Trade Union Federation. "Did Hayim Ramon  win? We will have to meet him. So far we have discussed  workers' rights with Haberfeld."    New huts for bathers are being built on the seashore. Until  the intifadah, Gazans used to go to the beach in Ashqelon. Since  the intifadah the seashore is associated with the "Seashore  Outpost" and the "Ansar-2 camp," two notorious sites on the  waterfront. Swimming was no fun then. Things are different now.    Peddlers expose their wares in the middle of the street.  Many Gazans feel the goods, with a view to renovating their  homes. New graffiti has been sprayed on the wall outside Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi's home: "We Will Build Our State With Our  Own Two Hands," and "Palestine Opens Its Arms to the Arriving  Policemen." Now the graffiti is aesthetic, pretty, and  colorful. They can stand in front of the wall with their spray  cans and paint uninterruptedly, not like it used to be.    Thousands of people still subsist on flour and water. A  demonstration was staged last week in front of the UNRWA [UN  Relief and Works Agency] offices demanding an increase in the  rations. Local doctors are worried about the growing incidence  of malnutrition which weakens the body's immune system,  particularly in children. All these are attendant consequences  of the prolonged closure. Gaza is awash in cheap Israeli canned  food. The reason: its expiry date is long overdue. However,  when people are hungry they eat cans of corn that should not be  used after November 1993. Most cans are marked "kosher for  Pesah."    On empty stomachs, children, women, and the elderly stand  for  three days along the roads awaiting the arrival of the  Palestinian police. They want to see with their eyes and touch  with their hands the Palestinian weapons. Against this  backdrop, clashes erupt between them and the soldiers guarding  the roads. These are truly the hardest hours of the end. The  soldiers also stand in the blazing sun for hours, they are also  thirsty, and they also want to see how all this ends. So, the  joy of getting out is accompanied by the music of rubber  bullets, the smell of tear gas, and a bitterness which will turn  into sweeping elation as soon as the first Blazer van donated by  the Americans arrives.    The Car Licensing Bureau is crowded. Ten meters away, in the  police station, some 20 Israeli policemen are locked behind the  fences, waiting for the transfer of powers. But, in the Car  Licensing Bureau it is business as usual. Earlier in the week  there was a clash with soldiers. To settle the dispute,  Palestinian policemen were summoned. Their uniforms are blue,  exactly as those of the Israelis, but without a flak jacket;  they do not yet bear arms, only a tag with the word "police" in  Arabic on their sleeves. In the meantime, this will do as a  source of authority.    What will happen in the future in the Car Licensing Bureau?  "Nothing," says a local driver waiting to renew his driving  license. "All the testers are Palestinian, our own men.  Therefore, all the hustlers will go on with their business.  For 100 shekels they will make your car pass its annual test,  even if you don't own a car. Just like in your bureau, in Holon."    Until the previous closure, Nabil worked in Israel as "a  professional meat griller." He had no permit to enter Israel  because of trouble with the income tax authorities. He used to  own a sewing workshop in Gaza. The income tax authorities asked  him to pay 60,000 shekels, but they failed to reach an agreement.    He managed. He registered the property in his mother's  name, and the owner of the grilled meat joint snuck him into  Israel without a magnetic card. After the closure this became  more dangerous. So, he bought himself an old Peugeot and went  into partnership with another guy in a taxi company. The  current media interest in Gaza earns him a good living, and his  business is flourishing. There are local Gazans who would  rather hire a taxi than drag all the way to Palestine Square.    He dreams that once the Israeli authorities get out perhaps  he will finally be allowed to install a radio in his taxi, just  like in Israel. So far this has been forbidden for security  reasons. Your income tax authorities will tear you to pieces, I  say to him. Nabil is not worried. He is confident they will  reach an agreement. I am even prepared to pay 5,000 shekels and  close the case, he says.    Last Tuesday he was worried about what would happen the next  day if Israel Electric Corporation made good on its threat to  cut off power due to Gaza's outstanding debt. Our neighborhood  had no electricity for almost a month. No problem. Now that  there is no curfew, we can unplug the refrigerator and buy fresh  produce every day. The problem is with the television. We  cannot go through the day without the news. He will apparently  use the battery in his car.    A Bedouin family in Rimal is busy building a fence around  their house. They ran away from Beersheba in 1948. Some of  their relatives still live in Tel Sheva'. In Rimal they are a  clan of several dozen. Now they are worried. Land in Rimal is  expensive, and the Palestinian authorities may now demand they  evacuate the area because they built on "state land." The best  is to hoard weapons and be ready for what lies in store.    "We are from Bet Dagan. My grandfather had a large orange  orchard there, which still exists. When I was 12, our entire  family in Gaza went on a trip to Israel. We also went to my  grandfather's orchard in Bet Dagan. To this day, my mother  talks about that orchard. When they escaped to Gaza in 1948  they had a lot of money. My mother told my father: Let's buy a  plot of land here, let's build a home. But my father told her:  What for? We will be back in Bet Dagan in a week.    "I worked in a grilled meat joint in Holon. Every summer I  would go to the orchard in Bet Dagan, steal a few oranges, take  them to my mother in Gaza, and tell her: These are from  grandpa's orchard."    I ask him: "So what, do you dream of going back to Bet  Dagan?"    He replies: "My mother does. I no longer do, there is no  chance. But we have at home Turkish papers of our deed on the  orchard. Now I take very good care of them. In another three  years they will start talking about the right of return.  Perhaps they will talk with us about compensation."    Within a few days -- they have been talking about "a few  days" for a long time now -- 'Arafat must present the list of  the 24 members of the autonomy council. These will make up the  government of Gaza and Jericho, and if it works out, they will  also get powers over the rest of the West Bank. Then, according  to plans, there will be elections. The elections were scheduled  to be held in July, when the talk was that Israel would hand  over Gaza in December. December went by, so will July, and  nobody believes elections will be held before December '94, and  'Arafat has not yet finished compiling the list.    "That's how 'Arafat works," a local political activist  says. "You are only now getting to know him. But we know that  'Arafat will issue the list at the 11th hour, and even that will  not be the final list. He has one list in his left pocket and  another in his right pocket; one in his attache case, another in  the drawer, three others in the closet, and 200 men are walking  around the territories, each one of them with a list 'Arafat  sent him by fax, and all the lists are hot air."    Ilyas Frayj from Bethlehem agreed to be included in the  list.  So did Dr. Zakariya al-Agha from Gaza. 'Arafat wants them in  because he is sure of their allegiance. Dr. Furayh Abu-Middayn  also acceded. He is more acceptable to the locals. "In the end  we will give him the same job like that woman you have, the one  with the teased hairdo, Miryam Ben-Porat."    "We will take a look at the list and decide accordingly,"  journalist Tawfiq Abu-Husa, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip  says. "If it looks good to us, we will work with them. If not,  we will tell 'Arafat: With all due respect, you are the  president, you compile the lists, but tell us one thing: When  will the elections be held?"    In the meantime, local leaders resort to tactics. Dr. Hanan  'Ashrawi is out of the picture. Sa'ib 'Urayqat decided now, of  all times, to go to London to collect material about a future  election. 'Arafat should get the hint. Faysal al-Husayni  protests. People in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are busy  building the infrastructure for political parties. Fatah is  becoming a party. PFLP [Palestinian Front for the Liberation of  Palestine] and DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine] activists are launching propaganda campaigns  criticizing the agreement. Everything is politics.    Fatah men take the newly-arrived generals to visit the  refugee camps. "They are completely detached from the reality  in the field," one activist says, "and it is very important that  they know what the people think so that we do not reach a  situation where they, our own police, are perceived as foreign  rulers, just as the Israelis. General Ziyad al-Atrash, the  former commander of the Palestinian force in Algiers, is already  visiting the camps, talking to people, and feeling great among  them. There are others who have not yet managed to make  contact. They will have a problem."    In the midst of all this, some people are making their  electoral calculations. Some 7,000 Palestinian policemen, along  with their families, will be arriving from the Arab countries.  A cautious estimate puts their total number at 50,000.  According to another cautious estimate, about half of them are  eligible voters. This is significant.    People in Nabulus, Ramallah, and Janin are closely watching  what is and what will be happening in Gaza. They are the next  in line. Apparently, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] also  understands that. The whole way from Petah Tiqva to Nabulus I  did not see even one IDF patrol on the road. Author David  Grossman's book "The Yellow Wind" has turned into the "yellow  line." A yellow line crosses the length of Nabulus so that a  settler from Elon More should not, God forbid, make a wrong turn  in the road. I did not see even one car with yellow license  plates [Israeli-owned] on the road. Driving through Nabulus'  main street, people looked at my Israeli vehicle with  astonishment. Who is that nut?    "What troubles me," a Gush Emunim settler told me, "is that  what Rabin said about the IDF being primarily committed to  protect the inhabitants within the Green Line is slowly sinking  in. The IDF sees to Ethiopians who come from Gundar, and to us  it doesn't? Just like everybody else, I am sure that terror  attacks here will now increase. So, to cover his ass the chief  of staff says he expects this. But what about practical  measures? I want the IDF to obligate us to drive in convoys  escorted by security guards to ensure our safety."    "But then you will say that the IDF restricts your  movements," I tell him. "Whoever wants to say that, let him.  However, this is what the IDF must do; it must understand that  it is also responsible for our security."    Jericho is said to have been one of the calmest spots during  the intifadah. Anybody driving through Jericho understands why:  water, greenery, the climate. Those who own land, deal with  the land and not with firebombs.    Hardly any incident was registered in 'Ayn al-Bayda',  halfway  between Tubas and Nabulus, during the intifadah. It is a  beautiful spot. Streams flow by the road, there is a lot of  greenery, and a developed industry of carpets made of the  abundant reeds growing in the area.    Plastic chairs can be seen on every roof; a sign that people  sit in the terrace in the evenings, breathing fresh air, and  relaxing. Usually, in such places there are not many PLO flags.  In local joints, 'Arafat's picture hangs next to the popular  poster of the crying child. "Allah willing," says Ahmad Tubasi,  "soon we will also have autonomy." What do you mean by soon?  He replies: Elections, a state, whatever.    He has never been and may never be in Gaza. He will soon go  visit Jericho, and so probably will other people from Ramallah  and Nabulus, "to see what a Palestinian state is. In the  meantime, we have our home, our fields. If there is no state,  we will also manage; we will go visit the state."    The Jericho bypass road is another story. A narrow and bumpy  road which prolongs the way to Jerusalem by another 15 minutes.  You fantasize about lunch in some garden restaurant in the  city, but have to make do with a hot dog and mustard in a  roadside diner.    All traffic has been diverted to the Jericho bypass for a  week now. There is no access to Jerusalem until the  Palestinians are done taking over. On Monday, singer Ari'el  Zilber will perform at the diner. Perhaps he will cheer up the  residents of Ma'ale Efrayim and Patza'el. About 50 reservists  were lying on the lawn outside the diner this week. They did  not feel like going anywhere. "Come on guys," the officer  exhorted them, "get going." "Come off it," the unit's clown  answered, "it is a pity we did not leave them the gasoline too."  Then I see a long and endless row of dozens of jeeps by the  roadside. Carrying only the radio equipment, the soldiers are  on their way to their base near Jerusalem. The Jericho exodus.    Passage to and from Jericho has been blocked for a week.  Locals crowd the square waiting for the arrival of the police.  The media and other foreigners wait outside. Assertive border  policemen prohibit the entry. Journalists covering the  territories threaten to appeal to the High Court of Justice. As  far as the IDF is concerned, they can go on threatening. Who is  allowed to enter Jericho? Locals, inhabitants of the  territories, and tourists. If the tourists have an Israeli  driver with the proper papers, they will be allowed in. Israeli  Arabs will not. So, why does the car with yellow license plates  ahead of me enter? These are Arabs from East Jerusalem, the  border policeman tells me, they own houses in Jericho.    If people do not see this as a sign of what is yet to come  --  the question of Jerusalem, who will vote and who will be elected  in the territories -- then they know nothing about signs.    The American Colony Hotel is still the base of the foreign  media in the territories. There I meet Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, a  Palestinian representative to the talks with Israel. Abu-Ziyad  does not want an official job, but he pulls strings and walks  around with a cellular phone. He can dial 'Arafat whenever he  wants, and get an answer.    He, just like me, does not believe the interim arrangement  in  the Gaza Strip and the West Bank will last long. "The  Gaza-Jericho agreement should be allowed to work for a short  time, but the question of the settlements will come up  immediately afterward. The settlements are connected with  everything. Do they want us to take over health affairs in the  West Bank? The question of the settlements contaminating the  environment with their sewage water will immediately come up.  Do they want us to take over education? There are places in the  territories where the Army forces schools to open at 0700 so  that there are no children on the roads when the settlers drive  to work. If they want to talk with us about elections,  according to the agreement the IDF must withdraw its troops from  populated areas. How can it do that when it must also guard the  access roads to the settlements? In my opinion, the whole  process will be accelerated."    "Not everything is up to 'Arafat," a local Gazan activist  tells me. "Our goal now is to show that what we are talking  about here is a state. You may say whatever you want, but we  will do what we understand. 'Arafat may also say whatever he  wants, but he should bear in mind that in the last seven years  we got used to rebelling. Nobody will force us to do something  we do not agree to."</p>

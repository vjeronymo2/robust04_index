			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Walker creditors' meeting adjourned for two weeks MR GEORGE Walker, former head of the Brent Walker property and leisure group, survived another round in his fight to avoid bankruptcy yesterday when a meeting of his creditors was adjourned for two weeks. Creditors have put in claims exceeding Pounds 150m. Mr Walker has proposed a voluntary arrangement which he said would give creditors more than they would receive under bankruptcy. It would require a 75 per cent majority, by value, of creditors to accept Mr Walker's proposal. Mr Michael Colman, of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, said that creditors representing Pounds 40m of debts, just over 25 per cent, had indicated opposition. Mr Raymond Hocking, an insolvency partner of Stoy Hayward, who was appointed by the court to investigate Mr Walker's proposal and who would supervise the voluntary arrangement if agreed, had decided that the voting was too close to put Mr Walker into bankruptcy yesterday. He is to spend the next two weeks examining the claims again to decide exactly how the votes should split between creditors. Under the voluntary arrangement, Mr Hocking has estimated the creditors could recoup Pounds 14.7m whereas only Pounds 96,767 would be available if Mr Walker was declared bankrupt. Mr Walker has promised to give half his after tax income from his new job, as chief executive of a company recently incorporated in the CIS, to creditors for the next three years. He expects an income in 1993 of Pounds 100,000. He has also pledged his 1.5m shares in Brent Walker and shares in two private companies, two properties, his one-sixth share in an apartment in Switzerland, and the proceeds of a legal claim in France expected to produce Pounds 14.5m. He has promised that any other assets he had would go to creditors as well, such as the proceeds of claims against Brent Walker which would not proceed if he was declared bankrupt. Mr Walker said his house in Essex was in his wife's name because it had been a wedding present from her father in 1964, when it had cost Pounds 3,000. Mr Walker said that the creditors which opposed the arrangement were the banks - including TSB Bank, Standard Chartered, Lloyds, Svenska, Credit Suisse and Hill Samuel - which were also the main bankers to Brent Walker. He said he thought these banks opposed the arrangement because they believed he was lying about his assets. In the proposal put to creditors he said that any material non-disclosure would be a ground for default on the arrangement and the supervisor or any creditor could then present a bankruptcy petition against him.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRAWING THE LINE ON JIMI  </P> <P> Randy Lewis' self-righteous article ("From a Self-Righteous Watchtower Comes a  Verdict on Jimi Hendrix," Oct. 29) made me wonder what Randy thought was so  dangerous about a "black-and-white attitude about drugs." It seems pretty black  and white to me. Drugs don't have any place in our society. They kill people!  </P> <P> Additionally, I don't believe the 100-plus students who wanted Hendrix's mural  painted over had, as their motive, a desire to "eliminate from our eyes, ears,  hearts and minds" anyone or anything. It seems they simply don't want their  school glorifying, by means of a mural, a musician whose life was so dominated  by drugs that they caused his death.  </P> <P> I think it is unfortunate that (Ridgefield (Conn.) High School student  Jonathan) Fulkerson doesn't represent the majority of students. It seems to me  that "mature" and "courageous," rather than "self-righteous" and "pimple-faced"  are the proper choice of adjectives for Jonathan Fulkerson and his friends.  </P> <P> ERIC SNYDER  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

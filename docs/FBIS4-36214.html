			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, June 4, IRNA -- The 12-member European Union  (EU) and the Islamic Republic of Iran have decided to continue  their dialogue to promote and widen relations following talks  between EU and Iranian officials in Athens Friday.    "We have decided to continue our discussion and exchange of  views on various issues of mutual interest," 'Ali Ahani,  director general for West European affairs at Iran's foreign  ministry, told IRNA in an interview Saturday.    It was the third round of meeting between Iran and the EU.  The first two rounds were held in Copenhagen and Brussels.    The Iranain delegation, led by deputy foreign minister for  Euro-American affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi and the EU troika, headed  by Greek Foreign Under Secretary George Papandreou, held  marathon 3-hour talks yesterday.    The EU troika consists of the former, the current and the  forthcoming holder of the rotating EU presidency, namely  Belgium, Greece and Germany.    "We have very good relations with all the EU countries, in  economic, political and cultural fields. But we should try to  have the same level of cooperation with the EU in its totality,"  said Ahani.    Asked to comment on the recent expulsion of an Iranain  diplomat from London and a British diplomat from Tehran, Ahani  said he hoped the matter has now closed and there would be no  further expulsions.    "I hope it will be stopped. We don't want to have tension in  relations with any EU member," he said. The tensions were  created by the British side, Ahani added.    The Iranian delegation left Athens Saturday after a 2-day  visit during which they met Greek government officials and  discussed bilateral political, economic and cultural ties.    Va'ezi was received by Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreau, the current euprht welcomed the expansion of  Athens-Tehran ties and also Iran's relations with the EU.    Ahani said Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will be  visiting Tehran next week to continue discussions on bilateral  relations and on regional and international issues.    Pointing that Greece currently holds the EU Presidency,  Ahani  said the Greek Minister's visit will offer an important  opportunity to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf region,  the Balkans And europe.

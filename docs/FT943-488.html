			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Muted welcome from life insurers - Some disappointment by Coloroll ruling / FT reporters analyse yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice which are expected to form a definitive framework under which employers and scheme trustees can provide equal pensions for men and women Some progress, but could have done better: UK life companies gave the court judgments a muted welcome. As life insurers sought to assimilate the implications of the rulings, it was already clear that not all the questions on which they had been hoping for decisions had been answered. 'It has removed a lot of the uncertainty, but we are not at the end of the line,' was the comment from Standard Life. Mr Peter Timberlake, marketing manager at Legal &amp; General, called for the case to be incorporated into UK law through the pensions legislation which is expected to be brought before parliament in the new session, in order to give trustees of schemes a legal framework on which they could rely. He believed there was such emphasis in the Coloroll judgment on defined benefit pension schemes that there would need to be another case to settle the position of money-purchase pension schemes. These are schemes where money is invested annually on an employee's behalf. Mr David Linnell, group actuary and compliance officer at Prudential Corporation, expressed disappointment that the court did not appear to have framed the Coloroll judgment in terms that would apply to all schemes. He also said that aspects of the position for part-time workers were still unclear. There was some good news for life companies as trustees of insolvent schemes are able to proceed to winding up the schemes. On winding up, most schemes buy deferred annuities from insurance companies in order to pay out the same level of benefits to current and potential pensioners.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Irish amend abortion protocol The Irish government has sent its European Community partners suggested amendments to a special Irish abortion protocol built into the Maastricht treaty on European union, Reuter reports from Dublin. The protocol, due to be included in an Irish referendum in June, has to be changed following the case of a 14-year-old rape victim who was initially banned from having an abortion in Britain. The Supreme Court, fearing the girl would kill herself unless she had an abortion, overruled the lower court ban. It also said abortion should be allowed in Ireland in certain limited circumstances when the woman's life was threatened.</p>

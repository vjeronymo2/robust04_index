			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Pensions provision poses hard choices for the future: Targeted state schemes and new company plans urged Personal pensions have had a bad press in the past year. Yet the controversy over how they have been sold has obscured a larger issue: whether the rise of personal pensions is a passing fashion or a permanent change in pensions provision. In the past few years, the structure of pension provision in the UK has been revolutionised and with it the relative incomes of pensioners. The revolution, the details of which are outlined in Pension Policy in the UK: an Economic Analysis, published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, means pensioners are no longer society's poorest group. The income of richer pensioners has risen faster than average incomes over the past 15 years or so: for the top 20 per cent of pensioners the rise was more than 50 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91. But the gulf between rich and poor pensioners widened. In the same period, incomes of the poorest 20 per cent rose by only about 10 per cent. State benefits now make up only half of pensioner incomes. For those reliant largely on state-provided pensions the future does not look rosy: the value of the contributory basic pension fell from 20 per cent of average male earnings at the end of the 1970s to 15 per cent at the start of the 1990s. By the middle of the next century it will fall to just 6 per cent or 7 per cent. The generosity of the supplementary State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) was curtailed in the 1980s. Increasingly, the income-tested sector (income support and housing related benefits) will be a significant source of income for the poorest elderly people while the rest come to rely more on private income. The perception that state provision is diminishing has fuelled the expansion of the personal pension sector. This growth in individual provision has been enhanced partly because coverage of workers by traditional occupational pension schemes peaked over two decades ago. In future, more people will retire with pension values determined by the success of their plan's investments rather than the scheme's tenure or earnings. The extent of these shifts is often underestimated. For example, among private-sector workers covered by a private pension, a majority (about 6m) belong to a contracted out money purchase or personal pension rather than to an occupational scheme (5.6m), according to the government actuary. Should this trend towards personal provision be resisted? As far as the basic pension is concerned a coherent and transparent policy is needed which will continue the move towards greater targeting of state resources, without creating the pitfalls of the current system of means-testing. Given the increasing diversity of pensioner incomes and the future increase in the numbers of pensioners simply raising benefit levels within the present structure will be expensive and inappropriate. It is often suggested that personal pensions are inherently riskier than other forms of provision. But reliance on state pensions is also risky: policy changes over the past 15 years have reduced both basic and earnings related components below expectations. The move towards defined contribution schemes feeds on some of the risks attached to traditional defined benefit schemes. Such schemes are inappropriate for many. Traditional occupational schemes penalise those who move jobs frequently, and often reward long servers and high earners disproportionately. So long as they do, defined contribution schemes, which are more flexible, will spread. In the US since 1975, 80 per cent of newly covered workers have joined defined contribution schemes. To compete, traditional occupational schemes must reform.

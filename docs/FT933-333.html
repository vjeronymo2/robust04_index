			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ugine plans to increase capital of US unit UGINE, part of the Usinor Sacilor French state-owned steel group, plans to increase the capital of its US stainless steel operation and float part of the company on the New York stock market. Mr Philippe Chopping de Janvry, chairman of Ugine, said the capital raised would be in the order of 'hundreds of millions of dollars'. He said it would be used to reduce debt of around FFr6.5bn (Dollars 1.14bn), and finance investments at J&amp;L Specialty Products, the US stainless steel operation. Ugine will raise the capital through the sale of 15.6m shares in Specialty Materials Corp (SMC), which holds 100 per cent of J&amp;L. It plans to offer 40 per cent of SMC through a capital increase, and 60 per cent through the issue of shares it already owns. Ugine said that SMC and J&amp;L will be merged as part of its reorganisation of US activities. The French group will keep between 50 and 55 per cent of the new company, to be called J&amp;L Specialty Steel. In addition to the capital raising and reorganisation in the US, Ugine announced a net loss of FFr65m for the first six months of the year, an improvement on losses of FFr87m for the same period last year. The result was achieved on sales 6 per cent lower at FFr7.6bn. For the current half year, Ugine expects a decline in operating profits compared with the first six months, but an improvement over the second half of 1992. It said this outlook did not take account of the proceeds of the partial sale of the US unit. For 1992 as a whole, Ugine reported a net loss of FFr365m. The sale of shares in North America is to be managed by Merrill Lynch, Credit Lyonnais Securities and J. P Morgan. An estimated 30 per cent of the shares will be offered to investors elsewhere.</p>

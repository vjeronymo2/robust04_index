			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATWATER VILLAGE TO LOSE ITS VIGILANT BUT TIRED PROTECTOR  </P> <P> For 20 minutes, slender, white-haired, hard-talking Ed Waite rolled out his  tell-it-like-it-is monologue, the news from Atwater Village.  </P> <P> He recited every zone change, every variance, every building permit, every  demolition in the works since the last time his group got together. He added a  word about crime and dispelled the inevitable rumors that pass through an  aroused community.  </P> <P> Last, he came to the rumor his followers were not prepared to deal with.  </P> <P> "Yes, I am going to leave Atwater, leave Los Angeles," Waite said. "My house is  up for sale. I divorced my wife."  </P> <P> A flutter of gasps went through the Glenfeliz School auditorium. Whether they  were for the weight of the news itself or the bluntness of the delivery was  impossible to distinguish.  </P> <P> Since Waite, now 62, founded the Atwater Village Homeowner Assn. in 1982, to  block the construction of a church auditorium, he and his unyielding manner  have been indivisible from its identity.  </P> <P> To his followers, Waite's unexpected departure will be the loss of their eyes  and ears, their voice in City Hall, their one, virtually unchallenged,  authority.  </P> <P> Riding his bicycle through the streets of the old and determinedly static  residential community between Glendale and the Los Angeles River, Waite had  monitored change with a vigilant eye. He spotted crime, zoning violations,  abandoned vehicles and illegal construction. He reported all with equal zeal.  </P> <P> In regular trips to City Hall, he tracked down the paper-work signs of coming  development. He reported virtually every developer's move to the 100 to 200  residents who consistently turned out at meetings. Those they didn't like, he  fought.  </P> <P> He kept the guard up to the end.  </P> <P> "Over at 4040 Edenhurst you're going to have an eight-unit apartment house,"  Waite said in his final monologue last week. "The man doesn't seem to want to  cooperate with the people in that area . . . We asked him to cut it down to  four. He won't do it. He doesn't care about the community because he doesn't  live here."  </P> <P> Naturally, Waite made enemies along the way.  </P> <P> Waite's opposition to a Los Feliz minimart owner's request for a city beer and  wine license left permanent scars between Waite and leaders of the Atwater  Village Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "I believe that Ed Waite was an integral part of improving this community,"  said Gerald (Red) Meade, chamber president. "There were a lot of people who  disagreed with him in the way he did it. I saw him persecute certain people and  not persecute other people.  </P> <P> "He never really helped the business community in any form," Meade said.  "Whoever takes over, I certainly hope he fairly helps every part of the  community and not just certain parts."  </P> <P> Waite alluded to his detractors in his final monologue Thursday night.  </P> <P> "Councilman John Ferraro called and said, 'Hey Ed, I hear you're leaving town.  They finally caught up with you, huh?' Well, I don't know who caught up with me  yet. There hasn't been anybody come to my door with a shotgun."  </P> <P> Waite simply pleaded fatigue as his reason for leaving the town he lived in  since 1955.  </P> <P> "I haven't had a vacation in 20 1/2 years," he said. "I've put in a lot of  hours. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying I haven't had any life of my own.  So I'm going to go and start over somewhere. I'll either go north or out of  state."  </P> <P> Waite told his followers that five people had already approached him about  taking over the association after he is gone. He said he told them they would  have to try it without his support because he didn't believe they were sincere.  "That's the way I will protect the community of Atwater," he said.  </P> <P> Someone from the audience asked if he might change his mind and come back some  day.  </P> <P> "I will never return to Atwater once I leave," Waite said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Colonel Juan Antonio </F> Martinez by an unidentified reporter from the Presidente Hotel  in San Salvador--live]    [Text] [Reporter] We want to hear Interior Minister Colonel  Juan Antonio Martinez Varela's opinion on the elections, because  he was a member of the commission that reached the peace  agreement in Chapultepec. Colonel, pleased to have you with us.    [Martinez] Thank you very much. I am pleased to have the  opportunity to salute the Salvadoran people on such an important  occasion. This was a historic day when the ideas, concerns,  values, and all things that interest the Salvadoran people were  at stake.    I think this enormous number of observers who came here will  attest to what happened here, that this was for real. The  results will reflect much of the Salvadoran people's political  and mental development. We hope the people will grow fully  aware that what transpired here represents a great step forward  for the Salvadoran people.    [Reporter] Is this electoral process, which concluded on 21  March with nationwide general elections, a way to consolidate  the effort you, as a negotiating commissioner, as a commissioner  for dialogue, made to reach the agreements in Chapultepec two  years ago?    [Martinez] Undoubtedly, I think so. A phase was virtually  closed, and, I think, another phase has begun. The elections  reflect the preferences of the Salvadoran people, and this is  why we are anxious to learn about the official results. Various  quarters have reported the initial unofficial results. We  reached this phase and another phase, which will strengthen the  country's democratic development, has started. [sentence as  heard]</p>

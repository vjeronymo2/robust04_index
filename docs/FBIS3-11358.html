			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by magistrates of the Salvadoran Supreme </F> Electoral Tribunal, TSE, from the Presidente Hotel in San  Salvador -- live]    [Excerpts] [TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar Romero]  Mr. President of the Republic; Messrs. members of the  diplomatic corps; Messrs. visiting observers and personalities;  Messrs. of the media; ladies and gentlemen:    On this glorious 20 March, we are concluding a vital process  for the life of our beloved El Salvador. The Salvadoran TSE,  for the past two years and plus days since it was installed,  after being born to the country's juridical life as a result of  the constitutional reforms stemming from the peace agreements  about which we all know, has worked very arduously to reach this  day when we, the TSE magistrates and all the personnel working  in it, feel very pleased. We feel very pleased for having  delivered to our country, because we have worked arduously in a  clean and honest effort to ensure the obtained results are also  the result of a free and just election, very clean and honest.    Your presence reaffirms, based on the expressions we heard  on  this day, that we did things well, that we did not fail our  homeland. Behind that backdrop, we will proceed in this plain  but solemn ceremony for our country's life, because we think  this 20 March will go down in the history of not only El  Salvador or America but of the entire world, because we want to  be an example for the world.    To not tire you, we will proceed with the core of this  ceremony. We will start to give results shortly of the various  vote count certificates of the Voting Table Boards and a few of  the Municipal Electoral Boards that we are receiving.    I know we are all impatient to learn about those results.  They will arrive. Let's wait for a moment to allow the company  that specializes in computer sciences which we have hired to  develop what we all want to see through the computer program; in  fact, this will be the reflection of the verdict of the  Salvadoran people. This will install the authorities who  managed to win the Salvadorans' will and trust to consolidate  democracy in our country and the much- longed for peace which we  know has arrived for all Salvadorans. Thank you very much.  [applause] [passage omitted]    The following are the results after the votes cast at 870  Voting Table Boards, the equivalent of 12.45 percent of the  total vote, were counted and processed: ARENA [Nationalist  Republican Alliance]--91,069 votes; the Coalition [Democratic  Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]--51,039  votes; MAC [Authentic Christian Movement]--1,111 votes; the  Unity Movement-- 4,248 votes; the National Solidarity  Movement--1,471 votes; the PCN [National Conciliation  Party]--6,574 votes; and the PDC [Christian Democratic  Party]--22,282 votes.

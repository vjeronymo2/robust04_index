			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW AT FINALS  </P> <P> For some, it's the thrill of a lifetime. For others, it's a steppingstone to  the next stop, the Southern Regionals.  </P> <P> Eight teams -- five making return engagements, three celebrating their coming  of age -- vie for San Diego Section Division IV and V girls' and boys'  basketball titles today and tonight at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "This is a good opportunity for us," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "Not  too many kids have the opportunity to play in the Sports Arena." Wright's  Patriots (13-11) will take a measure of experience -- they defeated Mountain  Empire for the Division IV title last year -- into their 8:30 game against  Coronado (11-13), first-time visitors to the arena.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Christian also has the distinction of coming from the City Central  league, joining Lincoln (Division III) and San Diego (Division I) also in the  Section finals.  </P> <P> "We've been through the war with a lot of these teams," Wright said.  </P> <P> Coronado, picked to finished last in the 10-team 3-A Metro Conference, finished  a surprising fourth.  </P> <P> But Coronado Coach Bob Stanton knows what kind of competition his team will  face. "Christian is going to be tough," Stanton said. "We have to get on  (David) Jeremiah and work to break their press."  </P> <P> Jeremiah is averaging 23 points and Darrell White 18. Tim Barkett has come on  late in the season and has averaged 18 points in the last eight games. Coronado  will rely on co-captains Jesse MacNeill (18-point average) and Derek Wastila  (14).  </P> <P> Wright said Christian's success will depend on "executing our offense and  playing with poise and intensity on defense."  </P> <P> At 4:30, Desert League rivals Calipatria (16-7) -- the defending Division V  champion -- and Imperial (13-9) -- the Desert League champion -- meet for the  sixth time this season, with Calipatria winning four out of the five played.  </P> <P> Mike Moss is Calipatria's only returning starter, but Javier Vega and Vince  Coleman, who came off the bench last year, add experience. Fourth-seeded  Calipatria knocked off top-ranked Bishop's to advance to the championship  round.  </P> <P> For Imperial, Brian Williams is the player to stop, but the Tigers are hurt by  the absence of Fabian Diaz, out with a badly sprained ankle.  </P> <P> In the girls' Division IV final, defending champion and top-ranked Holtville  will play third-seeded Coronado at 6:30, a rematch of last's year's  championship, which Holtville won.  </P> <P> In the Division V game at 2:30, top-seeded Calvin Christian (23-1) will try to  defeat second-seeded La Jolla Country Day (16-5) -- the defending Division V  champion -- for the third time this season.  </P></p>

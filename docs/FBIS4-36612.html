			<p>BFN     [Text] JANA's international affairs editor has commented on  remarks made by an assistant U.S. Secretary of State, who said  that his government does not hide its concern over the so-called  the nuclear capabilities of some states, including the Great  Jamahiriyah.    The editor said: These statements, which U.S. officials are  not weary of reiterating, can no longer be believed by anyone.  In fact, they have become the object of world ridicule for  several reasons, the most important being:    1. The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly affirmed that it  does  not have the capability to possess nuclear weapons and has not  even thought of possessing them. Nuclear weapons are not the  subject of its interest, which focuses entirely on planning,  preparing, and implementing programs to build its economy and  have sufficient water and food, despite the unjust measures used  by the imperialist states to obstruct this and deprive the  Libyan Arab people of the chance make progress on their land.    2. The U.S. official was not embarrassed to claim that his  government feels concern over the countries he mentioned,  including the Great Jamahiriyah. Who feels concern toward whom?  The small people seeking to build development and progress on  the basis of adhering to their sovereignty and independence are  the ones who feel concern over the nuclear states and their  arsenals of weapons against mankind, environment, security, and  peace in the world and over these states' blackmail behavior  against small people to sequester their independence, rob their  wealth, and impose tutelage on them.    3. If the U.S. Government really cares for world security  and  stability, it should have focused its attention on the Israeli  enemy, who has proudly declared before the world that it  possesses nuclear bombs and weapons of mass destruction.  Although this constitutes a real danger to the security, peace,  and stability of the region and the world, the U.S.  Administration is not worried by it. On the contrary, it has  supported and participated with the Israelis in developing these  weapons and helping them acquire more of them.    The editor went on to say: We are not surprised by this U.S.  stand because we know the reasons why the U.S. Government has  not taken any measures against the Israelis. Foremost of these  reasons is that no U.S. president can win the U.S. presidential  elections and enter the White House without the funds and  support of the Jews. We also know that the real capital of the  United States is not Washington but Tel Aviv.    Regarding the warnings and threats contained in the U.S.  official's remarks, the U.S. Government is the first to realize  that this style is futile with the Great Jamahiriyah and its  free and sovereign people.</p>

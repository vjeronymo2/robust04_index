			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Doubts surface on BBC governors' undertakings SENIOR BBC staff were last night casting doubt on the commitment of the corporation's governors to honour an undertaking made on Thursday to redefine their roles and responsibilities. It emerged yesterday that the governors had been angered by criticisms of their role in the appointment of Mr John Birt, first as deputy director-general and then, from January 1 this year, as director-general. Those criticisms, by the BBC's 41-member general advisory council, have apparently encouraged the governors to dig their heels in and resist pressure to undertake a thorough reform of their role. One senior source at the BBC said yesterday: 'The only thing that is likely to change the mood of the governors now is if any of the general advisory council members threaten to resign in protest.' The dominance of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the board of governors, over the activities of the board of governors will not be affected by Thursday's statement. A source close to the governors said things would go on as before. Four of the governors, including Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, are due to retire at the end of July. However, 'even after they are gone the chairman will still be there, as will the director-general,' said a figure in the BBC yesterday. The general advisory council is not due to meet again for several months. But several of its members, including Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, have indicated their firm wish that Mr Hussey should resign. Meanwhile, it was still unclear yesterday whether Mr Birt has agreed to give a financial indemnity to the BBC if problems with the Inland Revenue emerged because of a reassessment of his tax status. The BBC said yesterday that it would broadcast four of its radio networks by Astra satellite from April 3. Households in the UK and a large part of western Europe, will be able to receive Radios 1, 4 and 5, as well as World Service broadcasts, by tuning into the UK Gold television channel. The BBC has a 20 per cent stake in UK Gold and Thames Television 15 per cent. TCI, the largest US cable operator, has 27 per cent and another US company, Cox Cable, 38 per cent. Astra is owned by the Luxembourg-based company SES. Listeners to the satellite broadcasts will require a fixed satellite dish, costing about Pounds 400, until digital audio technology becomes available in the next few years, making portable listening possible.</p>

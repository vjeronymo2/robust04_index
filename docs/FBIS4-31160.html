			<p>BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 2 Jun -- Borislav Mikelic, prime minister  of the government of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today  denied reports that representatives of the RSK and Croatia were  going to resume talks in Athens, Greece. "We have not yet fixed  a location and date for further negotiations between Knin and  Zagreb. I am not sure how some news organizations have come up  with reports that this is going to take place in Athens,"  Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio.    "Our attitude is known anyway; anywhere except in Germany or  within Croatia's borders," Mikelic added. He stressed that he  was waiting for the next meeting with cochairmen Owen and  Stoltenberg which will probably take place next week in Geneva.  "Only when we have presented our arguments and heard their  opinion will we decide where to hold further negotiations,"  Mikelic said.    The RSK prime minister said that the dispute over where to  hold talks "increasingly resembles a match that is under way."  [as received] He accuses the three EU ambassadors who released a  six-point statement in Knin in early May, thereby prejudicing a  political solution, of stalling the negotiations. Asked by the  Obrenovac Radio presenter about a possible alliance between  Italy and the RSK, Mikelic said that he would soon meet Italian  Prime Minister Berlusconi and that he saw no reason why Krajina  should not cooperate with one of Europe's economic powers.    "At the moment Croatia should pay more attention to Dalmatia  and Istria than to us. First, we are another country. Second,  they should save whatever can be saved. Certainly, the Kuna  will not save them but let Europe witness where Croatia has  ended up under the leadership of the Croatian Democratic Union,"  Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio.</p>

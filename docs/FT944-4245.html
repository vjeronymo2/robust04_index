			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Company director jailed for canoe deaths The managing director of a leisure company was yesterday jailed for three years for the manslaughter of four teenagers who died on a canoe trip. And in a landmark ruling his company was also found guilty of four charges of manslaughter - the first time a company has been found guilty of such an offence. Establishing that companies can be held criminally liable has proved exceptionally difficult in the past. Mr Peter Kite had denied the charges which arose from the trip organised by an activity centre run by his company. The company - OLL, formerly Active Learning and Leisure - also denied the charges and was fined Pounds 60,000. The four school pupils died in Lyme Bay after setting out from Lyme Regis in Dorset. They spent hours in the water when their drifting canoes were swamped. Sentencing Mr Kite, of Richmond, London, Mr Justice Ognall told Winchester Crown Court that safety procedures at activity centres could not be 'left to the inadequate vagaries of self-regulation' and called for an immediate and thorough appraisal by the government. He said his comments should be conveyed to Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, and Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, responsible for the coastguards. Mr Kite was found guilty by a majority after a 16-day trial. OLL was also convicted on a majority verdict. Mr Justice Ognall directed the jury to return not guilty verdicts for Mr Joseph Stoddart, 53, the centre manager. Mr Stoddart, of West Lulworth, Dorset, had denied the manslaughter of the pupils from Southway School, Plymouth, Devon, on March 22 last year. The judge told Mr Kite he had been found criminally responsible for the deaths of Dean Sayer, Simon Dunne, Claire Langley and Rachel Walker - although he had not intended harm to the victims. But the judge, referring to a letter written by two former instructors warning about safety standards at the centre, said Mr Kite had been given notice in 'chilling, clear terms' of the risks he was running. 'That forecast became a reality because of your complete failure to heed it.' The judge said Mr Kite had a duty to put in place and enforce a system designed to protect his charges from unnecessary risk. Mr Kite must have known what was required of him. He said: 'I regret to say it seems to me there is force in the suggestion made - to a degree you were more interested in sales than in safety.'</p>

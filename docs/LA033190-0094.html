			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW REQUIRING INCREASED PARKING GETS  INITIAL OK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council tentatively approved an ordinance Friday requiring  an increase in parking spaces at new theaters, health clubs, restaurants,  retail stores and trade schools.  </P> <P> But under the threat of a veto by Mayor Tom Bradley, the council backed away  from an attempt to increase required parking at new offices, business and  manufacturing sites.  </P> <P> Currently, most non-residential construction must include two parking spaces  per 1,000 square feet of building, but homeowners near such areas as Westwood  and Ventura boulevards, where on-street parking is at a premium, have been  pressing for a change.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which goes to the council again next week, calls for four or  more parking spaces for the retail establishments but keeps the old requirement  for offices and other businesses.  </P></p>

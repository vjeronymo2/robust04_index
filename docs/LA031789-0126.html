			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Seagram Co.: The Montreal-based producer and marketer of distilled spirits,  wines, coolers and juices said 1988 profit rose 13.1% to $589.5 million from a  year ago. Sales increased 32.5% to $5.1 billion, an improvement the company  attributed to the additions of Tropicana and Martell as well as to significant  growth in its international business. Seagram said the increase in net earnings  reflected the strength of its beverage business and the particularly good  results reported by Du Pont. At year-end, Seagram held a 22.9% interest in Du  Pont.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 12  </P></p>

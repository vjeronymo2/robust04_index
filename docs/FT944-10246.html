			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / BT pays the price of job and cost cuts: Chairman warns on outlook for the annual results as shares ease The cost of cutting prices and jobs held back revenues and profitability at British Telecommunications in the first six months of the year. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman, warned that the second-half results would be affected by the same factors, influencing a 5p fall in the share price to 388p. Despite a stronger UK economy which helped to push up inland call volumes by more than 7 per cent, profits before tax were Pounds 1.49bn, slightly below the Pounds 1.5bn recorded last time. Turnover rose to Pounds 6.85bn compared with Pounds 6.76bn. Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 15p. Sir Iain said the group's underlying performance was strong, arguing that after adjustments for redundancy charges of Pounds 151m, a Pounds 75m premium on the repurchase of bonds and the effects on the results of the disposal of group undertakings, turnover was up by 2.4 per cent in both the second quarter and the half year. On the same basis, pre-tax profits rose 5.2 per cent in the second quarter and 3.7 per cent in the half year while earnings per share were up 5 per cent in the second quarter and 3.4 per cent in the half year. An interim dividend of 7.05p will be paid representing a 6 per cent improvement on last time. Sir Iain said it represented a compromise between a fair return to shareholders and the present and future needs of the business. At the same stage last year, he had warned that the 8.1 per cent rate of dividend growth awarded then was unlikely to be maintained. The group had dropped prices 11 times this year under the conditions of its pricing formula and had already returned about Pounds 1bn to customers in the form of price cuts with a further Pounds 400m to be shaved in the present year. Mr Michael Hepher, managing director, claimed success for the 'Good to talk' advertising campaign and for specific marketing initiatives such as National Weekend Rate. Staff numbers were now 151,600, a 4,400 reduction on the start of the year and on track for a reduction of 15,000 in the full year. Sir Iain said that Concert, the group's joint venture with its US equity partner MCI, was significantly ahead of the competition in being able to offer international companies 'seamless' voice and data services; the venture had some 75 new customers representing Pounds 200m in additional revenue. Completion of the MCI investment increased the group's gearing at September 30 to 29 per cent with net debt standing at Pounds 3.37bn. Analysts were yesterday broadly satisfied with BT's performance which they described as sound across the board. Pre-tax profits estimates for the full year are unchanged at about the Pounds 2.45bn-Pounds 2.5bn mark and the shares are seen as good value.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Management: Europe's most admired Senior European company executives are being invited to 'vote' for Europe's Most Respected Companies in a new survey by the Financial Times in association with Price Waterhouse. Business leaders will be asked to nominate companies in their particular sector based on seven specific qualities. They will be asked to consider the standard of customer focus, customer loyalty and service, the quality of employees, products and services, and the company with the most outstanding business performance - for example, the company that has shown consistent growth and long-term profitability, is a low-cost producer or whose results are used as a benchmark by others. Participants will also be asked which company in their industry demonstrates clear leadership and management qualities. Other questions cover which companies have the most effective strategy, perhaps in terms of policy and objectives or response to opportunities in the emerging European market, and which companies care about the environment. Finally, respondents are invited to nominate the company which they admire overall. Almost 2,000 chairmen, chief executives and finance officers from 640 European companies are being invited to take part in the survey. The companies span 21 sectors and include the largest quoted, state-owned and private companies in 17 nations from Portugal to Turkey. The results of the confidential questionnaires are expected to provide a fascinating insight into which companies command most respect from their peers, and why. The Financial Times plans to publish the results of the survey, and the winners of the award for Europe's Most Respected Companies, in the newspaper later this year.</p>

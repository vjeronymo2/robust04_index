			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTMENT OUTLOOK;  </P> <P> ASSESSING THE MAJOR MARKETS;  </P> <P> CAUTION ADVISED FOR LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS;  </P> <P> INVESTORS SHIFT THEIR FOCUS TO STEADY INCOME  </P> <P> Few investments carry a worse reputation these days than the limited  partnership. Tax-law changes, troubles at many partnerships and the resulting  bad publicity have sent partnership sales tumbling the past two years, notably  in real estate partnerships -- the industry's biggest player.  </P> <P> Don't look for partnerships to disappear in the 1990s, though. But they will  likely shift toward providing steady income rather than promising a large  payoff upon dissolution.  </P> <P> Limited partnerships pool money from investors -- the limited partners -- to  buy real estate, oil rigs or other assets to earn income, capital gains and  selected tax benefits. Run by a general partner, they typically last seven to  10 years before their assets are sold, and they are dissolved.  </P> <P> Ideally, limited partnerships should provide above-average returns for such a  long use of investors' money -- and hopefully offer a big payoff at the end by  selling appreciated assets.  </P> <P> Roughly $100 billion of partnerships already exist, and investors pumped an  additional $5.6 billion into public partnerships alone in the first nine months  of 1989, although that was down 25% from $7.5 billion a year earlier, said  Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks partnerships.  </P> <P> The industry's woes -- analysts say 5% to 10% are in trouble -- are putting  pressure on partnership organizers, or sponsors, to find high-quality assets or  cut fees in an attempt to gain new investors. They can no longer rely on the  appeal of tax benefits, which spurred the initial popularity of partnerships in  the early 1980s but were mostly swept away by the 1986 tax reform law.  Borrowing heavily to buy the assets also is losing favor.  </P> <P> "Now you're seeing people putting together deals based on economics and not  taxes," said Frank R. Pope, general partner of Technology Funding, a San Mateo  firm that has organized 10 partnerships to raise $210 million for fledgling  technology firms.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, don't count on these predictions coming true if you're  considering partnership investments today, experts said. Their advice: proceed  cautiously.  </P> <P> "Do they need to clean up their act? You bet they do," Paul T. Green, president  of Southport Advisors Inc., a Southport, Conn., partnership research firm, said  of partnership sponsors. To date, too many sponsors operated "by the seat of  the pants, and I have to believe they did a lot of acquisitions in the  seat-of-the-pants fashion."  </P> <P> He recommends studying a sponsor's track record to see how their earlier deals  performed. Check to see how much debt the partnership plans to incur; high  leverage might afford a bigger portfolio, but it also could swamp the  partnership with interest costs.  </P> <P> And ask a lot of questions. Green said he has been "taken aback" by how some  partnership officials were "not as good at putting their fingers on the kind of  information that any prudent investor or investment adviser would look at."  </P> <P> Recent sales figures indicate that investors are less willing to plunge into  real estate or energy based on a sponsor's promise that the assets will  appreciate and provide a fat return years down the road. They want steady  income now, such as from equipment leasing.  </P> <P> Investors "are less interested in a promise of long-term significant capital  gains," said Christopher L. Davis, president of the Investment Partnership  Assn., the industry's trade group.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of this year, equipment-leasing partnership sales rose  19%, to $987.3 million from $832.3 million, Stanger reports. But real estate  partnerships, which account for 51% of total partnership sales, plunged 45% to  $2.14 billion from $3.85 billion after skidding 24% in 1988.  </P> <P> Investors have shied away from partnerships because assets in many of these  deals actually dropped in value or did not have the income streams their  sponsors predicted. Many, particularly in the early 1980s, bought Sun Belt real  estate or energy assets that took a drubbing, depriving the partnerships of  income. That left some partnerships yielding annual returns of 6% to 7%, about  what investors could get with municipal bonds or money market funds.  </P> <P> Yet, frustrated investors can easily sell the bonds or money fund shares.  Partnerships, in contrast, attract few buyers in a limited secondary market,  and even then the sellers usually must stomach a huge discount -- perhaps 50%  or more -- from what they originally paid. Experts say it might be wiser to  ride out a struggling partnership in the hope it improves.  </P> <P> Moreover, many of the early partnerships "were admittedly done for tax  purposes," Davis said. Money was poured into shaky deals to generate losses,  and attendant tax credits, that could offset other investment gains.  </P> <P> The result: The partnership trade group estimates that up to $3 billion of  public partnerships and $2 billion of private deals are in trouble, meaning  they are withholding or cutting payments to their partners, renegotiating their  debts or simply filing bankruptcy. That represents 6% of the partnerships sold  since 1983, but some analysts think up to 10% of the deals are ailing.  </P> <P> (Private partnerships are designed mainly for well-heeled investors and do not  file their plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Public  partnerships, requiring investments of as little as $5,000 and peddled by major  brokerage houses, do make SEC filings.)  </P> <P> With partnership sales under pressure, look for some sponsors to shave their  up-front fees to draw in more investors. Sponsors to date have collected fees  totaling 15% to 30% of each partner's investment, enabling the organizers to  prosper even if their partnerships ran into problems.  </P> <P> "We've had some pretty hefty fees in these deals," said William G. Brennan, a  partner at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young in Washington. With smaller  fees, he said, sponsors will be forced to find properties that are financially  solid and thus "will make everyone's performance contingent on the performance  of the partnership."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RISE AND FALL OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS  </P> <P> Annual sales of public limited partnerships, which invest in such areas as real  estate, energy and equipment leasing and typically last seven to 10 years  before they are dissolved.  </P> <P> 1987: 413.5 billion  </P> <P> Source: Robert A.

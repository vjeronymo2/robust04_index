			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / More promises made on public service quality The government claimed yesterday that the Citizen's Charter had significantly raised the standard of public services and promised more than a hundred further improvements in quality. A report on progress under the charter said improvements in public services included reductions in waiting times for hospital operations, more information for parents on children's school progress and increasing punctuality in rail services. In a foreword to the report, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he wanted to see all services aiming for the best standards. 'I expect the best to go on raising their standards year by year,' he added. The charter's record was challenged by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow public service minister. He said many targets had been missed and the charter overlooked important services such as legal aid and childcare. He called for real sanctions to give people power to alter services to meet their needs. 'An idea of real potential value has been swamped by PR gloss to mask the steady deterioration of so many public services,' he said. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said the charter was a 10-year programme to improve services. 'These reforms are now gaining momentum and will bring yet further benefits over time,' he added. The report included more than a hundred new commitments to further raise service standards, including: Patients whose National Health Service operations are cancelled will be guaranteed re-admission to hospital within a month. Council tenants who improve their homes will get compensation. Every further education college will produce charters. Parents of children with special education needs will get extra choice. More radical improvements in patients' rights are promised for Scotland and Wales. In Scotland, maximum waiting times for hospital admission after being seen by a consultant are to be reduced from 18 months to a year by 1997. In Wales, health authorities are considering a guarantee that covers the maximum wait between first seeing a doctor and having an operation. Systems for dealing with complaints would be overhauled, the report said. A Complaints Task Force headed by Lady Wilcox, chairman of the National Consumer Council, is to be set up.

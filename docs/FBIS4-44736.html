			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andreas Gerlach under the rubric "Machine </F> Building and New Materials": "Lasers. Urge for Light. German  World Market Leaders Want to Strengthen Their Position With  Higher Beam Power"]    [Excerpts] [[passage omitted] The laser is more and more  developing into a wonder weapon in the struggle for  international competitiveness. And technology for the future is  one of the few areas in which the Germans are ahead  technologically. "The Japanese are simply not up to date here,"  asserts Arnold Mayer, chief executive of Optech Consulting in  Bieseingen and one of the best authorities on the scene. Welding  and three-dimensional cutting above all are provinces of the  Germans. In these most important fields of application for  CO[.sub]2[/] and solid-state lasers they profited strongly  from the automobile industry's innovation drive during the 80's.  Today there is hardly a single passenger car maker that does not  cut, drill, mark or process with the aid of lasers.    Most recently small and medium-size companies have also been  feeling the urge for light, especially in the electrical and  electronics industry. Point-precision microsurgical intervention  in integrated circuits is possible with lasers. Precision  welding and soldering are also no problem for a light beam.  Added to this is the flexibility of the tool, which enables the  economical production of even small lots down to single pieces.    Still the marketing of laser machines is making no progress.  "The high investment," says an industry observer, "is at the  moment not possible for most companies." For better or worse,  laser manufacturers are tied to the situation in the machine  building industry, which is only slowly improving. For instance,  the domestic demand for lasers last year dropped by 20 percent  to 600 systems. Only exports saved the German laser industry  from a nose dive. The dynamically growing U.S. market  represented a substantial share of this.    Even Rofin Sinar Laser GmbH, world market leader in the  manufacture of CO[.sub]2[/] lasers, is "distinctly in the  red," admits chief executive Samuel Simonsson. After the success  of the 80's the Siemens subsidiary set its mind totally on  expansion. Today part of the just recently developed site of a  passenger car dealer is being used for a warehouse. "Our great  expectations have not been fulfilled," Simonsson laments.    Now management is placing its hopes on a new development,  the  so-called diffusion-cooled CO[.sub]2[/] laser. In  conventional systems large quantities of the gas have to be  circulated because it gets hot. Part of the carbon dioxide is  routinely removed in order to reduce the contaminants that  originate in the process.    In the new development the gas is cooled as the laser light  forms, so that the tremendous technical input for circulation is  done away with. Because of this the new CO[.sub]2[/] laser is  smaller and more flexible. Rofin Sinar is presenting at Metav in  Duesseldorf--the metal machining show that starts on May 3--a  model having a power of 2 kilowatts. The immediate objective is  to double this.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS LEAVE CLASSROOMS FOR PICKET LINES  </P> <P> As an observer of the Los Angeles public schools for the past 20 years in the  capacity as a trainer of teachers at a leading university in Southern  California, I can say without hesitation that the L.A. Board of Education  deserves the teachers' strike. Those who don't support it deserve what they  have had, and will continue to get, for the last two decades: teaching  conditions in an urban system that are scandalous for a city this size; an  insensitive and overly top-heavy administration that misdirects a budget that  is larger than the budget for the entire city of Los Angeles; teacher salaries  and duties which make a mockery of the training and skills needed to be a  teacher; and a school system that can't find or pay good teachers and has to  rely increasingly upon emergency credentialed people.  </P> <P> Conditions can't be worse. Why would anyone want to teach in the Los Angeles  school system?  </P> <P> I find it amazing that the schools can't find the money for teacher salaries,  but, somehow, magically found new revenue to pay above-average salaries for  substitutes during the strike. In all honesty, this strike couldn't have  happened to a better school district. I'm only sorry that it took over a decade  for the teachers to get their act together this time.  </P> <P> ALFRED LIGHTFOOT  </P> <P> Professor of Education  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount University  </P></p>

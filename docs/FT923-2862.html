			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Hazards of reporting figures Commentating on the Singapore economy can be a hazardous business, writes Kieran Cooke. In late June, the Singapore newspaper Business Times published preliminary government figures for GDP growth in the second quarter of the year. The figures gave a lower than expected growth of 4.6-4.8 per cent. Six weeks later, officers from Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD) questioned Business Times journalists and took away notebooks and computer files. The preliminary figures were apparently based on leaked information. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the ISD officers were carrying out their investigations in accordance with Singapore's Official Secrets Act. Under the act, anyone who obtains such information and uses it 'in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore' can be jailed for up to two years. Civil servants have been questioned, as have representatives of foreign investment houses, about the source of the figures.</p>

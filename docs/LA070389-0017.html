			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A car bomb exploded in a housing area at a British military base in Hanover,  West Germany, killing a soldier and injuring his wife and four children,  officials said. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but  officials suspect the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end  British rule in Northern Ireland. The bomb went off as the man opened the door  of the car while his family waited to get in, police said. Officials said bomb  disposal experts found another explosive device in the area and defused it. It  was the second attack in two weeks on a British installation in West Germany.  In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, three explosions occurred at Belfast's Harbor  Airport, damaging two aircraft but apparently causing no injuries.  </P></p>

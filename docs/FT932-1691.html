			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / People: James Capel finds chief strategist . . . Peter Chambers, head of international institutional equity management at Citibank Global Asset Management, is crossing the fence to become broker James Capel's chief investment strategist. Alastair Ross Goobey and Martin Paling, Capel's strategy duo, both left earlier this year, and both for fund management jobs. Ross Goobey went to become the boss of Postel, running the country's largest pool of pension fund money; Paling, who then briefly stepped into his shoes as chief investment strategist, moved to Baring in May, and will be in charge of asset allocation in the Pacific and South East Asia based in Hong Kong. Keith Skeoch, Capel's chief economist, points out: 'A lot of clients do not think that strategy is done that well at brokers, which is why we wanted someone from the other side of the fence. Peter also has a much more up-to-date knowledge of the latest investment techniques from the coal face.' Capel, meanwhile, offers Chambers 'a bit more time to think' than he would have in daily charge of a large investment portfolio, as well as the chance to develop a much higher public profile, according to Skeoch. In line management terms, Chambers will report to Skeoch but the latter says that the relationship will essentially be 'primus inter pares' with the two on the road together making presentations. At Citibank, Chambers had established a particularly consistent record in European equities. According to sources elsewhere in the market, important clients included the Sultan of Brunei. He came to the City in 1981, after taking an MBA at Manchester Business School, to join Lazard Brothers, initially as a manager of UK pension funds and charities, and has been a Capel client ever since.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Nato diplomats impatient at UN caution in Bosnia Nato ambassadors yesterday decided to extend air cover by alliance aircraft beyond Bosnia to a small part of Croatia near the Bihac enclave. This means that in principle alliance aircraft could carry out bombing raids against Serb positions in Croatia if the Serbs were attacking UN forces around the Bihac enclave in Bosnia. The alliance ambassadors agreed that air cover could be extended to the whole of Croatia, but that would require a more complex operation involving the UN authorities in Zagreb. Yesterday's decision falls short of the imposition of a draconian 'exclusion zone' - where all heavy weapons are subject to air strikes. Any move in that direction would require a fresh UN resolution. However, diplomats said that even limited Nato air raids on Serb positions in Croatia could mark an important ist in the conflict. Yesterday's meeting in Brussels was the latest in a series of moves towards a tougher Bosnian policy that has been taken at alliance headquarters, where frustration over the cautious tactics of UN commanders on the ground is growing. The meeting took place amid pressure from US officials for a toughening of the application of existing policies in Bosnia, including the commitment to maintain six enclaves or 'safe havens' for the government side. They say this is the minimum needed to parry pressure in the US Congress for a unilateral break by Washington with the international peace effort and stronger efforts to assist the Moslem cause. Bihac has been at the centre of a bitter upsurge in fighting over the past weeks, with Bosnia's Moslem-led government making spectacular gains against the Serbs and driving the local warlord, Fikret Abdic, out of his stronghold. Fighting has spilled over into Croatia. Further reverses for the Serbs in the Bihac area would deepen the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs, who are facing a cut-off in support from their kinsmen in Belgrade. Earlier this week, Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, raised eyebrows at alliance headquarters by threatening to call down Nato air strikes against Bosnian government forces in Sarajevo, whom he accused of provocation. Nato officials have said that air raids against the government forces could provoke a bitter political reaction, especially in the US.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Norway's currency reserves depleted NORWAY'S central bank yesterday said it had used about half of its foreign currency reserves to defend the krone during last week's intense speculation that the currency would be devalued. The Bank of Norway said it bought NKr49.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn) between last Wednesday and Friday, but there had been a net currency inflow of NKr13.9bn on Monday of this week. The amounts were in the higher end of the range of dealers' estimates. The krone closed yesterday at 0.26 per cent below its central value of NKr7.9940 against the Ecu. The Oslo bourse was 1 per cent higher on continuing devaluation speculation. Norway was the first Scandinavian country to link its currency to the Ecu, from October 1990. At the end of October, Norway's foreign currency reserves were worth NK107bn.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, AVIATOR EDDIE MARTIN  </P> <P> In 1974 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley was appointed to the Orange County Board of  Supervisors for the 5th District, which happens to have an airport within its  boundaries. Since his first day on the job, Riley has been deeply involved in  both making the airport a good neighbor and meeting the vital needs of air  transportation.  </P> <P> Supervisor Riley's leadership made the settlement agreement with the city of  Newport a reality. This action permitted the current needed improvements at the  airport. In short, he has truly earned the recognition suggested in our letter  to the county board that would name the new terminal at John Wayne Airport the  Thomas F. Riley Terminal.  </P> <P> Some have said the terminal should bear the name of aviation pioneer Eddie  Martin because his contributions to aviation in the county are well known. The  present terminal was named The Eddie Martin Terminal in 1989, and will be used  for general aviation activities upon opening of the new terminal. General  aviation, of course, was and is Eddie's first love and this recognition seems  appropriate. Contrary to rumors, the Eddie Martin Terminal is not slated for  demolition.  </P> <P> Both of these men deserve a place in the history of air transportation in  Orange County and we believe the recognition suggested would properly honor  Thomas F. Riley for his many years of dedication to the improvement of aviation  services in Orange County.  </P> <P> EUGENE H. MORIARTY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Orange County Aviation Council  </P></p>

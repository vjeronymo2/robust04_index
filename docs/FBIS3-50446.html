			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a meeting with journalists, President Itamar  Franco bitterly criticized the Supreme Federal Court [STF] and  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], but praised the  National Congress and former Social Security Minister Antonio  Brito.    During the 20 minutes he stayed at the Planalto Palace press  hall to wish journalists a happy new year, President Itamar  Franco criticized the Supreme Federal Court and the PMDB, but  praised the National Congress. He also spoke about ministerial  reform and the events of 1993.    [Begin recording] We have had a year with a very high  inflation rate, but we must also stress, and stress  categorically because the newspapers usually do not mention it,  and if they do, they only refer to it in general terms, that the  country has left recession behind.    The country has managed to reach 1993 with a GDP of 4.5  percent, with all industrial areas fully recovering from  recession. We must review several other areas where we had  speculation, especially the famous pharmaceutical industry. The  government has not yet been able to control the pharmaceutical  industry. But the country has grown, especially in the energy  area and also in its international relations.    Thus, we can say that although we had a high inflation rate,  the country has developed calmly and within a democratic  environment. And no one can deny that the country has developed  economically. [end recording]    President Itamar Franco also said he is disappointed over  the  decision adopted by Supreme Federal Court Justice Marco Aurelio  de Mello which has granted an injunction in favor of state  companies continuing to pay super-salaries.    According to the president, this decision by Justice Marco  Aurelio de Mello and the STF does great damage to the country,  not just to the government.    The president of the Republic also took the opportunity to  praise the National Congress. He said that  congressional-Executive Branch relations are perfect and that he  hopes the measures adopted by the economic team to curb  inflation will be approved.    The president also praised former Social Security Minister  Antonio Brito, but bitterly criticized the PMDB.    [Begin recording] Concerning relations with parties, I  shouldn't say this because I do not want to fight, I do not want  to disrupt the peace, because I would rather have a climate of  peace, of love, and of brotherhood, but the PMDB, which until a  few days ago had five ministers in the government, suddenly said  that it was not part of the government. How could it not be part  of the government! It had five ministers holding important  posts. They were so important that the PMDB has forgotten that  it had important ministers, including one who helped out in my  work, who is a friend of mine, and who, in a demonstration of  loyalty to the government and to the fatherland, had to leave  his post to run for president of the Republic. I am referring to  Former Minister Antonio Brito. The PMDB is a party that has  grown quickly and has participated effectively in the  government. One has to talk with parties that have ministers in  the government, but when these ministers deny they are the  government, then it is better to find intermediaries to hold  talks with other parties. [end recording]    Next Monday President Franco will meet with Senate Leader  Pedro Simon to discuss names for the Mines and Energy, Industry  and Commerce, and Agriculture Ministries. The president added  that the future communications minister must be an expert in the  area.</p>

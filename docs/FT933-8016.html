			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Observer: Shipyard humour Over the years John Selwyn Gummer, Britain's environment minister, has been called everything, from a crystallised choirboy and solemn-visaged pipsqueak to a born head prefect. But until now no one has ever dared to call him a 'drittsekk', in public at least. However, Norwegian environment minister Thorbjoern Berntsen has no such hang-ups. Berntsen, 58, who used to be a ship's plumber before he took up Gummer's trade, was addressing a pre-election rally when he uttered one of Norway's more common swear words, which apparently translates into something very vulgar, to describe his opposite number in England. The Norwegians are particularly upset by British emissions of poisonous gases which fall as acid rain in Norway, killing forests and polluting lakes. But there is more to it than that. Berntsen, not known for his environmental sensitivities until he got his job, obviously does not like Gummer. But unlike his counterpart Labour MPs in Britain, he is not afraid of saying so. Yesterday Berntsen admitted that he could probably have said the same using somewhat different words, but 'I usually say things directly so that people understand what I mean'. And whereas lesser political figures might have toned down their comments yesterday, the minister was showing no signs of being cowed by the rising diplomatic storm. He told the state radio station that Gummer was one of 'the most arrogant people' he had ever met. The British embassy in Oslo said it was regrettable for ministers to use such language, but it seemed that 'Mr Berntsen has been expressing himself in his usual forthright way'. Bet John Gummer won't stoop to calling Berntsen a whale-murderer.</p>

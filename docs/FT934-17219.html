			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Easier tone ahead of third-quarter reports Wall Street US STOCKS ended on an easier note yesterday in the wake of lower bond prices and growing concern about the approaching quarterly reporting season, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.18 at 3,555.12. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.19 at 458.93, but the American SE composite gained 2.74 at 460.39. The Nasdaq composite was off 0.39 at 762.78. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 294m shares. The market traded lower for most of the day, although the bulk of the losses were incurred during the first half-hour of trading. The declines were attributed to several factors: further weakness in bond prices (the yield on the 30-year bond rose back above 6 per cent yesterday), higher crude oil and gold prices, which always raise concern over inflation, and nervousness ahead of the coming corporate reporting season. US companies are due to begin releasing third-quarter earnings data in the next few weeks, and the sluggish nature of economic growth over the summer has raised fears that corporate profitability in this latest quarter may not match the achievements of the first half. Among individual sectors, most oil issues were strong for the second consecutive day as crude prices rose in the wake of the oil production agreement between members of Opec. Chevron moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 97 3/4 , Mobil Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 67 3/4 and British Petroleum Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 . General Motors fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/4 amid apprehension about the car group's board meeting on Monday, which will review GM's labour relations strategy. The company is currently attempting to negotiate a new wage agreement with the car workers' unions. USAir fell in early trading but recovered to end unchanged at Dollars 12 5/8 , after the airline forecast losses for the third quarter and the full 1993 year, and said it would take a Dollars 75m charge in the latest quarter and Dollars 44m for the year to help cover the cost of 2,500 job cuts. The news from USAir troubled other airline stocks, with UAL falling Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 137 1/4 and AMR giving up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 . USF&amp;G dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 in heavy trading after brokerage house Kidder Peabody cut its 1993 and 1994 earnings forecasts for the insurance group. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were depressed. Intel retreated Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Apple Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 23 3/8 . Canada TORONTO finished slightly higher after further moderate trading. The TSE 300 index gained 7.4 at 3,990.6 and advances outpaced declines by 485 to 305. Volume was 55.4m shares valued at CDollars 580m. Energy stocks led the way with an index rise of 1.36 per cent, followed by pipelines, transportation and golds, up 1.33, 1.32 and 1 per cent respectively.</p>

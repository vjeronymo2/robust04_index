			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch trade surplus up sharply The Netherlands' trade surplus surged to a provisional Fl 23.2bn (Pounds 8.3bn) last year from Fl 9.9bn in 1992, reflecting a rise of nearly 5 per cent in the value of exports and a slight 0.7 per cent drop in imports. The central statistical office cautioned, however, that the figures for the two years are not entirely comparable. With the advent of the European single market in January 1993, calculations of European imports and exports are now based largely on figures supplied by the companies themselves, supplemented by the office's own estimates. Officials said yesterday that even if the 1993 figure were revised later, it was likely to remain above Fl 20bn. As in previous years, the country's biggest trading partners were Germany and Belgium. Inflation in the western German state of Hesse slowed to 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-May from a 0.3 per cent month-on-month increase in April, the state statistics office in Wiesbaden said yesterday. Italy's overall balance of payments recorded a L202bn (Pounds 85m) deficit in April after L2,290bn the previous month, the foreign exchange office said. The Bank of Italy's official reserves fell to L91,488bn in April from L91.957bn in March. French household spending on durable manufactured goods rose by 1.2 per cent in April following a rise of 0.6 per cent in March, the national statistics office said.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Rapid rise for Ford descendant The possibility that a member of the Ford family will one day take over the top job again at the US motor vehicle manufacturer increased last week with the elevation of a great-grandson of founder Henry Ford to a senior position in the company, writes our financial staff. William Clay Ford II, 37, was named as the next head of the company's important finance committee. He will take over the job from his father, also named William Clay Ford, on January 1 next year. William Clay Ford II was also named a member of the company's organisation review and nominating committee. His appointment was seen as a sign of a rapid rise within the company, potentially setting the stage for William Clay junior to become the first Ford family member to run the US's second-biggest manufacturer of vehicles since Henry Ford II, a grandson of the founder, stepped down in 1979. The company's finance committee has been chaired by members of the Ford family since Henry Ford II took on the job in 1979. The role passed to his brother, William Clay senior, after his death in 1987.</p>

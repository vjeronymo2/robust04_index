In a statement it issued today, the Arab League Secretariat  affirmed its stance rejecting these statements because they  contradict international resolutions, primarily Security Council  Resolution 252 issued in 1968, which asserts the legal status of  Jerusalem and stresses that any measures aimed at changing  Jerusalem's status are void.    It pointed out that this resolution calls on Israel to  immediately stop any acts that lead to changing the status of  Jerusalem.    The Arab League Secretariat statement clarified that the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles stipulated that  Jerusalem is one of the issues that will be discussed during the  coming stage of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.    The statement affirmed the Arab League's concern about the  peace process and its support for all the international and  regional efforts aimed at establishing a just and permanent  peace in the Middle East.    The statement noted the U.S. President and Administration's  concern over the need to make 1994 a year of peace in the Middle  East.    The statement recalled the stances of successive U.S.  Administrations affirming the special status of Jerusalem by  considering it occupied territory the fate of which no single  party has the right to decide unilaterally. They also affirmed  the need to respect its religious and legal status as the cradle  of "all divine religions."    [Earlier, Cairo MENA in English at 1310 GMT on 17 March  transmits an unfinished item on the Arab League commenting on  Jerusalem. Like the above report it is numbered 135 on the MENA  file, but is entitled "The Arab League and Clinton's Statement."

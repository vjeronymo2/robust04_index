			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Timothy Charlton] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong stocks plunged yesterday as panicked  investors fled the market ahead of an expected increase in  interest rates and a deteriorating property market. The Hang  Seng Index fell 3.1 per cent to close 286.42 points down at  8,934.59. At one stage the market was down 360 points as  traders stood back and watched the frenzy of overseas selling.    Yesterday s slump compounded the local market's reputation  as  one of the worst performing in the world in 1994. In the year  to date, the market, in Hang Seng Index terms, is down 26 per  cent and it is down 26.8 percent off its last record close of  12,201 on January 4.    The Robert Fleming Index was up four points to 8,938 in  early  trading overnight, but brokers are bracing themselves for a  further sell-off when the market re-opens today. Brokers blamed  the deteriorating residential property market and fears of a  rise in interest rates today for the fall. Hardest hit in the  massive sell- off were the large property developers.    Cheung Kong fell $1.75 to $35.75, Sun Hung Kai Properties  lost $2.75 to $47, and New World Development dropped $1.70 to  $23.40. Bank shares were also hit on fears that an interest rate  increase would further erode lending margins. HSBC fell $3 to  $85 and Hang Seng Bank dropped $1 to $50.    Panic selling in the morning stripped 360 points from the  index in the first few minutes of trading as investors sold  their stocks. "People have seen the property bubble burst and  they want out," said one broker. Barclays de Zoete Wedd  assistant director Nial Gooding said his clients were equally as  grim. "Foreign investors are saying 'get me out of property, I  don't want it'," he said.    Any hope of a recovery in property counters was dashed after  the Sino-British Land Commission released 56.81 hectares of land  for private and assisted housing. The move effectively  increases the amount of land available for residential use by 23  per cent compared with last year's grant. Brokers said it was  clear the Government was serious about bringing prices down and  that developers would suffer as a result. The sudden turn-about  in residential property prices has even caught the experts off  guard. And while the news is good for those wanting to buy a  home the implications for property developers are serious.    Baring Securities director James Osborn said everyone was  waiting on the Government's next move. "The jury is still out  on whether the market will fall by the 5-15 per cent the  Government hopes for or whether prices will plunge even  further," he said. "They could fall by 30 or 40 per cent --  that's the scary thing," he added. Nobody expected flat prices  to fall as quickly or as dramatically as they did. The sudden  turn-about in flat prices over the week has sparked a dramatic  sell-off in property related stocks.    Yesterday's sell-off was even more worrying because the main  sellers were European institutions, typically strong supporters  of the local market. There had been signs that foreigners were  taking an interest in Hong Kong stocks again after having been  heavy sellers in February. The sudden downturn in the property  market and the likelihood of higher interest rates has now  scared many away.    Bank stocks also came under heavy pressure ahead of today's  Hong Kong Association of Banks meeting where interest rates will  be discussed. Monday's increase in United States interest rates  -- the third this year -- will put pressure on Hong Kong banks  to increase their rates. This is because the Hong Kong dollar  is pegged to the US dollar and any difference in interest rates  will pressure on the peg.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UniChem advances 27% in challenging markets UniChem, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, increased 1993 profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 37.5m, against Pounds 29.4m, despite the 2.5 per cent cut in drugs price imposed by the government in October. Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, described it as an 'outstanding performance during a year of challenging market conditions'. In addition to the price cut UniChem faced intensified competition from rivals, notably Lloyds Chemists which is trying to build market share in wholesaling. However Mr Harris said UniChem was losing very little business and predicted that the 'crazy' discounts being offered by competitors would not last much longer. Turnover advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 1.05bn), with pharmaceutical wholesaling showing like-for-like growth of more than 10 per cent in a market which grew by about 9 per cent. Operating profits rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 40.1m, compared with Pounds 34.2m, and margins increased from 3.25 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 17.8p (13.7p) basic or 17.3p (13.4p) fully diluted. Dividends increased 15 per cent to 6.5p (5.65p) with a recommended final of 4.3p. The market share gain stemmed partly from large manufacturers cutting down on direct distribution and from the growth in sales to hospitals which, up 50 per cent to Pounds 44m. UniChem estimates that the market will grow by 10 per cent this year, somewhat less than the Government's recent prediction. The rapidly growing Moss Chemists retail chain increased sales from Pounds 79.7m to Pounds 114m generating operating profits of Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 4.9m). Operating margins slipped from 6.1 per cent to 5.8 per cent and are expected to remain flat. In November UniChem paid Pounds 8.9m for Bradford Chemists' Alliance, a regional wholesaler. Mr Harris said a number of the remaining regional wholesalers were interested in being acquired but added: 'We will have to look at them but very few will be worth going for.' COMMENT These figures may indeed represent an 'outstanding' performance in 'challenging' conditions but it must be said that UniChem has a great deal going for it. Despite the Government price cut its market showed healthy growth which is likely to continue. Its 30 per cent market share gives it a huge advantage over the dwindling band of regionals while the strong relationship between wholesaler and chemist has blunted Lloyds' efforts to poach its customers. In wholesaling there are further gains to come from depot automation and in retailing there are new opportunities as big selling prescription medicines are switched to over-the-counter. After a good run this year these strengths are better reflected in the share price which now stands at about 16.5 times prospective earnings.</p>

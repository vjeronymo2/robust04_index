			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Simon] </F>   [Text] St. George's, Grenada, 6 Jan, CANA -- As was widely  expected, personal income tax was reintroduced in Grenada on  Thursday when prime minister and minister of finance, Nicholas  Brathwaite, presented the government's 1994 budget.    Brathwaite, in a two-hour-long speech to the House of  Representatives, also heeded calls from the chief of customs,  geoff Thorne, and moved to crack a vibrant contraband trade  between Grenada and the sister island, Carriacou.    The measures included steep reductions in port charges on  home appliances, audio and video cassette tapes, computer  diskettes, wines and spirits, and a big cut in duties on cigars  and cigarettes.    "As a result of these changes, the prices of these items  will  fall significantly," Brathwaite told the House, making clear the  measures were intended to fight the contraband trade.    The budget of 278 million dollars (one EC dollar ; 37 cents  US) puts recurrent expenditure at 195 million dollars and  capital expenditure at 82.7 million dollars.    Total revenue, including grants, was projected 266.5 million  dollars, leaving a deficit of 12.5 million dollars to be  financed.    The reintroduction of personal income tax, abolished in 1986  and replaced with a value-added tax (VAT), accompanied other tax  reform measures.    VAT was downgraded to a consumption tax, and two tier system  of company tax was introduced for one year. On profits of  45,000 dollars and lower, a rate of 30 per cent will apply while  on profits above 45,000 dollars, the rate will be 35 per cent.  From 1995, a single rate of 30 per cent will apply.    Said Brathwaite: "Over the past years, our tax system had  become too complicated to administer as a result of improperly  drawn and frequently amended legislation, nuisance taxes and the  decay of tax administration itself."    The budget brought property tax relief for home owners who  from 1985 paid rates of 0.2 per cent of the value of the land  and 0.5 per cent of the value of buildings. A single rate of  0.2 per cent now applies on the value of the property.    Under the new system of income tax, the first 10,000 dollars  of income will be exempt. There is an allowance of 1,000  dollars for spouses and 1,500 dollars per child up to three  children.    Income tax is seen by the government as a gradual  replacement  for a two year old national debt service levy, which will come  to an end on March 31, 1995.    Reviewing the performance of the government's finances,  Brathwaite reported a current account surplus of 17 million  dollars, the first in five years. It was arrived at using  methods employed by the International Monetary Fund and other  international lending agencies.    The largest chunk of the 1994 budget went to the Ministry of  Communications and Works, reflecting the emphasis the government  is giving to improving the infrastructure over the coming year.</p>

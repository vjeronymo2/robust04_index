			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by G. Miri: "The Matter Could Be Brought to </F> Court"]    [Text] Yesterday the Albanian-language media in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] broadcast  an extremely harsh protest against Albanian Radio-Television  [RTSH] by the ethnic Albanian parliamentary group, Albanian  ministers in the Macedonian Government, and other members of  Macedonian state institutions. They described the work of  Albanian Radio-Television as "anti-Albanian activity aimed at  splitting further the Albanian political body in Macedonia." At  the same time, they repeated that RTSH programs have contained  inaccurate news, implying that this was done for divisive  purposes. If the RTSH and its programs are going to continue  like this with their lies and slanders, the Albanian political,  state, and public figures in Macedonia pledged that they "would  be compelled to bring it to court."    How could the RTSH come to such a fateful point?    All this comes as no surprise. It was in fact the RTSH's  real objective from the very beginning to reach a point that  could virtually be called extremely detrimental to the national  cause by splitting and misinforming the nation. There is no  cause for wonder, because the RTSH first started doing this sort  of thing with the Albanians in Albania by unjustly accusing,  differentiating, and insulting them, by misinforming the public,  and not allowing others to speak their mind. However, the  people in charge of the RTSH are under the "umbrella" of the  party in power, and are therefore untouchable. They have been  running unstopped. If nobody deters them in Macedonia, the  danger will be much greater.    Do the RTSH's divisive activities, as our compatriots in  Macedonia call them, have any significance for our national  unity? It may sound paradoxical, but it is of immense  significance. The political parties, intellectuals, and  ordinary people here in Albania who were directly or indirectly  affected by the RTSH over this period used to think that it was  their misfortune alone, and that nobody cared about their  plight. Meanwhile, the RTSH extended its evil activities to the  detriment of Albanians living outside Albania. When the poor  Albanians heard about it, they felt somewhat relieved that they  could share their plight with their brothers across the border.  This is a very good opportunity for Albanians to unite in their  plight, which was created for them by the so-called RTSH.    What can we say about the financial problems of the RTSH?  Since the RTSH satellite programs are sponsored by Albanians  living outside Albania, as is public knowledge, and since the  whole thing was built up by those Albanians, it means that the  RTSH has obligations toward them. However, it does not mean the  obligation to misinform the public, lie, and pursue divisive  activities, as the declaration from Macedonia proves the RTSH is  actually doing. Recently the RTSH has been launching appeals for  cash donations to its bank account. After all these  professional flaws and the discontent that the RTSH has created,  one might doubt that any money will be forthcoming.    Finally, what is the Albanian parliament going to do about  it? According to the law, the RTSH answers to the Albanian  parliament, and one of its defined objectives is to serve the  national cause. Thus, parliament finds itself confronted by two  great problems. Will this parliament have its say on the matter,  given that both the law and our national unity have been  damaged? It remains to be seen.</p>

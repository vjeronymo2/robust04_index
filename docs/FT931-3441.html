			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delta hit by US cable problems WITHDRAWAL from an Australian business and continuing problems in US cables further undermined profitability at Delta, the electrical engineering group, last year. Pre-tax profit for 1992 fell 14 per cent to Pounds 55m (Pounds 64m) on turnover of Pounds 785.9m (Pounds 774m). This followed about Pounds 3m of rationalisation costs at Surprenant, a US cables company badly affected by defence cuts, and a dent in profits of more than Pounds 6m in Australia. Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said disposals and closures in Australia accounted for 80 per cent of the Pounds 8.2m profit fall in the industrial services division, which made Pounds 12.8m pre-interest on Pounds 160.1m (Pounds 191m) sales. Losses in North America were the main factor behind a 33 per cent decline in profits in the cables division to Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 13.1m) on Pounds 263.8m (Pounds 279.4m) sales. The impact of severe competition in the UK was offset by exports. The biggest profit earner was the engineering division, including plumbing products and control equipment. It rose to a record Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 21.3m) on Pounds 320.1m (Pounds 295.1m) turnover, thanks to continuing growth in continental Europe. However, continental demand slowed in the second half. In circuit protection, profit recovered to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 13.6m) on Pounds 132.7m (Pounds 110.8m) sales. New products, particularly a circuit breaker for industrial use, had improved market share. The results included a Pounds 1.69m profit on a business disposal and a Pounds 2.71m currency gain on an investment related to an aborted US acquisition. Mr Easton said Delta backed out of the purchase, worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m), because of a last-minute problem arising from the due diligence exercise. It would have been debt financed, taking gearing to between 50 per cent and 60 per cent, as the group retains its aversion to equity issues. Year-end gearing rose from 13 per cent to 18 per cent, on net assets of Pounds 322.2m. The main purchase was the outstanding 36 per cent stake in Delta Crompton Cable for Pounds 37m from BTR. Earnings per share slipped from 27p to 23p. The proposed final dividend is held at 9.8p to give an unchanged total of 14p. COMMENT Delta faces another year of swings and roundabouts as recession in continental markets is expected to halt the record run in engineering and offset any gains from recovery in the UK and US. The pound's devaluation should help exports from the UK as well as providing gains in translation this year. Restructuring costs should also be lower this year. The balance sheet is comfortable and an acquisition would certainly liven up views on the company, which has come to be seen as solid and unexciting. A pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 57m gives a prospective p/e of nearly 18 times after yesterday's 9p rise in the share price to 444p. This looks about right, bearing in mind the continental impediment to a proper recovery in group profits.</p>

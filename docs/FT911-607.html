			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Shine goes off Polly Peck's fruit machine: Meyna, central to creditors' cash hopes NESTLED among the palm trees and orange groves along a highway leading to the Turkish Mediterranean coast, a line of warehouses and factories stretches for almost 25 miles outside the port of Mersin. At first sight, the two main factories of the Meyna group do not command much attention. The outlets for Polly Peck International's Turkish mainland subsidiary in the fruit and processing trade are lost in a seemingly endless parade of garish company and bank signs. Yet they - and other similar plants dotted around Turkey and northern Cyprus  -are at the heart of any hopes that Polly Peck's 28,000 creditors have of recovering the hundreds of millions of pounds they have pumped into the group. There are signs already that creditors will have to wait years for Meyna and other Near East operations to make a dent in Polly Peck's debts. And even then, the wait could turn out to be fruitless. Creditors were told this week that only about Pounds 500m of their Pounds 1.15bn was likely to be repaid. For the rest, they will have to rely on future profits or asset sales from the Near East. Meyna has long been thought by analysts and shareholders to be one of the group's biggest cash generators. For instance, it was believed to have been the biggest contributor to the Pounds 107m of reported profits from northern Cyprus and Turkey in 1989, which made up two-thirds of total group profit. The administrators this week cast serious doubts on the reliability of Polly Peck's published figures. Meyna is shown in reports at Polly Peck's head office to have made profits of TL195bn (Pounds 47m) in the first half of 1990, on turnover of TL578bn. The administrators warn that the limited access they have had to local records indicates that these figures 'may be significantly overstated'. This accords with the impression of Meyna given by former executives, and by competitors - that of a medium-sized player from one of the Mediterranean's less active fruit exporting nations. As one prominent Israeli fruit exporter, who has observed Meyna closely, says of the reported profits: 'You simply can't make that sort of money from a fruit business that size.' The Turkish Mediterranean fruit and vegetable market is not large. The Association of (Turkish) Mediterranean Exporters reported Dollars 110.4m (Pounds 65m) in exports last year of fresh fruit, vegetables, and citrus fruits. Polly Peck's Turkish fruit and vegetable operations were developed after 1985, following substantial investment. By the end of 1989, Meyna had 58,000 sq m of plant and two ultra-modern packing stations. The plant could process 20 tons of fruit an hour and seemed poised to challenge the Spanish and Italian fruit industries. By 1988, Meyna was exporting 68,000 tons of fruit and vegetables. However, problems in the overseas marketing arm handling Meyna's output led to substantial cuts in exports in 1989, with output falling to 23,000 tons. It is reckoned to be the fifth or sixth largest exporter in Mersin. Meyna then turned to the domestic market, with products ranging from fruit concentrates and cooking oils to plastic containers. It is also possible to trace Meyna's growing involvement in importing foodstuffs, including rice, sugar and coffee. From what is known of these piecemeal businesses, it is hard to construct a picture of a vibrant business generating substantial sums of cash. So where will the profits come from to repay Polly Peck's creditors? Not from Sunzest Trading, the group's original Turkish Cypriot fruit operation. This is substantially smaller than Meyna. Nor, on the face of it, from Unipac, the group's cardboard box factory in northern Cyprus. Unaudited figures for the first six months of 1990 show it made Pounds 14m profit - well down on the Pounds 1m-a-week profit it was said to have been making at one stage. Even the Pounds 14m is in doubt. The administrators have not gained access to the business, due to an injunction taken out by directors of Unipac. But the administrators say of the unaudited profits: 'The information available indicates the figures may be overstated.' If there is a big question mark over the profit-generating capacity of the Near East operations, then what chance is there of selling assets to pay back some of the Pounds 959m invested in northern Cyprus and Turkey by other Polly Peck group companies? On the evidence obtained so far, not good. The group was renowned for its lavish investments in new processing plants. It is uncertain whether these can be sold at anything like their original cost. In addition, hundreds of millions of pounds of Polly Peck money has been ploughed into holiday developments (although the administrators have not been able to verify Pounds 230m said to have been invested last summer). These have little resale value as incomplete developments. But it will take years for these investments to show a return. Despite this, Mr Michael Jordan, one of the three administrators of Polly Peck, said yesterday that creditors had little option but to place their faith in the Near East, and Polly Peck's chairman. For example, it is through Mr Asil Nadir, the Turkish Cypriot chairman and chief executive, that the administrators are trying to obtain legal title to assets bought with Polly Peck money, but not held in the name of group companies. Any legal attempt to gain control of assets, in a region not recognised by the UK, would take years and could yield nothing, said Mr Jordan. His blunt warning: 'If the creditors don't go along with our proposals and prefer to pull the plug (on Polly Peck), then they may as well say goodbye to northern Cyprus.' Observer, Page 14</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To support its position, INGAA states generally that RSPA ignored technical material presented to show that offshore pipelines cannot be ``smart pigged'', including an assertion that most offshore gas pipelines are not constructed to accommodate smart pigs. RSPA disagrees strongly with this argument. The issue is not whether existing offshore lines can be ``smart pigged'' but whether new offshore transmission lines can be constructed or existing offshore gas transmission lines can be modified to accommodate smart pigs. RSPA considered technical material relating to problems such as tight bends, restrictive subsea connections, and limited space on platforms in deciding that they can be. No technical information has been submitted to RSPA that concludes that offshore gas transmission lines would be incapable of accommodating smart pigs if they are so designed and constructed. Their construction is not dissimilar from that of offshore hazardous liquid pipelines, many of which are already constructed in a manner that would accommodate smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INGAA is incorrect in citing 1992 changes to the statutory authority as the basis for the final rule. As discussed above, that statutory change was not used to support the final rule. In addition, INGAA is incorrect that RSPA ignored recommendations of the TPSSC. As discussed above, RSPA is not obligated to adopt the recommendations of the advisory committee, only to consider them. Discussion of RSPA's consideration of those recommendations is included in the preamble to the final rule, but is commingled with the discussion of RSPA's response to commenters to the proposed rule. Furthermore, RSPA's consideration of the criteria contained in 49 U.S.C. 60102(b), the technical data, and recommendations of the TPSSC resulted in the exception provided in the final rule for offshore gas transmission lines less than 10 inches in nominal diameter that transport gas to onshore facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INGAA also points to the lack of population around offshore lines and the periodic cleaning of the gas transmission lines that removes condensates as justification for exception from the rules for these pipelines. The rationale is that offshore gas transmission lines do not pose either serious safety or environmental concerns justifying the cost of assuring that the lines can accommodate smart pigs. RSPA agrees that we may not have fully considered these factors in applying the rules to offshore gas transmission pipelines and accordingly propose a change to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INGAA asserts that most offshore gas pipeline operators use cleaning pigs to periodically sweep condensate to onshore separation facilities. This keeps the offshore pipelines free from condensate and greatly reduces the environmental impact of an offshore leak by eliminating the risk of a condensate sheen. RSPA agrees that a leak in an offshore gas transmission line, that is free of significant accumulations of condensate, poses minimal risk to the natural environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, RSPA agrees that the offshore gas pipelines do not pose the same safety risk as onshore pipelines. The offshore safety risk is to workers on platforms and to vessels. The latter risk is extremely remote absent the possibility of a collision between a vessel and an underwater pipeline. This possibility has been minimized by the issuance of &sect;192.612, which required operators to conduct underwater inspections in shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico to determine whether they pose a risk to navigation and to re-bury those pipelines. RSPA is working on a proposal addressing the need for similar periodic underwater inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accident reports for offshore incidents received by RSPA indicate that risk to workers on platforms comes from gas leaks in the risers. The leaks are the result of condensate with corrosive agents that is likely to collect in the riser's elbows and cause internal corrosion. Also, external corrosion at the riser's ``splash zone'' is caused by the degradation of protective coatings from wave action. Both types of corrosion are detectible by smart pigs. However, as INGAA points out, modification of riser bends in order to accommodate smart pigs is costly. RSPA notes that there are alternative techniques of inspecting these risers for corrosion that are generally more effective (and less costly) than use of smart pigs that survey the entire pipeline. These include divers, remotely operated vehicles carrying ultrasonic thickness devices, or specially equipped tethered smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

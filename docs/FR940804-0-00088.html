			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each agency will develop its own letter informing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complainant that the agency will refer the complaint to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEOC for investigation and processing, unless the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a written request to the contrary from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complainant within twenty days of the date of the notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter. The agency notice letter shall explain: (i) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's procedures for processing section 504 complaints;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (ii) the EEOC's procedures for processing complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under title I. The agency notice letter shall also inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals of the potential for differing remedies under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(3) describes the procedure for referral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by designated agencies, as established by &sect;35.171(b)(2) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the title II regulation. If a designated agency does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have section 504 jurisdiction, and determines that the EEOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have title I jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint to the EEOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(4)(i) provides that complaints referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the EEOC by an agency with section 504 jurisdiction will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be deemed to be dual filed under both section 504 and title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. As a consequence, the section 504 agency, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to defer its processing of the complaint, will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an opportunity to review the EEOC's findings and take any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further action it deems appropriate, as provided in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) further provides that a complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to the EEOC by an agency that has jurisdiction over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the complaint under title II only (and not under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 504) will be treated as a complaint filed under title I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distinction between the treatment of these two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of complaints, those falling within the province of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 504 and those arising only under the ADA, is based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the ADA's statutory mandate to preserve the rights,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies, and procedures of any Federal law that provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than are afforded by the ADA. Permitting section 504  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to review complaints originally filed with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies preserves section 504 remedies, including an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's prerogative to terminate the federal funding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent. It is anticipated that the fact that fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination is ultimately available as an administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy will encourage respondents to resolve valid claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through negotiation with the EEOC rather than through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litigation. Because &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .10(c) requires the reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 504 agency to give due weight to the EEOC's findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conclusions, it is also anticipated that, in most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances, further action by the section 504 agency will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(4)(iii) states that any complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to the EEOC shall be processed pursuant to title I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. Specifically, the EEOC will notify respondents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its receipt of a complaint in accordance with its usual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for notification following receipt of a charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .6 describes the circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which an agency shall retain a complaint for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation (rather than referring it to the EEOC or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Rights Division). The general rule applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 504 agencies, as stated in paragraph (d)(1), is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a section 504 agency shall retain a complaint when it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that it has section 504 jurisdiction over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint and that any one or more of the following are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> true: (i) the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint; (ii) the EEOC has jurisdiction over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint, but the complainant requests that the complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be investigated by the agency rather than being referred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the complaint alleges discrimination in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment and in other services or practices of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondent that are covered by section 504; or (iv) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint alleges a pattern or practice of discrimination in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment. Such complaints will not be deemed dual filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under title I of the ADA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This procedure is consistent with the approach taken in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the title VI/title VII regulation. For reasons of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency, section 504 agencies will ordinarily process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints that allege disability discrimination in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment and other practices of a recipient, because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEOC has no jurisdiction over the latter. Historically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under both section 504 and other civil rights statutes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies have also had a particular interest in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement of pattern or practice cases of employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrimination against recipients of Federal assistance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies shall continue to investigate such complaints. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be noted that the term ``pattern or practice'' of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrimination is intended to mean systemic or class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints generally. Although the term ``pattern or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice'' of discrimination is sometimes used in a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow sense to refer to intentional discrimination or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disparate treatment on a classwide level, the term was used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the title VI/title VII rule to refer to both adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact cases and cases of intentional discrimination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting a class of protected individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions described above only apply when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint is filed with a section 504 agency. The EEOC will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always process all charges, including class charges, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are solely filed with the EEOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(2) restates the principle established in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the title II regulation that an agency shall retain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint for investigation when it determines that: (i) it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has jurisdiction over the complaint as a designated agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (ii) that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaint under title I. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

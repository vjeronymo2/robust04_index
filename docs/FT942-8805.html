			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: German repo rate falls to 5.23% The Bundesbank yesterday allowed the securities repurchase or repo rate to drop by 12 basis points to 5.23 per cent following last week's half point cuts in its Lombard and discount rates to five-year lows. The cut was in line with market expectations and financial markets gave it a lukewarm greeting, fearing Germany is nearing the end of its series of rate reductions. The Bundesbank is expected to continue steering its repo rate gradually lower in coming weeks but dealers said this did not suggest that further large official rate declines were in the offing. German bonds and shares rose slightly after the half point US rate rise on Tuesday helped the market by removing uncertainty. The Bank of Portugal forecast Portugal would move out of recession in 1994, with growth of 0.5 to 1 per cent (after falling 1 per cent last year) driven by export growth of 3.5 per cent and investment growth of up to 2.5 per cent. Inflation would fall to between 5.5 and 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in 1993. Peter Wise, Lisbon. The Danish government upgraded its 1994 growth estimate to 4 per cent from an estimate of 3 per cent in December last year. The projection for inflation in 1994 was lowered to 2 per cent from 2.8 per cent. Spain's producer price index was 4.1 per cent higher in March against the same month in 1993, the national statistics institute said. Producer prices were up 1.8 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier.</p>

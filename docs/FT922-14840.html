			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Albanian president steps down PRESIDENT Ramiz Alia, the last of Albania's Stalinist stalwarts, resigned from office yesterday after a landslide election victory for the anti-communist Democratic party 12 days ago, Reuter reports from Tirana. Mr Alia, 67, announced his decision on Albanian state radio. The hand-picked successor to the late dictator Mr Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985, said he would formally present his resignation to parliament today at its first session since the March 22 election. The Democrats won over 60 per cent of the vote, while the communists, renamed the Socialist party, took less than 30 per cent. Mr Alia said he had made his decision after consultations with the Democratic party leader, Mr Sali Berisha, and the head of the Socialists, Mr Fatos Nano. It was not clear whether Mr Berisha, a charismatic 47-year-old heart surgeon, would step into Mr Alia's post or become the country's prime minister. Under the constitution, Albania's president is chosen by parliament. It was Mr Alia who, bowing - albeit late - to a wave of anti-communist sentiment sweeping eastern Europe, decided in December 1990 to permit multi-party elections in Albania. In his statement, he said he had accepted the post of president a year ago to help keep the country united, avoid serious disruptions and lead Albania towards democracy. 'I am offering my resignation for the same reasons,' he said. The Democrats greeted his resignation with satisfaction.</p>

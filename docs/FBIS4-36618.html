			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>   [Text] Several weeks ago, former Jerusalem Mayor Teddy  Kollek invited Jordanian King Husayn to come to Jerusalem and  pray at the Temple Mount mosques. The appeal to Husayn was made  with the knowledge of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres. So far, Kollek has not received an  answer.    Kollek contacted Husayn through a third party associated  with  the former mayor and the king. The mediator made a special trip  to Jordan to deliver the invitation. Kollek suggested that  Husayn come to Jerusalem openly, aboard a special helicopter,  and pray at the graves of his forefathers in the city. The  climax of the visit was to have been festive prayers at the  Temple Mount mosques. Kollek suggested that Husayn return to  Jordan after the prayers, without meeting any Israeli officials.  Kollek advised Rabin and Peres before making the proposal, and  they expressed no opposition.    Kollek confirmed the details of this report yesterday.  According to him, he has not yet received the king's reply,  although a few weeks have passed since the invitation was given.  In the interim, the king underwent ear surgery, and he is  currently in the United States for medical treatment. It is not  clear whether he intends to respond to the former mayor's offer.    It is not clear whether Kollek's offer to Husayn was made at  his own initiative, as the former mayor of Jerusalem, or whether  it was made at Rabin and Peres' request. In any event, the  offer was meant to serve important Israeli interests, as well as  obvious Jordanian interests, at this critical juncture for both  parties. Had Husayn accepted the offer, he would have prayed  publicly on Temple Mount, under extensive media coverage, before  Yasir 'Arafat, and this would have lent support to his demand  for involvement in the management of the Muslim holy sites in  Jerusalem.    A Husayn visit at this time could help Israel resist the  pressure for an 'Arafat visit to Temple Mount and help weaken  the Palestinian demand for control over East Jerusalem and the  Muslim holy sites.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 13 June  reports that "Teddy Kollek expressed regret over the fact that  his proposal to Jordan's King Husayn to visit Jerusalem and pray  at the Temple Mount mosques before Yasir 'Arafat was leaked to  the press." Kollek said "that so far, he has not received any  reply from Jordan with regard to his proposal."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic visited Jagodina  and Curpija today. He said that the program of economic  stabilization gave some encouraging results, but that the prices  of especially services and agricultural produce are still very  high. Our reporter asked the federal prime minister to comment  on yesterday's statement by the governor of the National Bank of  Yugoslavia, Dragoslav Avramovic, that the bank would not give  any credits to the Federal Government before it has secured  wheat. Let us listen what Radoje Kontic said:    [Begin recording] [Reporter Radoslav Nikolic] How do you  interpret the governor's statement that he will no longer give  any credits to the Federal Government?    [Kontic] I did not hear this statement. However, I must  immediately point our that there have been absolutely no  problems in cooperation between the Federal Government and the  National Bank of Yugoslavia so far. We have managed to resolve  all the issues very quickly and efficiently to mutual  satisfaction. I see no reason why this would not be the case in  the coming period. If we share the same strategic goal, which  we do, namely, the preservation of the dinar's stability, the  preservation of the stability of prices, and, within this  context, the reanimation of the overall economic activity and  production, then I really see no reason why we could not agree  on measures, mechanisms, and instruments with which we would  accomplish such strategic goals.    [Nikolic] Mr. Prime Minister, the Federal Government has  issued bonds with an 11 percent interest rate. To what extent  has this damaged the economic program of stabilization?    [Kontic] Well, it is a well known fact that the federal  budget suffers from a rather heavy budget deficit and this  budget deficit can be actively serviced in two ways -- through  money issue, which is inflationary and ill-advised, and through  real sources of income. It is perfectly common in such  situations for a government to issue bonds and in this way  secure real sources of income from the financial market in order  to cover the budget deficit.    In this particular case, this involved some 15 million FRY  dinars, with which we had to settle obligations toward the  Yugoslav Army, or to be precise, toward the military industry.  Bearing in mind that the overall sources were de facto placed  into the military industry, it is absolutely certain that they  will serve the reanimation of production, that is, that they  will comply with the realization of the program of economic  stabilization. I personally believe that governor's remark did  not refer to the fact that bonds were released, but to the  conditions in which the bonds were released. We have  acknowledged his suggestion and, in the future, we will, in  agreement with the National Bank of Yugoslavia, define the  conditions for the issue of bonds. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Georgi Mantarov] </F>   [Text] Formally, our army is more independent than even  the North Korean Army, and yet its international activity  becomes ever more obvious. We could even claim that we  contribute to world military science.    Chiefs of departments, staffs, and regiments compete with  each other to visit foreign countries, and at the same time our  Turkish neighbors prefer to train their soldiers in our country.  Naturally, at our expense. First, it is cheaper, and second,  if anything happens, they will be one step ahead.    The so-called lower-ranking commanders of the Bulgarian Army  cannot refuse to train people who will later join the reserve  troops of the Turkish rather than the Bulgarian Army. Here and  there it has been suggested that the recruits from across the  border have a suspiciously great interest in our arms and army  structures, but all this remains within the realm of specualtion.    The National Assembly members, ostensibly concerned with the  well-being of our motherland, are in no hurry to adopt the armed  forces bill. For the time being, the bill has a loophole that  allows even our officers to have dual citizenship. True, people  who are torn between two countries cannot become officers, but  no one can prevent active officers from acquiring another  passport if they so wish.    Under these circumstances why should the army officers be  angry because the army does not have enough money? There is no  reason to be, if our army can train the cadres of our  traditional rivals free of charge.</p>

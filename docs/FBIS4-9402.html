			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by Alica </F> Strbava; place and date not given: "A Ministry of Not Only  State-Owned Enterprises"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Strbava] Let us speak about  the problems of arms industry conversion. During his visit to  Israel, the defense minister was informed about the conversion  of Israeli arms factories, which was completed within five  years. We are in the fourth year of the conversion of Slovak  enterprises, and many of them still have enormous problems.  What alternatives do these enterprises have?    [Strbava] First, we have to say that, in Slovakia, we have  never introduced arms industry conversion; we simply stopped our  production. I believe this to be a nonsystemic solution to a  nonsystemic decision. For natural reasons, the role of the  state in that sphere is still understood as paternalistic. It  is true that, everywhere in the world, the state has its say in  arms production. This production is not regulated by free market  mechanisms but is subject to the laws of a controlled and  regulated market. We have not adopted methods of developed  economies but have succumbed to the pressure of social groups.  Projects that were expected to compensate for the shock from  conversion--I stress, these projects were not conversion  projects--required a lot of capital. Because of the recession  and imperfect entrepreneurial plans that were drafted under time  pressure and according to antiquated ideas, many restructuring  projects were made ad hoc, putting many enterprises in a  situation where they lack capital. This is, in fact, the root  of our situation today. As a result of this brutal  intervention, teams of top experts vanished. They asserted  themselves in small businesses, which is good, but this cannot  compensate for our losses in large and complex factories.  Jacok, when he wanted to sort out problems in the Chrysler  company, hired a team of top managers, whom he had to overpay.    [Strbava] What will be the solution? Are you considering  the possibility that the Slovak Republic or its arms factories  could join the [Czech] RDP Group?    [Magvasi] It is a big plus that [Czech] enterprises were  able to establish a joint group and find a common language.  Among the Slovak enterprises, there are disintegration trends,  and companies are fighting for the leading place instead of  making efforts to join forces.    [Strbava] The management of many arms factories is against  the entry of foreign capital. They are rather drafting projects  for the privatization of enterprises by shareholders' companies.  They are willing to communicate with foreigners only after the  enterprises are privatized. Therefore they require the creation  of favorable conditions under which they want to privatize the  enterprises. At the same time, they extend the problems, demand  debt write-offs, and reject dividing large production complexes  into smaller units. Is that to our detriment?    [Magvasi] I do not fully agree with your statement that the  management is against the entry of foreign capital. I rather  believe that foreign capital is willing to enter only when the  owner is clearly defined. For them, state ownership,  particularly our way of understanding it, is a too vague  ownership. That is the first thing. The second is: It is true  what you have said that general conditions should be  established that would make the situation clear and tell us  which procedures we should adopt. In Martin, we partially  succeeded in doing it. It has become evident that establishing  four enterprises from the former Turcianske Teplice Engineering  Works by the end of 1992--and making their situation clear--was  one of our good steps. That is, dividing large enterprises into  smaller ones is a way we should go. By changing the political  system, we want to change ownership relations and install the  plurality of ownership relations. Under such circumstances,  privatization has a slightly different function, such as finding  an owner who has the best entrepreneurial plans. This is why  the privatization process must be very comprehensible and must  be made public. We have to have clear information on it and  must accept the fact that we will not be able to satisfy  everyone. If one group is unsuccessful in one project, it should  try another one. Our weakness is that we concentrate on one  thing and, if we fail, we lament our failure. [passage omitted]</p>

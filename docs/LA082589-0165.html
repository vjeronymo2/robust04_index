			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FREAK INJURY IDLES CURTIS STRANGE  </P> <P> U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, citing a neck injury sustained while hanging  up the telephone from his hotel bed, dropped out of the World Series of Golf  today.  </P> <P> "I just don't want to damage myself," Strange said after withdrawing playing  nine holes in the second round.  </P> <P> Strange's withdrawal eliminated him from consideration for the Vardon Trophy,  presented to the PGA Tour player with the lowest scoring average for a minimum  of 60 rounds. To be eligible, a player must complete every competitive round he  starts. The withdrawal also hinders his hopes of repeating as PGA Player of the  Year and of earning his third consecutive money-winning title.  </P> <P> "I was hanging up the phone," Strange said in explaining the injury sustained  Thursday morning. "I was stretching and something popped and I couldn't get out  of it. I couldn't even get back down on the pillow. I don't know how I got out  here to the tournament."  </P> <P> Strange struggled to an opening-round 6-over-par 76 Thursday and was 5-over for  his nine holes today.  </P></p>

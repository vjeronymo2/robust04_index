			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA) -- Today Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid received Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, head of the government recently announced in Aden.    In a statement after the meeting, al-'Attas said they  discussed the current military escalation in Yemen and Sanaa's  defiance of the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution. He  said that Sanaa's escalation of the situation in Yemen is  manifested through the random shelling of economic installations  in the south, such as the oil refinery in Aden that caused big  fires to break out in it. This is in addition to the random  shelling of residential areas, such as al-Shaykh Duwayl and  al-Shaykh 'Uthman neighborhoods.    He added that fierce battles are currently taking place  because of the offensive, which has been launched by the Sanaa  forces against the south. He emphasized that "the people of the  south are desperately defending their city."    Al-'Attas said that serious developments are currently  taking  place in Yemen. The first development is the issuance of a  Muslim legal edict by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, member of  the higher committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is the  third party in the government coalition, allowing the killing of  children, women, and old people and ruling out a cease-fire in  Yemen. Al-'Attas said that this edict expresses Sanaa's  insistence to continue the war.    He said that the second serious development is Sanaa's  refusal to accept the UN Security Council's cease-fire  resolution, citing flimsy reasons to justify its decision.    Al-'Attas affirmed that the Arab League is currently  intensifying its contacts and efforts to bring about a  cease-fire and stop the bloodshed in Yemen.    Answering a question about the extent of international  recognition achieved by the "Democratic Republic of Yemen,"  which was declared in Aden, al-'Attas said that recognition is  not the first issue on the agenda. The first issue is stopping  the bloodshed. Al-'Attas praised the statement Egypt issued  today in support of the efforts to end the war between the north  and south in Yemen. Al-'Attas described Egypt as "one of the  main countries working to achieve peace and stability in Yemen."    Asked about Sanaa's claim that unity was established on the  basis of a popular referendum, and therefore, the south has no  right to dissolve this unity, al-'Attas said that the unity  agreement was concluded by Yemeni leaders and not through a  referendum. He added that the parliamentary elections, which  took place on 27 April expressed the position of the south which  rejects the north's view that it is the principal part and the  south is a branch. The Yemeni Socialist Party retained all the  seats in the southern constituencies.</p>

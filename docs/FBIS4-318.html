			<p>BFN     [Text] The two joint commanders of Mozambique's new  national army, composed of former government and Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance] soldiers, have begun their  first day in office. However, they have no troops to command  yet, as the soldiers are still being selected for retraining.    In an interview after their swearing-in ceremony, former  Renamo military chief, Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, said  that from this moment on he ceased to be Renamo. He said that  he now represented the armed defense forces of Mozambique.    Lieutenant General Lagos Lidimo, selected by the government  as joint commander with Gen. Ngonhamo, said the challenge facing  them was to defend the country and its territorial integrity.  The two officers will command a 30,000-strong army as provided  for in the terms of the 1992 peace accords.</p>

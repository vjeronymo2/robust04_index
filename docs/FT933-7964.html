			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Two US coal groups in discussions over merger ASHLAND Coal, the West Virginia coal company that is 41 per cent owned by Ashland Oil, and Arch Minerals are discussing a merger which could give the combined company North American recoverable coal reserves in excess of 2.5bn tons. The two companies said that the discussions were in the investigative stages and that there was no assurance that a merger would take place. Arch Minerals is a St Louis-based company with six divisions that operate independently in Illinois, Kentucky, West Virginia and Wyoming. It is privately held, owned 50 per cent by Ashland Oil and 50 per cent by interests of the Hunt family of Texas. The majority of Ashland Coal is publicly held. Both Arch Minerals and Ashland Coal properties are involved in a selective strike by the United Mineworkers of America union. The dispute has been continuing for three months.</p>

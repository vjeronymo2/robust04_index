			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 7 February a UNIAN correspondent learned  from reliable sources that the cabinet of ministers and the  National Bank of Ukraine will in the very near future approve a  joint resolution to emerge from the nonpayments crisis between  Ukraine's corporate bodies. Since 1 December 1993 their  receiveables have grown from 46 to 78 trillion karbovantsi.    At a meeting of the Presidium of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP] on 4 February, Ukrainian  Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov stated: Since the  movement of payments has almost halted, "the state's financial  and monetary system is paralyzed" and "industry is low." In his  words, it was decided that there would be considerable financial  "injections" in the economy. The government convinced Ukrainian  Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch of the need for this  move. It is now being coordinated what the plan for this will  be; whether it will be done through index-linking of working  capital or through emission. Vasyl Yevtukhov said he and Deputy  Prime Ministers Valeriy Shmarov and Volodymyr Demyanov estimated  that the total sum of money required was several tens of  trillions of karbovantsi.    In order to set monetary circulation in motion, the USPP  proposed "to determine the karbovantsi sum that would ensure the  first round of payments in goods manufacturing and banking and  to channel it to restoring the production cycle. To do this,  mandatory mutual offsetting of enterprises' debts through  settlement by promissory notes via relevant banks should be  carried out; the enterprises with a negative balance after  mutual offsetting by promissory notes should be identified;  priorities in the structure of the national produce should be  set; the range of enterprises that have the right to state  credits should be determined; and credits to sectors of the  national economy should be prohibited legislatively by the  Ukrainian president's edict. Should monetary emission be  necessary in order to grant state credits to specific  enterprises, it should be carried out."    The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has decided that credits  should be granted to separate sectors along the technological  line: By granting credits to the metallurgy and the coking  by-product industry, the government will enable them to settle  their accounts with the coal miners and the coal miners in their  turn will settle theirs with the power engineers etc. At the  same time, it is providing funds subject to produce in real  terms, rather than granting purely emissive credit, that is at  issue. According to some data, the government will make  ministries' and departments' primary officials personally  responsible for returning the money. In Vasyl Yevtukhov's words,  this scheme of credit provision requires 7-15 trillion  karbovantsi, which is two times less than the sum that was  discussed previously. Separate on the list is the agro-  industrial complex, which requires 3-4 trillion karbovantsi.    In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, acting  Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy confirmed that "the  problem of offsetting mutual indebtedness should be tackled  positively and immediately." He at the same time was  categorical in denying claims that this would lead to  considerable emission, since credits, in his words, will be  granted "exclusively subject to the finished produce." Asked by  a UNIAN correspondent to comment on expert estimates forecasting  initial emission to the amount of five trillion karbovantsi, the  Ukrainian acting prime minister said: "No businessman will ever  see such an emission in Ukraine."    Ukrainian Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko told a  UNIAN  correspondent: "Better emission, or to be more precise,  emissive credit, than mutual offsetting. The offsetting of  mutual indebtedness will take one and a half to two months,  while we need radical and prompt measures to increase the  viability of industry. At present there is a disaster in every  sector."    Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, USPP Chairman Leonid  Kuchma pointed out that the financial system could be unblocked  by interbank promissory note offsetting, which would identify  bankrupt enterprises. He spoke categorically against  automatically offsetting mutual debts. According to the latest  information, however, the government has rejected this USPP  proposal, since the banks are inexperienced in working with  promissory notes.    Asked by a UNIAN correspondent about how well-grounded talk  of emission was, Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek at his  news conference on 4 February answered: "We shall seek to settle  the issues of the budget deficit in the first quarter -- and I  cannot be sure that there will not be any in the second one as  well -- on a non-emission basis. This was one of the subjects  of the talks by the Ukrainian Government delegation in the  United States. The submission of annual financial reports by  enterprises is a convenient time for enterprises to be cleared  up. Address or point assistance will only be given to those who  are the foundation of our export potential."    Roman Shpek also said that delegations from the  International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank are coming to Ukraine next  week.</p>

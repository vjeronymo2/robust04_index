			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Health and Safety Executive: "New </F> Controls On Export of Certain Dangerous Chemicals"]    [Text] New controls on the export from European Community  (EC) countries of certain dangerous chemicals which are destined  for non-EC countries come into effect tomorrow, 11 February 1994.    The chemicals concerned are Aldrin, Dieldrin, DDT, HCH  (mixed  isomers), Fluoroacetamide, and Dinoseb and its salts. The new  controls take the form of a requirement to abide by decisions  made by importing countries about the chemicals in the light of  information about risks associated with their use.    This reflects international concern about the use of  dangerous chemicals, mainly pesticides, in developing countries,  which may not always have the necessary expertise or resources  to use them safely.    The requirement, known as the "Prior Informed Consent" (PIC)  procedure, allows importing countries to decide whether to  accept or refuse the chemicals, or apply conditions to their  import.    The controls have been introduced by means of an amendment  to  an EC Regulation (No. 2455/92). As EC Regulations enter directly  into law in EC member countries, no UK domestic legislation is  required to implement them or amendments to them.    EC Regulation 2455/92 implements United Nations guidelines  recognised by over 120 countries on the export/import of  dangerous chemicals.  <H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>   1. EC Regulation 2455/92 came into effect on 29 November  1992. It has three main requirements:    -- an export notification scheme, already in force; in the  UK  exporters must notify HSE [Department of Health and Safety] of  exports of any of 24 chemicals or groups of chemicals 30 days in  advance of the first shipment to a non-EC country;    -- the Prior Informed Consent scheme; this has just been  activated since the six chemicals mentioned above are the first  to be added to an Annex to the Regulation and become subject to  the PIC requirement;    -- all chemical exports are to be packaged and labelled  correctly as if they were being sent to another EC member  country.    2. The Regulation applies to certain industrial chemicals  and  pesticides but not to shipments intended for research or  analytical purposes, or when they are in the form of waste.

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE, PALOS VERDES MAKE BIDS FOR FINALS BERTHS  </P> <P> Morningside and Palos Verdes high schools, the only South Bay basketball teams  still in contention for state titles, will play home games tonight at 7:30 in  the Southern California girls regional semifinals.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Morningside (29-3) meets Mt. Carmel of San Diego (23-5) in a  Division I match-up, while Palos Verdes (28-5) faces Costa Mesa (18-11) in a  Division III game.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Coach Wendell Yoshida was happy his team bounced back Tuesday with  a 53-37 victory over San Diego's Our Lady of Peace in the first round of the  regionals. It came one game after the Sea Kings lost to Brea-Olinda, 50-33, in  the Southern Section 3-AA finals last week.  </P> <P> "We hated to end the (Southern Section) season not playing well," Yoshida said.  "We had a good season. But one bad game, especially the last one, can leave a  bad taste in your mouth.  </P> <P> "This gives us a reprieve, a second life."  </P> <P> As usual, the Sea Kings received a balanced effort against Our Lady of Peace,  the San Diego champion. Guard Lisa Humphreys had a triple-double of 13 points,  14 rebounds and 10 assists; sophomore center Monique Morehouse had 10 points,  11 rebounds and five blocked shots; forward Kristen Jaconi had 12 points and  seven rebounds, and point guard Susan Wilhite played a "great floor game,"  according to Yoshida.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa, the Southern Section 3-A champion, advanced with a 44-42 win over  Selma, the Central Section runner-up. Guard Olivia DiCamilli scored the winning  basket on a last-second shot and finished with 10 points.  </P> <P> Tonight's winner advances to the Division III regional final at 9:30 a.m.  Saturday at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Morningside, gunning for its third consecutive appearance in the State Division  I final, turned back a stubborn Ventura Buena team Tuesday, 56-49. Center Lisa  Leslie produced another triple-double of 30 points, 11 rebounds and 13 blocked  shots despite sitting out part of the game after drawing her fourth foul early  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel, the San Diego Section runner-up, defeated Southern Section 5-A  champion Hart of Newhall, 65-42.  </P> <P> The Division I regional final will be played at 6:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports  Arena.  </P></p>

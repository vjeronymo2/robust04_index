			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Joust one of those things - Clive Fewins meets a Black Knight who has fought back from reverses Nineteen years ago, Trooper Anthony Edwards was a Queen's Life Guard when, aged 22, he fell from a horse and broke his back. Since then, he has broken his pelvis, too; that kept him out of the saddle for 18 months. Now, though, he rides again - with the Quorn Hunt - and doubles up each summer as the Black Knight, staging 'authentic jousting as seen in the 12th century' and leading a 16-strong troupe of knights, squires, men-at-arms, assorted jesters, minstrels, falconers, fire-eaters, acrobats, dancers and story-tellers. He also owns a restaurant, Squires, which he opened this spring near the village of Burton-on-the-Wolds, a few miles from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. Squires, which is a partnership with Trevor Eggleston - a farmer who is Edwards' landlord, old friend and chief backer - is a means of keeping Black Knight Medieval Entertainments solvent. The jousts just about break even for the five months a year they operate with the help of much sweat, many tears, occasional (real) blood and a Pounds 9,000 overdraft from a sympathetic Leicester bank manager. 'It is too soon to say if the restaurant will be a success,' said Edwards. 'But the building was a ruin when Trevor and I got cracking on it last October. 'Trevor paid for all the conversion work, which we did together, and the building is now worth Pounds 50,000. If the venture should fail, Trevor will hold all the equity, minus what he pays me for my labours at the conversion stage.' So far, the signs are good. Squires operates in the evenings from Wednesdays to Saturdays and at lunchtime on Sundays, and the 38 covers are increasingly full. Edwards does the cooking, aided by a commis chef. His wife, Amanda, is in charge front of house, assisted by several part-time staff. 'When I took on a pub near here in 1974, it was taking in Pounds 200 a week. Twelve years later, when I left, we were turning over Pounds 250,000 a year and Pounds 1,000 on a good night in the restaurant we had created,' Edwards said. Squires is already beginning to supplement the Edwards' family fortunes, which were at a low ebb in October 1992 when debts were rising at an alarming rate. 'Black Knight had been going eight years - I had been running it in parallel with the successful pub business,' Edwards said. 'But we had lost Pounds 27,000 on a property and large piece of land near Marbella in southern Spain that we had unsuccessfully tried to buy as the location for the first Squires restaurant. 'Under the Spanish trespasso (lease) system, if you can't raise all the money,you forfeit the money you originally put down. In our case, we were just Pounds 6,000 short of the Pounds 33,000 needed to buy a plot that made Pounds 6.35m when it was next sold.' So when, in 1992, the chance to team up with Eggleston presented itself, Edwards saw it as the ideal way to restore his fortunes and keep the Black Knight on his charger. 'The boys would be devastated if Black Knight were to close down,' Edwards said. 'They are all as fanatical about jousting as me. Like me, many of them have been enthusiasts since their youth.' 'The boys,' 23 of them, include day-time storemen, carpenters, car mechanics, a stone mason and several students. All unpaid volunteers, they gladly pay their own insurance and are the core from which the 16-strong troupe is chosen when, nearly every weekend in the summer months, the Black Knight takes to the road. The troupe owns six horses and a 1976 Scania bus bought from Leicester city council. The bus transports and sleeps the horses, the performers and two grooms as they travel around Britain. The company gives two carefully-choreographed jousting performances which last 30 minutes and 40 minutes, Black Knight charges Pounds 2,000 for the total 70-minute show. Every move is rehearsed meticulously. In a good year, the troupe will do 25 shows, grossing around Pounds 50,000. Although Edwards aims at 20 per cent profit after paying the expenses of his volunteers and other costly items such as the upkeep of the horses, he rarely reaches this figure. 'In 1986, when I gave up the pub, I was earning Pounds 30,000 a year,' he said. 'But we sold our large house with five bedrooms and three bathrooms to finance the Spanish venture so, since then, life has been very hand-to-mouth.' Edwards' fertile mind has alighted, however, on another grand strategy to raise capital and run in parallel with both Squires and The Black Knight. Next spring, he will launch the Black Knight Medieval Banqueting and Jousting Roadshow. This is an attempt to move the Black Knight show indoors so that it is available to both corporate and private clients throughout the year. Edwards has an interest-free, hire purchase arrangement with the manufacturers for a 200 ft by 50 ft tented pavilion to house the mobile medieval experience. The tent costs Pounds 65,000 but Edwards will pay for it over two years. He has had to pay only Pounds 6,500 so far. The indoor shows will feature a display of skills including quintaining (tilting at a target post), carouseling (picking up hoops with a lance) and pig sticking, as well as jousting and much hand-to-hand fighting with broadswords, double-handed swords, axes, balls and chains and staffs. The rest of the evening will be taken up with a banquet and music, probably of a more modern kind. 'This has the potential of being a Pounds 1m business,' Edwards said. 'The full capacity of the tented structure is 325 and the cost is Pounds 35 a head. I reckon we need 30 shows a year to break even, but we have the capacity to do three shows a week for a 44-week season; that is, 132 shows a year. That's a turnover of more than Pounds 1.5m a year. I am aiming at 30 per cent profit - that is half a million pounds a year.' Edwards has written to 200 companies seeking sponsorship for the venture, to the tune of Pounds 35,000. 'So far, 30 have refused, but we still have 170 to go,' he said. Black Knight Medieval Entertainments, The Stables, Frisby Turn, Frisby-on-the-Wreake, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire LE14 2NS.

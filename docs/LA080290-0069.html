			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT CHARGES ILLEGAL DELAYS IN PROCESSING MEDI-CAL APPLICATIONS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE 45-DAY DEADLINE IS OFTEN VIOLATED, TWO PUBLIC-INTEREST LAW GROUPS  SAY. THEY ALLEGE DIRE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES.  </P> <P> Alleging that pregnant women and newborn children are waiting as long as 14  months for their Medi-Cal applications to be processed, two public-interest law  firms filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court Wednesday against Los  Angeles County and the state Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> As a result of the delays, many poor women in Los Angeles County are going  without prenatal care and are giving birth to sickly, underweight babies, the  suit alleges. Once born, many children are going without immunizations and  other medical care, it says.  </P> <P> Federal law requires applications to be processed in 45 days. In March,  however, 17,000 Medi-Cal applications filed at county offices had been pending  for 60 days or longer, according to statistics compiled by legal-aid attorneys  from county records.  </P> <P> "When pregnant women apply for Medi-Cal to cover their prenatal care and still  have not received a decision on their application by the time their newborn  babies are 6 months old, there's something seriously wrong with the system,"  said Byron Gross, an attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles,  which filed the suit along with the Western Center on Law and Poverty.  </P> <P> Attorneys with the two law firms said they will seek a preliminary injunction  requiring the county to process applications within the statutory 45 days.  Listed as the defendants in the suit are the county Board of Supervisors, the  directors of the county Department of Public Social Services and the county  Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> Carol Matsui, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Social Services,  declined to comment, saying the department had not yet been served with the  suit.  </P> <P> But Steve Carnevale, principal deputy county counsel, disputed the figures  cited by the attorneys. He said 87% of the approximately 21,000 Medi-Cal  applications handled by the county in March were processed on time.  </P> <P> Carnevale added that in most cases a delay past the 45-day waiting period has  "a minimal effect on the client. Whether or not they're eligible for Medi-Cal  doesn't mean they won't get medical care. They can get free medical care at a  county facility."  </P> <P> But Lynn Kersey of the Los Angeles Homeless Health Care Project said that if  economically disadvantaged patients are denied Medi-Cal, the quality of health  care they receive declines dramatically.  </P> <P> Faced with county health workers who tell them that they will be billed for the  services, many pregnant women decide to put off preventive, prenatal health  care, Kersey said.  </P> <P> She added that without Medi-Cal many of her clients are unable to afford  prescribed medicines such as ear drops to treat their infants' infections and  vitamins needed during pregnancy.  </P> <P> Four children and their parents are named in the suit as plaintiffs. Edith  Estrada, 31, has been denied her Medi-Cal eligibility since last November, even  though she met all the program's eligibility requirements, the suit alleges.  </P> <P> The complaint said that as a result, Estrada was unable to receive prenatal  care during the last three months of her pregnancy. Her daughter, Rubi Garcia,  was born in January underweight and is classified by doctors as "high-risk."  Still, the 7-month-old baby and her mother have yet to receive their Medi-Cal  eligibility, the suit says.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-area attorneys who work with the poor said they began to notice a  dramatic increase in Medi-Cal processing delays about a year ago when Medi-Cal  rules were changed to make more people eligible for the program.  </P> <P> Gross said he and other public-interest attorneys had been meeting with county  health officials to discuss the delays for the last few months. When the talks  failed to correct the situation, he said, the attorneys moved to file the  lawsuit.  </P> <P> Gross said a hiring freeze -- lifted earlier this year -- at the Department of  Public Social Services may be partly to blame for the delays. He cited a  department study that showed the number of pending Medi-Cal applications had  increased from 7,451 in January, 1988, to 21,806 in December, 1989.  </P></p>

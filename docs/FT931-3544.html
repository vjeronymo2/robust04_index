			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Dumptrucks seller hopes to scale the peaks again: How one importer has coped with the recession WHEN Mr Chris Rees shows a picture of the 'Matterhorn' to visitors to his office near Cambridge, the last thing on his mind is a skiing holiday in the Swiss Alps. This 'Matterhorn' is a graph of the UK market for articulated dumptrucks. The summit was in 1989 when 869 trucks were sold, according to statistics from London-based RB Research. 'Happy days,' comments Mr Rees. Last year sales languished at 293 units. Mr Rees, managing director of VME Construction Equipment GB, the UK importer for the Brussels-based group, says he is 'hoping for twin peaks'. For the first eight months of last year, VME - best known in the UK for its Volvo BM loaders and dumptrucks - coped with the recession relatively well. It increased the market shares of its main products, sticking to a policy of premium prices and a high level of customer support. Dropping prices too far, says Mr Rees, would in turn depress the high resale value of the plant  -a crucial selling point. Employment has been reduced sharply - 265 in the UK compared with 400 in 1989 for VME and the much smaller UK workforce of Akermans, a Swedish hydraulic excavator company acquired in 1991. Employees have agreed a pay freeze for this year. On top of the recession, Mr Rees and his team had a short, sharp shock in the autumn. Unlike big multinational rivals such as Caterpillar and Komatsu, VME has no UK manufacturing plant, and the devaluation of sterling in September triggered what Mr Rees calls 'two months of hell'  - VME imports 95 per cent of its products, and all its parts, from Sweden. Then came the devaluation of the Swedish krona in mid November, and it was back to square one. Until September 15, Mr Rees was looking to turn in a profit of Pounds 1m for the year, but Black Wednesday changed all that. 'We sat in this room that afternoon wondering what the hell we were going to do,' he says. The effect of a 15 per cent reduction in margins was felt immediately, as the company carries very little stock. After discussing the situation with his head office, Mr Rees and his national sales manager, Mr Bob Watterson, decided to continue trading as if the devaluation had not occurred. The company badly wanted to avoid disorderly pricing if the increases were reversed a few weeks later, and passing on the effect of the devaluation to customers would have hit sales volume. 'Volume is critical,' says Mr Rees. 'We need to keep up sales of machines to support our parts and service operation in two or three years time. It's a balancing act between short-term profits and long-term benefits.' After a big sales push in December, VME broke even last year. Trading in the first quarter has been better than a year ago, and some confidence has returned, says Mr Rees. What customers need now, he says, is stability. But those cherished twin peaks remain a long way beyond the horizon. A gentle upward gradient is the most that can be hoped for this year.</p>

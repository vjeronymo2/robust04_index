I read it carefully  because I spent my school years on Chukotka and I have been  there on business trips. This opus left me with a wild  impression. The former Soviet writer, ex-secretary of the Union  of Writers of the RSFSR and an activist in the Komsomol-Youth  and other widespread publications, retells from the words of his  dinner partner a couple of old anecdotes about residents of the  North. For instance, about the fact that a representative of the  local authorities when filling out passports, not being terribly  bright, filled in all of them with names like Ivan Ivanov,  Petrov, Sidorov, etc., and a photographer who was no better  pasted photographs of one person in all the documents--he said  they all looked the same.    Funny, is it not? Especially when you find out that the  writer's friend was talking about Koryaks, who live, as we know,  on Kamchatka, while the article made no mention at all of  Chukchi. Is it worthwhile to waste paper and ink on such a  "myth"? The answer, which is simple for any self-respecting  writer, is not only not acceptable to Povolyayev but, on the  contrary, he tries to capitalize on other people's anecdotes, as  it were, cutting himself a piece of ham from the overall  swinishness. Hence the attempt to appear as one who tells  "pretty tales" about international friendship supposedly  generated by the "empire of evil," from which Povolyayev broke  away, after being treated extremely well there, again in the  name of the triumph of democracy.    I was inclined to remain silent. Let God be his judge. But  my  pain over the fate of that wonderful land to which I had come so  close, its small and adult children, would not leave me in peace  all this time. As for the friendship of peoples, which is now  threatening to become anathema, we would do better to listen to  the writer Yuriy Rytkheu.    "I recall a case from my childhood," said Rytkheu. "In 1940  an unprecedented flu epidemic broke out among us in Uzlen, and  at that time the Northern peoples were not so protected. We were  all in bed in our tepees. There was nobody to go hunting. And we  had nothing with which to buy food. We were already eating  cooked strips of leather, pieces of walrus hide. And suddenly  some incredible news spread through our tepees: Everyone could  go to the store and take food, whatever he needed and however  much he wanted. Absolutely free of charge. At first nobody  believed this, and then somebody decided to go and see. I went  too. It all turned out to be true. To this day I get a lump in  my throat when I recall this.    "The country was at war. Leningrad, besieged by the enemy,  was under a blockade. The entire working rear was on a  starvation ration, and suddenly the store in Uzlen was opened  wide and we were taking bread baked by the Russian baker Uncle  Kolya from an unmanned store, without a salesman. Perhaps it was  this bread that saved my compatriot Anna Ntutetegryne, who later  became chairman of the Chukotka district ispolkom [executive  committee] and a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet  of the USSR. And my sister Galya, who is working as an animal  breeder. And myself, whose first teacher of literature was  Aleksandr Tvardovskiy. And many others of my countrymen...Yuriy  and Galina Rytkheu, Antonina Kymtytval, Anna Ntutetegryne, Zoya  Nenlyumkina, Nina Akukyn, Vladislav Rintetegin--Russian first  names, Chukchi and Eskimo last names. These were their parents'  names.    "And as for certain difficulties with the pronunciation and  writing, perhaps our state which is zealously striving to be  democratic should take the path of Western 'civilized'  countries. Yuriy Sergeyevich told me about the only Eskimo  student in Canada, Mary Carpenter, from the University of  Western Ontario. She gave him a brochure published by the  Indian-Eskimo Association of Canada which said Canadians spend  on average per year: $500 million on travel abroad, $1  billion--on alcoholic beverages, $200 million--on confectionery  items, and $30 million--on food for dogs and cats. And reading  on in this brochure one could learn that out of every thousand  newborn Eskimos almost one-fifth die in childhood--10 times more  than among the white residents of Ontario. During past years the  standard of living of white Canadians has risen higher and  higher, but as for Eskimos...."    In parting Rytkheu asked Mary to write her address down in  his notebook. After her name Mary wrote W-3-244.    "Is that your postal address?" Yuriy Sergeyevich tried to  clarify.    "No," answered Mary, "that is my number." It turned out  that,  for purposes of government statistics, Eskimos of Canada do not  have first names. This is explained by the fact that Eskimo  names are too difficult to pronounce and write. Therefore they  have decided to assign each Eskimo a number.    "Western Eskimos have the letter W in front of their name,  just as I do, and Eastern ones have E. It is easy and simple. We  in Tiyuktoyuk have carved these numbers on a wooden chip and  every Eskimo wears this chip on a chain around his neck, next to  the cross," Mary explained.    Some 40,000 people, a whole nation, have been numbered like  a  herd of reindeer or a crowd of prisoners in a concentration  camp. Indeed: "What is in a name?" But here in Leningrad back in  the 1930's the only faculty of peoples of the Far North in the  world was opened at the Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I.  Gertsen, and dozens of generations of humanities specialists  have trained there, making up the basis of a new national  intelligentsia.    Since the beginning of "perestroyka" this process has slowed  up considerably as, incidentally, have all the other processes  related to the socioeconomic position of indigenous and  immigrant residents of Chukotka. And the apogee of plundering  has been reached. The prolonged illness of this region's economy  is threatening to come to an abrupt end. The more gold, fish,  pelts, and other assets the state structures and private  entrepreneurs take out of this land, the worse the life of its  inhabitants become, year after year.    Back four years ago the shortage of goods from Magadan  Oblast, and hence above all from Chukotka, amounted to 54  million rubles [R] (not the present "wooden" ones, but the  former full-value "Union" ones), of which R42 million were for  food. Each year here they obtain practically no meat, potatoes,  vegetables, or fruits. During the last navigation period they  shipped in barely 20 percent of the Northern "food basket." And  what else can be expected when a state, torn apart by political  and ethnic conflicts, bled dry by hyperinflation and a  catastrophic drop in production, is not able to feed its own  citizens even on the Mainland.    Everything extracted on Chukotka goes for export--to be  sold.  And what is received in exchange? Coupons for sugar, alcohol,  and condensed milk. Do you want more food products and of better  quality? Go to the commercial stores where, what with the higher  costs of fuel, payment for energy sources, and the disappearance  of the paper ruble, prices are such that you would not dream  about them in a terrible nightmare. And these mountain hicks can  now take anything they want from commerce. Oranges, tangerines,  raisins, unlimited alcohol....    "How do they get there," I naively asked the people with  whom  I was talking, "if this is a special zone and even someone on a  business trip has to present a special permit from the organs of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs in their place of residence?"    "Very simple. At some point a person has gone to vacation in  the Caucasus, he has been discovered by local merchants and  offered a deal: You send me an invitation to be a guest and I  will pay you with both money and goods when I arrive. How can  you resist the temptation when things are as scarce as they are  today?"--they explained to me.    For a certain amount of time the local authorities were  still  hoping for state credit. Today, now that through the efforts of  the "shock therapists," food prices have shot out of sight,  there are no hopes for credit. The all-Russian conference on  problems of survival of the Northern peoples held recently in  Krasnoyarsk could only sum up the sad results of the current  destructive credit policy of the powers that be in these regions.    "The money that is being allotted is several times less than  what is needed. The credit moves to the recipients at such rates  that during this time because of inflation and the complete  destabilization of the price policy it almost turns into a heap  of ashes. In some places the navigation period lasts only 10-25  days. Nobody needs the money arriving on the 26th day--after all  there are simply no other ways of bringing in supplies."    Thus the residents of Chukotka of all  nationalities--Chukchi,  Eskimos, Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, who at one time  were representatives of the unified Soviet brotherhood of  peoples and now do not know what their citizenship is or who  needs them--have only one solution: to go begging to their  relatives in Alaska and its state authorities and ask for help  or engage in underground barter and recall the good old days  when the Soviets were still in power here. Perhaps in general  they should follow the example of Alaska and sell Chukotka to  Clinton along with Magadan so that they will not bother Moscow,  the Kremlin, and the White House with their long-standing  complaints and requests like this?    When I was still a child I read a remarkable book by Tikhon  Semushkin entitled "Alitet Goes to the Mountains," which  discusses the first years of Soviet power on Chukotka.    And he is not the only person whose creative work was linked  to the Far North and pointed out the path of great Russian  literature to its talented sons. Semushkin discussed this in a  conversation with Yuriy Rytkheu: "It seems to me that you and  Grigoriy Khodzher, and Vladimir Sangi, and Yuvan Shestalov, and  many others seem to come from the books written by Vatslav  Serashevskiy, Vladimir Bogoraztan, Vladimir Arsenyev, Gennadiy  Gor, Nikolay Shudin...."    With their help and support during the forties and fifties  they formed the spiritual environment in which the local  intelligentsia grew up. Yuriy Rytkheu himself, having become a  student at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I.  Gertsen, began his literary activity with a translation into his  native language of the works of Russian and Soviet writers,  received the blessing of A. Tvardovskiy on the pages of NOVYY  MIR and published more than 30 books with 8 million copies  translated into 17 languages, not counting the languages of the  peoples of the Soviet Union.    Reflecting on this creative process of mutual enrichment of  cultures, Yuriy Rytkheu then writes: "It is interesting that  during those years we did not even think about receiving the  wealth of another people. It seemed to me at that time that it  was quite natural and legitimate that the wealth of one people  belonged to another."    It seems to me that a people's cultural wealth essentially  does not depend on numbers although, on the other hand, it lives  and develops only as long as its creator thrives in the land.    I recall my last meeting in Anadyr with participants in the  Eskimo people's ensemble "Atasikun." The women take along their  tambourines and drums and they sing. The pounding of the drums  and the singing that penetrates to the heart took me back to  somewhere in ancient times and I got the feeling that I was on a  seacoast at sunrise. Two boys were dancing and their smooth,  rhythmic movements told me visually about the awakening of the  polar night. Then it turned out that I was not mistaken: This  dance, "Our Land," was handed down from generation to  generation, and in general everything I saw that evening was not  simply a concert. People of kindred spirit had gathered here and  they spoke the language of song and dance and recalled something  very distant and dear. And along with respect for them and  delight in their art, in my heart there grew a feeling of  sadness: Why are there so few of them?    Are you alive, "Atasikun?" How are things going for you in  this time of trouble when the laws of our friendship have been  trampled into the dirt by highly placed Ivans who do not recall  their heritage?</p>

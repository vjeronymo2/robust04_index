			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): A handy way to collect data Security guards, nurses and even meter readers could benefit from the latest computer from IBM. The TouchMobile is IBM's smallest machine - a data collection and communications terminal that fits in one hand. The TouchMobile is intended for workers on the move who need to record data using either a stylus, finger tip or scanner unit which reads barcodes. Weighing 2lb, the unit uses a radio link to send or gather information from the company computer. At the end of the day the terminals are placed in a 'docking station' which transmits data and recharges the batteries (which can last a day without recharging). IBM: UK, 0705 321212.</p>

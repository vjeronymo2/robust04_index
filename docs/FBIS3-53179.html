He said the team's principal concerns are the remains of  the Israelis and the whereabouts of the Israeli pilot.    Mufti Qabalan added that the Lebanese and Arab detainees who  are suffering in Israeli prisons are of no value in the American  view. Shaykh Qabalan called for releasing the Lebanese detainees  if the Americans wish to show signs of goodwill.</p>

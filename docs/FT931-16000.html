			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Equitable Life places Airtours stake at 260p AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 214.5m bid for rival holiday tour operator, Owners Abroad, showed signs yesterday that it has met with a less than unanimous welcome from shareholders. Equitable Life Assurance, the fund manager, placed a 6.4 per cent stake with Morgan Grenfell at 260p, about 31p below the price at which Airtours closed on Thursday night. Airtours shares dipped below 280p yesterday, some 8p below the price at which the partial cash alternative is being underwritten by BZW and The British Linen Bank. However, they ended the day 3p down at 288p. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said he was sorry to see Equitable go but was pleased that BZW had placed the block so quickly and with one share-holder. 'During the course of the bid there will be ups and downs, he said. 'It's early days yet.' Meanwhile, Thomas Cook denied market rumours that it had withdrawn its offer of a tie-up with Owners Abroad, which was announced last month. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said its offer remained 'a very strong commercial proposition'. It has proposed to take a 10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad and form the basis for Owners to develop a pan-european holiday company, 'We have every expectation and hope that the offer will be accepted' by Owners Abroad shareholders, he said. Owners has adjourned the EGM at which this proposal was to be addressed. Equitable is understood to have become an Airtours shareholder in 1990 and was sitting on a substantial profit. Owners Abroad shares slipped 3p to 119p. See Man in the news</p>

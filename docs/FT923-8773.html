			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: US officials urged to probe drugs outburst Track and field's world governing body has demanded an investigation and a written report from the US Olympic Committee over drug allegations by 200 metres gold medallist Gwen Torrence. A spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation said the organisation wrote to USOC President William Hybl regarding the case. Torrence said after last Saturday's 100m final, in which she finished fourth, that some runners in the field used drugs. Torrence has refused to name names publicly.</p>

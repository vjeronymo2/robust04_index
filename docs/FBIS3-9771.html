Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov today met the press to  elaborate on the visit.    Asked if Bulgaria and Albania differed on the UN Security  Council decision to send Turkish peacekeepers to former  Yugoslavia, Vlaykov said this issue was only considered in the  course of the general review of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Daskalov reiterated the Bulgarian call on  neighbouring countries to refrain from participation in the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].    Vlaykov said during a joint press conference of the  Bulgarian  and Albanian foreign ministers in Tirana yesterday, Daskalov was  asked about the Bulgarian position on Kosovo. He said Bulgaria  opposed any interference by foreign forces in seeking a solution  to this internal problem.</p>

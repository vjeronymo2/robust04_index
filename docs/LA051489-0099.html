			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS  </P> <P> The San Diego city schools Board of Education is again taking what should be  valuable planning time to consider whether or not to implement proposed health  clinics on public school campuses.  </P> <P> Our schools are already teaching sex education and AIDS awareness. They would  do well to now concentrate on developing and implementing better basic  educational programs for our children and grandchildren, who to date are being  taught at a level that is already leading us -- inevitably -- to becoming a  second-class nation in tomorrow's world.  </P> <P> Our school boards would do well to stay out of moral issues, particularly when  they are bound so greatly in religious tenets and are considered by a majority  of us to be a primary parental responsibility.  </P> <P> We want -- we need -- concentration on truly educational courses, better school  facilities and better teachers receiving substantially better pay, commensurate  with what should be a professional and honorable career.  </P> <P> STEVEN P. YOUNG  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

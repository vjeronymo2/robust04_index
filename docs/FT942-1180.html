			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Party loses its footing: The fluctuating fortunes of Germany's SPD When Mr Rudolf Scharping chose a cavernous indoor ice-rink on the outskirts of Halle, in eastern Germany, as the venue to launch his campaign last Wednesday for the German chancellery, he was taking a calculated risk. Not only was this monument to east Germany's former obsession with sports, with its banks of orange plastic seats screwed to concrete benches, a terrible place for a big set-piece speech, even to the party faithful. It was more than that. Halle, once capital of a sprawling chemical industry, now ravaged by unemployment, is in the throes of an election campaign for a new parliament and government in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The voters go to the polls tomorrow. So Mr Scharping, the neatly bearded, 46-year-old leader of Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), was putting his election-winning reputation on the line. Four months ago, he looked a good bet. Mr Scharping and the SPD were riding high, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was trailing in opinion polls, the economy was still in the doldrums, and the conservative-liberal coalition government in Saxony-Anhalt was in disarray after the resignation of its premier and three ministers in a scandal over inflated salaries. The Halle party conference to endorse Mr Scharping as the candidate for chancellor was just what was needed, the party strategists declared. It would secure a resounding win in the state election, and set Mr Scharping on his way for the chancellor's office come the general election in October. This week, it all looked like a very risky gamble. It is Mr Scharping and the SPD who are now falling behind, after a damaging defeat in the June 12 European election. Local elections on the same day in Saxony-Anhalt saw Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) still in front of the SPD, in spite of the salary scandals, although only by a narrow 1.5 percentage point margin (by 31.2 per cent to 29.7). Yesterday's national Politbarometer opinion poll, broadcast by ZDF television, put the CDU on 40 per cent nationally, to just 36 for the SPD. As for Mr Scharping, he is trailing Mr Kohl in the race to be the next chancellor by 48 per cent to 41 - a reversal of their fortunes at the turn of the year. On Wednesday, the mood on the ice-rink was grim. Yet everyone knew they had to put on a good show. Mr Scharping rose to the challenge. He delivered a storming speech, in complete contrast to his normal wooden, preachifying style. He mocked the 'fat man' in the chancellor's office, denounced the inequities of west German materialism and east German joblessness, and told his detractors in the party to 'put up, or shut up'. The question is whether his newfound fury has not come too late. For the tide seems to be running against the SPD, in both east and west. The party has been unable to make a clear political breakthrough, in spite of still rising unemployment and last year's sharp recession, and even against a chancellor like Mr Kohl, who has never been genuinely popular. Many question whether the SPD's malaise is not more fundamental than a question of policies, or of personalities. 'This is a very difficult time for social democracy,' says Mr Jurgen Burckhardt, director of the Friedrich Ebert foundation, the SPD think tank. 'It is very difficult to formulate policy under our changed circumstances, because you can only tell people unpleasant things.' In areas such as the extension of social benefits, or the protection of lower income groups - classic social democratic themes - the SPD now admits that public funds are not adequate to the task. Yet in seeking to be realistic and blunt about the financial possibilities, it is alienating both its traditional voters and new, more prosperous groups. 'The main themes for which social democracy always stood, and their main voters, are no longer recognisable,' says Mr Karl-Rudolf Korte, head of the Germany political science research group at the University of Mainz. 'If everything comes together in a great middle-of-the-road coalition, where will be the specific themes for the SPD?' Ever since he was elected leader just one year ago, Mr Scharping has sought to move his party towards the middle ground, to present it as a safe and stable alternative government, and one which might be more competent economically. Yet it is precisely on the question of 'economic competence' that the voters appear to have lost faith with the SPD. In January, a majority rated the opposition above the ruling coalition on that question. But as signs of economic recovery have started to multiply, they have changed their minds. 'The election strategy of the SPD has failed,' says Mr Hans-Joachim Veen, director of research at the CDU's Konrad Adenauer foundation. 'It was a defensive strategy which was wrong from the start, saying: 'We are like the CDU, but rather better.' That meant they were bound to the CDU. They did not control the themes. They had no profile of their own. And the moment the economy started to improve, the CDU could only gain.' The danger for the Social Democrats is that they are looking ever more like an acceptable party for provincial politics - governing at the state or local government level - but not for the national capital. All their main leaders are state politicians. Mr Scharping's safe, dull and provincial image has only compounded the impression. 'He presents himself as a younger Mr Kohl,' says Dr Korte. The irony is that the two may yet be condemned to govern together. For even if Mr Kohl emerges victorious, as the latest polls suggest, the electoral mathematics suggests he will not command a majority with his current coalition. The Free Democratic party, Mr Kohl's current partner, is weak, and may barely scrape back into the Bundestag. As far as the social democrats are concerned, their strategists seem already to be prepared to contemplate a setback in October. 'I am convinced Scharping has a chance in the medium term, even if he does not make it this autumn,' says Mr Burckhardt. 'Halle convinced me. He has got what it takes. This man is 46. And look how long it took Willy Brandt.' Mr Brandt became chancellor at 55.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Waiting for the eagle to strike again: Anheuser casts a cautious eye on growth For more than a decade, Anheuser-Busch of the US, the world's biggest brewer, has been expected to impose its bulky presence on the international beer market. Its intentions have been a constant source of speculation - most recently as a possible bidder for Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group. Yet, although the St Louis-based brewer produces more than 100m hectolitres of Budweiser, Busch, and Michelob beers a year - 40m hls more than the entire UK beer production - it exports only 3 per cent of its output. 'Our current strategy is more cautious than bold,' Mr August Busch, the chairman, admitted in the company's recent annual report. But he added: 'Longer term, the international beer mar-ket will become a more important source of volume and profits.' For the next few years, however, Anheuser will concentrate on the US domestic beer market where its potential growth is still huge. It has led the US beer industry since 1957. Last year, it increased its share of the total US market by two points to 43.7 per cent, with net sales worth Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 4bn). Anheuser now sells twice as much beer as its nearest rival, Miller Brewing, owned by Philip Morris, the US foods and tobacco group. The concentration of the US industry is continuing. Anheuser, Miller, and third-ranked Adolph Coors, account for 75 per cent of the market. In the next five years, the three groups will control 85 per cent, Mr Jerry Ritter, Anheuser's chief financial and administrative officer, confidently predicts. 'Anheuser is well on track to achieve its goal of a 50 per cent market share by the mid-1990s,' he says. Its progress towards that priority target appears relentless. First-quarter sales this year suggest that Anheuser has taken a doubling of excise tax on beer in its stride, just as it coped with last year's price discounting by competitors. Its interests in theme parks, food products, can manufacturing and baseball  -the company owns the St Louis Cardinals - do not distract from its commitment to brewing. Its brand marketing is aggressive, sustained and richly funded. Last year, it spent Dollars 613m on advertising. It has a dedicated nationwide distribution system. Budweiser brands account for one in every three beers sold in the US. More than half the country's 80m beer drinkers aged between 21 and 27 years are Bud consumers. Anheuser has also not been afraid to innovate. Bud Dry Draft, a beer with less sugar and no aftertaste was launched nationally last year and sold 3m barrels. The beer was judged one of the most successful new product introductions in the industry's history, even though some of its sales were gained from other Budweiser brands. This year, Anheuser is test marketing two new Michelob brands. 'We are developing new products to meet new tastes and segmenting the market further,' says Mr Ritter. With US brewers such as Stroh and Heileman losing share and the beer market still growing, if slowly, Mr Ritter calculates that there will be up to 5m barrels a year of new business to be won up to the middle of the decade. Against that background, he says: 'There is no great sense of urgency about plunging into high-risk areas overseas.' For the moment, at least, there is no inclination to change tactics by striking boldly to capture a brewer such as Allied-Lyons. 'We are quite willing to make investments in brewing assets abroad,' says Mr Ritter, 'so long as we can maintain our pattern of seeking a fair return on capital for shareholders.' The 'outrageous' prices paid over recent years for UK and European breweries would make that impossible. 'There will be opportunities later to buy assets, if necessary, at reasonable prices,' he suggests. Anheuser's international progress so far has been made mainly through licensing agreements with national brewers. These include Suntory in Japan, its largest export market, GrandMet in the UK, Guinness in Ireland, Labatt in Canada, Carlsberg in Denmark, and Oriental Brewing in South Korea. Such agreements have generally worked well. Budweiser is the leading international brand in Japan with 60 per cent of the category. In Canada, it has captured 4 per cent of the beer market. Sales in Ireland grew 52 per cent last year; and in the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of its European sales of 657,000 hls annually, Budweiser is one of the fastest growing premium lagers. The licensed brewers take a large share of the profits, however, and the uncertainties of such agreements was illustrated by the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's breweries this year by Courage, the UK's second-largest brewer. Mr Ritter confesses that this deal, which put Anheuser's Budweiser in the same portfolio as its US rival's Miller Lite, has caused 'very great concern'. Anheuser is discussing the situation with Courage and seems to have decided that, because of Miller's different positioning as a standard lager, it may be able to live with the arrangement. Courage, however, will have to provide some guarantees. 'The key factor,' says Mr Ritter, 'is the amount of attention that our brand will get. We have to ensure that it does not come to be seen as just one in a herd of premium lagers.' Anheuser sees 'great opportunities' for the future in the UK and continental Europe as the brewing industry restructures, trade barriers come down, and former communist states move to market-based economies. It is optimistic about resolving its long-standing trademark dispute with Czechoslovakia's Budweiser brewery and perhaps developing some form of joint venture. To strengthen its position in Europe generally, Anheuser established its own sales, distribution, and marketing organisation covering 17 countries last year. European sales volumes promptly rose 20 per cent. Budweiser is now listed by all the UK's leading brewers, and the foundations for future growth have been reinforced by its introduction into Greece, Sweden and Belgium. 'By moving slowly, we have gained knowledge of, and experience in, foreign markets without tying up significant capital,' says Mr Ritter. 'We feel confident that we now know the market inside out,' he adds. Bullish words, perhaps, but competitors may well detect an ominous note.</p>

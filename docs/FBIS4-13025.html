			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA) -- President Saddam Husayn has  expressed his confidence that the downing of two U.S.  helicopters in northern Iraq on 14 April is linked with an evil  scheme prepared in advance by Washington, London, and Paris.  Addressing a number of fighters, who participated in the  liberation of al-Faw City six years ago, his excellency revealed  that the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France  summoned Iraq's representative at the United Nations on the day  in which the incident involving the two planes took places and  informed him that their countries would patrol the Zakho-Fa'idah  highway without revealing the purpose of this.    The president noted that a memorandum from the Foreign  Ministry following the meeting between Iraq's representative and  the three ambassadors indicated that the language of the  ambassadors was hopeful and reassuring and that the objective of  their countries' deployment of the patrol was not provocative  and that they have no intention of waging a confrontation with  Iraq.    His Excellency President Saddam Husayn emphasized that the  meeting among the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and  France and the ambassador of Iraq at the United Nations took  place following instructions from their governments. He said  the meeting was designed to serve an evil action whose nature he  hoped will be become clear later. He said the meeting must have  had a connection with those who were aboard the two downed  helicopters.    His excellency pointed to the questions that were raised by  many political observers about the mission of the helicopters,  the identity and specialty of those who were on board, and what  they may have had been carrying.    His excellency the president called the downing of the  American helicopters by American fighters a scandal that has  exposed a moral, spiritual, practical, and humanitarian weakness  in the nations of the alliance led by Washington.    His excellency the president drew attention to the  objectives  of the enemy circles and the intentions they had in common with  the media and propaganda organizations they control and  manipulate so as to promote their interests and objectives. He  said the premeditated goal of the operation became apparent as  soon as the incident occurred, when certain suspect radio  stations put out press statements claiming that Iraqi aircraft  had downed two American helicopters.    His excellency said it was likely that if it were not for  the  fact that there were other casualties besides the Americans and  the fear that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, the  media would have stuck to the allegations and used them as  grounds to level charges against Iraq as they have done in the  past and continue to do now.    President Saddam Husayn recalled the chapters of Iraqi  confrontation against Iran's hostile scheme and the pictures of  Iraq's victory over these evil objectives. He said that the  liberation of al-Faw was the first step on the road to victory.  He said that the enemies were very concerned with entrenching a  fact that is alien to Arab heritage, but which they have become  known for by others recently -- namely, the land that is taken  from Arabs will not return to them and that Arab armies cannot  launch counterattacks to liberate their lands.    The president concentrated on the role of the Zionist  quarters in spreading despair among the Arabs. He said that  Zionism is working in this direction in all its activities and  moves, and with all its branches and potential.    The president stressed that the liberation of al-Faw foiled  all these false theories. He said: For the first time in  contemporary Arab history an Arab country liberated its land  without any political bargains or compromises. This was  achieved in the liberation of al-Faw.    President Saddam Husayn added: Al-Faw was the beginning,  where wills clashed. A city was liberated without any political  intervention or foreign factors. Victories were then achieved  when every inch on which the aggressors encroached was liberated.    His excellency shed light on the military lesson  crystallized  by Iraqi determination on the ground of confrontation against  the Iranian enemy to liberate al-Faw and every inch of Iraq's  territory. He said: No army, in a long war, can claim that its  enemy will not achieve any victories on the front because the  enemy can become stronger and superior and can benefit from  other factors that will take this army by surprise.    In light of this lesson, His Excellency President Saddam  Husayn urged the commanders not to belittle any field action,  combat front, or move no matter how small. He underscored that  it is these small moves and steps that add up to the final  result.    His excellency the president cautioned, however, that the  forest should not be overlooked for the trees, and that small  factors should not distract the commander from the determination  that the final strategy and results must be to his advantage.  He reaffirmed the importance of handling small moves on the  front on the basis of this overall strategy.    His excellency the president expressed his confidence that  the practical implementation of this concept is possible not  only in the military field, but that it is also possible to  translate this concept into practice in the areas of politics,  economics, social life, and security matters.    His Excellency President Saddam Husayn expressed his faith  and conviction that the leadership in Iraq is capable of  effecting changes in the overall situation if the pressure  increases and the situation becomes vulnerable. If such a thing  were to happen, the Iraqi leadership, the president added, would  also be capable of introducing new factors into the picture,  factors that could absorb any additional elements that might be  brought into play by the enemy.    His excellency the president expressed his full confidence  in  the future of the confrontation between Iraq and the U.S.-led  alliance, saying that the enemies' anti-Iraq posture can be  likened to a man seizing the sword by its blade. When the owner  of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the adversary will find  himself compelled to either release his grip around the sword or  risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have to release  the sword.</p>

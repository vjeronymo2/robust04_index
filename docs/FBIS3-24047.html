			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statements by State Duma deputies: "Civil Peace or Verdict </F> on the Reforms?"]    [Excerpts] Two events in the past week--the State  Duma's amnesty decision and the president's annual report to the  two chambers of the Federal Assembly--have disturbed the  relative calm of the country's political life. We have offered  political scientists, journalists, and deputies themselves a  chance to comment on them. Readers will easily see for  themselves that the first event preoccupies our respondents  considerably more. And this is natural because with the release  of the Lefortovo prisoners there has been a qualitative change  in the political situation in the country. And not for the  better, it would seem.  <H3>  Sergey Yushenkov, deputy of the State Duma (Russia's  Choice): The Role of the Government in Both Matters Is Enigmatic </H3>   The amnesty decree was adopted with numerous violations of  the standing orders, serious ones at that. I will cite just some  of them. Rybkin did not have the right to preside over the  sitting of the State Duma since he had presented the report. But  he employed the methods and means of the former Supreme Soviet  produced under the leadership of Ruslan Khasbulatov. It may be  said that Khasbulatov was set at liberty thanks to the methods  he employed in the Supreme Soviet. A second most flagrant  violation was that the decree was assumed as the basis,  amendments were submitted, many amendments were rejected, but at  least one amendment was adopted. That is, the decree should have  been put to the vote one more time, not as the basis this time  but as a whole. This was not done. The next violation was  connected with the fact that representatives of Russia's Choice  were not allowed to speak to the motion but supporters of the  amnesty, on the other hand, were recognized repeatedly. Thus the  decree, which was adopted with the most flagrant violations of  the standing orders, has no legal validity. This was not,  unfortunately, noticed by the representatives of the president,  this was not noticed by the prosecutor general. Although we can  agree with their interpretation of the Constitution, amnesty is,  truly, the prerogative of the State Duma, not the president.  Though in this case the content of the amnesty goes beyond the  framework of amnesty proper, it was a pardon. And the latter is  the prerogative of the president.    The affiliation to the Communists, the Agrarians, and the  Zhirinovskiyites of the Shakhray faction, New Regional Policy,  and Women of Russia and their incantation to the effect that if  we adopt the amnesty decree, peace will reign in the country, is  at the least very naive and simply foolish. And it is surprising  that such a shrewd politician as Shakhray does not understand  this. It is most likely that he understands full well that it is  extraordinarily important for him currently to score points  before the presidential elections, but he has in this case lost  considerable popularity. The amnesty decree testifies also that  the pro-government grouping in parliament has strengthened. From  a number of indirect indications it may be said with a great  deal of confidence that Chernomyrdin's department was involved  in the adoption of this decree. The president had to have  noticed this, I believe.    The ministers, except for the members of Russia's Choice,  voted for the amnesty, as did the officials connected with the  government. There is also indirect evidence that the document  was looked over by the government's legal services. That is, the  government has thrown the president, we may say, an open  challenge. Whether he will take up the challenge or not it is  hard to say, although the statements he made, all too late, it  is true, testify that he has a very clear idea of the disastrous  nature of the decision. It essentially takes us back to a state  of, at best, uncertainty, at worst, the eve of civil war.    The act of amnesty showed very clearly that the State Duma  is, in effect, a second version of the Supreme Soviet, and this  is making the world community very leery. For the act of amnesty  is out-and-out antidemocratic.    It is frightening to imagine what would happen had the State  Duma retained the functions that had been assigned the Supreme  Soviet.    Now concerning the president's report. It contains a great  deal that requires analysis. Certain things connected with a  strengthening of the role of the state, for example, are  incomprehensible to me. It is clear, of course, that in such  spheres as the fight against crime and the problem of military  security and security in general the role of the state should be  increased. But when it is a question, say, of an increase in the  role of the state in the economy and when the putative  manifestation of this role is not deciphered, we could encounter  exclusively administrative methods. In his report the president  attempted to cover all aspects of life, but to be honest I did  not see in the document an aspiration to achieve decisive  changes, primarily in the sphere of the economy. And we have  just two paths--either a return to the old, command methods or  new steps forward, toward the market economy. Which one we  choose will be shown by the prime minister's report. And we may  then draw a conclusion as to what was, in fact, implied in the  president's report.    The fact that the opposition was quite well disposed toward  the report puts us on our guard also. It is entirely to its  liking. I by no means proceed from the principle that since this  suits the enemy, it should not, consequently, suit us. Not at  all. I have given the reasons why the report does not suit me or  why, at least, it requires some additional clarification. In  short, I personally can draw a final conclusion concerning the  report only after the president's response to the government's  program.  <H3>  Andrey Nuykin, Deputy of the State Duma (Russia's Choice):  From Zhirinovskiy's `Falcons' to Shakhray's `Falconets' </H3>   I have an ambivalent attitude toward the Duma's amnesty  decree.    First, the pompous statements it contains about "national  reconciliation, peace, and harmony" are utterly hypocritical.  You do not have to be a Seneca to understand that political  intriguers, putschists, street toughs, firebrands, killers, and  looters, set at liberty and absolved of responsibility for  bloody crimes, will enthusiastically join in the struggle for  the seizure of power, resorting to provocations, terror, mass  unrest, and destabilization in all walks of life. The formation  of a broad coalition of political forces--from Zhirinovskiy's  "falcons" to Shakhray's "falconets"--which was revealed in the  course of the preparation and adoption of the decree and which  has been bolstered by the appearance in the dirty political  kitchen of proven top-level intriguers and speculators with  Malinovskiy-like dreams of "civil peace" will find few friends.    Second, both the insipid response of the president to a  situation that once again reeks strongly of civil war and the  submissiveness with which our leaders of justice and law and  order revealed a readiness to agree with the incompetent and  criminal action of the State Duma are extremely surprising and  disheartening. Amnesty is not practiced in respect to specific  persons and crimes. It presupposes merely articles of the  Criminal Code and nonindividualized categories of crimes  (pregnant women, minors, and so forth). The Duma has in practice  assumed the function of granting a pardon (prior to the judicial  ascertainment of guilt, what is more). And a pardon, according  to the Constitution, may be granted only by the president. A.M.  Yakovlev, representative of the president in the Duma, together  with our esteemed Prosecutor General A. Kazannik, should have  known about such elementary legal "niceties."    Third, the Duma has shown itself completely by this action  to  be a socially dangerous force bent on the incitement of civil  war. Its basis is composed once again, alas, not of legislator  professionals but irresponsible political intriguers concerned  with struggle for their personal careers and party or clan  interests. The small group of consistent democrats will hardly  be in a position to neutralize their socially dangerous  activity. At the first constitutional possibility this Duma must  be dissolved. Otherwise we will once again have to get out of  political crises with the help of tanks, Alphas, and other  unconstitutional mechanisms.  <H3>  Viktor Sheynis, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko'  faction): Both a Thief and a Terrorist Are Equal? </H3>   The amnesty decree is one of the most important decisions  adopted by parliament since it started business. But it is  fraught with serious complications and dangers. The "Yabloko"  faction, of which I am a member, decided when preliminarily  discussing this question that it could not support this decree,  and not one member of our faction voted for it. We are for  national reconciliation and a policy of compromise, of course.  But it should be pursued between those who can, are capable of,  and are prepared to agree to compromise. This is an essential  condition, which in this case was not observed.    It is significant that the speech of the leader of the  Communist faction during discussion of this matter was of a  clearly expressed peremptory nature. He interpreted national  reconciliation as a form, virtually, of capitulation before the  onslaught of quite aggressive forces close to the participants  in those events.    The mere principle of the unification of heterogeneous  documents and heterogeneous groups of convicted persons in a  single "package" evokes objections. Essentially, the decision  was adopted in respect to three different groups of convicts.  First, persons convicted of various criminal offenses, so to  speak. I say "so to speak" because our Criminal Code does not  draw a distinction between criminal offensives proper and crimes  of this political aspect or the other. The point of departure  for the decision was a draft that had been sent by the  president. It was properly drawn up from both the formal and  substantive viewpoints, incidentally. The Legislation Committee  performed certain additional work, excluding from the list of  those amnestied audacious hooligans and persons who had  committed rape. In this form the document was perfectly  satisfactory, and it should have been supported.    The second group is composed of so-called economic crimes  and  persons convicted, in fact, for private entrepreneurial,  commercial, and brokerage activity. Activity that is essentially  now perfectly legal. These people should have been released long  ago, and they are mentioned in the draft.    And, finally, the most contentious section of those  amnestied--the participants in the events of August 1991 and May  and October 1993.    Setting free and dropping the charges against people who  destabilized the political situation evoke misgivings in  themselves.    But there is one further aspect making support for this  document absolutely unacceptable. The part of it that pertained  to political amnesty was compiled in a legally improper manner.  For example, the list of persons to be amnestied was determined  with insufficient precision. And there is for me a very  considerable difference between, say, the political leaders who  called from the White House balcony for an assault on Ostankino,  city hall, and the Kremlin and the combatants. The call was  undoubtedly criminal. But, nonetheless, an appeal in itself is a  crime of one nature, and the organization of the gangs of toughs  who carried out the attack on Ostankino and city hall and who  were prepared to seize a number of official institutions is a  crime of an entirely different sort. I refer to such ringleaders  of the armed gangs as Messrs Anpilov, Barkashov, Terekhov, and  certain others. In respect to these people the amnesty is, in my  view, extremely dangerous. For these people will hardly be  capable of appreciating the humanity of the action that was  taken. They will, most likely, continue what they were doing in  the days leading up to the event.    Under these conditions we were put in a very difficult  position. I could not support this political amnesty decision in  the form in which it was presented, but nor could I vote against  the president's amnesty draft or, most important, against the  release of the people accused of economic crimes. It seems to me  that the president's position on this matter is distinguished by  somewhat of an uncertain and improper approach. He should have  anticipated that in sending the bill to the Duma, other groups  of people would obviously have been mixed in with his draft, and  he should have responded to this not when the Duma had already  adopted a decision.    The most deplorable aspect in this event, perhaps, was the  disconnection of the democratic forces in parliament and the  role which the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction  headed by Sergey Shakhray performed in the organization of this  "package." I find totally unconvincing the belated explanations  disseminated the next day by K. Zatulin, a leader of this  faction. The problem of the unity of the democratic forces on  matters of principle remains extraordinarily pertinent. For  unless we find understanding among ourselves, at the 1966  presidential elections (or, God forbid, sooner) we will find  ourselves in a situation similar to that in which the Germans  found themselves at the 1932 presidential elections, choosing  between Hindenburg and Hitler.  <H3>  Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko':  Yeltsin Could Have Determined Events </H3>   Four documents were put to the vote in the Duma in a single  package. It was against this that I, on behalf of our faction,  spoke from the Duma rostrum. We can only agree with the call for  civil reconciliation, but it is very important to ascertain: Who  is reconciling with whom. Reconciliation between, say, nouveaux  riches or embezzlers of state funds, who have plundered public  money, and the humiliated and the insulted, who have been  brought to the brink of destitution?    It can only be a question, of course, of reconciliation  between the opposition and the president. But watching the  release of Anpilov and Makashov, it does not seem that these  people, who have blood on their hands, aspire to such  reconciliation.    We are opposed to the release of people who besmirched  themselves by criminal offenses during the tragic days at the  start of last October. Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself declared that  some have fled to neighboring republics, fearing criminal  prosecution.    In addition, there are no grounds for terminating the  investigation of the events of September-October 1993, which has  been sought also by such irreproachable public figures as  Mikhail Gefter. This is why our faction did not support this  package of documents and preferred either to vote against it or  to abstain.    I would like to add that not only is it unlikely that  reconciliation, about which the general document speaks, will be  achieved, the political struggle will merely intensify. The  prospect of the tranquil cohabitation of the presidency and the  legislature does not emerge, unfortunately.    Several months ago, participating in the work of the  so-called Krasavchenko group formed by the leader of the Office  of the President, I proposed that the president himself release  the political prisoners through an edict of his. The suggestion  was rejected by my colleagues. A situation where this act has  been accomplished by the Duma, not the president, has come  about. Had this been done by the president, he would today be  determining the development of the situation.    At the same time accord could be achieved, although there is  little chance of this, if parliament occupies its proper place  and if there are no petty impediments in the way of its  functioning like, for example, the unresolved problem of the  location of the Duma. Ultimately it was the presidential  structures that drew up the new Constitution, and did they not  write that an act of amnesty was the prerogative of parliament?    Nonetheless, I hope for the president's cooperation, as  before. It is important that they not throw up obstacles to one  another inasmuch as their new antagonism would have a baneful  effect on the state of society. [passage omitted]  <H3>  Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma (Communist Party  of Russia): Very Timely Decree </H3>   The decree had a very difficult birth, but I consider its  adoption exceptionally opportune for a number of reasons.    The events of August 1991 and May and September-October 1993  were of a clearly expressed political nature. These events were  primarily a consequence of the destructive and splittist policy  that had been pursued by the national leadership in the person  of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. If this ball unravels any more, there  will be no end to it.    There has been a mass stoppage of production, unemployment  has in a number of places amounted to almost 30 percent, half  the population is not being paid on time, merely 20 percent of  the peasantry is ready for the sowing on account of the  nonpayments to the peasants for the grain they have surrendered,  and the mass strike movement of the miners, students, and  lecturers is growing. It would seem to me that under these  conditions the State Duma has taken the first step toward  national reconciliation, without which we will not accomplish a  single task.    It seemed to me that the radical democrats, who are  responsible for the policy of devastation of the country that  has been pursued in recent years, the civil wars throughout the  south of Russia, and the events that occurred in October in  Russia, should have been satisfied with this decision the most.    The president avoided a direct evaluation of it in his  report. But Yeltsin's aides subjected the Duma's decision simply  to outright ostracism. And as far as certain journalists are  concerned, one has the impression that peace and harmony in  Russia are absolutely not what they want. If they do not realize  that this is for everyone the last peaceful way out of the  situation, they will bring down on their heads troubles for  which neither the country nor their nearest and dearest will  forgive them.    We have issued the appropriate statement: Hysteria is being  deliberately incited and a provocation prepared in order to  frustrate the first steps toward reconciliation. I am sure that  both other factions and the leadership of the Duma will respond.  The laws the Duma adopts cannot be treated this way.    Concerning the president's report. It seems to me that those  who prepared it and the president himself were out of the  country for three years. Then they suddenly saw that Russia  needs strong statehood, that crime is raging, that science and  culture are in a dire state, that corruption has conquered all,  and that the bureaucracy has grown incredibly.    Yeltsin's report might have been deemed satisfactory had it  been heard in February-March 1991. There would not then have  been the collapse of the USSR, there would have been no  Belovezha pact, there would have been no tragedy in the Caucasus  even, there would have been no universal impoverishment.    On the other hand, the report was delivered in a tone  (tough-confrontational) which was untraditional for Yeltsin. It  contains a recognition that he also is responsible for what has  been done and that continuing the course of shock therapy to the  point of total shock is impossible--the total destabilization of  the situation would ensue. Thank God that this, at least, was  heard. But any declaration needs to be bolstered by a specific  program. [passage omitted]</p>

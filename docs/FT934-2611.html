			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Probe may change life insurance tax affairs The UK life insurance industry may be forced to change the way it handles its tax affairs following a probe into the affairs of one of the largest companies in the sector. Allied Dunbar, a subsidiary of BAT, confirmed yesterday that it was to present up to 20 separate reports to the Inland Revenue's Inquiry Branch at the end of January on a range of internal tax matters. Since the Revenue approached it at the start of the year, the company has used six tax experts from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick on the investigation. Mr Bob Gill, corporate affairs director, said one of the central topics covered is the treatment of 'soft commissions', the in-kind payments of equipment and other goods made by stockbrokers and marketmakers in exchange for business. A second is the way its 400 branch managers report tax on their share of the commissions paid to their sales teams, which can be up to 20 per cent of the value. Inquiry Branch normally examines serious cases of alleged fraud or manipulation, but Mr Gill said this probe was on 'technical' matters. He said Allied Dunbar had resolved with Revenue officials over the summer a separate discussion on the way interest-free loans paid to its 4,500 sales staff during times of low commission, and this did not form part of the current investigation.</p>

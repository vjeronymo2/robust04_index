			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Europe boosts Burmah - The Week Ahead The gathering recovery in continental Europe should benefit Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, which is expected on Monday to report a double-digit increase in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 90.5m to more than Pounds 100m. The lubricants business is doing well in the US and Asia and the upturn in the German market will at last benefit the metallurgical businesses of Foseco, which was bought at the end of 1990. Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, is expected on Tuesday to announce profits for the half-year to June broadly similar to last year's Pounds 102.6m. Consensus forecasts are just over Pounds 100m, with a range of Pounds 99m to Pounds 105m. Last year's figure, however, was boosted by an exceptional gain on disposals of Pounds 7.9m, so underlying profits growth is expected to be about 8 per cent. While good performances are likely to be reported from some overseas operations, especially in Australia and the Specialty Coatings International business in the US, many businesses have experienced margin pressures in the first half. Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer, is likely to report on Wednesday a moderate increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 63m to about Pounds 65m. With trading conditions remaining difficult, the most positive news will come on the financial side. No dividend increase is expected this time but management comments at the AGM raised shareholder hopes of a year-end rise. RTZ, the minerals group, is expected to report on Wednesday a steep rise in profits for the first half of 1994, from Pounds 186m to about Pounds 210m-Pounds 215m on the back of higher base metals prices. Analysts are anticipating Cookson, the speciality chemicals and metals group, to report on Thursday a rise in interim underlying profits from Pounds 37m to about Pounds 50m. But the pre-tax figure will be hit by about Pounds 50m of exceptional losses, relating mostly to March's disposal of Calder, the engineering business. BTR, the industrial conglomerate, will provide one of the most important indicators of the capital goods sector when it reports interim results on Thursday. Analysts are expecting a double-digit increase in normalised pre-tax profits to about Pounds 660m-Pounds 670m, and a 10 per cent rise in the dividend. Most attention will focus on the group's margins, following concern that manufacturers will find it difficult to pass on the rising cost of raw materials to their customers. Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group is expected to report interim profits up from Pounds 1.67bn to between Pounds 1.88bn and Pounds 1.9bn on Thursday following increased volume sales of Zantac, its best-selling anti-ulcer drug, and buoyant demand for its respiratory products. The figures, however, could be hit by the group taking some of July's Pounds 100m bond losses against first half profits. Analysts are also watching its dividend policy closely for any signs of concern over patent infringement cases in North America. If, as expected, the dividend is increased sharply to around 27p (22p), that would reflect some confidence of the likely outcome. A maintained dividend could leave the group open to accusations of expecting the worst. British Gas will report its half-year results on Thursday. Second-quarter results usually show a loss due to a seasonal downturn in demand, and analysts are expecting a net loss of Pounds 15m-Pounds 47m. Some analysts believe British Gas may use the occasion to elaborate on its future dividend policy. Earlier this year, the company warned that regulatory uncertainty was threatening its ability to maintain dividend growth. Most analysts expect that the 6.4p dividend will be maintained. Cadbury Schweppes is expected on Thursday to report some of the best interim results among UK food manufacturers with pre-tax profits up by about Pounds 40m to around Pounds 200m. The level of recovery in profits expected from Sun Alliance, the composite insurance group, on Thursday has produced a wide range of forecasts among analysts. These start at Pounds 140m and rise to Pounds 215m, against Pounds 61.7m. The shares have been among the worst performers among its peers and there is a growing view among some market watchers that the bad news is in the price. Interim pre-tax profits from Blue Circle on Thursday are expected to fall in the range of Pounds 80m-Pounds 95m, against Pounds 60.5m. Attention is likely to focus on the performances of both the UK cement market and the home products division. Both are expected to show a good recovery, but the level of the rally and the accompanying outlook from the company will be watched with keen interest. The dividend is expected to be pegged at 3.75p.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following items on problems  pertaining to privatization in the Republic of Croatia are drawn  from periodicals published in that republic.  <H5>  Irregularities in Forest Enterprise Alleged </H5>   A report on the Hrvatske Sume [Croatian Forests] public  enterprise has been removed several times from the Croatian  Assembly's daily agenda at the last moment, a fact that leads  the Zagreb weekly DANAS to be suspicious about the business  operations of the enterprise. In its 29 March issue discussing  an unspecified Assembly debate on the enterprise, the weekly  observes that: "What happened surprised many--Minister of  Agriculture and Forestry Ivan Tarnaj tendered his resignation,  while the prime minister dramatically came to his defense,  refusing to accept the resignation. Although there were rumors  that big shots were involved, the resolution of the situation in  the enterprise was not completed. The government alloted two  additional months for restructuring the management board of the  Hrvatske Sume enterprise and investigating once more all the  charges against this enterprise."    Reports on the investigations carried out by various  Assembly  commissions and state institutions, such as the Finance Police,  cite several questionable areas in the business operations of  the enterprise, according to DANAS. The Croatian Government  admitted an operating loss of 576,000 German marks [DM], which  was most often described by Assembly delegates as a "crime,"  DANAS states, adding that Vera Stanic, a member of the Assembly  commission investigating the work of the Hrvatske Sume  enterprise, enumerated specific irregularities, such as illegal  foreign currency transactions, violation of a government  decision limiting the production of certain wood products, and  financial misconduct to the detriment of the enterprise and the  state through misrepresentation of income, preferential  treatment of private enterprises, and unauthorized felling,  trade in, and export of wood. Stanic said that the enterprise's  greatest problem is its management and demanded that Minister  Tarnaj also be held accountable. Tarnaj defended the work of  Hrvatske Sume, saying that the manner of privatization of the  forestry sector was at the root of the controversy because "some  individuals are trying to keep the best parts for themselves and  leave those that are not good to the state."    In an interview published in the Split daily SLOBODNA  DALMACIJA on 28 March, Stanic charged Hrvatske Sume's "top  management" with the "theft" of Croatia's forests. "This is a  real catastrophe," she said, "the impermissible devastation of  the greatest of Croatian resources." Stanic named individuals in  Hrvatske Sume's management who had been indicted by the Public  Prosecutor's Office. She also discussed a report issued by the  Finance Police on irregularities in Hrvatske Sume's operations,  in particular the enterprise's exporting of wood at  "incomprehensibly" low prices without the authorization of the  Ministry of Trade.  <H5>  Jailed Businessman Threatens To Tell `Truth' on Privatization </H5>   Sinisa Caktas, a Split businessman who has attempted to buy  "almost all the best Dalmatian enterprises" with millions of  German marks of "mysterious" origin, is staging a hunger strike  during pretrial confinement because he has not received replies  to protest letters he had sent to Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, several ministers, and  President of the Croatian Privatization Fund Ivan Penic, says  the 8 April Zagreb weekly GLOBUS.    According to GLOBUS, Canic says that he will keep quiet  until  his trial and then reveal the "truth" about privatization in  Croatia. The weekly reports that Caktas is in pretrial detention  with his associates Ivo Cecuk and Feri Toth on suspicion of  having "misused a position of authority and falsified official  documents in the ownership transformation procedure of the Split  Mljekara [Dairy] enterprise." Caktas, on the other hand, accuses  the Croatian Privatization Fund of selling him the Mljekara  enterprise but not permitting him to register it in his own  name. He claims that he concluded a contract with the Croatian  Privatization Fund for the purchase of 50 percent of Mljekara's  shares and is seeking a refund of the 4.5 million German marks  he says he paid the fund, plus "large" compensatory damages.  GLOBUS notes that the conflict over the dairy enterprise has  been going on since September 1993.  <H5>  Shares of Fishing Company Transferred to Privatization Fund </H5>   By a decision of the management board of the Croatian  Privatization Fund [HFP], 46 percent of the shares of the  Jadran-Ribolov fishing enterprise, in the amount of DM8,700,000,  are being transferred to HFP ownership, reports the 11 April  edition of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. The daily notes that the HFP  decision, issued to Jadran-Ribolov the previous day, states that  not a single one of this block of shares had attracted a buyer  when they were offered to the public. According to the general  director of Jadran-Ribolov, SLOBODNA DALMAJICA says, a founding  meeting of the shareholders' society will be held within the  next 10 days. "Small shareholders" hold a total of 43 percent of  Jadran-Ribolov stock, and the Split Bank owns the remaining 11  percent.  <H5>  Emigres' Investments in Weapons Factory `Disappear' </H5>   The 1 April issue of GLOBUS alleges that 400,000 Swiss  francs  invested by Croatian emigres in the "first Croatian weapons  factory" have disappeared. The paper asks: "Was the founding of  the TOVO shareholding company intended to be the beginning of  the construction of the first Croatian weapons and military  equipment factory, or was it just a trick to rob Croatian  emigres of thousands of francs?" According to GLOBUS, brochures  appeared in Switzerland in 1992 urging Croat emigres to become  co-owners in TOVO of Zagreb, the first shareholding company "for  the needs of Croats." Emigres who paid for shares of stock in  the company have never seen their actual shares and have never  received any dividends. All they have are receipts for their  payments, says GLOBUS, adding that the TOVO enterprise does not  exist, "at least not at the addresses and telephone numbers  published in patriotic brochures." GLOBUS lists the names of  TOVO's founders, identifying them as members of the Croatian  Democratic Community [HDZ], the party of Franjo Tudjman. "The  only success the enterprise has had," GLOBUS states, was the  "publication of several issues of MAGNUM magazine," which listed  Branimir Glavas, soldier and politician from Osijek, as a member  of its editorial staff and several weapons specialists from the  Croatian Army's General Staff as permanent assistants.</p>

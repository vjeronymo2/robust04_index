			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Media Reimbursements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9004.6 contains rules governing expenditures for transportation and other services provided to media and Secret Service personnel by presidential campaign committees receiving public financing for the general election. Section 9034.6 is a parallel provision governing primary committees that receive public funds from the matching payment account. These provisions indicate that expenditures for these purposes will, in most cases, be regarded as qualified campaign expenses subject to the overall limitations of sections 9003.2 and 9035.1, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 also allow committees to accept limited reimbursement for these expenses from the media, and deduct any reimbursements received from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation. These rules set limits on the amount of reimbursement that a committee can accept, and require committees to repay a portion of any reimbursement that exceeds those limits to the Treasury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules seek to clarify the application of sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 by reorganizing them without any substantive change. Under the proposed revisions, paragraphs (a) and (b) have been broken into smaller subparagraphs. Paragraph (c) has been renumbered as paragraph (e). Paragraph (d) has been renumbered as paragraph (c) and broken into smaller paragraphs, and new paragraph (d) has been inserted in order to clarify the interplay between two aspects of the existing rules: The requirement that the committee return to the media representative that portion of any reimbursement received that exceeds the actual cost of the transportation and services provided by more than 10%, and the requirement that the committee repay to the Treasury any part of the reimbursements it receives that exceeds the actual and administrative costs incurred by the committee. The Commission welcomes comments on the proposed revisions to sections 9004.6 and 9034.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Travel Expenditures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission seeks comments on modifying 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7 to address several issues regarding the cost of campaign-related travel using government airplanes, helicopters and other vehicles. The current rules contemplate that for plane flights between cities served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the campaign must reimburse the appropriate governmental entity for the first class airfare, and that this amount is treated as a qualified campaign expense. New language in section 9004.7(b)(5)(i) and section 9034.7(b)(5)(i) would specify that, for travel by airplane, the amount of the lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class commercial airfare available for the time traveled is to be used. Discounted fares that are subject to restrictions on the dates and times of travel, or restrictions on changing flights, are not comparable to the service provided when the campaign uses a government conveyance. Campaign committees are responsible for determining these amounts at the time of the flight to ensure that the right amount is paid to the appropriate government entity, and would need to maintain documentation supporting these amounts. The lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class airfare is available from several sources including travel agents and the Official Airline Guide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions have also arisen regarding cities that are served by regular air service, but first class flights are not available. In this case, the Commission proposes specifying that committees should use the lowest unrestricted non-discounted coach fare available for the time traveled. This approach is consistent with the valuation method established by the Select Committee on Ethics of the United States Senate for the use of private aircraft. See Interpretive Ruling No. 412, Select Committee on Ethics, United States Senate, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., S. Prt. 101&hyph;18 at 251&hyph;52 (1989). It is also consistent with the valuation methods used by the House of Representatives' Committee on Standards of Official Conduct with respect to gifts of private transportation not associated with official travel. See, Valuation of Gifts of Transportation on Private Aircraft, Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, Letter dated June 11, 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For cities not served by regularly scheduled commercial service, the current rules specify that the amount to be reimbursed is the charter rate. The proposed revisions would clarify that the charter rate used should be for a comparable airplane of similar make, model and size. This provision would also be consistent with the approaches used by the Congressional Committees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

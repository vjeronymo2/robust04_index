Shot in various Iraqi towns, the first in four episodes  focused on complaints by Iraqis about the effects of the  sanctions on their daily lives and comments by Iraqi officials.    Several of those interviewed said they could not understand  why the embargo was being maintained "after Kuwait was returned  to the Kuwaitis" and called for the Arab states to support  Baghdad's position to have the sanctions lifted.    The UN embargo was imposed days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on  August 2, 1990.    Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih also told the  program that his country opposed a UN resolution allowing for  the sale of limited quantities of oil under United Nations  control.    Iraq says the restrictions for the sale harm its  sovereignty.    Besides Oman, which has always maintained normal relations  with Iraq, Qatar is the only GCC country to have restored links  with Baghdad after it participated in the U.S.-led coalition  that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991.    The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab  Emirates and Bahrain.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Campari stirred as the dynasty adds a dash of Dutch - BolsWessanen is the first outsider to take a stake in the Italian drinks company A measure of Campari, a shot of artichoke-based Cynar, a few bottles of the non-alcoholic aperitif Crodino, a magnum of Riccadonna sparkling wine, and a bucketful of assorted mineral waters, vermouths and grappa. As a cocktail, it sounds unpalatable, but as a business deal the drinks' producers Davide Campari-Milano and Bols-Wessanen hope it will prove to be surprisingly drinkable. Campari, privately owned since its foundation in 1860, and BolsWessanen, the Amsterdam-quoted food and drink company, agreed last month on a delicately-balanced strategic alliance. The deal, which should be completed around the end of the year if approved by the Italian anti-trust authorities, involves the transfer of Bols-Wessanen's Italian drinks business to Campari. In exchange, the Dutch group will receive a stake of around 33 per cent in Campari. If this is an interesting move for BolsWessanen, it is akin to an earthquake for Davide Campari-Milano. It will be the first time investors unconnected to the original Campari dynasty have held shares in the company and the first substantial diversification beyond the company's trio of Campari-based products, bitters, soda and cordial. Adding the BolsWessanen brands and production facilities in Italy will nearly double Campari's annual turnover, which was L401bn (Dollars 257.7m) in 1993. In 1994, core Campari sales should generate L430bn, but income from the former BolsWessanen operations will add a further L354bn. In the past Davide Campari-Milano has turned down other international suitors, but Mr Marco Perelli-Cippo, managing director, says the fear of allowing Campari shares to fall into the hands of outsiders 'has been analysed and overcome'. 'We are more afraid of the dimensions of the acquisition,' he explains, adding that it will take about a year to digest the old BolsWessanen activities. 'Frankly I would have preferred to carry out a slightly smaller purchase at first and then pass to a larger acquisition,' he says. But the deal fits into the strategy Mr Perelli-Cippo outlined for Campari this year. Campari says volume and turnover of its products are still rising, but analysts claim volume has begun to flatten in recent years as the aperitif market has come under pressure. In April, Mr Perelli-Cippo spoke of the need to add new products to the limited Campari range and use Campari's international distribution and marketing network, which annually spends the equivalent of 10 per cent of turnover on publicity, to promote them. Both BolsWessanen and Campari have carefully talked about the mutual benefits of strategic alliance, but for the respective domestic audiences a little judicious spin has been applied to the implications of the deal. This suggests there may well be tough negotiations about how to develop the alliance's international activities. In the Netherlands, Bols-Wessanen, advised by Lazards, has underlined the synergy between the two companies' Italian operations, the prospects for 'international co-operation' and the importance of acquiring a significant stake in Campari. In Italy, Campari - advised by the specialist investment bank Colker Gelardin - has successfully peddled the line that the accord will return some proud Italian brands to Italian ownership, rather than deliver the company into the hands of the Dutch. Indeed, Campari is adamant that BolsWessanen will be unable to increase its stake in the Italian company unilaterally. Mr Perelli-Cippo briskly dismisses the suggestion the Dutch presence on the share register and in the boardroom might compromise Campari's tradition of independence. The Dutch company will have three out of 11 seats on the board, he says. This will allow BolsWessanen to take part in 'general strategic decisions' which affect the value of their investment, but not in decisions on everyday operations or choice of management. Although the exact structure of the Campari share register after the deal has not been clarified, it seems the family of the late Mr Domenico Garavoglia - one of two Campari managers to whom the company was left by the last of the Campari dynasty in the 1980s - will retain majority control of the group. BolsWessanen is likely to acquire most of its stake, said to be worth about L500bn-L600bn, from the minority Rossi family. As Mr Perelli-Cippo puts it: 'The majority shareholder had already developed the ability to handle a minority shareholder: now it's simply a question of handling a minority shareholder who speaks Italian less well.' Whether this is a comfortable arrangement for both parties will depend partly on what happens in the continuing negotiations about the alliance's international potential, the part which most interests BolsWessanen. 'Bols drives a very hard bargain,' says Mr Leon Stelmach of Canadean, specialists in marketing and information for the beverage industry. 'I can't imagine that Campari has such a wonderful deal.' The Dutch company has said it expected a higher profit contribution from Italy in 1996, once its activities were integrated with those of Campari. But a spokesman adds: 'We don't just have a share in Davide Campari in Italy, we have a sizeable share in Davide Campari worldwide. That's where we would have an influence.' Outside Italy, the companies have duplicate production facilities in certain countries. For example, even after the deal has been concluded, production of the Cynar aperitif in Switzerland and Brazil will remain under Dutch control, while production of Campari in the same countries will belong to the Italians. Detailed discussions will concentrate on the interpretation of existing international licensing, marketing and distribution agreements. But in the longer term, BolsWessanen will try to use its boardroom influence to exploit the agreement's international potential. As for Campari, it is not expected to wait another 134 years before making its next strategic move. It may even seek a stock exchange listing, but only if it needs to raise capital. For the time being, however, Mr Perelli-Cippo is content to concentrate on the latest challenge. 'After all, if you put too many steaks on the grill, they'll all end up burnt,' he says.</p>

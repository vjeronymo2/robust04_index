			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Supermarket fire risks cause increasing concern to insurers The risk of fire in larger supermarkets is causing increasing concern among insurers and safety experts following a spate of losses in recent months. The lack of compartment walls, which would halt the spread of fire, and the absence of sprinkler systems and roof venting in many stores have been singled out as potential hazards. The risks were highlighted at a conference this week organised by the Fire Protection Association, a body linked to the insurance industry. Recent losses include a supermarket fire in Hull in June, which caused Pounds 10m property damage, and a blaze at a superstore in Chichester last December, where damage amounted to Pounds 11m. The association reports nine total losses over the last two years. Mr Stewart Kidd, a director of the association, said recent incidents showed stores to be at 'considerable risk from fire, no matter how it is caused'. Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'It is a real worry. Fires can spread very quickly from one corner to the whole building.' The association has been in touch with the Home Office and is pressing for tougher regulations, including compulsory installation of sprinklers. 'The cost of installing sprinklers in large retail outlets is the same as that of laying carpet,' Mr Kidd added. Retailers insisted yesterday that fears were overplayed. 'We are constantly being attacked on grounds of fire safety. It is an assertion which is not borne out by the facts,' said Mr Mark Bradshaw, assistant director of the British Retail Consortium, which represents about 90 per cent of the retail industry. Mr Bradshaw said supermarket owners fully complied with the statutory framework and that criticisms exaggerated the effectiveness of sprinkler systems. 'The basic concept that fire sprinklers are an all-round solution to our problems is absolutely wrong,' he said. In a false alarm, sprinklers could damage stock and building structures. Instead, supermarket operators and other retailers placed more emphasis on evacuation procedures, so that employees and customers could escape quickly. He added: 'The assertion that sub-standard buildings are being constructed is absolutely absurd. You have to pass very stringent building controls which are tightly enforced by local and fire authorities.'</p>

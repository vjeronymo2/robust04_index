			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / And the eldest takes all / A look at the debate over primogeniture Not since the days of King Herod has it been so rough for firstborn sons. Last week, the Marquess of Blandford decided to fight the court action of his father, the Duke of Marlborough, who is effectively trying to disinherit him; more than 30 peers have supported a bill to allow hereditary peerages to pass to the eldest child, regardless of gender; and increasingly, the landed gentry are giving their children equal slices of the inheritance cake. It is remarkable that the seemingly anachronistic concept of primogeniture - whereby the eldest son inherits all - exists at all in a world of positive discrimination and Nintendo. In the words of Mr Nick Howard, second of the four scions of Castle Howard in Yorkshire: 'It is the last refuge of feudalism.' This Norman law of inheritance lasted until 1925, when land legislation removed the right of the eldest to inherit all from an intestate parent by allowing the widow some chattels for herself. Save for hereditary dignities and titles of honour, primogeniture no longer has legal force. Only hereditary peers list heirs in Who's Who. But primogeniture has remained a custom that aristocrats have observed unquestioningly for almost 1,000 years until this month's action in the High Court. As Mr Lawrence Stone, professor of history at Princeton University in the US, points out, the 'prime preoccupation of a wealthy English landed squire was somehow to contrive to preserve his family inheritance intact and to pass it on to the next generation according to the principle of primogeniture'. While wealthy squires' objectives have not changed, their methods may be about to. If the Duke of Marlborough wins, he will set a precedent that others will find hard to ignore. By demolishing the assumption that the eldest son should take over, he is subjecting the business of succession to commercial reality. The duke wants to prevent his son from automatically inheriting Blenheim Palace and its 11,500 acres. He is so anxious that control of the estate should not fall to the marquess (who is being treated for drug addiction) that he is seeking to overturn the Act of Parliament of 1704 that gave Blenheim to his ancestor, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, in acknowledgement of his victories on the battlefield. He wants a new trust to replace the present settlement. This trust would tightly control the sale of land, heirlooms and building on the estate. Nothing can prevent Jamie Blandford from taking his title, but someone else seems likely to act as duke in all but name. The duke may then have saved Blenheim Palace for posterity. But what will he have done to the system that ensured he, and nobody else, became the 11th duke? The money and land at stake is substantial. Primogeniture helped the British aristocracy remain richer, more illustrious and tightly knit than any other comparable elite. Today, the heir-takes-all tradition still pays dividends: a British farmer's average landholding in 1992 was over 70 hectares, more than five times the EC average. Between them, the 24 non-royal dukes, from Abercorn to Westminster, are worth an estimated Pounds 4.6bn in income and assets - three-quarters of that belonging to the Duke of Westminster. Mr Dominic Hobson, the financial historian, says this compares with a total of Pounds 3.5bn in 1883 (at 1991 prices and only from rental income). By contrast, continental aristocrats have become so common that their prestige is diminished; and the parcelling of land elsewhere in Europe has diminished estates. In France, in particular, the post-revolutionary Code Napoleon - which revised common law - demanded that land be divided equally between children. While this meant that most of the peasant class owned plots of land, farms were small and France was unable to benefit as much as Britain from new farm machinery. But while Britain still has its great estates, many owners are struggling to keep them intact and in the family. Some have failed: between 1880 and 1976, the great estates shrank in size by 76 per cent in England and Wales. Estate duty, followed by capital transfer tax in 1975 and inheritance tax in 1986, have forced the sale of 460 historic houses in the past 20 years. Even when a son inherits cash - the Marquess of Cholmondeley was left Pounds 116m - it does not stop the rot. He was forced last year to sell a Gainsborough and Holbein in lieu of tax on his father's estate. Primogeniture, designed as it is to keep the estates intact, is destined to continue. Lady Ann Somerset, the historian daughter of the Duke of Beaufort, cousin to Blandford, thinks it should and will survive. 'Only really rigid primogeniture - where the eldest gets masses and millions and the others get not a farthing - will be rare,' she says. 'Provided the younger ones aren't cast out into the world, it's fair. Really, the estate can't continue if it's all shared out.' But Mr Nick Howard, of Castle Howard, a second son, predicts that the 'flexible primogeniture' will be the way of the future. 'These large estates are businesses,' he says. 'And not all eldest sons make the best businessmen.'</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Italian-Americans Didn't Laugh: Two Italian-American organizations found little  humor in comic Billy Crystal's Italian joke during the Academy Awards ceremony,  and complained to ABC about it.  </P> <P> Crystal, host for the 62nd annual awards ceremony broadcast on ABC, quipped  that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian businessman meant the famous  lion would no longer roar at the start of the movie but instead plead the Fifth  Amendment. "It was a cheap-shot joke against Italian-Americans," said a release  from the Coalition of Italo-American Organizations. "There is a fine line  between ethnic humor and negative stereotyping. We feel (Crystal) crossed that  line." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> LONG SUMMER FOR NEA  </P> <P> I agree completely with all points specified and stated by Joseph Papp in his  July 2 Counterpunch article ("NEA: Once More Unto the Breach"). Again we are  faced with a "long, hot summer" politically speaking and our lawmakers don't  know what to do with themselves.  </P> <P> Instead of seeking effective legislation (their appointed task!), they are  expending vast amounts of energy on such media-hot issues as abortion,  flag-burning and, of course, censorship.  </P> <P> The recent National Endowment for the Arts debacle is just one more example of  a string of events triggered by the persistent efforts of a small fraction of  our population whose aim is to mold our society in order to fit their  specifications.  </P> <P> The most discouraging thing about all of this is that it seems to be working.  As a young adult, it is very disheartening to witness such a waste of  legislative resources when there are a number of more pressing issues that  demand immediate action. So much for the saying that "youth is a time for  idealism." The reality of the day makes such thoughts impossible.  </P> <P> I believe in our system; but I don't have any faith in the ability of the  average American voter to see past all of the "garbage issues" that pollute  American politics.  </P> <P> DARREN S. DOLLABAUN  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Niamey, April 17 (AFP) -- Police rounded up the  leaders of the three main opposition groups here Sunday [17  April], party officials said, in a crackdown launched the day  after anti-government demonstrations left one dead and 20  injured.    Mamadou Tanja, leader of the National Movement of the  Development Society (MNSD), his counterpart Andre Salifou of the  Union of Progressive Patriots and Democrats (UPDP) and the head  of the Democratic Union of Progressive Forces (UDFP), Issoufou  Assoumane, were arrested at midday (1100 GMT), an MNSD official  told AFP. The party worker said the men were detained by  detectives for questioning after emerging from a meeting at  headquarters of the MNSD -- Niger's former sole party -- but  official sources declined to confirm their arrests.

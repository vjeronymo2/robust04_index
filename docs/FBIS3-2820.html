			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) and Ding </F> Jianming (0002 1017 6900)]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- Joining deputies of the  Zhejiang delegation in deliberating the government work report  today, Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC], pointed out:  As far as the current situation is concerned, China is in the  best period of its modern history. China's domestic situation  is very good. In particular, a good situation of political and  social stability and sustained economic development has emerged  since the publication of the remarks made by Comrade Xiaoping  during his inspection of the south in 1992. The international  situation is also conducive to China's socialist construction.  We should seize the opportunities and work hard together to  develop the economy.    Qiao Shi is a deputy of the Zhejiang delegation. At 0900  [0100 GMT] today, Chairman Qiao Shi arrived at the Labor  Building, where the Zhejiang delegation is staying, to  participate in the joint discussions of the delegation's second  and fourth groups. At the discussion meeting, while focusing on  the government work report, deputies Shen Zulun, Zhang Qimei,  Peng Guozhen, Ding Bingyan, Sun Yongsen, Xu Cangen, and Liu  Minchun, delivered speeches in connection with the struggle  against corruption; the agricultural issue; economic reform; the  relationship among reform, development, and stability;  invigorating the state-owned large and medium enterprises; and  the development of town and village enterprises. A lively  atmosphere prevailed at the meeting. Many deputies from  basic-level units vied with one another to express their  opinions.    While the deputies were delivering their speeches, Chairman  Qiao Shi listened very carefully. Occasionally he interposed.  He said: "Because of my participation in this discussion  meeting, your speeches are fairly blunt and come straight to the  point. This is good." When Deputy Lei Wenxian, head of the  Jingning She Autonomous County -- the sole She autonomous county  in the country -- spoke on how to accelerate the pace of helping  poor areas to free themselves from poverty and become well-off,  Qiao Shi interposed, saying: It is our resolute objective to  free the remaining 80 million people of China who are still poor  from poverty and to become well-off by the end of this century.  To realize this objective, we must have resolve, and adopt  resolute and effective measures. He said: China is a huge  country, where development is uneven. There are  poverty-stricken areas not only in the western but also in  eastern part of the country. The party and government have  always attached importance to this question, but it is not  possible for the state to take over the entire work of helping  poor areas. However, it is necessary to adopt appropriate  preferential policies to help poor areas. The coastal regions  in the east, which are relatively more developed, should work  vigorously to solve their own problem of helping poor areas  become well-off, but they should also do their best to assist  western regions.    When the deputies finished speaking, Chairman Qiao Shi  expressed his opinions in connection with agriculture and  reform. He said: When we say it is necessary to push the  economy forward, we must first advance agricultural development.  Agriculture was the foundation of our national economy; it is  and will remain the foundation. If the foundation is not  strong, it is not possible to develop the entire national  economy successfully. Qiao Shi said: Our reform began in the  countryside; it began with the all-around contract system. It  was on this basis that surplus labor in the countryside could be  diverted to developing town and village enterprises. China's  development is out of the question without the changes that have  taken place in rural areas. Therefore, at no time should we  forget or relax our efforts in agriculture.    Qiao Shi said: In attaching importance to and developing  agriculture -- the foundation of the national economy -- we must  not indulge in empty talk. We must have down-to-earth measures.  To permanently preserve the enthusiasm of the peasants, we must  not be satisfied with our development level of the past. We  should continue to develop agriculture in depth and in breadth,  develop diversified undertakings in all sectors of the rural  economy, and develop farming operations on a massive scale that  stress high yields, high quality, and high efficiency. At the  same time, town and village enterprises should continue to  upgrade the quality of their products. Qiao Shi stressed:  Secondary and tertiary industries have expanded rapidly in  recent years, but their growth has been closely related with  agriculture. We must not assume that there are no more  agricultural problems because we have reaped bumper harvests for  many consecutive years and because the vegetable supply has not  posed any big problem. We should always closely link secondary  and tertiary industries with agriculture. Only thus can we  build socialism with Chinese characteristics better.    Concerning reform of the economic structure, Qiao Shi said:  Reform is an unprecedented undertaking. The process of reform  is one in which explorations are made, and it is not at all  strange that some problems will be encountered. Of course, we  should constantly sum up our experiences and strive for gradual  improvement. We should undertake reform after drawing up a  comprehensive plan and making all-around considerations. Of  course this is good, but in practice this is not possible and  does not conform to the law governing the process of knowing  things. He urged the deputies to make proposals and offer their  opinions to help the central authorities make policy decisions  in a more scientific way, to constantly improve reform measures,  and to ensure the smooth progress of reform. Qiao Shi said:  Reform will inevitably result in the readjustment of the  relationship among all sectors, and this requires all to  increase their understanding of and support for the formulated  reform measures. He said: We have the resolve and confidence  to advance our reform to successfully build a socialist market  economic structure at an early date.    In response to some deputies' suggestions that it is  necessary to overcome formalism, Qiao Shi said: Overcoming  bureaucratism and formalism has always been a principle of our  party. Currently, formalism is quite serious in some areas.  The reasons are varied. There is formalism in leading cadres,  in localities, and in departments. Therefore, joint efforts  from all quarters are required to overcome formalism.    After attending the meeting of the Zhejiang delegation, Qiao  Shi called on some deputies of the Anhui and Hubei delegations  at the Labor Building.</p>

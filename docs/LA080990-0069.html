			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SAX PIONEER SAYS HE'S THE RODNEY  DANGERFIELD OF JAZZ  </P> <P> Today's light jazz prodigies, who rely heavily on electronics, owe a lot to  Eddie Harris, who first plugged in his saxophone in 1965. On "The Tender Storm"  album, released the next year, he turned in a pioneering electric performance  that pleased even straight-ahead jazz critics. Harris, who opened five nights  at Elario's on Wednesday with his quintet, has recorded more than 70 albums.  Yet today he doesn't get much press and doesn't have a U.S. recording deal. The  lack of interest, after all the successes, clearly hurts, although he keeps a  sense of humor.  </P> <P> "In the U.S., you're only great if you're in your 20s or 60s," joked Harris,  53, noting that old jazz legends or hot young superstars get the most  attention. "I started with electric sax in '65, but very few people connect me  with what they call fusion, I guess because I'm still living."  </P> <P> Harris compared his career to that of baseball great Ernie Banks, who never  received his due because he played for the Chicago Cubs during some losing  years.  </P> <P> "Sometimes guys can sit on the bench on popular teams and get more notoriety  than a guy who's playing well on a team in last place," he said, referring to  lesser musicians who become well known through associations with commercially  successful acts. Is Harris the Ernie Banks of jazz?  </P> <P> "Worse than that. I'm the Rodney Dangerfield. I don't get no respect. Come by  and see the Rodney Dangerfield of jazz."  </P> <P> Those here who do come by to see Harris, who plays many instruments, will see  him concentrate on tenor sax.  </P> <P> Harris also has three albums on the way, all made overseas. They are a Japanese  session including pianist Kenny Barron, an English recording including former  San Diegan Rob Schneiderman on piano, and a trio album recorded in Holland.  </P> <P> After settling a two-year legal battle with her record company, singer Diane  Schuur is ready to get back to music full time.  </P> <P> Schuur, who plays at Humphrey's on Friday night at 6 and 8:30, hopes to finish  a new album later this year, her first since 1988's "Talkin' 'Bout You." The  contractual dispute with GRP Records Inc. had delayed recording plans. In a  phone interview from her home outside Seattle, Schuur was reluctant to give  details of the conflict, other than to say it focused on both money and what  she felt was inadequate promotional support.  </P> <P> But she brightened measurably when discussing her personal life and music.  Those who caught her performance at Humphrey's last year saw a drastically  slimmed-down Schuur. She said she has kept the weight off and become something  of a fitness buff. These days, she often heads for a swimming pool, exercise  bike or treadmill, even while touring.  </P> <P> Her voice has never been stronger. Schuur is that rare songbird who appeals to  both mainstream jazz and light commercial jazz audiences. She can swing and  scat in the tradition of Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald, or turn a lighter,  contemporary ballad with the smoothness of Anita Baker. The 1987 album "Diane  Schuur &amp; the Count Basie Orchestra" stayed at the top of Billboard's jazz  chart for 38 weeks, she said. Both "Talkin' 'Bout You," aimed at light jazz and  pop radio audiences, and the Basie project sold in six figures, according to a  GRP spokesman.  </P> <P> San Diego fans can expect to hear material mostly from her last few albums.  </P> <P> "It's too soon to get into the stuff for the new album," she said.  </P> <P> Schuur will be backed by San Diegans Randy Porter on piano, Bob Magnusson on  bass and Jim Plank on drums.  </P> <P> Folk-rock singer Holly Near, whose music carries strong political and social  messages and is released on her own Oakland-based Redwood Records, will open.  </P> <P> Saxophonist Richard Elliot has never denied that he wants commercial success.  He consciously packages his music to reach the largest possible audience.  </P> <P> With his fourth solo album, released last year, Elliot, who plays Humphrey's  tonight at 8, hit pay dirt. "Take to the Skies" sold more than 100,000 copies,  placing him among an elite group of jazz-pop moneymakers. But at what cost?  </P> <P> On "What's Inside," his newest album, Elliot undermines his own talent. The FM  radio single is "Movers and Shakers," on which his horn takes a back seat to  sappy self-help lyrics sung by Michael and Danny Sembello. But the best tracks  are "Sea Breeze" and "Cantiba," on which Elliot cuts loose against a  synthesized wall of tropical percussion.  </P> <P> In San Diego, Elliot's band will include several musicians from the new album.  He plans to play material from all of his solo projects, especially the last  two.  </P> <P> RIFFS: KIFM unveils "The Jazz Show, with Ron Galon" from 10 p.m. to midnight  this Sunday, hosted by the KSDS-FM disc jockey who has been a local jazz radio  personality since 1970. Galon promises minimal talk, maximum straight-ahead  jazz. . . .  </P> <P> Singer Anita Baker plays San Diego State University's Open Air Amphitheatre on  Tuesday night. . . .  </P> <P> The Night Blooming Jazzmen serve up Dixieland jazz at 2 p.m. Sunday at the East  County Performing Arts Center in El Cajon. . . .  </P> <P> This Sunday night at 7, KSDS-FM's (88.3) "Le Jazz Club" program features a live  1965 recording of guitarist Wes Montgomery in a quintet that also includes  saxophonist Johnny Griffin. . . .  </P> <P> Art Johnson plays seven-string jazz guitar at Words &amp; Music in Hillcrest on  Wednesday night, joined by L.A. pianist Joanne Grauer, with sets at 8 and 9:15.  The duo will perform material from their 1989 album, "Time Remembered,"  including several Bill Evans tunes. . . .  </P> <P> Pianist Shep Meyers, a veteran of work with Woody Herman, Ella Fitzgerald,  Roland Kirk, Charlie Haden and many others, will give a free concert next  Tuesday night at 8 in the campus theater of San Diego City College.  </P></p>

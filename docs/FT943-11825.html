			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Italy As the political tensions in Italy mount, the contrarian investor might be tempted to buy. The battered lira appears substantially undervalued against the D-Mark, sharpening Italy's international competitiveness. Corporate earnings are likely to rebound even more strongly as a result. Italian bond yields reflect far more than any realistic expectations about inflation, which stands at a 25-year low. The real fear for investors, though, concerns Italy's budget deficit. On some calculations, the government needs to run a primary surplus of 3 per cent of GDP a year to cope with the strain. Belgium has shown that is possible. But it will take real political muscle to tackle health and pension spending in Italy. That seems uncertain when the political situation remains so volatile. The contrarian investor will dave to be bolder than ever.</p>

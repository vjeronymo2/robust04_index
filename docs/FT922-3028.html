			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: 'Endowment trust' launch IF YOU thought you had seen the most complicated product the financial services industry had to offer, prepare to be amazed. Next month, Kleinwort Benson will launch an investment trust which invests in second-hand with-profits endowment policies. It aims to compete with zero-dividend investment trust preference shares. Confused? You need not be. The Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust (Kept) should do a simple job for investors - over 11 years it should deliver a solid capital gain. It is not planning to pay any dividends. No income tax is payable, so it will appeal, like zeros, to top-rate taxpayers who pay no capital gains tax. The trust's fund will invest only in second-hand endowment policies (Sheps), together with some cash. The supply of Sheps comes, in particular, from distressed homeowners who give up on the endowments they were using to pay the mortgage - KB estimates the policies surrendered each year amount to Pounds 1bn. If homeowners 'surrender' their policy to the life office, they receive a paltry sum compared with the value which has already accrued. This opens the way to make a market - distressed policyholders can get a better rate from a marketmaker, who makes a profit by selling the policy to someone else, who pays the remaining premiums and receives the maturity value. The market has grown, boosted by wider awareness of Sheps' possibilities. But it is hard to find a Shep for the price you want to pay, and valuation requires actuarial formulae which few can take on unaided. Hence the demand for a collective fund. Endowments are long-term and illiquid, so an open-ended fund, such as a unit trust, seems unworkable. Investment trusts are preferable. KB's trust will have an 11-year life. It aims to buy its endowments during its first year and to use some cash from the launch to pay premiums on the policies until the end of year two. From then on, premiums from the remaining policies will be paid for out of the proceeds of endowments as they mature within the fund. The Sheps will mature in the trust's final year, and the capital will be distributed to shareholders. It has the simplicity of a unitised fund, combined with all the reassuring qualities of with-profits investment. So could things go wrong? With-profits policies cannot go down in value. Instead, 'reversionary' bonuses - which once awarded cannot be taken away - are added each year together with a terminal bonus when the policy matures. But they are not risk-free. The amount of bonuses added can be reduced, so the policy can do worse than expected. Bonuses are under severe pressure and 1992 has seen sweeping cuts for short term policies, although 25-year policies have been less affected. Kept hopes to avoid some of these problems by investing in the large long-term policies which are least popular with private investors. It also has a deal with Surrenda-Link, a marketmaker, which it hopes will ensure that it can buy policies at healthy discounts. But low inflation and low interest rates will put further pressure on bonuses. KB says that if both reversionary and terminal bonuses fall 20 per cent over the next 11 years then the gross redemption yield (the growth received each year over the life of the trust) will be 10.2 per cent. Greater bonus cuts would mean a lower yield. Then there is the discount risk. The underlying portfolio is secure, but the value you receive if you sell your shares within the 11 years is determined by market forces. Kleinwort says the shares can be regarded as zeros, most of which now actually trade at a premium, but analysts seem unhappy to go this far. Nigel Sidebottom, of Gerrard Vivian Gray, calls Kept a 'quasi-zero', because it lacks the cover of a zero, but is less risky than most equity investments. Other analysts concur. That, hopefully, will mean that the shares do not sink to a discount, but the risk is still there. Doubts also remain about the market for Sheps, where demand far outstrips supply. The advent of a big new buyer can only exacerbate this. However, the ingenuity of this genuinely innovative product cannot be faulted. The full prospectus will be available in July.</p>

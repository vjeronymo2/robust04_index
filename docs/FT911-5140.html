			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: MEPC lets property in City THE FIRST large property letting in the City of London this year has been achieved by MEPC, the property developer and investor, which has pre-let its 125,000 sq ft office development at Finsbury Circus to the Bank of Toyko. Another big letting deal has been announced by Markheath Securities, which has pre-let 140,000 sq ft of offices in Brentford, West London to SmithKline Beecham, the healthcare group, for an annual rent of about Pounds 3.7m. The weakness of the London property market was reflected in MEPC's agreement to take on the Bank of Toyko's existing lease of 80,000 sq ft in Northgate House in Moorgate. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the letting agents, said that the terms of the deal should be an encouragement to the market. The rent, which was undisclosed, was said to reflect the high quality of the development. MEPC was originally quoting rents early last year of over Pounds 60 per square foot. The Bank of Toyko will move into the building next spring. It will sub-let the top two floors of the building, which total 25,600 sq ft.</p>

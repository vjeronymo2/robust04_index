			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S MURDER: THINGS THAT WENT WRONG  </P> <P> One might say actress Rebecca Schaeffer's life was worth only about $5, as that  is all the money it took to legally obtain her home address from the California  Department of Motor Vehicles, with the issuance of such directly leading to her  death (Part I, July 22).  </P> <P> Accused murderer Robert John Bardo then allegedly used this address, which was  obtained by a private investigator hired by him, though anyone could easily  obtain it from the DMV with a valid reason, to hunt her down and kill her.  </P> <P> It is painfully self-evident that new laws need to be immediately enacted to  protect the privacy and safety of individuals by making it considerably more  difficult for someone to obtain a person's home address from the DMV or any  other source in order to prevent future such tragedies.  </P> <P> Another disturbing aspect of this murder is that due to severe cutbacks in  mental health funding, individuals like Bardo, who are seriously disturbed and  need to be confined in mental institutions, are out there freely roaming the  streets, veritable walking time bombs, just waiting to explode and kill or  seriously injure someone.  </P> <P> KENNETH L.

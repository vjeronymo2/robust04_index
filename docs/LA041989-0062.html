			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG SUPPLY CONVOY BREAKS THROUGH REBELS' BLOCKADE TO REACH KABUL  </P> <P> A convoy of up to 1,000 armored vehicles and 500 trucks carrying Soviet arms  and food broke through a guerrilla blockade and rumbled into Kabul on Tuesday  in the biggest operation of its kind since Moscow's troops left Afghanistan two  months ago.  </P> <P> Helicopter gunships flew overhead as the columns of tanks, armored cars,  mounted multiple-rocket launchers and food trucks reached the capital after  running a gauntlet of guerrillas dug in on mountains dominating the Salang  Highway.  </P> <P> Drivers said the convoy carrying arms, rice, flour and wheat took 45 days to  get from the Soviet border -- normally a three-day journey.  </P> <P> Its arrival was a significant victory for the Soviet-backed Kabul government,  which has fought a powerful moujahedeen alliance on its own since the last  Soviet troops pulled out Feb. 15.  </P> <P> The convoy had to battle moujahedeen determined to starve Kabul into surrender,  and drivers said they saw dozens of trucks and armored cars burning along the  highway.  </P> <P> The drivers said they saw soldiers handing over truckloads of food and  ammunition to the moujahedeen as security for safe passage.  </P> <P> With the Salang Highway closed, a Soviet airlift of food and military equipment  has enabled the government of President Najibullah to continue fighting the  moujahedeen, armed and financed by the West.  </P> <P> Closure of the highway had caused a pileup of up to 140,000 tons of essential  supplies on the Soviet border, with wheat germinating and other perishable food  rotting.  </P> <P> A 90-truck vanguard reached Kabul last Friday, but the moujahedeen, who  sometimes operate only 12 miles from the capital, had prevented the rest from  getting through.  </P></p>

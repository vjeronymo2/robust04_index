			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga, 11 Jan -- The actions against the Russian  ambassador and the representatives of her army that occurred in  Latvia on Monday [10 January] were called thoughtless and a  provocation by Georgs Andrejevs, Latvian minister of foreign  affairs. On the instruction of the head of one of Riga's  districts, four of Russia's military facilities were blockaded,  the ambassador's car was detained, and two major generals were  arrested and taken away in the direction of the frontier in  handcuffs. As a result, talks with the Russian delegation  scheduled for today have been postponed.    "Armed conflict was a reality," Andrejevs noted in an  interview on television on Monday evening. According to him,  President Yeltsin had given the command for a number of  divisions stationed close to the frontier with Latvia to be in a  state of operational readiness. In a report for the press  circulated that same evening the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  notified that "the Government of Latvia will do everything  possible to prevent similar measures of a provocative nature  from happening in the future which might have a negative effect  on the prestige of Latvia in the world and complicate the  internal political situation in the state." The government  stresses, it goes on to say, that in the future all questions  connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops will be resolved  by means of talks.    It has been announced that criminal proceedings have been  instituted with regard to all the facts that will establish the  degree of guilt of each participant in the action. The Cabinet  of Ministers of Latvia gathered for an extraordinary sitting  late in the evening.    Evening television broadcasts also showed the main  instigator, Andrejs Ruchs [as transliterated], head of the  Vidzemskiy [as transliterated] district of Riga, who had ordered  that anyone hindering his instruction should be shot. He warned  the generals when they were arrested that if they did not resist  they would be taken to the frontier unharmed. Ruchs stated that  there will be no more talks on the territory of his district.    "It is naive to think," the minister of foreign affairs of  Latvia noted, "that what happened is the outcome of the  `creativity' of just a few people."</p>

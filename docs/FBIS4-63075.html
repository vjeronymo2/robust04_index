			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Situation Will Improve in </F> the Immediate Future"]    [Text] Unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and  Russia is a mandatory condition for pulling the Republic out of  its current crisis. Belarus will be able to preserve its  independence only through economic union with Russia. This  staunch position was declared by Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyachaslaw Kebich during a visit to Borisov, where he met with  residents and the leaders of local enterprises.    Speaking to an audience at the Town Center of Culture,  Vyachaslaw Kebich assured that, despite various talks on the  current government faults, he has a program for pulling the  state out of the crisis. In particular, the government will  considerably cut down its financial support to unprofitable  enterprises. It was recommended that banks stop allotting  credits to such entities. The "Law on Bankruptcy" will be  applied. The government is going to launch a wide-scale  campaign to set up share holding enterprises along with foreign  investors. To stop the decrease in the standard of living, the  Cabinet of Ministers specified an inventory of goods which will  be produced in the Republic in required amounts, irrespective of  all economic difficulties.    Citing the opinions of foreign experts, Vyachaslaw Kebich  said: "If the government manages to realize its plans,  Belarusian industry will increase its production as early as  1995."    In the opinion of the head of state, similar results could  be  expected in the agricultural sector. The government will  support the financial situation of the agricultural sector by  lifting certain taxes. The Cabinet of Ministers plans to lift  taxes on real estate, water, subsidiary production, and health  care, as well as certain environmental taxes. The government  declared its readiness to finance the development of the  agrarian social sector.    As to the question of if the Cabinet of Ministers supports a  collective form of economy, Vyachaslaw Kebich answered that, in  his opinion, kolkhozes have not yet used all their reserves and  opportunities. "Our position is not to destroy what has not  become obsolete."    In his talk with Borisov residents, Vyachaslaw Kebich made  assurances that the situation in the republican economy would  change for the better in the immediate future. The prime  minister links this hope with the signing of the monetary merger  agreement with Russia. This subject was discussed at his  meeting with leaders of "Ekran" Association enterprises, which  are currently undergoing conversion. They produce first-class  navigational equipment for aircraft and ships.    "I strongly support a new confederative union," said  Vyachaslaw Kebich.    As for economic union with Russia, the prime minister  believes that Ukraine -- after holding its presidential  elections -- will also support this idea. The Asian republics  [of the former USSR] would like to become members, as well. In  the opinion of the head of government, a Russian ruble can  become legal tender in Belarus in as little as one or two months.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (11): Pressure for farm reforms - Hefty production-related subsidies to farmers have led to perverse results, including high food prices IN THE next few months, most Swiss farmers will begin receiving their first dose of general direct payments from their federal government. The idea, now widely accepted among agricultural policy-makers throughout the industrialised world, is to separate the question of farm income from the question of production. Switzerland, like most other industrialised countries, has provided farmers with hefty production subsidies in the postwar period. Indeed, the country is, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the champion in this field, with production subsidies accounting for no less than 79 per cent of consumer prices in 1987-88. These production-related subsidies have led, in Switzerland as elsewhere, to a number of perverse results. Production has been excessive and the environment has been damaged by the fertilisers and other chemicals that have been over-used to intensify output. High product prices coupled with severe import restrictions have hurt consumers while helping small farm units - that might otherwise have collapsed - to survive. For a long time, the Swiss were willing to put up with very high food costs, still feeling gratitude to farmers for providing adequate supplies of food during the Second World War. Indeed, the legal basis of farming in the country is a 1951 law that called for the maintenance of a vigorous peasant farming community. However, in recent years, as comparisons with food costs in other countries have become more unfavourable, attitudes have changed. Many Swiss have voted with their feet, shopping regularly in neighbouring France and Germany where prices for meat and dairy products are as much as 50 per cent lower than at home. An additional pressure for reform has come from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations which, if it succeeds, would oblige Switzerland, like other countries, to reduce its subsidies to farmers. The Swiss government embarked on a big reform programme about two years ago, with three aims generally agreed. These were to promote larger farm units, to reduce surpluses and to ease the impact of agriculture on the environment. In the typical Swiss way, once there is general agreement on something, the execution follows remarkably quickly. By last October, a law had been passed incorporating these principles, and the regulations to implement it cleared the cabinet two weeks ago. THANKS to high subsidy levels, Swiss farm units have remained very small - the average full-time farm was only about 16 hectares in 1990. The agricultural sector employed about 150,000 people, some 5 per cent of the labour force, and produced goods worth SFr9.4bn, 4.1 per cent of total GDP. The initial focus of reform is in dairy products, partly because that is where the distortions are most pronounced, partly because important cheese exports could soon be outlawed in many countries unless production subsidies are cut. Some SFr190m in direct payments will start to flow in the next few weeks. Two types of payment are foreseen. The first is in return for the producer milk price dropping on September 1 from SFr1.07 to SFr0.97 per litre. The other element is for contributions by farmers to improving the environment, measures such as returning land to pasture, using biological techniques and raising free range animals. Swiss officials hope the rewards for these measures will stop farmers from thinking only about increasing production. Amenity is an important element of Swiss agriculture, especially in the mountains. If farmland is not looked after, the danger of floods and erosion is enhanced. Also, it becomes less attractive to tourists. Some Swiss worry that as farmers start to receive their direct payments, they will simply head for the Seychelles. The government hopes to stop them by insisting that grassland must be cut at least once a year if the farmer is to qualify for payments. If the land reverts to forest - which happens quite quickly if it is neglected - direct payments are halted. Direct payments will grow in the future only to partially compensate for inflation - 'we are telling farmers to cut their costs by 2 per cent a year. We will raise payments only if inflation is over two per cent,' an Agriculture Ministry official says. The hope ultimately is to get milk prices down to levels that are slightly higher than EC prices, so that products can be exported without subsidies. In the official's view, this means a price of about SFr0.75 per litre of milk. However, the government is not optimistic about the speed with which production capacity will disappear. Milk output, for example, has been subject to quotas for several years, and many farmers have substantial reserve capacity. At the current milk price, the average farm has 12 cows. Officials estimate that at SFr0.75 per litre, a farmer will need to have at least 30 cows to be economically viable. The government wants to expand the direct payment programme to meats, not least in the hope of slowing the exodus of consumers to neighbouring countries. But no moves are scheduled at the moment, largely because of budgetary restraints and because of the successful campaign by farmers' organisations to spread out the pain. Mr Marcel Sandoz, the eloquent president of the Schweizerische Bauernverband (Swiss Peasant Farmers' Union), says Swiss farmers are among the most heavily indebted in Europe, having invested heavily in anticipation of policy stability. 'In farming, the smallest unit of time is one year. It takes a generation to change the way a farmer thinks, yet we are being asked to adapt to a revolution in only a few years,' says Mr Sandoz. Farmers launched a legal appeal for slow implementation of the reform based on the rather charming Swiss notion that a citizen has the right to trust his government. The government agreed.</p>

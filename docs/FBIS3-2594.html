			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by LIEN HO PAO News Team: "CPPCC </F> Members Press for the Right to Vote"]    [Text] Many CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference) members yesterday demanded that the CPPCC should  enjoy more real powers or even the right to vote like that  exercised by the upper houses in foreign countries yesterday,  the first day for group discussions. Again, many CPPCC members  were dissatisfied with the contents of the report on work done  by the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee and leveled  many criticisms at it.    The economic group is a new group set up by the Eighth  National CPPCC Congress and also a dynamic group. The economic  group held two wonderful discussions at the Beijing Jingfeng  Guest House yesterday. When commenting on the role of CPPCC  members, Xu Qingxiong, board-of-directors chairman of the  Shanghai Wanguo Stock Company, said: "CPPCC members should not  be content with discussing state affairs. However, they are not  entitled to participate in shaping policy decisions and can only  express their views when the policies have been published."    He added: "For example, in foreign countries tax reform is  decided on after lengthy debate. But in China, CPPCC members  had no idea about it until the tax reform program was  published." Zhao Weichen, convener of the economic group,  responded: "Opinions of CPPCC members should be solicited  before any decisions are made."    CPPCC members can presently participate in the  administration  and discussion of state affairs but enjoy no right to vote in  formulating policies and bills. In his speech, Wei Yuming,  CPPCC member and former deputy minister of foreign economic  relations and trade, pressed for the right to vote for CPPCC  members. He said that the government work report as well as  important policy decisions should be presented to the CPPCC for  discussions before rather than after they are published.    Wei said that CPPCC members are not representatives because  "they are appointed by the authorities." He believed that CPPCC  members' right to participate in the administration and  discussion of state affairs should be given legal status. He  further pointed out: "Abroad, CPPCC delegation usually call on  the upper house or the senate. But the upper house has the  right to vote while the CPPCC has not. I explained the CPPCC's  role whenever upper house members asked me about it, but they  did not understand what I said despite my earnest efforts. To  participate in the administration of state affairs, the CPPCC  must enjoy the right to vote. The CPPCC should have the same  power and functions as those enjoyed by upper houses in foreign  countries under the new historical situation."    In his report on the work done by the CPPCC National  Committee Standing Committee, the vice chairman of the committee  Ye Xuanping said that CPPCC members "should fulfill their duties  without overstepping their authority." This statement evoked  dissatisfaction from many CPPCC members. Tian Yinong, CPPCC  National Committee Standing Committee member and former deputy  finance minister, said he does not understand what is meant by  overstepping authority. Another CPPCC member Lu Zhongmin,  board-of-directors chairman of the First Luoyang Tractor Plant,  said: "There would be no problem of `overstepping the  authority' if the rules and regulations were strictly observed.  Such problems, if any, should not have been raised in the  report on work done by the CPPCC National Committee Standing  Committee."</p>

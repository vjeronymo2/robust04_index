			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Leading Article: Russia after the summit 'THE WORLD cannot afford the strife of the former Yugoslavia replicated in a nation as big as Russia, spanning 11 time zones with an arsenal of nuclear weapons that is still very vast.' Thus did President Clinton explain the importance of the subjects under discussion with President Yeltsin over the weekend. But they were no less important a year ago when actions now being contemplated by western leaders might have made faster reform feasible. The west chose to be timid when it should have been bold. Now it may be too late. A legally justified anarchy obtains in Russia. Unhappily, it is likely to endure. Mr Yeltsin is likely to win a majority of those voting in the plebiscite of April 25. That would give him the moral victory, but it would not give him the unquestioned authority he needs to implement reforms, for which he must obtain a majority of those registered to vote. The west cannot directly influence the outcome, though its moral support must help. Should Mr Yeltsin win either a decisive victory or merely a moral one, western assistance will be essential. First, the West cannot offer just one kind of assistance. There will have to be humanitarian relief, technical assistance and project finance. But there must also be help with economic stabilisation. Without a currency worth earning, a budget that can be closed without use of the printing press, and a social safety net, assistance will largely be wasted. Second, aid must be coordinated more effectively. The summit decision to establish a G7 coordinating office in Moscow is welcome and overdue. Third, substantial assistance will be needed to make stabilisation even conceivable. With its proposed temporary financing facility to help Russia and other former Soviet republics 'facing particularly disruptive systemic shocks', the IMF seems to have recognised at last that the orthodox approach is not workable in the former Soviet Union. Fourth, Russia will need markets. But access to western markets is in the interest of the west as well, since Russia will export in order to import. The European Community should reach generous free trade agreements with all the countries of the former Soviet Union as quickly as possible. Finally, President Clinton needs to remember his own words about the security threat posed by Russia. Dollars 900m of the Dollars 1.6bn he offered is merely disguised assistance to US farm exports. Help for Russia should be seen as an alternative to western military spending. It is only in this context that assistance on the required scale could be justified without sacrificing the interests of other, arguably worthier recipients. President Clinton has shown he is aware of the seriousness of the challenge. That is a welcome start. The G7 must now show the determination to help take Russian reform forward.</p>

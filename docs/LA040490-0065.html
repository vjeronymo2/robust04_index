			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> U.S. IS AMONG EIGHT TEAMS TO PLAY IN INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE  </P> <P> The Federation Internationale de Volleyball will try to create a consistent  interest in men's volleyball with an international league offering $1 million  in prize money to teams from eight countries, including the United States.  </P> <P> "It's the first league of this type in sports," said Doug Beal, director of the  U.S. national team, at a press conference Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The World League will supplant the World Cup and World Championships. Those  events tend to only get tremendous attention in the country that is hosting  it."  </P> <P> Beal said that the league grew out of the frustration in trying to support and  train a national team in non-Olympic years.  </P> <P> The FIVB will try to expand Olympic interest with the World League, which  includes the U.S., France, Italy and Brazil in one division and the Soviet  Union, Japan, China and the Netherlands in the other.  </P> <P> The U.S. will open the season against France April 29 at the Forum in  Inglewood. The Americans will also play France on April 30, then Italy on May  5, and Brazil on June 2 at the Forum, and Italy on May 6 and Brazil on June 1  at the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Teams will play division opponents four times -- two at home and two away --  and the top two teams in each division will meet in the playoffs at Osaka,  Japan in July.  </P> <P> The FIVB also has an agreement to have all the league matches televised, home  and away. The U.S. matches will be shown, delayed, by SportsChannel.  </P> <P> Individual match winners will receive $1,500 and the losers will get $1,000.  The division champions will receive $80,000 and the second through fourth-place  teams will get $60,000, $40,000 and $30,000, respectively.  </P> <P> The playoff champion will receive $140,000.  </P></p>

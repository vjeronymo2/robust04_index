NATO, the strongest military alliance in history, the defender  of Western civilisation, the guardian of individual liberty, has  fired its first shots in anger. We are in a new world.    The destruction of four Serbian planes over central  Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday does not mean that the West is  engaged in a full-scale war. But those explosions in the skies  have changed the structure of international relations. Gone is  the black-and-white world of East-West confrontation. Gone,  too, is the fleeting mirage of a New World Order, a place where  responsible powers were supposed to work together for the cause  of security. Welcome, instead, to a world of uncertainty and  upheaval, of clashing nationalisms and murky wars where the West  thinks, but is not quite sure, that it must unleash its weapons  for the sake of its own credibility.    When the foreign ministers of 12 Western countries signed  the  treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on 4  April 1949, it is a fair bet that none of them expected the  alliance to fire its first shots in the middle of the Balkans.  Berlin, perhaps, but not a few miles from Banja Luka, a place  that lies outside NATO's frontiers.    Now that NATO has struck, the West has no escape route from  Bosnia short of utter humiliation. It is therefore a matter of  the highest urgency for Western governments to tell their  publics what, precisely, is the goal of NATO policy in the  Balkans. Since the wars of the Yugoslav succession broke out in  June 1991, there have been too many switches of direction, too  many disputes inside the Western alliance, too much confusion  over how far to involve the Russians and, above all, too little  long-term thinking.    This is not a conflict like the Gulf war against Iraq.  There, the West had a clearly defined and legitimate objective:  to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. If, in the course of  that action, Saddam Husayn was prevented from posing a future  threat to other countries in the region, including Israel, then  that, too, was a reasonable objective.    But in Bosnia, as in the rest of former Yugoslavia and the  Balkans as a whole, it has never been clear what the West stands  for. Shots have been fired, aircraft have been destroyed, but  in the name of what? We have a military policy, but our  political strategy lacks coherence.    It is instructive to recall that, only three summers ago,  the  West was upholding the principle of a united Yugoslavia.  Slovenia and Croatia were warned against secession. By the end  of 1991, a complete reversal of policy had taken place and the  West was promoting Slovenian and Croatian independence.    The consequence was that the West also had to endorse  independence for Bosnia-Herzegovina, for otherwise the Muslims  and Croats of that republic would be vulnerable minorities in a  Serbian-dominated rump Yugoslavia. But the West then did  absolutely nothing to protect Bosnia. It admitted the newly  independent state into the United Nations at a time when it was  clear that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President  Franjo Tudjman of Croatia were colluding in Bosnia's partition.    By mid-l992, the damage was done. The West had adopted the  mantle of Bosnia's protector but refused to come to its defence.  Making the best of a bad job, Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance, the  West's mediators, devised a plan for turning Bosnia into a  republic of 10 provinces in which the central government's  powers would be kept to a minimum and Muslims, Serbs and Croats  would, as far as possible, administer their own affairs. It was  in principle not a bad plan, for at least it preserved the idea  of Bosnia's territorial integrity. But it had several flaws.  First, it needed a substantial commitment of UN forces to be  workable, and Western governments could not summon the will for  such an operation. Second, it appeared to reward the Serbs with  land, where Muslims were the largest nationality before they  were subjected to killings and forced expulsions. It also  handed Mostar to the Croats, though the town had a slight Muslim  majority before the war. This led to the third flaw: the  absence of US support for the plan on the grounds that it was  unfair.    The next Western initiative came close to acknowledging  that Bosnia had ceased to exist. It was a plan, again bearing  Lord Owen's stamp, that called for a three-way division of  Bosnia into Serbian, Croatian and Muslim regions. Few seriously  expected that the Serbian and Croatian areas would refrain from  merging with Serbia and Croatia proper. Even fewer considered  how to organise the massive population transfers that would be  necessary to implement the plan.    As before, the United States -- backed by Germany --  withheld  support from the proposal. Why should the Muslims be pushed  into an unjust settlement? It was a fair point, and it buried  the plan. But still there was no agreed Western policy.    The Sarajevo marketplace massacre last month caused the buck  of Bosnian peace-making to pass to the Americans. Their idea is  to construct a Muslim-Croat unit in Bosnia that will then form  an alliance, possibly even an administrative connection, with  Croatia.    But this initiative begs important questions. Does the West  uphold the principle of Bosnia's unity, or is it saying that,  once the Muslims and Croats are packaged together, the Bosnian  Serbs can merge with Serbia? If the latter, then what about all  the towns on the Drina river in eastern Bosnia where the Serbs  tore Muslim communities to shreds in 1992? If the Serbs are to  retain these towns, and ultimately end up with about half of  Bosnia, then what was the point of destroying four Serbian light  attack aircraft yesterday?    But if the opposite is true, and the West wants to keep  Bosnia together, then how will it impose such a settlement on  the Serbs? Is the West proposing to beat the Serbs into  submission by force? If so, has the West taken into account the  implications of Russian opposition?    If Western countries take the view that they have no  fundamental interests in the Balkans worth a confrontation with  Russia, then their governments should tell us so explicitly and  admit that a Bosnian settlement will involve a degree of  injustice. At the moment, we have the worst of both worlds:  highmindedness and irresolution. Couple that with military  action undertaken without a clear purpose, and the only  certainty is that the world is rapidly becoming less safe.</p>

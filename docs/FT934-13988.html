			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Brokerage business helps Primerica advance 57% PRIMERICA, the financial services group which last month announced an agreed bid for the US insurer Travelers, yesterday reported a 57 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 258.7m. The strong performance was fuelled by another record quarter from Primerica's Wall Street brokerage subsidiary, Smith Barney Shearson. The group's overall results, however, were affected by a string of special factors. They included Dollars 89.6m in gains from portfolio investments and sales of subsidiaries and affiliates; a Dollars 65m provision for the cost of the merger between Smith Barney and Shearson; and an Dollars 8.1m charge related to a recently-enacted tax increase. Once these factors are stripped out, Primerica's third-quarter operating earnings came in at Dollars 242.2m, up 77 per cent from a year ago. Smith Barney Shearson again proved to be the star of Primerica's show. The firm, the second-largest brokerage house in the US after Merrill Lynch, earned Dollars 118.8m in the quarter, which includes two months' results from Shearson following its acquisition on July 31. Like other Wall Street firms, Smith Barney Shearson continues to benefit from heavy interest in the stock and bond markets among individual investors, strong demand for asset management services, and record-breaking underwriting activity on the US capital markets. Mr Weill described Primerica's third quarter as 'gratifying and exciting'. He said the steady improvement in Travelers' operating performance meant that once the insurance company was merged into Primerica, the combined group should have a prosperous future. Travelers' results, also announced yesterday, were not as sparkling as Primerica's. It reported a net loss of Dollars 36m in the quarter, blaming a Dollars 211m charge following a Dollars 325m addition to its reserves to cover asbestos and environmental claims. Excluding the charge and a Dollars 40m one-off tax benefit, Travelers earned Dollars 135m in the third quarter, compared with the Dollars 358m loss it incurred at the same stage of 1992. That loss was due mostly to costs associated with Hurricane Andrew and corporate restructuring initiatives. Travelers' said underlying profit performance continued to improve, thanks partly to cost-cutting.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: IMF chiefbacks Moscow IMF managing director, Mr Michel Camdessus, yesterday strongly urged G7 finance ministers to back the phased reform plan he has agreed with the Russian government. He also insisted that the plan still complied with Russia's reform promises last April. He stopped short of urging them to agree a debt rescheduling for Russia, still under negotiation in the Paris Club of official creditors, although he said President Boris Yeltsin was entitled to ask for creditors' understanding. Mr Camdessus, who flew from Moscow to brief the ministers before Mr Yeltsin arrives tonight, spelt out the broad conditions agreed by the Russian government. It was up to Mr Yegor Gaidar, prime minister, to reveal details, he said. However, he said that on the controversial question of energy price liberalisation, both sides had agreed on a progressive approach of freeing the prices gradually. 'Liberalisation, especially of energy prices, is one of the key elements agreed by us with Russia in April,' he said. 'What the Russians do not want to do (and we agree) is to liberalise energy prices all of a sudden. At the moment the gap between the world energy price, and domestic prices, is too huge.' As for debt rescheduling, both Mr Camdessus and Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, refused to prejudge the decisions of the Paris Club. However, it is clear that the G7 wants to do a deal if details can be agreed. 'Russia I believe will continue to enjoy the support of the Paris Club, and explain what it is doing at the next meeting,' Mr Camdessus said.</p>

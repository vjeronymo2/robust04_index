			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: Why IBM downloaded - Alan Cane hacks into the reasons behind the computer giant's decline THE FATE OF IBM by Robert Heller Little Brown Pounds 16.99, 370 pages International Business Machines in its heyday believed it was better than anybody at anything. Challenged to a boat race by Oxford University, its UK subsidiary trained with characteristic thoroughness and lost convincingly. Chastened but determined it took on the weaker Cambridge crew and lost again. Detailed analysis commissioned by IBM Europe uncovered the reason: while the two universities used one cox and eight oarsmen, IBM had one man rowing and eight steering. Armonk, IBM's corporate headquarters, studied the report and issued its solution: 'Change the rower'. Robert Heller retells this undoubtedly apocryphal story to illustrate the problems deep within IBM which have conspired to bring the company down. It is, significantly, the only joke in a book deeply pessimistic about the future of the world's largest computer manufacturer: 'With the death of the old IBM in February', he writes, 'the torch has passed not only to its new leaders, but to others in many other companies'. He describes his book as a detective story, an investigation of the factors which led an industrial giant with unprecedented power and influence to lose money, its reputation as a paragon of managerial virtue and control of its key markets. He identifies seven suspects; technological change, the company's idiosyncratic culture, customer preferences, changing markets, suppliers turned competitors, globalisation and management faults. All certainly played their part in IBM's downfall. The computer industry displays a curious phenomenon; superficially the technology and the business seem simple; below the surface, however, are vast complexities. Here, then, is the simple view of IBM's decline: a large corporation, used to gross profit margins of 70 per cent or more, failed to change quickly enough when the larger part of its business moved to commodity products delivering at most a 20 per cent profit margin. Reasons for this failure take Heller on a search for clues lasting over 300 pages and bringing the reader en route into contact with many of the remarkable new individual and companies which populate the new computer industry: Bill Gates of Microsoft, America's richest man; Ben Rosen, the brains behind Compaq; Intel, chip maker to the world's personal computer manufacturers; Ross Perot, the fastest, richest Texan in history. Reading The Fate of IBM, however, has something in common with a first visit to a Shakespearian play: it helps to know the story first and to have a passing acquaintanceship with the language. Chronology is abandoned for the sake of the plot. Heller moves freely from the early days of IBM to the present and back again as he develops his theme in a way which sometimes causes vertigo in the reader. There is a good reason. The personal computer business is essentially a new industry which has little in common with the old world of IBM, Unisys and so on. The sharp disjunction around the 1978-82 timeframe makes chronology difficult in such a comprehensive study. Heller has relied heavily on published sources, mostly US in origin, in preparing his analysis and this detracts somewhat from the freshness of the writing. Covering IBM from the UK is difficult; there has only been one other book of this size about the company - Rex Malik's and tomorrow . . . the World? (Millington, 1975) - written from the UK to my knowledge. There is the occasional technical error - An Wang made his money from patents on core, not bubble, memory - but the judgments on IBM's managerial failings display Heller's experienced touch. He will forgive me if I suggest he has not written a 'whodunnit' but a 'why was it done'. It was always going to be the butler.</p>

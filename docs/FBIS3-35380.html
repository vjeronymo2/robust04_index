She was talking to newsmen early this  morning at Islamabad Airport on her return from Saudi Arabia  after performing a minor pilgrimage there. She was referring to  a mob of Afghan demonstrators who attacked the Pakistani Embassy  in Kabul, smashed windows and furniture, and intimidated and  beat the embassy staff. The prime minister said Pakistan has  sheltered three million Afghan refugees for more than 10 years  and even now a large number of the refugees are present in the  country. She said Pakistan has set up camps at Jalalabad in  Afghanistan where displaced persons from Kabul are being  provided relief. Benazir Bhutto said she is deeply saddened by  the incident.    About the rescue of school children who were taken hostage  by  three armed Afghan gunmen, the prime minister said she is happy  that they were safely rescued. She commended the Pakistan Army  commandos and their timely and safe action for safely rescuing  the children. Ms. Benazir Bhutto also welcomed Afghan President  Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani's statement in which he condemned  the kidnapping.    Pakistan has expressed regrets over the attack on its  embassy  in Kabul and has protested with the Afghan Government about this  incident. Immediately after hearing the report about the attack  by an agitated mob on Pakistan's Embassy in Kabul, Foreign  Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Afghan Ambassador Sardar  Roshan to the Foreign Office. The foreign secretary lodged a  protest of the Pakistan Government with him on this regrettable  incident which is a matter of deep concern. The Afghan  ambassador was asked to tell his government to take all possible  steps to ensure the security of the embassy and its staff. The  Afghan ambassador was also asked to immediately provide full  details of the incident and about the well being of the Pakistan  Embassy staff. The Afghan ambassador was told that the incident  is especially condemnable because it took place during the  Pakistan foreign minister's visit to Kabul in connection with  the establishment of peace in Afghanistan. The Pakistan  Government is surprised at such a reaction in Kabul in support  of a criminal act in which three criminals kidnapped innocent  children at gunpoint.</p>

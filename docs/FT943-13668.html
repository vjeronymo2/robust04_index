			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Nigeria oil strike deaths mount Nigeria's striking oil unions said yesterday their leaders had disappeared, as witnesses to clashes in the commercial capital Lagos between demonstrators and security forces reported a number of deaths. The Campaign for Democracy, which is seeking the removal of the military government, alleged that 20 people were killed. One witness described seeing a man in military uniform left dead by a rioting crowd while another unconfirmed report said eight people were shot by armed security forces. The oil workers are demanding that General Sani Abacha's regime uphold the result of the June 1993 presidential election, which was annulled after Mr Moshood Abiola emerged as the apparent winner, and reverse its cuts in investment in the oil industry. Mr Abiola has been arrested and charged with treason and faces trial at the end of this month. Nupeng, the junior oil workers union which is entering the third week of its strike, says its leader Mr Frank Kokori is under arrest, which is denied by the police. Pengassan, the senior staff union which joined the strike a week ago, says it does not know where its two top officials are. The oil workers yesterday ruled out an end to the strike until the military government hands over to civilian rule and denounced as a sell-out talks at the weekend between the government and other trade unions over an end to the strike. Some of the 41 unions which make up the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) began a two-day meeting in Kaduna yesterday to consider a national stoppage in support of Nupeng, especially if any of the strikers were badly treated. The NLC has sided with the government in previous crises and avoided all-out strikes, but as an umbrella for the labour movement it does not control individual unions. Factory workers have been on strike in support since last week in Lagos, where most of the industrial area is shut either because of strikes or lack of electricity and fuel. Some multinationals operating in the Lagos area say they have between a week's and two weeks' supply of industrial fuel, diesel and petrol. The strike has stopped deliveries of petroleum products to filling stations and big industrial users, mainly in the south-west of Nigeria. Shell, which produces half of Nigeria's estimated 2m barrels of oil a day, said: 'It is affecting production in a small way but we are meeting tanker delivery schedules. Gradually the strike is taking effect.'</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: UK's most popular technology devices - Worth Watching Ten years after the launch of the IBM personal computer in the UK, the PC has become one of the top three technological devices in use in Britain. Not suprisingly the most populous device was the remote control unit - 88 per cent of homes have those - followed by the microwave oven, which inhabits 69 per cent of UK homes. One in three households (32 per cent) now own a PC, while 42 per cent of respondents said they used a PC at home or work. The survey was conducted by Gallup for IBM. IBM: UK, 0705 561000.</p>

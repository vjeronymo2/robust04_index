			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Mr Clarke shows his skills Yesterday's performance rounded out the picture of Mr Clarke as a skilful politician who does not fit easily into any political pigeon hole. He is fiscally tough, notably so on public sector employees. Hostile to the call of certain colleagues for 'family values', Mr Clarke is tender towards some of those dependent on the welfare state. He ignores cries for help from big firms, but shows a soft spot for small business. As for the arguments for tax neutrality that meant much to Lord Lawson, these evidently leave him cold. The picture he paints is, in short, one of a pragmatic, tough, cunning and ambitious man. The most striking feature of this, the UK's first ever unified Budget, is its fiscal orthodoxy. Mr Lamont had already announced substantial fiscal adjustments for 1994-95 and 1995-96 of Pounds 6.7bn and Pounds 10.3bn, respectively. Mr Clarke adds to this a further Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95, Pounds 4.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6.1bn in 1996-97. But this is not all he does. He adds spending austerity as well. The result is a noteworthy change in prospects for the public sector borrowing requirement. At Mr Clarke's hands, the PSBR falls from 8 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (excluding privatisation proceeds) this financial year to 6 1/4 per cent in 1994-95 and 1 3/4 per cent by 1997-98. By contrast, only last March Mr Lamont forecast a PSBR of 7 1/4 per cent of GDP next year and 4 per cent of GDP even in 1997-98. Mr Clarke stated: 'The overriding need is to place the public finances on a sound footing.' That judgment is right. Even though his forecasts look rosy, he has probably done enough to ensure this outcome. The rosiness of the perspective is not in the forecasts for growth. This year's growth in non-North Sea real GDP is projected at 1 3/4 per cent, barely up from the 1 1/2 per cent expected in March. Thereafter, these forecasts are unchanged. They are for 2 1/4 per cent growth in 1994-95, 2 3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent thereafter. These projections are not that optimistic. With forecasts for the economy largely unchanged, the impact of Mr Clarke can be judged by changes in shares of public spending and taxation in GDP by comparison with the legacy of his predecessor. Under Mr Lamont, the share of general government expenditure in GDP was to fall by 2 1/4 percentage points of GDP between 1993-94 and 1997-98. Under Mr Clarke, by contrast, it is to fall by 3 1/4 percentage points. Similarly, under Mr Lamont the share of general government receipts was to rise by 2 3/4 percentage points. Now it is to rise by 4 percentage points. So Mr Clarke intends to achieve the improvements he seeks by roughly equal adjustments on the spending and revenue sides. Is this credible? The tax increases are more or less in the bag, presuming the recovery goes as planned. Spending control is not. The reduction in the new control totals for non-cyclical spending is accounted for by changes in the reserve. While normal, this means analysis must focus mainly on the departmental figures. The overall increase in the control total in real terms between 1993-94 and 1996-97 is set at only 0.6 per cent. Real spending on health is shown unchanged, as is support for local government, while spending on defence is to fall 12 per cent in real terms. Education does better, with an increase of 5.3 per cent, but even spending on social security is expected to increase only 2.3 per cent. Low planned increases in real spending over a period of three years in highly sensitive areas will be possible only if the government can maintain its planned constraint on running costs, with wage bills unchanged in real terms. Is this believable or even desirable? It is not believable that the relative pay of public sector workers, whose productivity will never rise as fast as in some other areas of the economy, can be reduced indefinitely. An explosion is almost certain, perhaps in the run-up to the next election. But this is also undesirable, because it makes a nonsense of the role of review bodies in setting public sector pay. Yet even if the government fails to achieve its ambitious goals on public spending, this Budget should achieve, with its announced fiscal changes and even limited success on spending, what the chancellor set out to do. With Pounds 7bn of underfunding as well this year, the gilts markets have every reason to cheer. This Budget should allow further interest rate cuts and, with luck, sustained recovery. There is rather less reason to cheer some of the details. The various offsets to the cost of value added tax on fuel were justified. But the result, a cost of Pounds 1 1/4 bn extra in 1996-97, offsets a great deal of the additional Pounds 3bn the measure would raise in a full year. No wonder Mr Clarke decided to avoid further changes to VAT, even where they could have been justified. A noteworthy feature is the chancellor's fiscal tinkering. The freezing of allowances is, for example, bound to bring ever more people into the tax net, an unattractive development. The introduction of a new, unheralded 15 per cent rate of allowance for mortgage interest relief and the married couple's allowance, reasonable in itself, is also a destabilising precedent. The long-sought elimination of one old distorting scheme, the Business Expansion Scheme, is promptly offset by a new one, the Enterprise Investment Scheme. Some fiscal changes do look sensible in themselves, the tax on insurance premiums, for example, and on air passengers. For all that, Mr Clarke offers not the germ of an idea on the proper direction of the tax system as a whole. This criticism is a little less true of spending, where he evidently benefits from his own background and the hard work of two Thatcherite minsters, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley. The introduction of a 'job seeker's allowance' and 'incapacity benefit' look defensible. Reductions in support for students are even to be welcomed. But he remains sturdily eclectic. His strong statement of support for the principles of the welfare state is notable. Introduction of the first direct support for childcare, targeted at single mothers, alongside a further reduction in the tax benefit to married couples, is a more specific example of the chancellor's non-Thatcherite, non-family values. This is not a Budget with a big idea on tax or a big idea on spending. It contains, instead, many little ideas, of varying quality, on both. But Mr Clarke does have one big idea, frugality. This is a tough Budget from a tough man. It is the right Budget for the times.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Joint Miramar bid hits valuation snag MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific's joint bid for Miramar Hotel and Investment has hit a snag with Miramar's senior executives claiming that the bid undervalues the hotels and property group by up to HKDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 343m). In a letter to shareholders, Mr Young Bing-Ching, Miramar director and general manager, said the overture from Mr Li and Citic Pacific, Beijing's main investment arm in Hong Kong, was not friendly, as Mr Li has claimed, and that it undervalued the company. He urged shareholders not to sell until they had received the opinion of an independent valuer. Last week, Mr Li and Citic launched a cash bid for Miramar of HKDollars 15.5 a share and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant, valuing the company at HKDollars 8.7bn. The market's initial reaction was that the offer was too low and Miramar's shares have since been trading above the offer. Yesterday they closed at HKDollars 16.70. Mr Young claimed in his letter that Miramar's property assets alone were 'good enough to support (the company's) shares at HKDollars 20'. He said that Miramar was close to reaping the benefits of the work it had done in developing ties on the mainland. Neither Citic or Mr Li had any comment to make on Mr Young's statement.</p>

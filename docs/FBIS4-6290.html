			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai soldiers yesterday fired eight  mortar shells into Cambodia after five rockets believed to have  been fired by Cambodian government gunners landed in a Thai  village at Ban Saensuk of Tambon Khlong Namsai.    One rocket fell on the house of Samran Ploimali, 30, and the  shrapnel slightly injured her daughter, Sirikanya, 12.    Thai gunners at first fired a smoke shell to warn Cambodian  troops but Cambodian gunners, stationed at kilometre 4 on  Highway No. 5, refused to heed the warning and kept on firing  artillery, mortar and rocket-launchers at the Khmer Rouge  stronghold at Phnum Malai with stray shells landing in Thailand,  according to Thai sources.    Thai gunners then fired eight mortar shells into Cambodia.    It is not known whether the shells caused any casualties  among Phnom Penh troops.</p>

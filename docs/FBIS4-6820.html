			<p>BFN     [Text] Nakhon Si Thammarat -- A powerful bomb went off at  busy Nakhon Si Thammarat Railway Station around noon yesterday,  killing three people and injuring 27 others in an apparent  terrorist attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the  incident. Police said the explosion came from a cluster of  baggage in the crowded waiting area near a food stall on the  platform where the Nakhon Si Thammarat- Bangkok express train  stood around 12.30 pm.    Sutchai Butngam, 40, who kept the food stall, was killed  instantly, while Rochem Butem, a young man, and a 17-year-old  woman, Amnuai Raksarat, who suffered serious injuries died later  at hospital. Eight of those injured were in critical condition  last night and some may not survive, according to Maharat  Hospital officials. Most of the casualties were passengers or  relatives seeing off family members.    Provincial Governor Suchan Phongnua expressed outrage at the  attack but did not lay blame. "The explosion was an act of  terrorism. It intended to kill people -- poor people, women and  children," he told reporters at the scene of the blast covered  with pools of blood, broken tables and chairs, smashed utensils  and scattered food.    Suchan quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw a young man in  his mid-20s placing a paper box amid the baggage and casually  walking away a few minutes before the explosion. The governor  said police bomb experts had yet to identify the explosive  device, although an initial report suggested that it was an  improvised bomb set off manually by a battery-powered detonator  attached to a time-delay circuit.    Security was tightened at the airport, bus terminals,  wharves, railway stations and government offices throughout the  province, he said. Terrorist attacks like yesterday's incident  are impossible to prevent, he said, because the perpetrators did  not use a time bomb, which can be detected before it goes off.    Police Director General Prathin Santipraphop, who arrived  here from Bangkok to personally direct the investigation into  the case, said he believed the bomb attack was not linked to the  separatist movement because the type of bomb used was different.  Asked whether the attack was aimed at discrediting the  government, Prathin said police investigators would need some  time to find out. The national police chief said initial  findings suggested that there were at least three people  involved in planting the bomb at the railway station. Prathin  said yesterday's attack was unpreventable, but acknowledged that  police will have to improve their intelligence gathering.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he was told by  police that the bomb was designed to create the impression that  the government is unable to keep peace and order. But he said  it was premature to link it to "disempowered element".    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, also Democrat MP  representing Nakhon Si Thammarat, said he was told by an  eyewitness that a man apparently lit a fuse to set off the bomb.  He said the eyewitness saw smoke rising from the paper box just  before the explosion. Surin, who was in Nakhon Si Thammarat  yesterday, said it was too early to say whether the blast was in  any way linked to the separatist movement in Muslim-dominated  provinces.    Police and army bomb experts equipped with metal detectors  searched the railway station and the train for other bombs but  found none.    The Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok train eventually departed on  schedule at 1.40 pm, but most of the would-be passengers  cancelled the journey, fearing for their safety, and had their  tickets refunded.</p>

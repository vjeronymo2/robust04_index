			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy exception to positive tone in bourses European bourses showed particular strength last week, with Italy being the only exception to the positive tone as further political and personal problems confronted the administration of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Asia's markets were also ebullient, with Malaysia recording the best performance last week in local currency terms, although looking at the year as a whole it still remains one of the worst performers in dollar terms: off 11 per cent since last December 31. Ireland led Europe's gainers last week, with the rise explained mainly by the 16 per cent advance in the share price of Jefferson Smurfit, the packaging group, on mid-week news that it was acquiring the paper and packaging unit of Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials company. The market received further encouragement from AIB, up nearly 3 per cent after reporting interim results slightly ahead of expectations. According to Davy's, the Dublin-based broker, the overall market valuation now stands at 12.1 times 1994 earnings estimates, and 10.3 times those for 1995. Given the growth in the domestic economy, Davy's expects the market to rally further in the coming months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change    % change in            % change in local currency**        sterling**  US Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of     Start of                                        1994       1994         1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +3.46   +3.81   +8.31    -5.34      -0.62         +3.55 Belgium      +1.44   +5.74   +8.38    -2.36      +4.06         +8.42 Denmark      +0.44   +5.85  +16.52    +1.24      +6.13        +10.59 Finland      +1.22   +7.61  +38.48   +18.83     +26.89        +32.20 France       +1.62   +9.29   +3.00    -6.21      -1.82         +2.30 Germany      +1.65   +5.62  +14.19    -5.09      -0.03         +4.16 Ireland      +4.21  +10.23  +15.01    +3.49      +7.40        +11.90 Italy        -0.75   +3.43  +17.11   +15.19     +19.92        +24.95 Netherlands  +2.04   +7.12  +15.78    -1.82      +2.97         +7.29 Norway       +0.21  +10.24  +21.39    +7.12     +11.85        +16.54 Spain        +2.40  +10.39  +14.73    -2.56      +2.81         +7.12 Sweden       +1.36  +10.50  +18.00    +5.55      +9.07        +13.65 Switzerland  +1.09   +1.56   +8.51   -10.40      -4.32         -0.31 UK           +2.70   +7.02   +7.77    -6.67      -6.68         -2.77 EUROPE       +1.88   +6.62  +10.12    -4.36      -1.30         +2.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +1.79   +7.19  +13.80    -2.59      +2.12         +6.40 Hong Kong    +1.09  +13.46  +33.55   -20.35     -23.54        -20.34 Japan        +0.77   -0.58   -0.48   +13.38     +20.86        +25.93 Malaysia     +6.66  +13.17  +45.77   -15.00     -14.63        -11.05 New Zealand  +5.30   +9.52  +14.53    -1.32      +2.31         +6.60 Singapore    +2.95   +8.80  +27.36    -8.91      -6.65         -2.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +0.29   +2.65   +9.88    -1.43      -9.67         -5.88 USA          -0.23   +1.90   +1.88    -1.64      -5.59         -1.64 Mexico       +5.09  +10.50  +44.78    -0.32     -11.98         -8.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa +1.71   +6.13  +43.17   +17.46      +6.29        +10.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +0.87   +2.91   +4.96    +1.09      +1.93         +6.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on August 5th 1994.

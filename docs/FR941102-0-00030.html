			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Eliminate the current 28 day pre-acceptance period for notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving nonbanking proposals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reduce from 30 days to 15 days the public comment period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals involving listed activities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specify in the regulation the core information that bank holding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies must provide for a nonbanking proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These revisions to the current application procedures should result in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall reduction in the total period of time involved in reviewing nonbanking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals, and in a reduction in the paperwork burden associated with proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to engage in nonbanking activities. Comment is invited on all aspects of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Procedure Under Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To implement these statutory changes, the Board proposes to amend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation Y to replace the application procedures for obtaining approval to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engage in nonbanking activities with a notice procedure. The interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplates action by the Reserve Bank on nonbanking proposals involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed activities within 30 days after a notice containing all of the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in the rule has been received by the Reserve Bank, in cases that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for Reserve Bank action, and within 60 days of that date in cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving any previously approved activity that are subject to Board action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the rule also indicates that the Board will seek to act on notices involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new activities within 60 days of receipt of the notice by the Reserve Bank,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals that involve activities that have not been previously approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board often require substantial information and may continue to require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater processing period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule specifies the different types of information required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals to engage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de novo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in listed activities, proposals to acquire a company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in listed activities, and proposals to engage in activities not previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by regulation (``unlisted activities'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Listed Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule contemplates that proposals to engage  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de novo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquire a company engaged in a listed activity will be approved within 30 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the original date of filing of the notice, even if additional information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently requested by the Reserve Bank or the Board. Upon receipt of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to engage in or to acquire a company engaged in a listed activity (or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity previously approved by order), the Reserve Bank shall immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the Board, and the Board will publish notice of the proposal in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inviting public comment for a period of 15 days. Within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar days after receipt by the Reserve Bank of a notice filed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule, the Reserve Bank must approve the notice, extend the notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for 15 calendar days, or refer the notice to the Board for decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because a substantive comment on the proposal has been received or action on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice by the Reserve Bank is not appropriate. The Reserve Bank also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, return the notice if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informationally incomplete. Under the interim rule, the return of a notice by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reserve Bank under such circumstances is deemed action on the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Unlisted Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As is the practice under the current rules, proposals to engage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities not previously approved by the Board by regulation or order will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by the Board in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  within 10 business days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptance by the Reserve Bank, unless the Board determines to extend this 10- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day period for an additional 30 days. Public notice of proposals to engage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such new activities shall invite comment for a period of generally 30 days, or if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board determines that the notificant has not adequately demonstrated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereto, the Board may return the notice and explain the reasons for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule provides that the Board will attempt to act on all cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred for Board action within 60 days of the date the notice is received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Reserve Bank. As noted above, proposals that involve new activities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been previously approved by the Board are likely to require a greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing period. In the event the Board does not act on the notice within 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of receipt by the Reserve Bank, the Board will notify the bank holding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company, and explain the reasons for needing additional time as well as provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an anticipated date by which the Board expects to act on the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Elimination of Pre-Acceptance Review Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the interim rule eliminates the pre-acceptance review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure currently contained in Regulation Y for proposals to engage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonbanking activities. This procedure established a defined period of up to 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days during which an applicant and the Reserve Bank could identify and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address significant issues prior to the filing of a final application. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure has been particularly beneficial to the processing of complex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals and applications to engage in activities not previously approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board by regulation or order, where information requests often must be tailored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the specific proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the elimination of pre-acceptance procedures should shorten the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review process, the Board recognizes the utility of a pre-acceptance procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and anticipates that there will be certain proposals that could benefit from some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form of pre-acceptance review. The Board invites comments as to whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some form of pre-notice review procedure should be reinstated in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation Y currently provides that (with the exception of proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed under the abbreviated procedure for small acquisitions) all proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to engage in previously approved nonbanking activities must be published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and provide for a public comment period of not more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days. Under the interim rule, the public comment period has been shortened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 30 days to 15 days for proposals to engage in activities previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by the Board by regulation or order. The interim rule also provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Reserve Bank may not act on a notice before the fifth business day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the close of the public comment period unless an emergency exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring expedited or immediate action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 346 authorizes the Board to prescribe shorter notice periods by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation for particular activities or transactions. The Board invites comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on whether further shortening of the comment period is appropriate, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for notices to engage in activities previously approved by the Board. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, the Board requests comment on a proposal to reduce the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period to 5 calendar days for proposals that involve listed activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or activities that have been previously approved by Board order. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would enable the Reserve Banks to act on proposals that raise no substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues well within the 30-day target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

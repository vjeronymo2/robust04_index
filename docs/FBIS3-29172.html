			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko on Saturday [12 February] visited two monuments  to the war dead on Iwo Jima Island, site of one of the fiercest  Pacific battles during World War II, and where 20,000 Japanese  soldiers and 7,000 U.S. soldiers were killed.    They laid flowers and bowed in front of one of the  monuments,  where they met former island residents who were forced to leave  during the war and representatives of bereaved families of the  former Imperial Japanese Army.    Then they paid their respects at another monument built by  the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.    The imperial couple had flown to Iwo Jima earlier in the  day,  to start a three-day visit to the Ogasawara Islands, to  commemorate the 25th anniversary of the islands' return to Japan  by the United States.    They arrived at the Self-Defense Forces' air station on the  island, which is the only airfield available in the Ogasawara  chain.    In the evening the emperor and the empress continued their  trip aboard an aircraft carrier to Chichijima, the main island  of the Ogasawara chain, where they will stay overnight.    On Sunday they will take a helicopter to neighboring  Hahajima  Island to attend a judo performance by local residents.    Following another stopover at Chichijima Island and meetings  with islanders, the couple will return to Tokyo on Monday  evening.    It is the couple's first trip to the islands in the western  Pacific some 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo and follows their  historic visit to Okinawa last April to pay respects to Japanese  soldiers and civilians killed there during World War II.    The use of more than 20 Self-Defense Force planes, 10  warships and 2,000 troops for their trip, however, has drawn  criticism from civic groups.    The Ogasawara islands, which the U.S. calls the Bonin  Islands, were taken by the U.S. toward the end of World War II  and were returned to Japan in 1968.</p>

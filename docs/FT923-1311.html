			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Pohl backs union of strong currencies THE former Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has come out in favour of abandoning the Maastricht Treaty idea of currency union and instead creating a union of Europe's strong currencies, Reuter reports from Zurich. 'Those countries which are willing and able to establish a currency union with a common central bank and single currency should do so, not in 1997 or 1999 (as in the Maastricht Treaty) but in the near future,' he told the Swiss weekly Weltwoche. He said such a system - unlike the EC's monetary system - would no longer be dominated by the Bundesbank but held together by a strong, common central bank. Asked if this did not amount to a so-called 'two-speed Europe', Mr Pohl said this already existed. He said Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands were already in a position to form a currency union, and added that Austria and Switzerland, both outside the European Community but with strong currencies and political stability, could also join. Mr Pohl said recent upheavals, in which the pound, lira and peseta have left the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) or been devalued, and the French franc come under pressure, had strengthened the idea of a single European central bank. A continuation of the current D-Mark-led ERM would become more and more difficult as other countries' readiness to follow the Bundesbank waned after the turmoil of the last week. He said the treaty on currency union should be abandoned 'since it is too ambitious, contains many discrepancies, and can't be implemented anyway since the Danes' No (in a referendum)'.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WVU MAY TAKE GATOR BOWL BERTH  </P> <P> West Virginia University will play in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., on  Dec. 30, with Clemson as the Mountaineers' likely opponent, a newspaper  reported today.  </P> <P> The Times-West Virginian of Fairmont, quoting "reliable sources," said WVU  (7-2-1) wanted to play in the Hall of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's  Day but went with the Gator Bowl when the Hall of Fame wouldn't commit.  </P> <P> West Virginia Athletic Director Ed Pastilong told the paper he could neither  confirm nor deny the report.  </P> <P> "We haven't locked anything up yet," said Gator Bowl President Charles Hughes.  "West Virginia is certainly high on our list. So are Penn State and a Big 10  team."  </P> <P> However, "I think something along those lines (a West Virginia-Clemson game)  could happen," Gator Bowl Executive Director John Bell told the Florida  Times-Union in Jacksonville.  </P></p>

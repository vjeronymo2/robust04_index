			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Elektra - Opera at the New York Met Strauss's Elektra is the last new production of the Met season. Like Tannhauser, the Ring, and Parsifal, it is produced by Otto Schenk and conducted by James Levine. It is designed by Jurgen Rose, who did the Salome not long ago. Rose is a designer adept in many manners. Here he has provided a monochrome roofed courtyard, spanning the Met's width and height, where light shafts in from a tall slot in the right wall and is otherwise supplied by follow-spots switched on to each principal as she or he enters. Dramatic light is an operatic element to which the Met, wedded to its house man, Gil Wechsler, accords little attention. Steps rise steeply to a giant double door in the palace facade, which gives on to a diagonal inner staircase. Mycenae has evidently been shaken by an earthquake: although the main walls stand square, the steps and a terrace to the right of them are out of true, and the left side is filled with a huge, shattered bronze of a horse, lying on its side. This horse serves as a symbol of Agamemnon; Electra addresses it often, spreadeagles Chrysothemis across it while exhorting her, scrabbles for the axe within it, and caresses a fetlock while remembering her father. For the rest, Schenk's production is as conventional and drab as his Ring: individual singers have to light it. Hildegard Behrens, in the title role, did so. When she began, there was so heavy a beat in her voice and so strenuous a shift between registers that one feared she might not last out the evening. But she did. Sheer will, feeling, instinct, fire impelled a strong voice shattered by years of strain into a thrilling performance. She was still able to pull out shining high notes, telling chest tones, an eloquent middle. And she felt and made much of every phrase of the role. In a little black dress (Chanel would have been proud), she looked tall, slender, and young - exciting. There was not much else to admire. Deborah Voigt, the Chrysothemis, was a heavily draped mountainous pudding, her main merit an ability to scream out high notes shiningly on pitch, excellently audible above Levine's loud orchestra. Leonie Rysanek, on the other hand, effortfully banged out Clytemnestra's music, hammily, on pitches so approximate that they were embarrassing. Bernd Weikl, a portly Orestes, stood and delivered, and managed by his physical ineptitude to kill the excitement that Miss Behrens - alive, alert, climactic, responsive to the score - was striving to creating at the Electra-Orestes encounter. James King was a dull, routine Aegistheus. But by the first-night audience the show was cheered to the skies. It is hard to know what Levine, the artistic head of the Met, really wants. A cheering (if undiscriminating) public? He got that. A spin-off recording and video? They are presumably in the works. Orchestral playing of uncommon excellence and beauty? He got that too, and the orchestral sound was the main reward of the evening - whenever one removed attention from the stage (where, as Wagner insisted, operas happen) and listened with averted eyes. But if one then listened to the whole score - voices and players at once - Levine seemed to be an undramatic, untheatrical, unoperatic conductor: unresponsive to his particular cast as he encouraged his brasses to blare and his drums to crash and drown them; sluggish in his self-indulgent, loving enactment of Strauss's score; vulgar in his stressing of the obvious. He is a puzzle. His Met is a puzzle. One does not hear operas better played than they are when he conducts them. But oh] How dreary, how pointless, how dated, how unimportant to New York life throbbing all around this all-star Elektra - apart from the telling, electric Miss Behrens - did seem.</p>

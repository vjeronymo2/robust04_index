			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Senate took a very important step in today's  session by approving the protocol by which Mexico joins the  OECD. In order to join the OECD, which includes the world's  most developed nations, Mexico will no longer be in the  so-called Group of 100, in other words the Nonaligned Movement,  in which Mexico participated as an observer. Mexico is no  longer in that group.    Senator Porfirio Munoz Ledo participated in today's debates.  Of course, he was not very pleased and said that Mexico is now  a poor country within an organization of rich nations.    [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We have resigned what, on many  occasions, has been described as leadership, which in fact was  Mexico's recognized historical moral authority over developing  nations to become the poor relatives of an organization with  which we have no historical links. I will not mention the case  of Turkey, out of our respect and friendship toward that  sovereign nation. [end recording]    Munoz Ledo stressed that Mexico's withdrawal from the  Nonaligned Movement at this time will be very costly.    Senator Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the  Finance  Commission, reacted to Munoz Ledo's statement. He described  Munoz Ledo as an archaic politician who has remained in the  seventies and who never sees anything positive when the country  takes a step forward. He said that by entering the group of  developed nations, Mexico seeks to be in a better position for  international competition.    [Begin Rodriguez y Rodriguez recording] I did not hear any  good arguments from him. I only heard miserable and pathetic  expressions. Although his words may have some impact, I want to  hear arguments. I would like to say that I am afraid that as in  the case of the legendary Rip van Winkle, the opposition senator  has remained in the past, he has remained in the decade of the  seventies. He moved into the eighties with some difficulty  because his personal participation was necessary, but the truth  is that he continues talking about a world and an economy....  [pauses] first he talks about the postwar period and then about  [word indistinct]. The reconstruction of Europe is way back in  history. [end recording]    Senator Rodriguez y Rodriguez said Mexico's entrance into  the  OECD is a fundamental step toward achieving the development for  which we are striving.</p>

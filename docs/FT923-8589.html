			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Forte Ever more insistent talk of boardroom changes at the Forte is doing little to restore confidence in the company's share price. Admittedly, yesterday's fall took the shares a mere 1p lower to 138p but they have still underperformed the market by 35 per cent since the start of the year. Part of the problem is continuing uncertainty about the outcome of Forte's boardroom review. Equally important are the fundamental problems facing the company. They will not go away just with the addition of a few fresh and younger faces to the board. Not only is the UK hotel business deeply still blighted by the recession. The weak dollar is hardly designed to help boost the spend by US tourists. The company appears to lack strategic direction after coming so close and then failing to sell its contract catering business at what would have been by all accounts an attractive price. For the second year running the dividend is likely to be uncovered. To be sure, Forte is operating on a broadly cash neutral basis, even allowing for a maintained dividend and some Pounds 150m of capital expenditure this year. But its decision to postpone the rebranding of its US Travelodge hotels shows the purse strings are having to be held tight when it would make sense to be spending on expansion in Europe. Assuming the company can manage a modest increase in profits this year it is trading on a forward multiple in the high teens, which is roughly twice that of Queens Moat. The shares are still expensive, however respectable the name.</p>

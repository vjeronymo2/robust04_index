			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Barzani's Party Denies Negotiation </F> with Baghdad"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The unified Kurdistan  Democratic Party [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, has affirmed that  it "has no intention of holding secret negotiations with  Baghdad. If it became convinced that negotiations would serve  the interests and aims of our people then it would hold  negotiations openly as it had done in the negotiations with  successive Iraqi governments." It emphasized that it "saw no  point in negotiating with the regime."    A statement by the KDP's spokesman, which AL-HAYAH received  yesterday, said that the report published by AL-HAYAH on Tuesday  under the headline "Barzani resumed negotiations with Baghdad"  was "unfounded" and that the report was "leaked for selfish  partisan and political purposes by a party to the recent  dispute" in Iraqi Kurdistan "with the aim of casting doubt on  the KDP's position in the Iraqi opposition."    The statement added: "That is confirmed by the fact that the  KDP has obtained a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] secret  internal bulletin number 24, dated 19 June 1994, containing the  same information published in AL-HAYAH's report. That source  was the only source, referred to as reliable Kurdish Iraqi  sources. We do not believe that such practices would help the  current peace process and reconciliation in Iraqi Kurdistan  following the containment of the destructive crisis.    "To clarify the truth we also say that the members of the  KDP's alleged delegation which was supposed to include Yunis  Ruzbayani and 'Izzat Sulayman Bik and to have visited Baghdad on  11 and 12 June, actually never left the Kurdish area at all in  that period. In addition to being a member of the Central  Committee, Ruzbayani is also the interior minister in the  regional government and he was in his office in Irbil during  that period as many employees can testify. As for 'Izzat  Sulayman, he was grieved when his son Aram was killed in the  recent fighting, and he never left the area in that period  because of the tragedy and the condolences procedures. No other  official went to Baghdad. The unified KDP has no intention of  holding secret negotiations with Baghdad. If it became  convinced that negotiations would serve the interests and aims  of our people then it would hold them openly as it has done with  successive Iraqi governments, but the party sees no point in  negotiation with the regime and it is committed to the policy  and objectives of the Unified Iraqi National Congress, which  are: promoting a democratic alternative and fulfilling the  Kurdish people's aspiration to a federation within a peaceful,  united, and democratic Iraq."</p>

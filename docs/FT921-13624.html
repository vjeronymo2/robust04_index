			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EC in push to revive Gulf free trade talks THE EC will today propose to the six states of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) a speedier phasing-out of import duties on the latter's petrochemical products, in a move to revive talks for eventual free trade between the two blocs, David Buchan reports from Brussels. In the run-up to last year's Gulf war, the GCC states, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the UAE, rejected proposals by the EC, which suggested phasing out its import tariffs on Gulf petrochemical products over 16 years. Spurred by the need to help rebuild Gulf economies, especially Kuwait's, after the Gulf war, EC governments last autumn decided to risk the wrath of their own petrochemical lobbies by softening the Community's terms. The package, which European Commission negotiators will today present to their GCC counterparts, would do away with the last curbs on petrochemical imports from the Gulf within 12 years. But no definitive end to the talks is expected this week. Some 95 per cent of GCC exports to the EC, totalling Ecu 11.87bn (Pounds 8.4bn) in 1990, enter the EC free, because crude oil and refined products carry no duty. But the rest, mainly petrochemicals, bear import duties of 6-13 per cent.</p>

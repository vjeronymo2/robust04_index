			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Samsung in pact with Goldstar SAMSUNG and Goldstar, the South Korean conglomerates, will co-operate in acquiring foreign technology for liquid crystal displays (LCDs). It is the first time that two South Korean competitors have agreed to share technology in a cross-licensing agreement. About 8,000 patents are involved, including those for Braun colour television tubes. The government hopes the pact between Samsung Electron Devices and Goldstar will pave the way for agreements among Korean companies in cars, machinery and aerospace. Officials have said the lack of co-operation among Korean concerns has hindered the country's efforts to develop high-technology industries. Previous attempts to share semiconductor technology have failed, leading to unnecessary duplication. Both Samsung and Goldstar believe LCDs will be one of key electronic technologies of the 1990s. They hope to rival the Japanese, repeating their success in challenging Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. Some analysts doubt that the two companies could afford to develop LCD technology while also spending large sums on the development and production of semiconductors. The cross-licensing agreement will ease this problem.</p>

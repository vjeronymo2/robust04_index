			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Woman in the News: Exception to the rule - The Queen Monarchy becomes Elizabeth Windsor. She does the job well. She has outgrown the natural disadvantages of one who never went to school, never learned to mix as an equal with others of her own age, and, initially at least, had little more than formal contact with persons outside the narrow penumbra that surrounds the royal family. Five years into her reign, when she was still an apprentice, her speeches were described by the erstwhile Lord Altrincham (now John Grigg) as prim little sermons; her style of speaking, he wrote in 1957, was a 'pain in the neck'. The words that were being put into her mouth were appropriate to 'a priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a recent candidate for confirmation.' Mr Grigg's comments caused a furore at the time. An elderly crank hit him. An Italian monarchist challenged him to a duel. Today that long-forgotten text should serve the Queen well. The contrast between then and now is to her advantage. She was a nervous young woman. Her voice and manner were stilted. Her public demeanour was heavy with responsibility. But 35 years later she is a mature sovereign, a mother who has suffered as would any other from the sight of the marital difficulties afflicting her children, a matron with a long memory and a definite sense of humour. Her 40 years' experience of public life prepared her for the moment when she was obliged to come clean, which she did in her celebrated 'annus horribilis' speech on Tuesday. Yes, she intimated, she did hate it when her family was pilloried by the media. True, she hinted, it was indeed unpleasant to be attacked for not paying taxes, or for being so wealthy that she should have contributed to the cost of rebuilding the burned-out segment of Windsor Castle. She was appealing for sympathy but her heartfelt remarks, delivered in the husky tones brought on by a cold, did not reduce the tabloids to quivering respect. Those years are gone. Do not blame the messengers: they largely reflect the sentiments of their readers. In 1952 the young Elizabeth inherited not only the throne but also the affection in which the nation had held her father. During the war, class distinctions were forgotten. By his sharing of their experiences King George VI had won the undiluted allegiance of the British people. Unexpectedly, he died aged 56. The then Princess Elizabeth was 26. Not yet ready for coronation, she became Queen-Empress; her reach stretched around the globe. Today the Commonwealth means more to its titular head than it does to most of her subjects. In Britain the monarchy is fondly regarded as a mildly decaying domestic institution. As such, it is the subject of cartoons, TV lampoons, commonplace jesting, and, on occasion, the nastier manifestations of envy. How it is viewed by people in the former colonies, some of which have discarded it, is a matter of little concern back home. Among the generality of the Queen's British subjects deference is an outdated notion, although there is still a tendency to fawn when politicians, or business-folk, or other distinguished persons are invited to the palace. Those who seek honour, or recognition, are positively enthralled by contact with any royal. The Queen is accustomed to obsequiousness. It is, to her, a natural part of her life. Yet she shows every sign of enjoying her job, which she takes seriously. She is proud of remembering many of the names, and recognising many of the faces, of those of her guests she greets personally. She likes being flattered, and bowed and curtsied to, and treated as the pivot of the constitution by a succession of prime ministers, some of whom have sought to out-Disraeli Disraeli, the Victorian prime minister who wooed his Queen. She has a strong sense of royal vocation. When there is a matter of state the TV cameras confirm that her dignity and composure are exemplary. Her highest duty, as she sees it, is to preserve the monarchy. She had previously taken advice on how to maintain the affection of the people; this led to two intimate TV portraits of her family of which the later, a close-up of the Queen herself, was surely the more appealing. She came across as a race-horse owner, a countrywoman, a professional monarch with a twinkle in her eye. But in mid-slump, and with tabloid scandals appearing every day, that was not good enough. There is no widespread demand for a republic, but the feeling that people want a less extravagant, less patronising, less privileged monarchy is palpable. The almost universal reaction to the Windsor Castle fire last weekend convinced both the government and the palace that slowly-gestating plans for the Queen to subject herself to taxation had to be brought forward immediately. She was ready to be so persuaded by Mr John Major. The torrent of criticism should now abate, at least for a while. The history of the monarchy is one of survival by adapting to the pressures of the time. The events of this week - the Royal cry for help and the Royal decision on taxation - are fully consonant with that history. Yet the adaptations the Queen has been obliged to make since 1952 have all served to diminish the importance, if not the stature, of the institution she personifies. As the significance of the Commonwealth has shrunk, so has that of the Crown. As Britain has moved to middle-ranking status, so has its head of state. As the costs of maintaining a rumbustious extended family have risen, so the esteem in which the enterprise has been held has dwindled. During the fifth decade of her reign there may be further changes. The European Community accommodates monarchies, but the complexities of membership put into question Britain's highly centralised, unwritten constitution. Celtic demands for self government may again become vocal. The Conservatives seem set to hold office indefinitely; single-party government, exercised in the name of the Crown, cannot be good for democracy. While Queen Elizabeth is on her throne she will continue to be the British constitution made flesh. Her successor may be a mere boy on a bicycle.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa will stress his commitment to continued political,  economic and administrative reform in a speech to be delivered  at Georgetown University in Washington next week, government  sources said Wednesday [2 February]. The sources said Hosokawa  will make a commitment to continuing the process of change now  that his administration has successfully tackled its top  priority task, with the passage of political reform bills  through the Diet.    Hosokawa leaves for Washington on February 10 for talks with  U.S. President Bill Clinton the following day.    The sources said he will also call for a strengthening of  the  Japan-U.S. relationship, underlining the two countries' vital  roles in the world economy and in ensuring peace and stability  in the Asia-Pacific region.    Hosokawa will deliver a 15-minute speech in English just as  he did last September at the U.N. General Assembly session, the  sources said. As his audience will consist mainly of university  students, Hosokawa will open the floor to questions after his  speech.    He will emphasize his efforts to achieve domestic political  reform because it is a precondition for meeting the widespread  expectations that Japan make greater international  contributions. The prime minister will stress his intention to  further promote deregulation, take into account the interests of  consumers and establish a system whereby policy decision-making  is more transparent.    Hosokawa is also scheduled to make a television appearance,  when he will have the opportunity to address the American public  directly.</p>

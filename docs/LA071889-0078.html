			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL PLAY TO BE BASIS FOR LOTTERY;  </P> <P> OREGON APPROVES CONTEST DECIDED BY POINT SPREADS  </P> <P> The Oregon Lottery Commission approved rules Monday for a new game that makes  Oregon the only state with a lottery contest based on National Football League  point spreads.  </P> <P> The commission, on a 5-0 vote, endorsed the game despite the objections of an  NFL attorney, who said the action would harm the integrity of professional  football. No further approval is needed for the lottery, and ticket sales are  to begin Sept. 6 for the NFL's first week of games on Sept. 10.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the game, called Sports Action, are to go to Oregon college and  university intercollegiate sports programs, which currently do not receive  state funding.  </P> <P> The 1989 Oregon Legislature approved a bill calling on the Lottery Commission  to create a sports-oriented game to generate money for college sports. Oregon  Lottery director Jim Davey and the lottery staff put together the specifics of  the NFL contest.  </P> <P> Davey estimates the game will generate between $4 million and $9 million each  year for Oregon intercollegiate sports.  </P> <P> Athletic directors at Oregon and Oregon State say state aid is essential if the  schools are to remain in the Pacific 10 Conference.  </P> <P> In the football lottery, a $1 investment will allow players to predict the  outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games against the point spreads set  by Nevada oddsmakers.  </P> <P> Under rules of the game, players will try to predict the outcome of four to 14  games against the point spreads. The more games they bet, the more money they  could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about $8,000 for a  perfect 14-game card.  </P> <P> NFL attorney Jim Noel told the commission the game would create a situation in  which fans are more interested in point spreads than how their favorite teams  fare.  </P> <P> Noel said the league is concerned that Oregon "is on the brink of triggering a  nationwide trend."  </P> <P> "The entire nation is watching," he said. "Lottery officials in other states  have stated publicly that if Oregon does this successfully, they will try it,  too."  </P> <P> Noel also said the NFL would consider legal action to block the contest.  </P> <P> "We didn't come out here to threaten anyone," he said. "There are some very  viable legal issues here that we're going to evaluate."  </P> <P> The NFL took Delaware to court when that state tried a football betting game,  but the lawsuit became moot after Delaware gave up its game after one season in  1974 because it lost money.  </P> <P> In approving the new game, Lottery Commission members noted that betting on  professional sports already is widespread in Oregon and around the country.  </P> <P> They said many people take part in office football pools or bet on games  through bookmakers, either illegally or through operations in Nevada, the only  state that allows gambling on team sports.  </P> <P> "All you have to do in Oregon is pick up a phone and place a bet," Davey said.  "People do it every day."  </P> <P> Commission member Mike Schwartz of Eugene said he thinks the NFL should embrace  the idea as an opportunity to market professional football to new audiences.  </P> <P> "It will make people more excited about NFL football," Schwartz said.  </P> <P> Noel rejected that argument, and said the NFL does not want to see an expansion  of gambling on professional sports.  </P> <P> "The net effect of the Oregon Lottery game will be to increase the overall  volume of betting on NFL football," he said.  </P> <P> Lottery officials have said the game could later be expanded to include  National Basketball Assn. games.  </P> <P> In his appearance before the commission, Noel read statements from the NBA and  Major League baseball saying they oppose the football lottery on the same  grounds as the NFL.  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Criticism between Polly Peck administrators TWO administrators of Polly Peck International have publicly distanced themselves from the third, in the latest twist in the story of Mr Asil Nadir's electronics, fruit and leisure company which collapsed in 1990 with debts of Pounds 1.35bn. But criticism of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross by his fellow insolvency practitioners, Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Ly-brand Deloitte and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully appears to have been intended to placate Turkish Cypriot sensitivities in the hope of eventually unlocking Polly Peck records and funds in Cyprus. At a press conference on Thursday in northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot journalists were handed a press release prepared by leading counsel in which Mr Stone and Mr Jordan said a recent unsuccessful action by Mr Morris in the High Court in London against the Turkish Cypriot central bank was his sole responsibility, and statements and allegations by Mr Morris should not be attributed to them. They said they particularly regretted the fact that Mr Morris, in his affidavit to the High Court, had described the Turkish army's intervention in Cyprus in 1974, which led to the division of the island, as an invasion. The three administrators and the committee of Polly Peck creditors approved the contents of the statement earlier this week. In London, Mr Morris denied he was offended by the remarks, saying: 'There is no rift between the administrators. Everybody agrees that this is the right way forward.' The Turkish Cypriots are still furious at court action by Mr Morris which secured a freezing order against the central bank on Pounds 38.9m in November, overturned in the appeal court in London. The Turkish Cypriots are poised to launch a counter-suit for damages. Along with their comments on Mr Morris, the two administrators said they had regained control of two Polly Peck hotels in northern Cyprus, Jasmine Court and Palm Beach, and had appointed Execumaster Hotels, an international hotel management group, to run them. There were scuffles when the senior staff of the two hotels were asked to leave.</p>

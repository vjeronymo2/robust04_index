			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / World News in Brief: Princess of Wales to cut down duties The Princess of Wales said she was all but quitting public life by drastically scaling down her number of official duties. She made the announcement at a charity lunch (left) in London, asking to be given 'time and space' and laying the blame for the decision partly at the door of the media. She will retain links with units of the armed services and a small number of charities.</p>

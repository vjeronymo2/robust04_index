Only 10 percent of the German people believe that the CDU/CSU  "is working hardest to ensure our safety from crime." This is  the result of a representative poll conducted by the Allensbach  Opinion Research Institute in November 1993. Ten years ago, 71  percent of those polled affirmed that the CDU/CSU was taking  care to effectively combating crime. In its history, the  CDU/CSU has not had to accept a more massive loss in trust --  and that in a key policly area.    However, the people also attest to the failure of the other  parties. Only 5 percent cite the Social Democratic Party of  Germany as the party that is doing most against crime, 1 percent  the Free Democratic Party of Germany, 1 percent Alliance  90/Greens, and 3 percent the Republikaner. The comment by the  Allensbach institute: "The fact that 80 percent answer this  question with `no party' or do not have an answer is an  extremely alarming sign." Furthermore, the opinion research  institute has discovered that the Germans' fear of crime  increasing further has become one of the people's main worries.  In the west of the republic, 49 percent of people are afraid  "that crime is going to increase in Germany;" in eastern Germany  this is felt by as many as 65 percent. A total of 44 percent  feel threatened by crime in their everyday life. One in four  said they had been a victim of robbery during the past three  years.    Asked about the most important reasons for increased crime,  38 percent of those polled by the Allensbach Institute cite  unemployment; 24 percent point to "wrong education," 22 percent  to the "crisis in values and meaning," 14 percent to foreigners,  13 percent each to the welfare and leisure-time society as well  as to the media, and 12 percent to politics.    The people's demands for large-scale measures to restore  public order are clear: 76 percent interviewed by the Allensbach  Institute called for better equipment for the police, 69 percent  want the police to be given more rights and potential in their  work, and 59 percent demand stricter laws. Currently, 31  percent even think that the death penalty should be reintroduced  in Germany. A total of 48 percent of citizens think that  stricter education of children and adolescents is necessary.    Against the background of steadily rising crime, the  Allensbach Institute comes to the conclusion: "There are no  indications that the latest measurement...describes the climax.  The signs of anxiety among the people point to a storm...."</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic shares dip 25% Shares in Scantronic Holdings fell 25 per cent yesterday after the security components manufacturer and distributor announced a deeply-discounted share offer to stave off substantial cash flow difficulties. The shares closed 6 1/2 p lower at 20p after the company announced the Pounds 1.6m share offer, which accompanied a statement that it would incur a loss for the first half of the current year. The open offer of 16.1m new shares is being launched at 10p a share, and was required before Barclays, its bankers, would extend further loans to tide the company over the peak manufacturing period. It is understood that the company may have breached existing banking covenants. Scantronic, whose shares have fallen from a 1994 high of 89p, has been saddled with increasing debt from acquisitions, and had Pounds 11.2m debt at the end of June, up from Pounds 3.5m in March 1993. Profits have been hampered by legal actions related to some of the acquisitions. In addition, sales have been hit by recession in Europe, and UK profits faltered during April and May. However, the company is confident that after taking a number of one-off costs in the first half of the year, it would 'see a steady return to normal trading,' and reap the benefits from substantial investment in new products. The company also announ-ced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 1.27m) for the year to March 31. This compared with a statement on July 25 that it would make profits of at least Pounds 2.75m. However, the difference was accounted for by a change in accounting policy, under which research and development costs are no longer capitalised. Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 50.2m, but the core UK manufacturing business saw operating profits fall from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 2.59m, primarily due to lower sales to Europe. UK sales, however, continued to rise. In the first half of next year, the company will take on substantial costs related to its financial reorganisation - it incurred a Pounds 240,000 deficit from the sale of Gardiner Group loan stock to meet financing requirements - which will result in a loss. The company has replaced the finance director following its latest difficulties, and may face compensation claims, which could further affect profits. The final dividend is passed - the 0.843p interim compares with a previous 3.121p total. Losses per share were 0.46p (0.88p).</p>

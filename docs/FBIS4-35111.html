			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy met with National  Encounter Alliance, AEN, leader Guillermo Caballero Vargas this  morning in a move to obtain the support of his party in Congress  for its privatization program--given the lack of endorsement  from his own party.    Caballero Vargas underlined: "There is no marked difference  between the three (economic) projects that were publicly  expounded during the campaign leading to the 9 May elections.  There may be slight differences, mainly in the procedures  involved in the privatization scheme, but the three all agree on  the need to privatize government-owned enterprises."    The meeting was held at the presidential residence at 0700  local time and lasted approximately two hours. It was convened  by President Wasmosy.    Milciades Rafael Casabianca, AEN bloc leader in the Senate,  also attended this meeting.    Commenting on the purpose of this meeting, Caballero Vargas  noted that "there are obvious disagreements" between the  executive branch and the Colorado Party about privatization.    Asked if Wasmosy was trying to curry favor with the  opposition as he lacks the support of the Colorado Party for his  economic program, Caballero Vargas replied: "This is the  impression we all have. If we have that impression, the  president must certainly have it."    He continued: "I think the opposition has a more coherent  stance on this issue. The president believes he will find more  support on the opposition benches than on the Colorado Party  benches."    Caballero Vargas added that differences will be reflected on  very specific subjects, but "we must achieve consensus and  compromise, especially regarding the preference the Constitution  grants workers in privatizations."    He stated that direct dialogue like the one proposed by  Wasmosy is the best way to analyze subjects like this, "since it  seeks to iron out difficulties and prevent misunderstandings."    Wasmosy and Caballero Vargas also broached the subject of  financing this year's harvest and the inflow of foreign exchange  even though, according to the AEN leader, these were not the  main points of their discussion.    Wasmosy convened this meeting to sound out the opposition on  the implementation of his privatizations program and to obtain  its support in Congress.    Caballero Vargas said the problem of how to finance farmers  was mentioned "only in passing" during the meeting. He added  that another subject raised was the noteworthy entry of foreign  exchange.    He said: "Those of us who believe we know something about  our  country's economy are dumbfounded by this phenomenon," adding:  "Paraguay's economic variables are under control. Yet, as I told  the president, the miracle does not lie in the stabilization of  macroeconomic variables, inflation, exchange rates, etc. The  miracle lies in controlling inflation with an exchange rate  policy that enables the country to be competitive and, above  all, with interest rates that help to achieve development."    Caballero Vargas observed that there is economic stability  in  Paraguay, but "at this rate the whole productive apparatus will  go bankrupt.    Much has been done, but the test of these achievements is to  be found in interest rates, which must be considerably reduced."    Although it is not known if anything concrete resulted from  this meeting, Wasmosy's objective in convening this meeting is  to prop up his economic program with the help of the opposition  since it lacks the support of the Colorado Party.    This is evinced in remarks by Vice President Angel Roberto  Seifart and Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero,  who voiced their reluctance to undertake the massive  privatization of government-owned enterprises.    Opposition to the privatizations has a mainly political tone  because the Colorado Party draws a considerable number of votes  from government-owned enterprises.</p>

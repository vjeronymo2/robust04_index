			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Beilin by </F> Alberto Stabile in Jerusalem; date not given: "Israel and PLO  Sign" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- The historic agreement to introduce  Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will at last be signed  in Cairo tomorrow. [passage omitted]    Now that an Israeli-PLO agreement can be taken for granted,  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has been concerned over the  past two days with the negotiations between Israel and Syria --  perhaps the most difficult in the peace process -- in an attempt  to shift the two antagonists, Rabin and al-'Asad, from the  stances to which they have clung stubbornly for months. And he  seems to have succeeded. Irrespective of the official comments  and the needling, negotiations between Israel and Syria have  entered a new, "more substantive," phase, as the secretary of  state put it. Sunday [1 May] Christopher conveyed to Damascus  the proposal for an agreement put forward by Rabin -- a  withdrawal from Golan in three stages, the immediate return of  three of the five Druze villages, security measures, and the  immediate opening of diplomatic missions. The official response  was a refusal. "Syria is opposed to an Israeli withdrawal in  stages," al-'Asad's spokesman said. And Foreign Minister  al-Shar' went further by describing the Israeli offer as  "stupid." In fact al-'Asad entrusted Christopher with his  counterproposal, which includes a number of "substantive"  points. The "al-'Asad Plan" has been received with "great  interest" by Foreign Minister Peres, according to whom, "the  efforts to achieve peace between Israel and Syria are in  earnest."    "I think that our proposals mark the start of a new phase in  negotiations with Syria," Yossi Beilin said in his office at the  Foreign Ministry. Of Israel's young politicians, he has had,  and still has, the most important role in the complex  negotiations of the peace process, partly thanks to his  proximity to Shim'on Peres. [passage omitted]    [Stabile] Mr. Beilin, tomorrow the agreement on Gaza and  Jericho will be signed. What will happen after that?    [Beilin] We have several different alternatives. We hoped  that the Palestinians would complete their election process in  July so as to establish their Council and immediately start  discussing the extension of autonomy to the whole of the West  Bank. But if, as it seems, there are no elections in July, and  more time is needed, then we will negotiate the transfer of  powers only in some fields -- health, education, welfare, and so  forth. Be that as it may, from Wednesday [4 May] we will start  counting the five years of the transition phase. And we will be  able to start right away to negotiate a permanent solution,  without necessarily awaiting the end of the second year.    [Stabile] Do you not think that you are moving rather too  fast? The Palestinians do not seem to be at all ready to take  over power in Gaza and Jericho.    [Beilin] I have read some newspaper accounts in this regard.  I suggest that we should not be paternalistic and tell them what  they should do. They are at a delicate stage in their history.  They have to create all their institutions from scratch. We  must understand them and be patient, as long as our security and  our interests are not placed in jeopardy. I hope that the PLO  and the Palestinian police are capable of preventing terrorism.  This will be the real test of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho.    [Stabile] What do you expect?    [Beilin] If terrorism becomes less intense, it will be the  agreement's greatest success.    [Stabile] Otherwise?    [Beilin] Otherwise we will be forced to reconsider  everything.    [Stabile] Chief of Staff Barak has said that Hamas and the  PLO have the same final objectives. Do you think that it is  possible that Israel could some day conduct a dialogue with  Hamas?    [Beilin] We must not exclude anyone a priori. If they are  prepared to recognize Israel, of course we will not exclude them  merely because they call themselves "Hamas." I would point out  that for many years the PLO was our worst enemy. But once they  changed their minds and put an end to terrorism, we were willing  to talk. I am sure that their dreams are the same. But I am  interested not in what they dream at night, but in what they do  during the day. And as things stand, there are major differences  between Hamas and the PLO.    [Stabile] How would you regard an involvement by Hamas in  the Palestinian elections?    [Beilin] If Hamas renounces terrorism and takes part in the  elections, we will not oppose it. On the contrary, we would  regard it as a positive sign, because it would mean that they  have accepted the peace process. But unless it abandons  terrorism, we cannot tolerate Hamas' involvement in the election  campaign.    [Stabile] Are you not afraid of the settlers' reaction to  the  agreement?    [Beilin] I do not think that this opposition will jeopardize  the country's stability. Few political leaders now could argue  that we should remain in Gaza. On the contrary, there are  thousands of Israeli mothers who will be happy that we are  leaving.    [Stabile] Will the opposition be sharper in the case of  Golan?    [Beilin] Golan is important to security. And I think that  when there are negotiations and a draft agreement with Syria, we  must make the relinquishment of Golan the subject of a  referendum. Of course, we could lose it, but that is a risk we  must face.    [Stabile] But are you not afraid that Syria's President al-  'Asad could regard a referendum on Golan as an excuse for  avoiding a withdrawal?    [Beilin] I think that al-'Asad can understand that the  decision to make a future agreement the subject of a referendum  is the most important indication of the seriousness of our  intentions. Also I can assure you that such an agreement would  by no means have an easier life in the Knesset, since we have  only a small majority.    [Stabile] Meanwhile al-'Asad has rejected your plan. Will  you change anything in it?    [Beilin] I do not think that Syria will reject all our  proposals. If they did so, they would be proving to the world  that they are not in earnest in their desire for peace. We have  never said: These are our ideas; take them or leave them. That  is merely a proposal, but it is the most serious proposal that  Israel has ever made. And if there are differences to be  bridged, we are prepared to discuss them.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Japan urged to reform markets THE JAPANESE government was urged yesterday by international and domestic financial institutions to increase the transparency of markets and encourage competition to ensure the longer-term health of the troubled financial system. An industry committee comprised of 22 companies ranging from Barclays Bank to the Industrial Bank of Japan and Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, said tight regulation had 'hindered the free play of the market mechanism' and blocked the entry of new securities products. The Committee to Make Tokyo Financial Markets More Transparent and International (CTTI) said the cosy relations between regulators and some large Japanese institutions have also created a lack of transparency, leading to inconsistent policy decisions by the Ministry of Finance. It is intended that the committee's report be used by the Japanese government as a guide to financial reform. Professor Kazuo Ueda, the committee's co-ordinator, said the collapse of the stock market had led to a slowing of liberalisation in Japan, making it unlikely that there will be quick approval of the changes recommended. 'There will be a long-term negative impact on Japan if nothing changes,' he said. Foreign brokers complained that, in other markets, an action is allowed unless specifically prohibited, while in Japan, an action is not allowed unless specifically permitted. There was also a general complaint that unnecessary intervention has severely restricted the growth of the corporate bond market in Japan. The CTTI found that only 12 of 25 financial instruments available in the US and EC are available in Japan, and that the use of administrative guidance in handling new products leads to 'incongruous treatment of issues and issuers, with insufficient consideration for the interests of investors'. There were similar complaints expressed about fund management in Japan.</p>

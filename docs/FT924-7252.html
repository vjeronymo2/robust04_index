			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (4): Lessons for the west - Japan sets a cracking pace JAPAN is widely acknowledged as the world leader in the field of energy efficiency and the exemplar for other developed industrial countries in getting value from the fuel they burn. A wide panoply of financial and other incentives has been deployed by government and business organisations to help industry, business and householders to use energy more sparingly. They include: free energy audits for companies of 300 employees or less; tax concessions on investment in new energy-saving equipment; credit for conservation measures, including co-generation schemes, from numerous sources, including the Japan Development Bank; low interest loans from the Housing Finance Corporation to help pay for insulation and efficient water heaters; annual observance of a national energy saving month every February. It is not easy, however, to compare Japan's performance with that of other countries. The conventional mechanism for comparing different countries' programmes is to divide their Gross National Product by energy consumption. This measure is favoured by the International Energy Agency and, by this yardstick,the Japanese record is truly impressive. In the 15 years after the Yom Kippur War first alerted the world to the danger of energy profligacy, Japan succeeded in using 34 per cent less fuel to produce the same amount of goods and services. In contrast, the UK was using 25 per cent less energy per unit of GDP, the US 26 per cent less. Relying only on the GDP/energy ratio can be misleading, however. A country which chooses to de-industrialise and concentrate upon service industries can appear vastly to improve its ratio, but in practice it does little to reduce wastage. Put simply, an insurance broker can create the same amount of GDP as a steel worker - but by definition he requires far less fuel to operate. Nations which cut back on their manufacturing output during the 1980s can thus report superficially attractive energy efficiency improvement figures, the UK being an obvious example. That did not happen in Japan. During the 1980s it developed into a powerhouse producing many of the world's key consumer durables. Strong domestic demand gave Japanese companies a firm base from which to export, stimulating frequent model changes to keep demand high. One can argue that Japan's discipline in energy usage was an integral factor in bringing about this economic success. A detailed study of the Japanese energy scene* yielded seven key conclusions: a successful energy efficiency programme can play a key role in expanding international competitiveness. Symptomatic of this is the recent initiative to inaugurate centres around the Far East to promote Japanese energy efficiency technologies, as part of the world-wide response to the threat of climate change. successful energy saving programmes require long-term objectives, with policies set accordingly. Once introduced, initiatives are maintained and not, as in Britain, left to run on a stop-start basis. minimum efficiency standards are needed for industrial plant, for buildings and for appliances. These require regular updating and to be mandatory not voluntary. these standards or 'sticks' need to be accompanied by 'carrots'. Japan uses a wide range of incentives, grants and regulations to encourage energy conservation investments. although fuel prices are appropriately 40 per cent higher than in Europe as expressed in conventional exchange rate terms, in terms of cost to disposable income the difference is not that great. It is a myth that higher fuel prices alone have stimulated Japanese energy efficiency. a single agency, under the industry ministry, MITI, with considerable finance and influence throughout Government, administers the programmes. Japanese companies are required by law to have well-trained and qualified engineers in place as energy managers. Attempts by the European Commission to replicate such training requirements were withdrawn earlier this year, perceived as a breach of the concept of 'subsidiarity'. most important is the establishment of the principle that economic growth does not require more energy use. (In the UK, by contrast, the decline in GNP since 1990 has been accompanied by higher energy use.) This principle seems to be accepted by the Japanese people, most of whom do not wish to see more energy consumed than at present. Indeed, a majority are willing to sacrifice increases in living standards to improve the world's environment. These conclusions were drawn from a recent extensive opinion survey of 3,750 Japanese. It was initiated by the Prime Minister's office, following his Government's commitment to stabilise green house gas emissions. It was intended to provide evidence about how individual Japanese felt about the best way to achieve such stabilisation. Only 32 per cent thought that more energy consumption was needed for an improved economy. Contrary to some Western stereotypical views of alleged Japanese indifference about the environment, 40 per cent said they were personally willing to retain present levels of energy use, and a further 14 per cent to reduce levels, to aid the environment. * Lessons from Japan; Association for the Conservation of Energy 9 Sherlock Mews, London W1M 3RH; Pounds 15</p>

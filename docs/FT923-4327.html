			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UN nuclear team flies out of Iraq A United Nations nuclear inspection team left Iraq yesterday without laying to rest the ghost of a secret underground plant but having agreed a plan to keep an eye on whether Baghdad is reviving its nuclear programme, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, head of the 14th mission charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear weapons capability, said Iraq's rivers, lakes and canals would be monitored for radioactivity levels, making possible the detection of any resumption of nuclear activities. Mr Zifferero said Baghdad had to do more to satisfy the UN it was complying with the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire, requiring elimination of all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But after the recent strained relations between Iraq and the UN, Mr Zifferero praised the co-operation he received, and said he had laid the groundwork for long-term monitoring. President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday, was yesterday quoted as saying it was time democratic reforms were introduced in Iraq to thwart western attempts to dismember the country.</p>

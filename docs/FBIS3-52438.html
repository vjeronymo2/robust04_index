On  the line from the Knesset, David Ze'ev reports:    Both sides were mobilized, and the vote was close: 46 in  favor, 52 against, and three abstentions.    The bill presented by the Likud's Me'ir Shitrit stated that  an agreement with the Palestinians will be possible only if five  points are ensured: no Palestinian state between the Jordan  River and the Mediterranean; Jewish settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza remaining under Israeli rule, with the  government responsible for their existence and security; freedom  of movement of the Israeli security forces throughout the  territories to stop terrorist activity; no right of return of  Palestinians who left in 1948 and 1967; and Jerusalem remaining  Israel's united and eternal capital. To reverse any one of these  points, three quarters of the Knesset, not just a simple  majority, would have to vote in favor.    Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid, responding for the government,  said the government supports certain aspects of the bill, such  as on Jerusalem, but objects to Jewish settlements in the  territories continuing under Israeli rule forever -- certainly  those settlements, said Sarid, that were built with the  intention of sabotaging this government's policy of territorial  compromise.    Minister Sarid, himself a participant in the recent  negotiations with the Palestinians in Europe and Egypt, said he  also objects to the principle of such legislation, limiting the  authority of Israeli negotiations, and its acceptance, he said,  would mean an end to the peace process.</p>

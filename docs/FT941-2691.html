			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / SPD calls for tax shift to pay for unification German tax reforms, which would shift the burden of spending on unification from the low-paid to the wealthy, were outlined yesterday by the opposition Social Democrats as the main plank of their federal electoral campaign. The aim is also to boost demand and promote job-creation by cutting taxes for ordinary wage-earners and reducing their social security contributions. Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader, says the net effect will be no increase in the combined burden of taxation and insurance contributions, and no increase in the government's net borrowing requirement. The proposal was published as a draft programme for a future SPD government if the party wins power in October. It was immediately denounced by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, as 'hot air'. Far from relieving the burden on ordinary wage-earners, it would hit the vast majority on average incomes, he said. The tax reforms amount to a calculated risk by the opposition leader, who is seeking to present his party as a reliable alternative to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition. They are intended to demonstrate greater social justice, maintain strict fiscal discipline and create more jobs. The growth rate of public spending would be kept 'appreciably below' the nominal growth rate of gross national product to cut soaring public debt, the programme states. 'Unnecessary' tax allowances would be abolished. At the heart of the package is a 10 per cent tax surcharge on higher incomes. The suggested threshold is an annual income of DM50,000 (Pounds 19,455) for the single taxpayer and DM100,000 for married couples. The Kohl government has decided on a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to pay for unification to take effect from January 1995. The SPD proposal also includes an increase in the wealth tax on individuals and measures to close tax loopholes for the higher-paid. In return, an SPD government would remove the surcharge on unemployment insurance contributions which finances retraining programmes and job-creation schemes in east Germany. Mr Scharping said this surcharge was socially unjust because it was only paid by regular wage-earners, not by civil servants and the self-employed.</p>

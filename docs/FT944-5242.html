			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: You can't judge a book by its reviewer Most managers claim not to have the time to read management books. Fewer are prepared to admit that the effort is probably not worth the gain. But most would, in theory, like to sound erudite and well-read by mentioning famous gurus and their latest concepts. The easiest way out seems to be to read not the book, but the review which might give the gist of a 50,000-word book in 500 words. Do book reviews tell more about the author, the book or the reviewer? I believe it is the latter, and furthermore that regular reviewers are gratuitously nasty. They know that only pessimism sounds profound; that being a prophet of doom and gloom and biting criticism makes them sound wise and insightful, while optimism and praise are perceived as foolhardy and ignorant. In a paper called 'Brilliant and Cruel', the American psychologist Teresa Amabile asked people to judge excerpts from matched negative and positive book reviews. She found that negative reviewers were perceived as more intelligent, competent and expert than positive reviewers, even when the content of the positive review was independently judged as being of higher quality and greater forcefulness. She believes that most reviewers know this and that it is simply a self-presentation strategy by the intellectually insecure. Certainly, there is nothing inherently more intelligent in criticism than praise. WH Auden pointed out that one cannot attack a bad book without showing off, but some reviewers apply that dictum to all books. Management book reviews perhaps tell us most about the reviewer, something about the author, but frequently little about the book. Nearly 100 years ago Thorstein Veblen pointed out that many of the rich of his time engaged in conspicuous consumption. They bought and displayed products to show off their taste, wealth and refinement. All advertisers have exploited this fact and are able to distinguish between a product and an image. Thus we have the company BMW, whose product is the motor car, but what is really being sold? An upmarket image. Louis Vuitton makes luggage but sells prestige. Disney owns and runs theme-parks but sells happiness, fun and an innocent view of the world. As we can see from advertisements, a variety of manufacturers of breakfast cereals are selling not muesli and cornflakes but fitness and health. What does Estee Lauder sell? The product is make-up, but hope is what it sells. It is not a bad discipline for employees struggling with mission statements or 'who-is-your customer' quizzes to attempt to distinguish the product, tangible or intangible, from what is truly being sold to the consumer. Consumer boycotts are increasingly common in the UK. Some are media-oriented, where announcements and pleas are made with passion, drama and supposed legitimacy by individuals or organisations. Others are market-oriented where particular brand names are targeted by lobbyists and protectionists. Some pressure groups aim to 'educate', that is to proselytise rather than to boycott. But what these consumer affairs activists have in common is that they purport to speak on behalf of others. Most behalfers claim to represent the consumer - which is patently absurd precisely because consumers have highly varied, indeed conflicting, needs. Have they ever been elected? Worst, there is no way they can know consumers' needs, wants or wishes. Newspapers through sales, companies through market-research, even politicians through their surgeries get some idea of the feelings, beliefs and behaviour of the public, but behalfers rarely have access to the diversity of public opinion. Most are against things, anti this or that and in favour of more life-style control or legislation. It would be hypocritical to attempt to ban or restrict behalfers but no one should take them seriously. I often travel long-haul on east Asian carriers, fortunately near the 'front-of-the-bus'. The cabin crew have a deserved reputation for being conscientious about their somewhat mundane duties. But are they over-staffed? Last week I had a long flight on KLM in business class. The steward was attentive without being intrusive, charming but not rule-driven, comfortably tri-lingual and good at reading passengers and anticipating their needs. Alone he served 20 filled seats two full meals. Compared with other carriers the 'staff-student' ratio was low but the service exemplary. Perhaps, we Europeans really have woken up to the threat of the Pacific Rim countries. The long night of over-staffing may be coming to an end.

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Redrow chairman says worst is over IN LINE with its forecast at the time of its acquisition of Costain Homes, Redrow Group, the privately-owned housebuilder and construction concern, raised pre-tax profits by 30 per cent to Pounds 13.3m in the year ended June 30. Turnover of the group, which paid Pounds 23m in July to acquire Costain's loss-making UK housebuilding operations, rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 130m. The result prompted Mr Steve Morgan, the chairman, to predict that the worst of the recession was over. He said that although all group companies experienced difficult trading conditions 'we have hopefully seen the start of a sustained recovery in the housing market'. Redrow claims to be the UK's largest unquoted housebuilder. During the year, Redrow's balance sheet strengthened by a further 17 per cent, reflecting a net worth of Pounds 53.7m, while net year end borrowings were reduced to Pounds 3.8m, giving a 7 per cent gearing. Following the Costain purchase however, group borrowings rose to Pounds 21m and gearing to 39 per cent. Mr Morgan said he expected the housing division to make substantial progress during the current year. The acquisition of Costain Homes - now trading as Redrow Homes (South East) - took its number of regional housing operations to 7 and gave the division a significant presence throughout England and Wales. With a land bank of about 6,300 plots, completions approaching 2000 units were anticipated in the current year.</p>

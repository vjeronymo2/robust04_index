			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking restricts Nikkei to modest rise PROFIT-TAKING eroded initial gains yesterday, but the Nikkei average closed marginally higher after further strength in the yen had earlier pushed the index up to the 19,000 level for the first time since March 31, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained a net 36.03 at 18,804.60. After a day's low of 18,804.09 recorded immediately after the opening, the Nikkei jumped on active buying by foreign investors, which prompted dealers and investment trusts to follow suit. The index briefly rose as high as 19,003.61, but profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling then took their toll. Volume increased to 450m shares from 394m, with institutional investors remaining on the selling side. Declines outnumbered advances at the finish by 501 to 484, with 155 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.49 to 1,396.73. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.60 to 1,114.07. Some analysts said the downside risk for share prices had subsided. Mr Alan Bell of Baring Securities said fears of a market 'melt-down' were now non-existent. He added that the market faces some volatility during the next few months, due to companies' profit announcements, but that it should post a rally after mid-August. Rises in the second section and over-the-counter market added to the positive mood. The previous declines of smaller company stocks have been steeper than those of the major section stocks, with the former perceived to be more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy. The second section index rose 18.11 to 2,103.79 and the OTC index gained 22.84 to 1,708.62. Traders said the advances reflected an improvement in the earnings outlook for companies in the second section and over-the-counter market. Short-term speculative trading by dealers led activity. Japan Metals &amp; Chemicals was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y38 to Y749, while Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, retreated Y50 to Y1,500 on profit-taking. Export-oriented, high technology issues lost ground in reaction to the higher yen. Hitachi slipped Y8 to Y831, Matsushita Electric Industrial dipped Y10 to Y1,380 and Sony shed Y60 to Y4,370. Housing shares were higher on favourable earnings results for the year to March 1992. Daiwa House Industry registered an advance of Y30 to Y1,870. The company posted a 1.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y90.5bn on a 9.9 per cent increase in sales to Y881.9bn. National House Industrial moved forward Y20 to Y1,750. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 81.73 ahead at 21,428.63 in volume of 23.6m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of other markets in the region were also affected by profit-taking, although enthusiasm for New Zealand was not to be denied. NEW ZEALAND tested its peak for the year as the NZSE-40 Index added 20.64, or 1.4 per cent, at 1,529.79, after gains of 2 and 1 per cent respectively on Tuesday and Wednesday. This was its highest close since January 6, on fresh buying orders from foreign investors encouraged by falling domestic interest rates, a weak New Zealand dollar and growing optimism that the depressed local economy is starting to recover. Forestry issues again claimed most attention: Carter Holt rose 10 cents to NZDollars 2.68. HONG KONG took a breather after three consecutive record highs, the Hang Seng index closing 11.50 down at 5,746.46 in turnover up from HKDollars 3.99bn to HKDollars 4.53bn. Afternoon profit-taking wiped out sharp early gains which had carried the index through the psychologically important 5,800 barrier. MANILA saw turnover rise from 218m pesos to 370m, but profit-taking in the last hour of trading left the composite index only 9.31 higher at 1,337.35 following Wednesday's 93-point surge and a gain of 41.70 in the first hour. Philippine Long Distance Telephone added 45 pesos at 1,065 after a good overnight performance in the US. Philippine National Bank lost 5 pesos to 307.50 after the resignation of its president on Wednesday. BANGKOK declined for the third day in a row, with investors worried about opposition calls for a big rally against Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon this weekend. The SET index lost 3.31 to 727.96 in thin turnover of Bt2.49bn. AUSTRALIA was led lower by a weaker futures market. The All Ordinaries index finished 2.9 easier at 1,679.8 in turnover of ADollars 317m. Foster's Brewing gained 6 cents to ADollars 1.86 ahead of tomorrow's refinancing deadline. TAIWAN weakened on fears that the strong Taiwan dollar would depress export industries. The weighted index lost 25.78 to 4,300.60 in turnover of TDollars 20.8bn. BOMBAY drifted lower, the BSE index closing 36.65 down at 3,394.48. SINGAPORE gained ground on expectations of an increase in first-quarter GDP. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.23 to 1,472.75. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index receded 5.62 to 593.03 in turnover of MDollars 73.3m. SEOUL fell on heavy institutional selling, the composite index ending 4.73 off at 587.56.</p>

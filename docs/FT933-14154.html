			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Shell expands in Canada SHELL Canada has strengthened its natural gas reserves in the Sable Island area off Nova Scotia in a property exchange with Petro-Canada, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Petrocan has acquired Shell's 5.3 per cent stake in the Terra Nova oilfield off Newfoundland, increasing its interest to 49 per cent. In exchange, Petrocan has transferred part of its minority interests in six gasfields in the Sable Island area to Shell. This means Shell now has a 25 per cent share of 3,700bn cubic feet of gas reserves about 175 miles east of Halifax. Most of the gas reserves were found in the mid-1970s in an exploration programme led by Shell. However, Shell and partners have no plans yet to develop the gas.</p>

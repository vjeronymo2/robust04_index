			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Palestinian negotiator Hasan  'Usfur has said that 1,000 Palestinian police will enter Gaza  and Jericho on Sunday [8 May].    The force will begin to take over the camps from which the  Israeli Army will withdraw, he said.    'Usfur told MENA today that 22 Palestinian officers  representing the Palestinian side in the Palestinian-Israeli  Coordination and Cooperation Committee arrived in Gaza on  Tuesday to prepare for the entry of the Palestinian police force.    He said 6,000 members of the force will enter the self-rule  areas in the next two weeks.    It was agreed, he explained, that the Palestinian police  force would consist of 9,000 personnel, 7,000 of which will come  from outside the occupied territories and 2,000 from inside the  self-rule areas.    'Usfur said that Israel yesterday released 850 Palestinian  prisoners. He said the rest of the 5,000 prisoners whose  release was agreed upon will be freed in batches over the next  five weeks.</p>

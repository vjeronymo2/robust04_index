Katyal: "Six Proposals Submitted to </F> Pakistan"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--Keeping up its initiative, India  today conveyed to Pakistan the promised proposals on six  sensitive subjects, including Siachen, stabilisation of the Line  of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, and confidence-building  measures in the nuclear field, as part of a normal, practical  approach intended to be adopted in the bilateral field.    The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, handed over six  non-papers containing the proposals to the Pakistan High  Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, this evening. India, Mr. Dixit  told the High Commissioner, had structured these proposals after  serious deliberations and the initiative was neither empty  propaganda nor an attempt to lay pre-conditions for continuing  the dialogue.    The other subjects covered by the non-papers are: Sir Creek  and delimitation of the maritime boundary, Tulbul navigation  project and activation of the committees, set up within the  framework of the Joint Commission, in July 1989 at Islamabad.  India was represented at the Joint Commission meeting, which  followed the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi's visit to  Pakistan, by Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then External Affairs  Minister.    The nuclear continental ballistic missile, contained in  today's proposals, envisage extension of the existing agreement  on non-attack at each other's nuclear facilities to cover  non-attack on population centres and economic targets and to  provide for non-first use of nuclear capabilities.    This was a small step in the bilateral context but there was  nothing to preclude its extension to cover other countries which  might choose to adhere to these provisions.    To ensure effective communication especially at times of  crises, India suggested conversion of the present hotline  between the Directors-General of Military Operations into a  secure and dedicated link, coupled with fax facilities.    Siachen: As regards Siachen, India re-conveyed its  willingness to accept the agreement reached in 1992 (which could  not be implemented because of technical wrangles). Under it,  both sides were to disengage from authenticated positions held  presently, and leave the delimitation of the Line of Control  beyond NJ 9842 to a joint commission. The immediate objective  was to ensure peace and tranquillity in the area without  prejudice to each other's positions.    `A positive signal': Today's formulation on  Siachen was, perhaps, not different from the one agreed upon by  the Defence Secretaries of the two countries towards the end of  1992. India's acceptance of that agreement now was seen as a  positive signal which was not possible then because of the  domestic political situation. Pakistan did not want the "Actual  Ground Positions Line" (AGPL) to be mentioned in any document  lest India should use it in support of its claim to hold the  territory acquired "through aggression." It should be possible  to get over this objection, so goes the Indian argument, by  inserting the words "without prejudice to each other's  positions."    India occupied all the commanding heights along what,  according to it, should be the Line of Control--along the  Saltaro ridge, following the internationally-accepted watershed  principle for delineating boundaries. The area was relatively  quiet, with the cases of firing on the decline. India would like  Pakistan to appreciate the significance of New Delhi's  gesture--made at a time when it had a decisive advantage.    LoC in J &amp; K: Perhaps, the most comprehensive was  the non-paper on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the  Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. It was virtually a  full-fledged draft agreement, with its ten clauses dealing with  all aspects--violation of the line, trans-border infiltration  and the like. It followed the format of the Sino-Indian  arrangement for a tension-free border but was firmer and  clearer. That was because, contrary to the Sino-Indian border,  the two sides do not differ on how the Line of Control runs in  Jammu and Kashmir. This proposal also envisaged an institutional  mechanism to monitor and suitably deal with cases of violation  of the agreed steps. That mechanism could also be used to ensure  compliance with the provisions of the existing agreements, like  the one on the prior notice of the movement of troops in the  border areas (which, in actual practices, had not been fully  adhered to).    The Sir Creek imbroglio was sought to be resolved by  separating its two components--the border on the ground, which  could be resolved later, and maritime boundary, for which a  detailed delineation formula had been spelt out.    No reference to forces: There was no reference to  re-deployment or reduction of forces along the LoC in Jammu and  Kashmir, as demanded by Pakistan. According to the oft-explained  Indian stand, the force level would be in proportion to the  degree of infiltration or interference from the other side. By  implications, India could discuss re-deployment in case of  decline in the activities against its territorial integrity.    While the proposals on Siachen and Sir Creek, were, more or  less, on the lines already agreed upon, the formulation on other  issues, according to officials, marked a forward movement by  India. That was particularly the case in regard to the nuclear  CBMs. India could not compromise on its opposition to the  nuclear non-proliferation treaty nor accept the proposal for a  five-nation conference for a nuclear-free South Asia, as  suggested by the United States. Subject to these reservations,  it had offered non-proliferation steps in the bilateral  context--in keeping with the concerns mentioned during its  dialogues with industrialised countries. But there was nothing  to suggest that India would accept the "capping, freezing and  rolling back" sequence suggested by the United States and others  in regard to its nuclear capabilities.</p>

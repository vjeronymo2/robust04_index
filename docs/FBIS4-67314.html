			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw (DPA) -- Polish customs officials have  caught drug smugglers with 40 kg of heroin at the German-Polish  border crossing of Olszyna near Forst. It has become known only  now that some Poles last week tried to smuggle the "hot" stuff  to Germany in a private car. In Slubice--the Polish part of  Frankfurt/Oder--a Vietnamese was apprehended who was trying to  take opium hidden in cotton shirts into the Federal Republic.  The public prosecutors said on 19 May that he had 600 shirts  with him, decorated with a beer mug design. Underneath this,  little bags with an amber liquid containing opium were sewn in.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UN chief appeals to Germany on role THE German government's continuing reluctance to participate as a full member in the United Nations could prevent the UN from being a truly international organisation, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, said in Bonn yesterday. In a series of strongly-worded statements to government officials, Mr Boutros Ghali said money was no substitute for Germany's limited involvement in the UN. Although Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN, accounting for 8.9 per cent of the organisation's budget, it is constitutionally prevented from participating outside the Nato area in any military role, whether in peace-keeping or peace-enforcement. It is able to participate in UN-backed aid programmes for countries emerging from war or disaster. Germany has sent a medical team to help the UN in Cambodia and has provided aircraft and pilots for UN relief flights to Bosnia and Somalia. 'We don't need so much money. We need real participation on the ground. 'Without full diplomatic, military, economic, and political involvement from Germany, the United Nations will not become a stronger organisation,' Mr Boutros Ghali said. He dismissed the suggestion that some countries, for historical reasons, were afraid of Germany playing a military role in the UN. 'There is no fear of this,' he said But the country's main political parties remain divided about how the constitution should be amended, and the extent of Germany's future military role in the UN.</p>

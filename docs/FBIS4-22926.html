Barbarash, Scientific Research Institute of Cardiology at  the Tomsk Scientific Center of the Academy of Medical Sciences;  UDC  616.127-005.4-036.11-092.9-06:[616.12-008.318-084:616-092.19-021.7]    [Abstract] Reports about the possibility of preventing  stress-related myocardial injury and cardiac rhythm disruptions  in acute myocardial ischemia (OIM) by preliminary adaptation  with the help of short mobilizations, brief hypoxia, and  physical stress and enkephalin's known ability substantially to  affect the vegetative myocardial innervation, making it possible  to speculate that cyclical nucleotides play a role in realizing  antiarrhythmic effects of opioid peptides (OP), prompted an  evaluation of the possibility that cardial enkephalins may  participate in the mechanisms of preventing arrhythmia in  adapted animals. The experiment to study antiarrhythmic  adaptation effect was carried out on 60 200-250 g Vistar male  rats which were divided into four groups: intact, adapted to  cold, adapted to physical stress through swimming, and adapted  to the combined effect of cold and physical stress. The  experimental procedure is outlined. The experiment shows that at  a -11C temperature, animals not adapted to cold die after  5-7 h while the adapted ones survive for at least 16 h. The  adapted animals also had 1.5 times more fat. The animals not  adapted to physical stress swim with a load of 10% of  their  body mass for no more than 10 min while the adapted animals swim  for at least 25 min. Adaptation to combined physical stress and  cold facilitated a reliable twofold decrease in mortality in  subsequent acute myocardial ischemia and a decrease in the  ventricular fibrillation rate and duration. The effect of  adaptation and acute myocardial ischemia on the enkephalin  concentration in the myocardium and the effect of adaptation and  acute myocardial ischemia on the cyclical nucleotide  concentration in the myocardium (M+/-m) is  summarized. The findings demonstrate that adaptation to the  combined exposure to cold and physical stress is the most  effective in developing the endogenic opioid system stimulation  and preventing arrhythmia in acute myocardial ischemia as well  as lowering the experimental animal mortality. The study also  reveals that intravenous administration of dalargin (enkephalin)  before the coronary occlusion inhibits an increase in the cAMP  concentration induced by acute myocardial ischemia, probably due  to activating presynaptic opiate receptors. A limitation of the  adrenergic effect on the myocardium in acute myocardial ischemia  facilitates a decrease in the rate of cardiac arrhythmia. The  findings attest to the fact that endogenic cardial enkephalins  may play a significant role in the mechanism of antiarrhythmic  effect of adaptation in acute myocardial ischemia; this effect  is attributed to a decrease in the adrenergic influence on the  heart and serves as an indirect evidence of a decrease in the  sympathetic effect of the peptide on the heart.

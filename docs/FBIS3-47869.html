			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A top official of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry said on 18 January that Japan-U.S. accord on  the economic framework talks may be postponed if the United  States sticks to its demand for setting numerical targets.    The official said: "If the United States adheres to the  numerical targets, the two nations are unlikely to reach an  accord on the objective criteria during the Hosokawa-Clinton  talks in February. In that case, the settlement of the issue  should be postponed until the next [G-7] summit in summer."</p>

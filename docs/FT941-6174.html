			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Tussle over US bank regulation continues A tug of war between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board over plans to overhaul the US's convoluted system of bank supervision continued yesterday as Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, refused to back down from his organisation's insistance that it keep its responsibilities as an independent bank regulator. Despite a warning from Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate banking committee, that the Congress would not tolerate 'bureaucratic stubbornness where an institution tries to dig in', Mr Greenspan refused to relax his opposition to the Treasury's proposal to create a single Federal Banking Commission. Mr Greenspan told the committee in a hearing yesterday that the Fed needed to stay involved in bank supervision in order to keep its finger on the pulse of the financial markets. He also argued, however, that it was important to give banks a choice of regulator in order to preserve 'the current invaluable restraint on any one regulator conducting inflexible, excessively rigid policies'. Mr Greenspan's concerns were not shared yesterday by his colleagues from the three other federal bank regulatory agencies. Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, and Mr Jonathan Fiechter, acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, both backed the Treasury's proposal. Mr Andrew Hove, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also backed the administration plan in most respects, though he argued that the board should be expanded from the five members proposed by the Treasury to include the FDIC chairman. Members of Congress have urged the Treasury and the Fed to come up with a joint proposal. In the event of a clash, the Fed currently seems to hold the strongest cards. Although its argument about the need for competing regulators is viewed as bizarre by other bank supervisors, it is drawing support from bankers, as well as the Republican minority. Bankers have shouted loudest about the need to clean up the four overlapping federal supervisory agencies, but the prospect that there wish might be fulfilled in the shape of a single powerful agency has scared many of them into changing their tune. The Treasury's chances of winning Republican support for its proposal have been impaired by the continuing dispute over President and Mrs Clinton's links to the White Water affair - a murky financial imbroglio with a tenuous connection to the issue of bank supervision because of the involvement of the failed Madison Guaranty savings bank.</p>

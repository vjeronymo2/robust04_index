			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan draws French flak on aircraft bid Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has stepped into a growing political row over the Japanese government's selection of a new multi-purpose support aircraft for its air defence force. Mr Balladur wrote personally last month to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, his Japanese counterpart, urging Japan to consider a French aircraft for its Y30bn (Dollars 303m) ground support project, codenamed UX. The Self-Defence Agency had decided informally on August 11 to recommend a US-made Gulfstream aircraft in preference to rival bids from the French Falcon and Canadian Challenger models. But at a cabinet meeting the next day at least one minister is understood to have raised objections to the process by which the aircraft was selected, and the final decision was deferred. Ministers' doubts were said to have centred on the close involvement of some politicians from the former coalition government in the decision to back the Gulfstream bid. There were also concerns that the US aircraft may have been chosen to improve trade relations between the two countries. Foreign Ministry officials yesterday refused to comment on newspaper reports that the French prime minister's letter, which was received in Tokyo on August 23, had demanded that the Japanese government select its military materiel through open competition, implicitly criticising the way in which procurement decisions are made. But they acknowledged that a letter had been received and that it urged the government to give full consideration to the French-made aircraft. Mr Kozo Igarashi, the chief cabinet secretary, told a press conference yesterday that no final decision had been made on the project. But he said the letter seemed to have been based principally on considerations of national interest. 'We should select our next generation aircraft objectively and rationally,' he said. French officials in Tokyo refused to comment on the correspondence but acknowledged it was unusual, but not unprecedented, for heads of government to intervene personally in such matters. The Self-Defence Agency began preparing for selection of a new support aircraft three years ago. It plans to buy nine aircraft, at a cost of about Y3bn each, over the next five years. They will be used by the Japanese military to transport commanders and for communications and support of military exercises.</p>

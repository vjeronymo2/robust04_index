			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to a Supreme Court of Justice ruling,  there will be no run-off election. The decision does not allow  any kind of appeal or reconsideration recourse. A class action  suit was filed with the Supreme Court several weeks ago, against  Article 255 of the Electoral Code. The provision states that  the winner of the election is the candidate who receives a  majority of the votes. The court has just handed down its  decision on this unconstitutionality claim.    [Begin Chief Justice Arturo Hoyos recording] The court has  decided, in a plenary session, that Article 255 of the Electoral  Code is not unconstitutional. Therefore, there will be no  run-off election for the 1994 presidential election. For  several decades now, the word majority in the text of Article  172 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that only a  simple majority is required. [end recording]    Chief Justice Hoyos explained that the Constitution must be  reformed in order for there to be a run-off election. He added  that there will be no appeal or reconsideration of the court's  ruling, which was reached unanimously and is deemed definitive.</p>

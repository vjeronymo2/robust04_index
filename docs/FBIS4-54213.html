			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column] </F>   [Text] Former opposition party leader Yi Chol-sung  criticized Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu for calling North  Korean President Kim Il-song "great leader" and expressing  regrets over Korea's dispatch of combat troops to Vietnam during  the Vietnam War.    Yi alleged that Han's remarks were apparently "derogatory to  the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War for the cause of  democracy."    He also took issue with Han saying that "his life was saved  by a North Korean soldier during the Korean War when he was  seriously injured by the UN Forces' bombing."    Meanwhile, a ministry spokesman dismissed Yi's criticism as  "ridiculous" saying that the word "great" has widely been used  to jeer Kim Il-song rather than eulogize him.    Yi also denounced President Kim Yong-sam's personnel  management by claiming that the government has appointed  scholars holding "ambiguous ideologies" as Cabinet members, thus  leaving his fellow orthodox rightists in disarray.    Yi also charged that former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung,  now chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, is seeking a  political comeback despite his repeated announcement of his  retirement from politics.    Yi made a similar accusation Friday in a statement released  in the name of a civic body he heads.    In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim had  reportedly  said even if Pyongyang possessed two or three atomic bombs, it  would not be much of a problem compared with the 20,000 nuclear  warheads that the United States has.    He also said that the United States should dispatch former  president Jimmy Carter to Asia as a special envoy and invite  North Korean President Kim to Washington.    The reports touched off a wave of criticism from the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party and the National Unification Board for  distracting the government's official nuclear policy aimed at  eradicating North Korea's suspected nuclear arsenal.    Kim denied his remarks later, allegng that the reports were  totally groundless. Kim even said that Pyongyang clandestine  nuclear weapons program should be stopped at all costs and the  government should be the sole channel of dialogue with North  Korea.</p>

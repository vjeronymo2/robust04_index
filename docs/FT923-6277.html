			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US and Japanese groups in Dollars 1.5bn Chilean mine deal PHELPS DODGE of the US and Sumitomo Metal Mining of Japan were late yesterday signing a Dollars 1.5bn contract to develop one of the biggest mining projects of Chile's recent history: the Candelaria copper and gold deposit in the Atacama desert. Mr Douglas Yearley, Phelps Dodge's executive president, and his counterpart, Mr Akihiko Shinozaki of Sumitomo Metal Mining, were in Santiago yesterday to sign the foreign investment contract with the government of Chile. The Candelaria deposit was discovered by Phelps Dodge in 1987, and Sumitomo has taken a 20 per cent stake in the project. It has proven reserves of 400m tonnes, with an average ore grade of 1.1 per cent copper and 0.26 grams per tonne of gold. The reserves are expected to last for 34 years. Phelps Dodge and Sumitomo plan to invest an initial Dollars 500m to strip the mine and build a concentrator plant. Candelaria will enter production in 1995 with an output of 400,000 tonnes of copper concentrates (a semi-refined product containing about 30 per cent copper) and 80,000 ounces of gold a year. The foreign investment contract of Dollars 1.5bn is expected to cover the 34-year life of the mine. Mr Tom Foster, Phelps Dodge's vice-president, said the company was finalising the financial package for Candelaria. Japanese copper smelters will be putting up some of the money in exchange for supply contracts on Candelaria's future production; Japan's Export-Import Bank is arranging project financing, and Phelps Dodge and Sumitomo will complete the package with their own capital. Candelaria is the second major copper mine to be developed by foreign investors after Escondida, the giant deposit owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a group of Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi.</p>

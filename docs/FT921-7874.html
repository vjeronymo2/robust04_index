			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners continue to buy French cyclicals THE CONTINENT put in a mixed performance yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS reinforced Tuesday's gains as foreign investors, including the Japanese, continued to buy stocks with exposure to cyclical industries and to the US economy. But some analysts feared that the optimism was premature. The CAC-40 index rose 3.20 to 1,915.41 in heavy turnover of FFr2.6bn. Rhone-Poulenc saw its investment certificates rise FFr22 or 3.9 per cent to FFr587 with a respectable 153,375 units traded as the market gave an unexpectedly good reception to its lukewarm 1991 results. Analysts were cheered by the message given at a meeting with the company, that a further recovery in earnings could be expected in 1992 and 1993, with the extra help from a lower tax charge. Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo de Benedetti, rose FFr4.70 or 4.1 per cent to FFr120 in a heavy 312,150 shares on rumours that it would sell its 36 per cent stake in the car components manufacturer Valeo or, alternatively, buy in the outstanding shares. Analysts said the former had more credibility, given the fragile financial position of Olivetti. Accor, the hotels group, rose FFr15 to FFr761 with 117,400 shares traded on news that SGB was likely to increase its holding. FRANKFURT weakened as it pondered the New Hampshire primary in the US, concluded that a strong dollar could be a two-edged sword, and moved towards DTB closure day tomorrow. After a 1.62 decline to 689.48 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX finished 7.20 lower at 1,687.79 after a half-hearted attempt at the 1,700 level. Siemens dropped DM5.10 to DM670.90 as it topped active stocks in turnover of DM1.04bn, very high in the context of total turnover of DM5.3bn, down from DM6.5bn. Daimler led carmakers down with a DM6.90 fall to DM734.60 as some analysts lowered their forecasts following reports that its models saw a 15 per cent year-on-year drop in new registrations in western Europe in January, and that the company expects to cut production this year. Retailers, which had a good run on this week's tax package, ran into profit-taking, Douglas falling DM15 to DM645, Asko by DM17 to DM738 and Kaufhof by DM6 to DM487.50. MILAN overcame an uncertain start and consolidated the previous day's late gains as turnover improved to between L95bn-L100bn from L89bn. The Comit index rose 4.38 to 531.27. Among industrials, Fiat added L58 to L4,740 while in insurers, Generali was officially fixed at L30,535, up L375. Rumours of a rights issue pushed Ras down by L250 to L22,150. Olivetti rose L87 or 3.2 per cent to L2,807 on expectations of a turnround in 1992, but the buying was described as speculative. Montedison was another gainer, as investors re-assessed the Beghin-Say/Eridania restructuring in a more favourable light. The stock rose L22 to L1,356 in heavy trading. The state-controlled cement group Cementir was suspended yesterday ahead of IRI's announcement of the winning bidder for its 52 per cent stake in Cementir. The stock is due to be re-quoted today. AMSTERDAM, after moving strongly in the morning, fell back on nervousness over a weaker Wall Street and closed barely changed on the day, up 0.1 at 123.7 in turnover of Fl 676.5m. Royal Dutch, which reports its 1991 results today, lost Fl 2.30 to Fl 142.10. Most analysts are expecting to be disappointed, given a generally poor fourth quarter for the European petrochemical industry. Among other blue chips, Unilever recorded another record high, gaining Fl 2.30 to Fl 192.20, helped by a stronger dollar, Elsevier moved ahead Fl 0.20 to Fl 109.70, while Philips was off Fl 0.50 to Fl 32.40 on rumours of a rights issue. Begemann, the engineering group, which has been weak over the last few days, came back Fl 5.00 to Fl 103.00, helped by favourable local press comment. STOCKHOLM saw a 3.3 per cent drop in the banking and finance sector as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.8 lower at 933.1. Worries over loan losses were intensified by the suspension of payments by Reinhold, the property company. Among Reinhold's main creditors, SE Banken and Handelsbanken both fell, SE Banken C shares by SKr3 to SKr44 and Handelsbanken B by SKr4 to SKr78. OSLO closed at its lowest level this year, depressed by a weak oil price. The all-share index fell 9.08 to 413.86 in turnover of NKr205m. Norsk Hydro, which is expected to announce a net loss for 1991 today, fell NKr4 to NKr139. MADRID closed down 1.18 at 260.23 with Telefonica actively traded after reports about its pension scheme plans sent the shares to a day's low of Pta1,185. However, it recovered to close down Pta40 at Pta1,200. ZURICH ended a quiet session slightly lower, the SPI index losing 5.0 at 1,122.5. Some cyclicals continued to attract interest, Alusuisse bearers closing SFr17 higher at SFr970. VIENNA's 18-share ATX index fell 8.10 to 1,075.85.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 19  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1143.15  1142.67  1141.71  1140.66  1139.69  1139.60  1140.51  1140.09  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Day's High  1143.29    Day's Low  1138.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 14    Feb 13    Feb 12     1143.83   1135.65   1130.78   1136.68   1136.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

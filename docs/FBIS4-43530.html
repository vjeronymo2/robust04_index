			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Magdalena Rauscher: "Haider's All-Out Attack in </F> `the Thin Air'"]    [Text] The beginning of the election campaign a la Joerg  Haider: Overflowing with self-confidence and cynicism, he  started an all-out attack against political opponents and  critics from within his own ranks at the Freedom Party of  Austria [FPOe] federal congress in Linz.    The aftermath of the defeat in the European Union [EU]  referendum was severe. Haider's criticism of the declared EU  advocates in his party was veiled but unmistakable. During the  FPOe's "steep climb to a fascinating summit" the air has already  become thin and "some" people's "hearts have started to flutter  and they are afraid" as a result. However, the FPOe does not  need fearful persons and egotistical functionaries.    Erwin Hirnschall, a president of the Vienna provincial  legislature, who had celebrated together with the  Industrialists' Association on the evening of the referendum,  received verbal slaps from Haider and the secretary generals --  which he returned during the discussion in the afternoon.  Hirnschall: A continuing massive anti-EU course is a  "dangerous path" for the FPOe.    Back to Joerg Haider: He does not see any EU advocates  anymore. The people are "not pleased" about this vote.    Political opponents were showered with verbal abuse: The  Social Democratic Party of Austria has left a "heap of  sociopolitical shards" with its policy. The Austrian People's  Party [OeVP] is "degrading its own president." He even called  OeVP Chairman Busek a "self-styled coalition idiot."    When the chairman was elected in the evening, Haider's  unambiguous call for cohesiveness showed effect: He was the  only candidate and was reelected with 96.6 percent of the  delegates' votes. Following his own proposal, he now has five  deputies: Edith Haller (80.2 percent); Hans Achatz (81.8  percent); Karl Schnell (86.5 percent); Michael Schmid (86.9  percent); Susanne Riess (78 percent).    An interesting aside: Haider asked Erwin Hirnschall to chair  the election campaign-- "because he brings me luck."</p>

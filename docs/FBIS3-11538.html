The  president was reacting to an agreement reached in New York on  Saturday, 19 March, between Netherlands Development Cooperation  Minister Pronk, the IMF, and Surinamese Foreign Minister Mungra  and Planning and Development Cooperation Minister Assen.    After the meeting Pronk said that Paramaribo had agreed to  IMF monitoring of the structural modification program which the  Surinamese economy was to undergo. The IMF will report progress  made each quarteron. The state of affairs and the Netherlands  will decide on this basis whether or not Suriname will receive  or how much money Suriname will receive as support for its  balance of payments, the minister said.    But Venetiaan refused on Sunday to commit himself. "We have  not yet made any decision. First, we want to see what demands  are made," the president said in his initial reaction to IMF  monitoring. Paramaribo has always resisted IMF checks on the  grounds that the institution would support excessively rigorous  economic cuts. Suriname wanted the British Warwick Institute to  follow up the process rather than the IMF. But the Warwick  Institute indicated that it wanted to do no more than assist the  IMF. In addition this was unacceptable to the Netherlands.    The Development Cooperation Ministry was assuming yesterday  that the agreements made on Saturday were valid. "If two  prominent Surinamese Government ministers agree on something  like this, then it is serious business," Pronk's spokesman said.  He added that the agreements still had to be approved by IMF  Director Camdessus and President Venetiaan.    Before his departure for New York on Friday, Pronk said that  Suriname had to decide in the near future about the monitoring  of the recovery program. Elections would soon be held in the  Netherlands, followed by the formation of a new cabinet, and  according to the minister, that could lead "to a huge amount of  lost time" in the resumption of aid to Suriname, Pronk's  spokesman said. On the basis of the 1992 Framework Treaty,  Suriname is still due approximately 1.2 billion guilders for  items including balance of payments support, subject to the  condition that it takes measures to boost the economy. If  everything goes well, this support will be spread over  approximately 10 years. It is separate from project aid, which  is continuing normally and remains outside IMF monitoring. The  Netherlands is providing this aid for social facilities,  education, health care, and infrastructure.</p>

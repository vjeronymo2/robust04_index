			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CANNERY CLEARS HURDLE TOWARD LANDMARK STATUS  </P> <P> A controversial proposal to renovate a Wilmington pet food cannery into a  restaurant and retail complex received a significant boost Wednesday when the  Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission voted to designate the building a city  landmark.  </P> <P> The landmark status for the Heinz pet food cannery -- which must be approved by  the City Council -- is important to Wilmington community activists, who are  battling the Port of Los Angeles over the future of the building.  </P> <P> The cannery is expected to close Dec. 1., and port officials want to raze it to  make way for an expanded equipment storage yard.  </P> <P> But community leaders want to preserve the 71-year-old cannery for inclusion in  what will be Wilmington's first commercial and recreational development near  the waterfront. If the landmark status is approved, the port will be prevented  from demolishing the building for at least a year.  </P> <P> "It's an opening for us," said resident Simie Seaman, who serves on a citizens  committee that is planning the waterfront access project. "It's part of our  history, it's part of the waterfront and it's something that a lot of people  are interested in. It's a natural for the area."  </P> <P> Wednesday's decision caught port officials off guard.  </P> <P> "That is an understatement," said port Deputy Director Dwayne Lee, when asked  if he was surprised at the commission's vote. Lee said he believes the  building, which has been added to and has evolved over the years, has no  architectural significance at all: "It's kind of like the tree house in the  kid's back yard."  </P> <P> But an aide to Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who requested the  historic status, said commissioners declared the building a landmark because of  its cultural, rather than its architectural, significance. Their vote was based  on the canning industry's historic importance to the Wilmington community and  the port, said aide Susan Prichard.  </P> <P> Lee said port officials intend to find a way to "recognize the historical  significance of the structure and at the same time realize our objectives."  </P> <P> Although he said he could not provide specifics, he suggested that one means of  complying with the ruling would be to document the historic significance of the  cannery in writing and through photographs, to file the documentation in  libraries or with historical societies and then tear the building down.  </P> <P> Such a solution, however, is not likely to satisfy the Wilmington residents  committee, which has been pressing the port since last spring to include the  cannery in the waterfront project.  </P> <P> "Forget it," Seaman said. "We don't want it in pictures. . . . That's  ridiculous."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed FZ/PI: "12 June Federal Polls: 57.3 </F> Percent Against Swiss Blue Helmets -- Supporters Say an  Opportunity Has Been Missed"]    [Text] Bern, 12 Jun (ATS) -- Switzerland will not have its  own blue helmets. The people have rejected, by a 57.3-percent  majority, the creation of a Swiss contingent for UN peacekeeping  operations. The opponents, surprised by the widespread  rejection, are happy that Switzerland's neutrality remains  unaffected. For the supporters of the project, Switzerland has  missed a chance to rise on the international scene.    The "yes" got the upper hand only in four cantons: Geneva  (54.7 percent), Vaud (53 percent), Neufchatel (52.8 percent),  and Jura (52.4 percent). Fribourg said "no" to the blue helmets  with one of the lowest majorities against: 52.3 percent. The  Valais rejected the idea with more determination: 60.6 percent.  Participation was 46 percent. All in all, 1,203,870 people  rejected the project while 898,925 approved it.  <H5>  A Failure for the Federal Council </H5>   Kaspar Villiger accepts the result from a military point of  view: There will not be any Swiss blue helmets. In his opinion,  most Swiss people did not want to engage financial means for  this project. Mr. Villiger further says that this vote reflects  a certain mistrust toward parliament. Flavio Cotti also  stressed the financial situation of the Confederation and of the  welfare state to account for this result.  <H5>  Supporters: A Missed Opportunity </H5>   Those supporting the creation of a corps of blue helmets --  namely the Radical Democratic Party (PRD), the Christian  Democratic People's Party (PDC), the Socialist Party (PS0), the  Liberal Party (PLS), the Independents' Alliance (AdI), and the  Green Party of Switzerland (PES) -- have called this rejection  by the people a missed opportunity. The causes of failure  include the difference in funds plowed into the campaign and the  people's feeling of insecurity at a time of recession and  financial crisis for the Confederation.    Several groups in favor of the blue helmets idea are  concerned that emotive arguments may have won the day. They  stressed the need to promote the humanitarian missions to  counter the negative image which this vote will procure at  international level.  <H5>  UDC: Loyalty to Armed Neutrality </H5>   The Swiss People's Party (UDC) pointed out that the  principle  of armed neutrality remains deeply rooted in the Swiss people.  The citizens reject any attempt to whittle it down. That must  be taken into account in the future, the UDC stressed, noting  that once again it is the only government party to represent the  popular will.  <H5>  Opponents: A "Marignano" for the Federal Council </H5>   The Liberty Party (PDL, formerly Swiss Car Party) and the  Swiss Democrats (DS) noted the popular result with satisfaction,  relief, and great joy, although they were surprised by the  extent of its clear-cut nature. The PDL felt it was a Marignano  [1515 battle lost by the Swiss which entailed an oath of  neutrality toward France, Milan] for the Federal Government and  the parties supporting it. A "no" vote was the only proper  response to the slice-by-slice policy leading toward UN  membership, the PDL and DS said.    While the Swiss Officers' Association (SSO) was disappointed  by the "no" vote, it stressed that this is not a rejection of  the Army. The goal was not reached because it would have meant a  proportional cut in the military budget. The Group for  Switzerland Without an Army (GSsA) was not surprised by the  result. The creation of such a military corps seemed in its  eyes devoid of credibility.  <H5>  United Nations: Switzerland Has Not Spoken its Last Word </H5>   Vladimir Petrovsky, UN director general in Geneva, said the  United Nations respects the Swiss people's rejection. The  country is coming to grips with adapting to the new  international environment. We know it is not easy and it takes  time, the director general stressed, before expressing the hope  that "this is not the last word Switzerland will utter on the  matter."</p>

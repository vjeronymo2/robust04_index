			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Outsider appointed to senior post at Microsoft Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has appointed Mr Robert Herbold, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, as executive vice-president and chief operating officer, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Mr Herbold will report directly to Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, as a member of Microsoft's 'office of the president', succeeding the late Mr Frank Gaudette, who died in April. He joins Mr Steve Ballmer, executive vice-president of sales and support, and Mr Mike Maples, executive vice-president of products, as a member of the office. This group shares responsibility with Mr Gates for broad strategic and business planning for the entire company. Mr Herbold worked for P&amp;G for 26 years, most recently as senior vice-president for information services and advertising. The appointment by Microsoft of an outsider to such a senior position is surprising. In the past Mr Gates has expressed scepticism about the choice of executives from other industries such as Mr Lou Gerstner of IBM to head computer companies. Yesterday, however, Mr Gates said that Mr Herbold's business experience and management skills 'will prove invaluable in taking Microsoft forward as we face new business challenges'. Mr Herbold will be responsible for worldwide operations at Microsoft, including finance, manufacturing, distribution, logistics, information technology, human resources, corporate services, real estate and development and Microsoft Press.</p>

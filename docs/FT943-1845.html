			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Signs of the times - Russia has become an advertiser's dream, but a nightmare for regulators There was a time when the only advertisements on the roof-tops of Russian cities were imposing slogans extolling the virtues of the proletariat and the glories of the communist party. But since the collapse of Soviet power, the cities' skylines have been transformed. Giant neon signs now light up the night sky promoting Marlboro cigarettes or Sanyo stereo systems. They are the most visible sign that Russia's consumer age has dawned. Turn on the television and the change is just as startling. Commercials now teem between Mexican soap operas and glitzy game shows. Elsewhere, billboards have mushroomed, glossy magazines are eagerly devoured and flysheets handed out at metro stops promise returns of 1,600 per cent a year from various investment funds. 'The advertising market really only began here two-and-a-half years ago but it has been growing at a phenomenal rate ever since,' says Pallavi Sodhi, media director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather's Moscow office. But advertising's helter-skelter growth has occurred almost entirely unchecked and there has been little debate about who should regulate these new powers of persuasion. The threat from the unscrupulous is great because of advertising's novelty. 'In the west most people instinctively distrust what they see in commercials. Here that is still not the case,' one western advertising executive says. Russians' susceptibility to extravagant claims has been highlighted by the rise and slide of the MMM pyramid scheme which sucked in investors' money through an advertising campaign, estimated to have cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m). In spite of the government's warning that MMM investment certificates were little more than 'pretty postcards', the company continued advertising during many of Russia's most popular television shows. The government has now banned MMM from advertising in state-run media but it has simply switched to private media outlets. The humdrum star of its television advertisements, Lyonya Golubkov, can still be seen most nights dancing with a Mexican soap opera queen. The lack of regulation has led Russian psychologists to warn of other dangers such as subliminal advertising, in which images flashed up in the middle of a commercial leave an impression on the subconscious mind. That may be relatively harmless when ice cream is being sold but fears are spreading that such techniques could be used for sinister political purposes. 'What if someone wanted to make Lyonya Golubkov president?' the weekly magazine New Times asked in a long examination of advertising's new power. The effective use of television was one of the main reasons for the strong showing of the extreme nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, in last year's presidential elections, the magazine observed. The government has finally responded to such concerns and is drafting a law to regulate the industry. This promises to stop all advertising from unlicensed companies, such as MMM. It would also ban subliminal advertising and insist all material is 'trustworthy and conscientious'. All cigarette and alcohol advertising would be banned and measures introduced to protect the young from unscrupulous campaigns. But the most critical test of the legislation will be its implementation. As a scathing front-page article in Pravda observed, it is already supposedly illegal to advertise potentially harmful products, such as alcohol and cigarettes, under the government's existing health laws. The government lacks effective powers of enforcement and Russian businesses have a proven ability of staying one step ahead of officials. Completely new advertising channels, such as the fast-growing unofficial cable television operators, also threaten to become the regulators' nightmare. The biggest battle, though, is likely to be fought on mainstream television, which accounts for three-quarters of all estimated advertising expenditure. About 99 per cent of the Russian population have access to television with the main channel, Ostankino, reaching a potential 280m people in the former Soviet Union and beyond. Despite recent sharp rises in the cost of advertising, it remains extremely cheap compared with other countries and an attractive means of promoting products. 'We like and use television advertising because of the sheer size of the country,' says Michael Parsons, eastern Europe spokesman for Philip Morris, which advertises many cigarette and food brands in Russia, such as Marlboro. 'There are 11 time zones and there is no other really effective means of reaching consumers across such a large land mass.' Most western multinational companies operating in Russia say they have their own strict guidelines on what advertising material they use. The big western agencies, such as DMB&amp;B, Young &amp; Rubicam, BBDO, and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which were the first to develop the Russian market, also claim - somewhat piously  -that they are bound by ethical considerations. But there are few restrictions to stop any company, such as MMM, producing its own advertisements and putting them on the air. Many Russian entrepreneurs have also moved into creative advertising. One estimate suggests there may be as many as 800 agencies in Moscow alone - many of them of dubious reputation. But the biggest and the best of them, such as Video International and Premier SV, have rapidly evolved into formidable operations. They are already making high-quality advertisements, including some for western agencies and clients, and have strengthened their grip on the media market by buying up big chunks of advertising time on the main television channels. Alexei Gusev, director of Video International, says the private company now employs 250 full-time staff and uses more than 100 free-lances. He forecasts that its annual income will have jumped from Dollars 250,000 three years ago to more than Dollars 10m by the end of this year. Video International has secured its position by buying up more than half the advertising time available on Ostankino. Yegor Makhalov, production director of Premier SV, says the Russian advertising industry is learning fast and will soon prove more than a match for the western agencies. 'Technically the western agencies are better but Russian agencies have good ideas and know a lot more about how the Russian market works,' he says. If the government's attempts at regulation prove fruitless, it may ultimately have to rely on these new power brokers to win the nation's hearts and minds. Significantly, perhaps, the ministry of finance has just commissioned its own advertising campaign to fight the financial fraudsters.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACH BOY BRIAN WILSON'S KIN CLAIM HE'S 'BRAINWASHED';  </P> <P> CELEBRITY: FORMER PSYCHOLOGIST IS ACCUSED OF CONTROLLING HIS LIFE. THE SINGER  SHOWS UP AT A PRESS CONFERENCE TO CHALLENGE COUSIN'S PETITION TO BECOME HIS  CONSERVATOR.  </P> <P> The long-playing, woe-filled ballad of Beach Boy Brian Wilson's return from  mental illness and substance abuse took a bizarre turn on Monday as Wilson's  cousin filed a court petition claiming that the rock singer has been  "brainwashed" by a former psychologist who has taken control of Wilson's  recording enterprises.  </P> <P> Even as the charges were being outlined at a Los Angeles press conference,  Wilson walked in -- uninvited -- to respond to the claims by his cousin, former  professional basketball player Stan Love.  </P> <P> Wilson, glaring icily, took over the lectern during the suddenly tense press  conference and angrily denounced the legal action.  </P> <P> "I think (the charges) are outrageous . . . out of the ballpark," Wilson said,  even while his attorney exchanged words and glares with Love's associates.  </P> <P> Speaking for only a few moments, Wilson told reporters that he performed twice  with the Beach Boys on Sunday in San Francisco and denied allegations that he  has been brainwashed into rejecting his mother, two daughters and other members  of the Wilson family.  </P> <P> "I feel great and my life is back on track," Wilson said, adding: "I see who I  want to see and I am in charge of my own life."  </P> <P> He declined, however, to answer questions concerning his personal and  professional involvement with Eugene Landy, the so-called "psychologist to the  stars" who treated Wilson for several years before 1988.  </P> <P> In 1989, Landy voluntarily surrendered his license to practice psychology in  California as part of a settlement with the state involving charges of  professional misconduct, including having sex with a female patient. As part of  the settlement, Landy admitted to a single charge of unlawfully prescribing  drugs and agreed not to petition for reinstatement for two years.  </P> <P> Since abandoning his practice, Landy has worked as Wilson's partner in a Santa  Monica-based record-producing company called "Brains and Genius," where Landy  develops projects and co-writes songs, said Wilson's attorney, John Mason.  </P> <P> Love, who filed a request in Santa Monica Superior Court to become Wilson's  conservator, accused Landy of taking "extensive control" over Wilson's business  deals and personal affairs, to the point that "he is unable to properly provide  for his personal needs for food, clothing, housing and physical or mental  health."  </P> <P> A hearing on Love's petition was set for June 22.  </P> <P> Love, who said he was acting on behalf of the rest of Wilson's family, said he  hopes that the court will order independent psychological and psychiatric  evaluations of Wilson and permit members of the singer's family to learn the  full extent of his financial involvement with Landy.  </P> <P> The monetary stakes involve "Brian Wilson's estate, whatever (dollar amount)  that is," said Love's attorney, Thomas M. Monson. "We do expect it to be in  excess of $1 million, certainly."  </P> <P> "He's totally controlled . . . a puppet," Love said of the singer. "I've made  50 to 100 phone calls trying to see Brian. I can't even have any access to  him."  </P> <P> Love, a former forward for the Lakers who is the brother of Beach Boys lead  singer Mike Love, also charged that Brian Wilson "has not been allowed to see  his mother for more than five hours in the past five years and . . . has not  been allowed to spend more than five hours in that five years with his two  daughters.  </P> <P> "I feel Brian is being held a virtual hostage," he added.  </P> <P> Landy did not return phone calls from The Times.  </P> <P> Wilson's mother, Audree Wilson, said she supported the actions by Love and  called Landy "the worst news that ever happened" to her son.  </P> <P> "I think he's pretty well brainwashed Brian," Audree Wilson said in a telephone  interview. "He manipulates him, that's all I know. He just hasn't been a free  guy."  </P> <P> Although she regularly receives phone calls from her son, she has given up  trying to contact Brian on her own, she said. "If he calls you, that's great,"  she said. "But . . . you can't get through to him. If you call his home, you  get the answering machine. To get through to him you have to go through the  office -- and you're put on hold. It's just a crock. I won't be so insulted.  That's my son!"  </P> <P> Other members of the family could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy, are successful singers who are now  performing in Europe. Beach Boys Carl Wilson, Alan Jardine, Mike Love and Bruce  Johnston are also on tour.  </P> <P> Love claimed to have support for his petition from the two daughters and the  Beach Boys singers. But a publicist released a statement saying members of the  group would withhold comment on the charges until they could investigate the  issue.  </P> <P> Wilson's attorney, Mason, questioned how the band members could be supporting  the charges when they were appearing on stage with Wilson again Monday night in  San Francisco. Last year Brian Wilson did 50 shows with the group, Mason said.  </P> <P> "How can he be keeping everyone away from him when they're performing  together?" the attorney asked. "This whole thing of Stan's is preposterous."  </P></p>

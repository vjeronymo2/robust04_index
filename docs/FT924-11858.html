			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EFA weighs costs and commitment IN SEVEN thick volumes, the industrial partners in the European Fighter Aircraft have set out to meet the demands of the German government and try to rescue Europe's most important collaborative military programme. But their report, sent to the UK, German, Italian and Spanish governments last Friday, could be shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted. The horse in question is Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister. He is adamant that the EFA programme, worked on by the four nations since 1984, is a thing of the past. The study was commissioned by defence ministers in August after Mr Ruhe announced that Germany would not go ahead with EFA production. Its target was to find a way of producing a fighter for 30 per cent less than the price put forward six months ago and which Germany rejected as far too high. It concludes that the 30 per cent target could be met using the current EFA airframe and engines. These have absorbed most of the Pounds 5.5bn (Dollars 8.96bn) already spent on development. Responding to Mr Ruhe's call for a new aircraft instead of the EFA, the report examines seven alternative designs but concludes that these would either be more expensive or fall well short of requirements. Even if Germany were to stay, its share of the project, geared to the number of aircraft bought, would be expected to drop from 33 per cent to 25 per cent, and Britain's to rise from 33 per cent to over 40 per cent. UK experts believe the 'significant cost savings' would still apply if Germany quit the project. How the sums would work out if Britain decided to pursue EFA completely on its own are still unclear, however. The report was produced by Eurofighter, the Munich-based consortium of British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and CASA of Spain, together with the Eurojet engine grouping of Rolls-Royce, Deutsche Aerospace's MTU subsidiary, Fiat and the Spanish company ITP. Mr Ruhe has so far been dismissive of UK hopes of keeping even the basic EFA plan, arguing that the partners should start again and design an aeroplane for today's needs rather than a world war against the Warsaw Pact. He attaches more weight to a parallel study being carried out by the four chiefs of defence staff. Britain believes the defence chiefs will want an aircraft similar to the EFA, but Mr Ruhe has other ideas. The crunch is expected to come at a defence ministers' meeting in early December. Meanwhile, British proponents of EFA hope to exert pressure on other members of the German government. Eurofighter's proposed cuts are set against the 'system price' it submitted in April. This is a price definition used only by Germany, including production tooling and the cost of keeping aircraft in service for 10 years. Its figure was DM127m per aircraft, or about Pounds 43m at the exchange rates of the time. Eurofighter now says this can be reduced by 13 per cent without changing the aircraft by reshuffling some of the work share arrangements and reducing the allowance for logistical support. The aircraft is designed to be more reliable and therefore cheaper to maintain than its predecessors. Downgrading some equipment - with a loss of perhaps 4-5 per cent in performance - would lower this cost to DM100m, a 21 per cent cut. Eurofighter has dubbed this aircraft the New EFA. Further cuts would offer more savings. With a limited electronic warfare capability and a current radar instead of the one being specially developed for EFA, Germany could achieve a target price of DM90m. This would also be within the levels that Mr Ruhe says Italy and Spain regard as a maximum. Both have initially made positive noises about the report's conclusions. Proponents believe that offering a 'family' of aircraft will also boost prospects for export to other countries. Among the alternative new designs considered, only two worked out cheaper than continuing with EFA, and then only fractionally. Both these would be single-engined models using on the same EJ200 engine as the twin-engined EFA. More powerful engines would make them costlier. They would not, according to Eurofighter, fare well against improved versions of the latest Russian-made fighters. The EFA programme has already slipped nine months, and the target for bringing it into service has been moved back from by two years to the year 2000. A new aircraft, according to Eurofighter, would not be ready until at least 2005. Industry representatives warn that such a delay could force some of the companies involved out of business.

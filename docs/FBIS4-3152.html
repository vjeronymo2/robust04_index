			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  Government official said here today that discussions at the just  concluded 8th meeting of the China-U.S. Joint Commission on  Commerce and Trade were "candid, business-like and constructive."    Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, was presiding over the two-day meeting together  with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown.    At the concluding ceremony, both Wu and Brown spoke highly  of  the results of the meeting, which concentrated on a review of  the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries  over the past few years and an exchange of views on broadening  this cooperation.    Wu said, "China and the United States have much in common in  their economic interests and can count on a bright prospect in  bilateral economic and trade cooperation."    "We have every reason to get rid of the negative effect  brought by the most favored nation status issue."    This afternoon Wu and Brown signed a joint statement  indicating that the two sides had agreed to set up working  groups, on trade and investment, trade promotion, and law of  commerce respectively.    During the meeting, Wu Yi met with U.S. Vice President  Albert  Gore and Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen.</p>

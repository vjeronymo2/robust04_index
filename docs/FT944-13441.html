			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pre-tax reverse at Jyske Bank Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth-largest bank, suffered a fall in pre-tax earnings after nine months to DKr66m (Dollars 11.3m) from DKr495m last year, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The bank, the only Danish bank to publish quarterly results, said its core earnings, which include net interest income and other operating income less operating expenses, increased by 20 per cent to DKr855m. But the pre-tax result was pulled down by unrealised losses on the bond and share portfolio of DKr467m, compared with a gain DKr513m last year. The bank expected to achieve its full-year profit target of between DKr200m and DKr300m.</p>

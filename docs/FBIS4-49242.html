			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>   [Text] China's economic czar Zhu Rongji, whose political  fortunes will be jeopardised by hyperinflation, has threatened  to axe local officials in an expanding move to check market  prices. Chinese sources said the executive vice-premier ordered  regional officials to be personally accountable for price  control.    Failure to rein in the runaway inflation will weaken the  political position of Mr. Zhu, who is betting his political fate  on dealing with the boom-bust economy, analysts say.    At a recent emergency national telecommunication conference,  Mr. Zhu warned provincial party chiefs and government heads to  spare no effort to combat inflation, saying they were gambling  with their future. "The inflation rate should be contained to  below 12 per cent in the second quarter of the year, and under  no circumstance is it allowed to rise to 15 per cent in that  period," he was quoted as saying.    In the first quarter of the year, China reported an  inflation  rate of 20 per cent.    Mr. Zhu, who was acting premier at the conference, warned  that if inflation was not immediately checked in the first half  of the year, the national goal to rein in annual inflation at  under 10 per cent would fail. The government has set a 9 per  cent growth rate while containing inflation at 10 per cent in a  bid to cool down the overheating economy.    "I would step down if the economic problems cannot be  solved," Mr. Zhu said recently.    Chinese economists and analysts said the political future of  the fast-rising star was tied with his ability to deal with the  boom-bust economy.    "Inflation should fall to around 10 per cent this year and 6  per cent next year," Mr. Zhu said in March.    To bring the annual rate below 10 per cent, the Chinese  government must keep the combined figure of the coming three  quarters at a quarterly percentage of not more than 6.67 per  cent.    Chinese economic sources said Mr. Zhu blamed the runaway  inflation on local officials who were scrambling for more  investment in an apparent defiance of Beijing's repeated  warnings. In an unprecedented move "to kill one to warn a  hundred", Mr. Zhu last month fired a provincial party chief for  failing to toe Beijing's line on economics.    In his six-day tour to the northeastern province of  Heilongjiang two weeks ago, Mr. Zhu announced a central order to  strip Sun Weiben, the party secretary of the provincial  Communist Party committee and head of local legislature, of all  official positions.    In the meeting, Mr. Zhu said regional top officials should  give the price control top priority in their agenda.    Meanwhile, Mr. Zhu has called for stricter control of grain  prices and urged the booming coastal regions not to neglect  agriculture, according to press reports.    In a speech carried on the front page of major Chinese  newspapers, he observed that rationalisation of grain prices was  essential to the establishment of a stable grain purchasing and  selling mechanism.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] As of today, the Bank of Mexico [Banxico] will have  independent control of internal loan activities to ensure  stability for the nation's currency. Miguel Mancera Aguayo also  becomes the bank's first governor. So begins a new phase for  Banxico as an autonomous organization, within an atmosphere of  stability in the area of monetary policy, guarantees in the  fight against inflation, and the highest figure in international  reserves the country has ever seen. This means the central  financial institution will have independent control over  domestic credit and no government agency will have the authority  to order it to adjudicate funds to any other. This will ensure  the stability of the national currency's buying power.    Miguel Mancera Aguayo will head the organization as its  first  governor. He was a key figure in restricting the Mexican  economy. He had the ability to remain calm even in the most  difficult of times.    [Begin Mancera recording] The Board of Governors must  administrate Banxico's credit portfolio to attain stability in  the national currency's buying power [end recording]    Mancera Aguayo is the author of the consumer price stability  plan, which served as the basic economic policy strategy. He  was tasked with lowering the inflation rate from 160 percent in  1987 to annual figures under zero [as heard] and monthly figures  of only four-tenths of a percent. Banxico's independence is  another reason for the local and international financial  community to feel confident. It confirms the continuity and  honesty of the current economic plans.    Miguel Mancera Aguayo will hold the post of bank governor  for  three years and nine months. Different from the past, Mancera  will not be alone at the head of Banxico because he will have  four assistant governors to fill out the Board of Directors.</p>

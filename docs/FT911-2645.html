			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Lilley to stress innovation at DTI MR PETER Lilley, trade and industry secretary, will announce a revision of his department's formal objectives tomorrow in a speech setting out a free-market industrial policy for the 1990s. A greater emphasis on improving the quality of DTI staff, on innovation and on promoting deregulation will be included in a reworking of departmental objectives as set out in 1987 by Lord Young, the then trade and industry secretary. Mr Lilley's speech follows a 'brainstorming' weekend summit of DTI ministers last month at the home of Lord Hesketh, minister for industry. At the Institute of Directors in Birmingham, Mr Lilley will set out a non-interventionist role for government in industry, but he will stress his belief that the DTI has a role in promoting innovation. No change is expected in the DTI's 'department for enterprise' logo. His speech comes as the Labour party steps up its attack on the government's handling of the economy. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry spokesman, said the DTI had been turned into 'an adventure playground' for the No Turning Back Group of Thatcherite Conservatives of which Mr Lilley is a member. Lord Young set objectives of creating more competitive markets, improving information available to businessmen, extending privatisation and protecting consumers and investors. The emphasis was on enterprise, wealth creation and reducing red-tape. Mr Lilley will aim to build on, rather than alter, that free-market approach. But he will seek to counter critics' claims that the government does not have an industry policy, in particular by recognising the importance of manufacturing in the economy. He will argue that the long-term decline in manufacturing has been halted in the past decade. Mr Lilley will cite government efforts to win contracts in Kuwait for British companies as an example of how partnership is possible between industry and government. He wants to improve the quality of staff at the DTI so government assistance is more accessible. The DTI's regional offices could be used as 'one-stop shops' for businessmen to obtain information about all government department's programmes, including the training responsibilities of the Department of Employment.</p>

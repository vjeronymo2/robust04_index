			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Ford unions prepare to resist cuts: Compulsory redundancies feared WORKERS at Ford, leader in the UK market for new cars, are expected to face compulsory redundancies for the first time in almost 30 years following a meeting today between management and unions. Unions representing the 25,000 hourly paid workers say the company has withdrawn its proposal for a six-month pay freeze in return for voluntary job cuts, but expect Ford will still press for a 40 per cent pay cut for workers on short-time until the end of 1994. In September Ford said it would undertake to achieve the more than 1,500 job losses voluntarily if unions agreed to the package. The company warned that if there were insufficient volunteers by December 11 it would have to move to compulsory redundancies if the deal was rejected. Unions believe Ford can achieve job cuts voluntarily and say they will resist compulsory redundancies and the cut in lay-off pay. They warned that reductions in lay-off pay would affect productivity. Ford said in September it needed to shed workers at UK car-assembly and engine plants, saying it had 'half an assembly plant too much capacity'. Ford's 10,000 salaried staff were told last week to expect compulsory redundancies because of continuing weak demand. Ford's UK workforce fell from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 39,500 by late last year and is expected to fall below 34,900 by the end of this year. Last month the company announced production cuts affecting 5,500 workers at Dagenham and 1,800 at Southampton. It stopped all car and van production at two of its three UK assembly plants for a week and said it was extending the three-day and four-day working weeks at Dagenham and Southampton respectively. The job losses and production cuts underline Ford's European losses. In the third quarter its European automotive operations fell to a deficit of Dollars 479m because of continuing heavy losses at Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, and a sharp fall at Ford of Britain. Ford's US automotive operations incurred a loss of Dollars 153m in the third quarter. In September it announced it had returned to loss on its worldwide operations in the third quarter with a deficit of Dollars 159m (Pounds 101m), compared with a net profit of Dollars 840m in the first half of the year. Ford recently cut production in Belgium and this month announced a programme of non-production days at plants in Valencia and Cologne.</p>

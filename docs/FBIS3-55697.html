The statement was made  by a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official in Moscow.    According to sources in Belgrade, a delegation of the self-  proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina intends to arrive in  Moscow on Tuesday. The republic is a Serbian-populated area in  Croatia, conflicting with Zagreb, and favoring unification of  Serbian lands into a separate state.    A Russian diplomat said such a republic does not exist for  Russia. Russia maintains contacts with Croatia, which is a  member of the United Nations.</p>

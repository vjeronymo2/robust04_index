			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE INTERIOR?  </P> <P> Even his political opponents believe Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr.  of New Mexico is a truly nice and well-meaning person. But more than a few of  his friends, as well as critics, are convinced that Lujan is in over his head  as chief of an agency that is instrumental to President Bush's desire to become  known as the environmental President.  </P> <P> This view was reinforced Thursday by news accounts of a session between the  former congressman from New Mexico and a small group of reporters invited by  Lujan to his office to discuss Interior issues. Particularly embarrassing was  Lujan's failure to understand some of the very basic facts about how his  department administers the nation's public estate. For instance, Lujan  incorrectly insisted that the government receives royalty payments on minerals  gotten from mining claims that had been sold by the government to claim  holders.  </P> <P> When told of the error, The Times' Douglas Jehl reported, Lujan expressed  amazement and asked: "We don't get any royalties? We don't get any money?" Then  he added, "I didn't know what I was talking about. "  </P> <P> An official new to a sprawling department with a $10-billion budget -- Lujan  was selected for the post in late December and confirmed in February -- might  be excused for not knowing such seemingly obscure details. But Lujan dealt  constantly with these very same issues for 20 years as a congressman from New  Mexico, an important mining state, and as a longtime member of the House  Interior Committee. The sale of patented claims for as little as $2.50 an acre,  stemming from the Mining Claims Act of 1872, has been a matter of considerable  controversy for years.  </P> <P> Later in the same discussion, Lujan seemed confused about how the department  leases land for coal mining. This is only a symptom of the problems at  Interior, however, which is described by some insiders as an agency adrift and  riddled with depression and dissension.  </P> <P> When Lujan accepted the nomination, it was with the understanding that all the  key officials under former Secretary Donald P. Hodel would be replaced. The  clean-sweep concept presumably was Bush's way of ridding himself of the  anti-environment image of Interior under Ronald Reagan's secretaries, including  James G. Watt and Hodel, a Watt confidant.  </P> <P> But so far, most of the top jobs requiring Senate confirmation have not been  filled. Career Interior officials say that a few Hodel holdovers, although they  have been given notice, remain entrenched in key positions and continue to  exercise authority while they wait for their official departure dates, which  often are weeks away. News reports have noted that false stories spread by some  in this clique led to Lujan's firing of the department's respected  congressional liaison staffer, who had been recommended for a top Interior  appointment. Word is that Lujan later apologized to the victim, but took no  other action.  </P> <P> After Thursday's meeting with reporters, a Lujan aide said that at least people  would know they have a human secretary of the Interior. But that never was a  question. Lujan was well-liked during his long service in Congress. What the  people want, and need, is a secretary who will take charge of the Interior  Department and rescue it from the harshly exploitative and political mind-set  of the last eight years. Lujan must demonstrate this ability soon.  </P></p>

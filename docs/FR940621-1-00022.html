The Act requires the Service to make a final determination on such proposals within 12 months, but provides for a 6 month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to that determination. The Service finds that there is such a substantial disagreement concerning whether the Alabama sturgeon continues to exist and therefore extends the deadline with respect to the decision to list the Alabama sturgeon. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The deadline for final action on the proposal is now December 15, 1994.

Butler, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216 (904/232&hyph;2580). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This sturgeon, which is endemic to the Mobile River system in Alabama and Mississippi and was once widespread in this system, has had a significant decline in both population size and range in the Mobile River system. The fish may currently exist in only a short, free-flowing reach of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam in Clarke and Monroe Counties, Alabama. Primary factors that have likely contributed to the sturgeon's decline include dams, altered river flows, gravel-mining operations, general habitat degradation from land use practices, and, perhaps, overfishing, particularly at the turn of the century. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alabama sturgeon, once called the Alabama shovelnose sturgeon, or just shovelnose sturgeon, has been recognized since 1976 as a distinct, undescribed taxon (Ramsey 1976) that is most similar to the shovelnose sturgeon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scaphirhynchus platorynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the Mississippi River system and the Rio Grande. The Alabama sturgeon is a relatively small sturgeon; the maximum standard length is about 72 centimeters (28 inches). It has an elongated, heavily armored, depressed body and an attenuated caudal peduncle. The caudal fin has a long filament on the upper lobe that is characteristic of the genus. Sexual dimorphism is slight. Morphological characteristics of the juvenile Alabama sturgeon are unknown. The Alabama sturgeon can generally be distinguished from the shovelnose sturgeon of the Mississippi River system. The Alabama sturgeon almost always has larger eyes, it has different plate numbers posterior to the anal fin, there is a difference in dorsal fin ray numbers, and there are three diagnostic characters associated with its head armature (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alabama sturgeon is known only from the Mobile River system of Alabama and Mississippi. Historically, this sturgeon was found in the Mobile, Tensas, Alabama, Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Cahaba, Tallapoosa, and Coosa Rivers of the Mobile River system (Burke and Ramsey 1985). The only recent confirmed record (since about 1985) of the Alabama sturgeon is from the free-flowing portion of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Alabama sturgeon was once common in Alabama. In a statistical report to Congress in 1898 (U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries 1898), the total catch of shovelnose sturgeon from Alabama was 19,500 kilograms (kg) (42,900 pounds (lb)). Of this total, 18,000 kg (39,500 lb) came from the Alabama River, 1,000 kg (2,300 lb) from the Black Warrior River, and 500 kg (1,100 lb) from the Tennessee River. The shovelnose sturgeon reported from the Alabama and Black Warrior Rivers was the Alabama sturgeon; the sturgeon from the Tennessee River was from the Mississippi River system shovelnose sturgeon population. Any anonymous article in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama Game and Fish News  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in 1930 stated that the Alabama sturgeon was ``not uncommon.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

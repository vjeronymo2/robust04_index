			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives on Thursday [16 June] approved a bill to  introduce product liability for the first time in Japan and sent  it to the House of Councillors.    The upper house is expected to endorse the bill as early as  next week, setting the stage for the enforcement of the  legislation one year later. The new law, the first of its kind  in Japan, will make it easier for consumers to prove  manufacturer liability for damage stemming from defective  products.    The legislation had met strong opposition from some  lawmakers  within the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest opposition  party, who had demanded that blood products be exempted. The  Japan Society of Blood Transfusion had joined the LDP in  demanding an exemption of blood for transfusion, saying that the  bill could hurt the blood supply. The opposition did not lead  any change in the draft bill, but forced the government to  attach seven resolutions making it clear that an unavoidable  spread of viruses through blood transfusion at the current  scientific standards and blood transfusion reactions do not  constitute defects.</p>

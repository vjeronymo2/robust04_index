The office of Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat's in Tunis stressed that the Palestinian  leadership has decided to recall the Palestinian delegations  from negotiations with the Zionist entity in Paris, Washington,  Cairo, and Taba. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi,  leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, said the  Zionist crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque was planned and  premeditated by the occupation authorities and the troops in  charge of guarding the Ibrahimi Mosque. This is has been shown  by the fact that the Zionist assailants withdrew freely with all  their weapons under the cover of the enemy troops surrounding  the Ibrahimi Mosque. Al- Tamimi asked: How can an individual  -- as the occupation authorities are claiming -- kill and wound  400 people? He said: We have made a clear and specific  decision deeming every Zionist inside the occupied territory a  target of our revolutionaries' bullets. He added: We will  carry out the Palestinian response inside the occupied territory  before the blood of martyrs dries. He urged all other  Palestinian factions to stop their denunciations and to embark  on real action that restores the dignity of the blood that has  been spilled at the Ibrahimi Mosque.

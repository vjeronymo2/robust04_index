			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 17 Farvardin [16 April] -- Construction to  complete the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant has begun after years  of suspension, with the cooperation of Russian experts.    An informed official at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant gave  an interview to the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI in which he  announced the above. He said: Following the preliminary  agreements made with the Russians in the last few months,  construction to complete the first unit of the Bushehr Nuclear  Power Plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts of electrical  power began early this year with a four-year schedule. Russian  experts and specialists are now working on this power plant.    He added: So far 30,000 tons of essential parts for the  power  plant have been shipped into the country from Germany and are  being properly stored in warehouses. At the same time,  unfortunately about 7,000 tons of the power plant's essential  parts, whose price has been paid and legally belong to the  Islamic Republic of Iran, have been impounded in German ports.    Continuing, this informed official noted: Fortunately, 90  percent of the damage to the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant caused  by the imposed war will be repaired by the capable hands of  skilled domestic specialist manpower, and the rest will be  repaired in the course of the plant's operation.    It is necessary to explain that the 5.8-billion-mark [DM]  contract to build the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant was signed on  10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976] between the Iran Atomic Energy  Organization and the West German Kraft Werk Union Company. Based  on this contract, the aforementioned company was required to  build a nuclear electrical power plant consisting of two  pressurized light water units, each with a thermal capacity of  3,715 thermic megawatts [MW] and an electrical capacity of 1,296  MW on an 18-km site in the southwestern part of the province of  Bushehr. Of this amount, so far DM5.8 billion has been paid by  Iran.    In addition to this, separate contracts have also been  signed  to procure the needed fuel and 200,000 cubic meters of drinking  water for this complex, for which more than DM137 million and  DM394,000 and $43 million, respectively, has been paid to  Germany by the Iran Atomic Energy Organization.    Based on the same report, to implement these contracts so  far  about 85 percent of the construction on the Bushehr Nuclear  Power Plant has been completed, and about 65 percent of its  mechanical, electrical, and other installations have been  installed.    On the other hand, in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's contact with the  office of Engineer Mohsen Mehr 'Alizadeh, general manager of  power plants for the Iran Atomic Energy Organization, it was  announced that the full details of Iran's contract with the  Russians to complete the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant will soon  be announced.</p>

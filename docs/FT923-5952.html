			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wace falls 29% as competition bites - DTI inquiry may 'raise doubts' for potential new chief executive INTENSE COMPETITION in commercial printing and higher interest costs reduced pre-tax profit at Wace Group by 29 per cent, from Pounds 7.86m to Pounds 5.55m, in the first half of the year. The decline in operating profit from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 10.1m stemmed mainly from the UK printing side of the business, which accounted for about a third of the Pounds 156.5m (Pounds 148.3m) turnover. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said pre-press work had fared better, particularly in the US. Mr ten Bos took on executive responsibilities following the resignation of Mr John Clegg as managing director in January. The Department of Trade and Industry has since been investigating share dealings in the names of some of Mr Clegg's relatives. Wace reiterated that it had nothing to fear from the investigation. Meanwhile, Mr ten Bos acknowledged that the inquiry might raise a doubt in the mind of a potential new chief executive. None has yet been recruited, although he said the group had no need to rush into the appointment. UK operating profit slipped to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 6.81m) on Pounds 79.2m (Pounds 77m) turnover. One commercial printing subsidiary lost Pounds 500,000. 'Some competitors were quoting at less than the cost of materials,' he said. More than 1,000 printing companies had gone out of business last year and 'a hell of a lot more will go to the wall this year'. Label printing and packaging had done well, but work related to advertising, publicity and mail order had suffered. In the US, operating profit rose 55 per cent to Pounds 3.65m. 'Last year we had a few bleeders. That has been stopped, said Mr ten Bos. On the Continent, growth in Germany and Italy helped operating profit to reach Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.11m). Interest charges rose to Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 3.41m) and net debt at the end of June rose from Pounds 80.4m to Pounds 90.6m, giving gearing of 125 per cent. Mr Stephen Puckett, finance director, said this was partly caused by Pounds 3.3m of earn-out payments made in cash. Another Pounds 4.3m was satisfied in shares. Cash-flow would be positive in the second half. Earnings per share fell to 2.9p (5.2p). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.25p. COMMENT These results showed the resilience of the pre-press business and reflected well on management action to eliminate losses. Although the group will remain slightly cash negative this year, stability seems to have been achieved with the tailing off of earn-outs. Reducing the debt will depend on progress in disposing of the Pounds 64m property portfolio, which can hardly be a rapid process. After a seasonally better second half, full-year pre-tax profit is forecast to reach Pounds 15m, giving a prospective p/e of 10 on yesterday's close of 90p. Although the dividend payments (including the preference shares) were not covered by profit in the first half, the betting is that the final will be maintained to offer a yield of 12 per cent. The yield on the convertible bonds is about 18 per cent. While the stock is not without its attractions, the DTI inquiry, the weak dollar and the chief executive lacuna act as a drag. And some risk remains because of high debt and exposure to the UK media sector.</p>

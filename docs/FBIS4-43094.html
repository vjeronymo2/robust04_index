			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a barrage of explosions last night in the  center of Athens. Specifically, within 15 minutes at around  midnight homemade explosive devices went off in a school bus  from the Kostas Yitonas educational institute at the  intersection of Skiros and Evelpidhes Streets in Kipseli [Athens  suburb], at a refreshment shop on Andrianos Street in Plaka  [Athens district], and outside the Thivai textile mill on  Kapnitareas Street.    A very strong explosion also took place at 0230 today at the  intersection of Vasilissis Sofias and (Iridhanos) Streets,  destroying a small, white truck with the registration No. YZ8660.    The Antiauthority Battle [Andiexousiastiki Pali]  organization  made a telephone call to a private radio station claiming  responsibility only for the first explosion.</p>

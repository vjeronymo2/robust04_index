			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: When seniority is replaced by merit Even if it confirmed a trend which had already started, the lead article several weeks ago on the front page of the Nikkei, Japan's national economic daily, is likely to have shaken many loyal Japanese businessmen. Nissan, Japan's second largest vehicle maker, it reported, would abolish seniority-based pay for nearly 3,000 managers and would be putting them on a performance-related pay scheme. The news that one of Japan's most prominent industrial groups was planning to do away with the cherished tradition of seniority was a clear signal to Japan's hard-working salarymen that the secure life of ever-rising incomes could no longer be taken for granted. Nissan is not alone in trying to restructure its salary system. A growing number of Japanese companies is experimenting with schemes that allow salaries to reflect better an employee's performance. Fujitsu, for example, is trying to do this with the bonuses its managers receive twice a year. Honda, the car maker, adopted an annual salary system last year whereby pay is linked to performance in the previous year. The trend is being spurred by changes in the Japanese economy and in the working environment, says Haruyoshi Nishio, general manager in the Human Resources Department at Marubeni, the trading house. The Japanese system of paying employees according to seniority worked well for companies while the economy was growing. It fostered corporate loyalty and allowed companies to repay that loyalty in the form of increasing salaries. Seniority was also a method of assessing an employee's contribution to the company and complemented the Japanese belief in the value of experience and in wisdom in old age. But it also created a cosy environment in which mediocrity was condoned. Since employees' basic salary increased each additional year they worked with the company, there was little incentive, in terms of pay, to do more or better. Katsuhiko Sato, deputy general manager of the company's personnel department, points out the maturing of the Japanese economy and the ageing population have undermined the seniority-based pay system in recent years. At the same time, length of service and hours of work do not necessarily lead to better performance in a world where value-added work has increasingly taken over from mass-volume production. 'It may have been true with factory work in the past but is not necessarily true with many of the jobs performed today,' says Yuri Momomoto, manager of public relations at Fujitsu. 'In software, for example, some people can write a programme in a few days while others will take weeks.' Better employee motivation obviously lies at the heart of many of the changes. But companies are conscious of the need to ensure that performance is measured as objectively and fairly as possible. To do so they have introduced systems for employees to agree performance targets with their superiors and jointly assess the results at the end of the fiscal year. In public relations, for example, a department head might agree with a superior to approach new publications, or sponsor innovative seminars to spread knowledge of the company and its products. At the end of the year, they would discuss whether these targets had been successfully reached. Setting such targets not only provides managers with some objective measurement for performance but also helps to clarify an employee's job aims. 'During the years of high growth, the goal was always the same and very clear: to sell more products,' says Shin Tanaka, manager of public relations at Honda. 'But as growth has slowed, the goal is no longer as clear and that is why the productivity of white collar workers seems so low.' One lingering fear even among companies that have embraced performance-related pay, is that the greater emphasis on individual performance could destroy the group harmony that has served Japanese companies so well in the past. Nevertheless, the move by some companies to introduce merit as a barometer for pay indicates Japanese employment practices face a significant turning point as companies struggle to adapt to an economic environment markedly different from the growth years that formed the basis for those practices in the first place.</p>

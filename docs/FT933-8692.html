			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Call to curb ERM speculators: Belgium joins France in urging tighter controls on currency dealing BELGIUM, current president of the European Community, and France have joined forces to call for tougher measures to stop currency speculators forcing devaluations of currencies inside Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The calls reflect growing political pressure on the European continent for action to curb international trading practices in the currency markets, tempered by a realisation of the political and financial risks involved. On Thursday, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, blamed currency speculators for the crisis in the ERM and called for reform of the international monetary and financial system. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, said yesterday that currency speculation was 'a type of transaction which does not know any rules, no costs and no taxes'. But an EC official said the reimposition of capital controls would split the EC and damage the single European market. 'It is like using a nuclear weapon,' he said. The political pressure follows a month in which the credibility of the ERM has been severely undermined by currency speculation. The EC finance ministers agreed two weeks ago to widen the fluctuation bands in an effort to save the system and staunch further selling of currencies, particularly the French franc. Yesterday the franc fell heavily against the D-Mark, dropping nearly 2 1/2 centimes to FFr3.538, its lowest ever close against the German currency. In late New York trading it slipped to around FFr3.54. The Danish krone also fell sharply for the second day running, dropping to DKr4.1425 against the D-Mark after opening at DKr 4.1275. It recovered a little in New York to DKr4.1330. The Dutch guilder also fell. The principal reason for the franc's fall was this week's disclosure that the Bank of France had negative net foreign currency reserves. Markets were also unnerved by Mr Balladur's comments that France was considering exchange controls. At the close of ERM trading, there were almost 8 1/2 percentage points dividing the strongest and weakest currencies, more than half the new 15 per cent fluctuation band agreed on August 2. EC ministers appear to be using psychological warfare to strengthen currencies against speculative attack. Mr Maystadt said it would be 'imprudent' to narrow the ERM's new 15 per cent fluctuation margins without first having perfected 'weapons of defence' to counter speculative movements. In La Libre Belgique, Mr Maystadt said he was not advocating a reimposition of controls to stop the free movement of capital in the EC: 'But we must find ways so it is no longer easy for speculators to place the (European Monetary) System in difficulty.' EC finance ministers are scheduled to discuss the ERM crisis on September 13 in Brussels. Without pre-empting the talks, Mr Maystadt suggested that they may wish to discuss the possible use of 'safeguards', a reference to powers contained in the 1988 EC capital movement directive. Under Article 3 of the directive, the European Commission may authorise member states to take protective measures lasting up to six months, 'where short-term capital movements of exceptional magnitude impose severe strains on foreign exchange markets and lead to serious disturbances in the conduct of national monetary and exchange rate policies'.

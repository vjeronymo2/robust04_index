			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Midland in deal with Japanese card issuer Midland Bank has signed an agreement with JCB, the Japanese charge card company, to handle its retail business in the UK. The deal opens the way for JCB, the largest charge card company in Japan to increase its network of retailers from 10,000 to 50,000 by 1995. At present JCB's UK business is almost entirely confined to the 500,000 Japanese tourists and business travellers who visit the UK each year. However, the company last year announced plans to become a card issuer in the US and UK, a move which will eventually bring it into direct competition with American Express and Diners Club. One problem JCB faces in trying to expand its UK retailnetwork is that many retailers hate the high commissions required by charge cards. American Express has an average commission of about 4 per cent, compared to about 1.6 per cent for Visa or MasterCard. A new player in the market such as JCB would face higher costs and so probably have to ask retailers for a commission well above this. However, large retailers could decide that this was worth-paying in order to attract business from high-spending Japanese customers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Nabil Sharitah, a 43-year-old  Syrian diplomat, today denied having transported the explosives  used in an attack on the Maison de France [French cultural  center in West Berlin].    Testifying to the 29th Criminal Bench of Berlin Regional  Court, Sharitah, who was hidden from the view of journalists and  the public by a curtain, admitted that on 25 August 1983 he gave  explosives stored at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin to  46-year-old terrorist, Johannes Weinrich, only a few hours  before the attack on the French cultural center on  Kurfuerstendamm.    Sharitah, who was third secretary of the Syrian Embassy at  the time and in charge of security, claims he learned of the  purpose for which the terrorist needed the explosives only after  the attack. The witness confirmed that the ambassador had  assigned him to look after Johannes Weinrich and other  terrorists. The ambassador had acted on instructions from the  Syrian Foreign Ministry.    At the start of his testimony, the diplomat, who recently  gave himself up to the German authorities, said he hopes the  case will not become a trial of his country. Syria had nothing  to do with the attack on the Maison de France.    The defendant, 51-year-old former Stasi [GDR Ministry for  State Security] Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, is charged with  having been an accessory to murder and to the explosives attack  on the Maison de France. He is accused of having arranged for  25 kilos of explosives, which the terrorists had temporarily  stored at the Syrian Embassy before the attack, to be handed  over to Weinrich.    One person was killed and 23 were injured, some seriously,  in  the bomb attack.</p>

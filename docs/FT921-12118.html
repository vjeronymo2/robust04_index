			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: IBM Australia in red for first time IBM Australia, an offshoot of US computer group International Business Machines, has plunged into the red for the first time in its 60 years of operation in Australia. The company reported it had turned a ADollars 241m (USDollars 185.3m) profit into a ADollars 389m loss in 1991 on a near-ADollars 600m slide in revenue to ADollars 1.34m from ADollars 1.93m. The result forms part of a USDollars 2.8m loss reported earlier by the US group. Despite its own difficulties, the parent has injected ADollars 200m into the Australian offshoot, the first such support package since the early 1980s. Mr Brian Finn, IBM Australia managing director, said the injection was needed because the Australian company was not generating enough cash and because it needed to maintain balance sheet ratios to hold its debt rating. The loss reduced shareholders' funds at December 31 to Dollars 269m from ADollars 386m and total assets to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 2.05bn. Mr Finn said that widely-defined capital spending, which rose to ADollars 401m from ADollars 362m, would probably increase again in 1992. He confirmed that IBM Australia expected to complete a 25 per cent staff reduction which would see 1,200 employees leave by the end of February, mainly through voluntary redundancies. This was expected to cut about ADollars 75 m from costs in a full year.</p>

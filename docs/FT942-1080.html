			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Nigerian respect for Maradona - Soccer Nigeria, who meet Argentina in Boston today following a 3-0 win in their World Cup debut against Bulgaria, say they are not afraid of Argentina's rehabilitated star, Diego Maradona. 'Maradona is a respected player,' said Nigeria's Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof. 'We respect him, but we are not afraid of him.' Both teams won their opening games and know they have relatively weak opponents in their last games, so today's Group D match could turn into a goal-chasing clash of two powerful forward lines. But Maradona advised caution against Nigeria.</p>

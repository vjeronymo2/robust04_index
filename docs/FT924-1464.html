			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gota Bank's shares worthless, says S-E Banken SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, said yesterday that shares in Gota Bank, the country's fourth largest, were worthless, improving prospects for Gota's reconstruction. S-E Banken made its gesture conditional on the administrator of Gota AB, the holding group which collapsed in September, handing the shares over to the state. Five years ago, S-E Banken lent SKr1.1bn to Gota AB in return for all Gota Bank's shares as collateral. S-E Banken stressed it still hoped to get back a substantial amount of its loan. Gota Bank's reconstruction will take place under Sweden's new support programme for the country's banking system.</p>

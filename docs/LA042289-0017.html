			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIONIS FACES TRIAL IN ATTACK ON AISSA WAYNE; BAIL AT $250,000  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas A. Gionis was ordered Friday to stand trial for an attack on his  ex-wife Aissa Wayne, daughter of actor John Wayne, after a judge found that  authorities had amassed enough evidence to link the wealthy orthopedic surgeon  to two street thugs who carried out the assault last fall.  </P> <P> Judge Susanne S. Shaw of Harbor Municipal Court in Newport Beach set bail of  $250,000 for Gionis over the strong objections of prosecutors, but she offered  a scathing summary of the evidence against the surgeon, concluding that he  "snapped" as a result of a divorce and bitter custody battle over the couple's  only child, 2-year-old Anastasia.  </P> <P> "You went off the deep end," Shaw said to Gionis after a weeklong preliminary  hearing.  </P> <P> Gionis, 35, of Pomona, had been denied bail since his arrest April 4 because  authorities considered him a flight risk. Gionis' lawyer, F. Lee Bailey,  predicted Friday afternoon that his client would be released soon.  </P> <P> Gionis is charged with conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon in the  Oct. 3 assault on Wayne, 33, and her then-boyfriend, millionaire financier  Roger W. Luby, 53, at Luby's gated Newport Beach estate. Wayne was bloodied and  Luby suffered a slashed Achilles' tendon in the attack, which prosecutors  contend was ordered by Gionis as a warning to Wayne.  </P> <P> Gionis has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have said he knew  nothing about the attack.  </P></p>

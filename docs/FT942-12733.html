			<p>940428 FT  28 APR 94 / People: Vice-Admiral to steer BSI Retired Vice-Admiral Sir Neville Purvis has been appointed chief executive of the British Standards Institution. Sir Neville served until February as Chief of Fleet Support in the Royal Navy. BSI says Sir Neville has 'extensive experience at senior management level in a complex and diverse organisation like BSI'. The BSI has been without a chief executive at the bridge since last year when Michael Sanderson stepped down after 18 months over what the BSI called a 'deep disagreement on important matters of policy and management'. The BSI will not expand on the disagreement. BSI's problems came to a head last November when a row with its members turned down plans to strengthen the powers of the directors and to double directors' fees. Sir Neville said yesterday that the BSI had faced 'problems of communication rather than substance'. He said the BSI was an important conduit between industry and the international organisations where many standards are now agreed.</p>

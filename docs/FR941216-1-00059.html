Appropriate adjustments are made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as of the leg-out date to reflect any difference between the fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market value of the qualifying debt instrument and the adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price of the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying debt instrument is subject to &sect;1.1275&hyph;4, a holder must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the principles of &sect;1.1275&hyph;4(b)(9)(i) to compute interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accruals on the instrument after the leg-out date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) If the qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise terminated, the synthetic debt instrument is treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold for its fair market value on the leg-out date and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is treated as entered into at its fair market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value immediately after the taxpayer legs out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) If a taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposing of or otherwise terminating a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of legging into the integrated transaction, then any loss or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section is not allowed.

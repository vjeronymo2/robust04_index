			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tory party denies new turmoil after MP's death Concern about the political consequences of the bizarre death of a Conservative MP was growing among Tory backbenchers yesterday, in spite of plans by Mr John Major to launch yet another attempt to shore up his government's authority. Party leaders sought to distance the government from the death on Monday of Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, which was still being investigated by police last night. 'I think the public will take the view that this kind of tragedy could take place in any party, in any organisation, and will view it in that way,' said Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party. The circumstances of Mr Milligan's death, which were leaked by junior police officers, prompted a flood of rumours about other MPs. MMr Milligan was found on the floor of his west London house, bound and gagged and wearing women's underwear. The cause of Mr Milligan's death was unclear. A post mortem was 'inconclusive'. Scotland Yard refused to rule out murder. Shocked Tory MPs drew comfort from the reluctance of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats to exploit the affair, which is being regarded by the opposition parties as a personal matter. Party officials hope the opposition silence will ensure that the political impact is less damaging than other recent scandals such as the admission by Mr Tim Yeo, a junior minister, that he had fathered a child outside marriage. But some Conservatives said the response to Mr Milligan's death demonstrated the danger of the prime minister's determination to stand by his back to basics campaign for a return to traditional values. 'The back to basics campaign is too inward looking,' said Ms Emma Nicholson, Tory MP for Devon West. 'It has become a self-destructive slogan. I think we should drop it.' Downing Street said Mr Major would use a visit to Leicester to tell party workers and regionalnewspaper editors that he is'supremely confident' about the government's prospects. A senior official said the prime minister 'does not share' the growing view at Westminster that the government's authority is ebbing in the turmoil of events. 'Turmoil? What can you be speaking of?' the official said. Mr Major told Tory backbenchers during a series of meetings at the Commons that the back to basics campaign would would be steered away from personalities in future. The government dismissed suggestions that Mr Milligan's death might have security implications. He was parliamentary private secretary to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence minister. The defence department said Mr Milligan, who was not vetted by the security services, had no access to classified documents. The government is expected to announce the Eastleigh by-election will be held on May 5 to coincide with local elections in metropolitan areas.</p>

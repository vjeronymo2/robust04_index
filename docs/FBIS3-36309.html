			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A strict itinerary for the  Russian delegation in Georgia ruled out the opportunity for a  conversation with Russian Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. However,  after his talks with the Georgian prime minister on 3 February,  he found some free minutes.    Oleg Soskovets said that, historically, our peoples have  always been together. Everything that is happening today  reflects the aspiration of the two parties, that is, to support  what was stipulated by history. One cannot gamble with the  welfare of the people, but people can endure anything, including  unreasonable activities, for a certain length of time.    Responding to our correspondent's question about the  importance of the CIS, Mr. Oleg Soskovets said: This  Commonwealth is an opportunity to protect our traditions,  economic relations, and industrial union. It is necessary to  admit that sensible unities are justified and to realize that  the life of the people and the improvement of their life is  principal. Now we are independent states. We have our own  policy and free economic relations. We are building them on an  absolutely new basis of equality. All of this is a proof that  politicians as well as people have become wiser.    Asked the question, Have you discussed the issue of  Georgia's  joining the ruble zone with the prime minister?, Mr. Soskovets  answered: We have not discussed the issue this time. We have  discussed ways to arrange the restoration of broken economic  relations and, in particular, possibilities to stabilize  Georgia's power and fuel economy and secure transport movement  between Georgia and Russia.</p>

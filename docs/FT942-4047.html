			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / The Long View: Missing the bullseye Now you see them, now you don't. This week, British Printing joined the list of the amazing disappearing new issues. It followed Life Style Care, a nursing home group, and General Cable and TeleWest, two cable TV operators, snatched at the last minute off the public offering list. But the season's biggest flotation, that of the venerable venture capital giant 3i, is still on schedule for later this month. Hundreds of companies are reputed to be planning flotations on the London market but time might be running out. Usually, around 100 companies are floated each year although, in 1992, the figure dipped to 82 in the economic recession. Last year, however, new listings soared to 182. As for 1994, the annualised rate in the first five months of the year has been 280. The flow of companies to the market is always cyclical, but this time it is exceptionally so. This is probably because of the large number of management buy-outs which have been financed riskily through borrowings and venture capital during the past few years. Such companies have only once chance of hitting the bullseye and paying back the maximum amount of those liabilities when they float. The financial market cycle swings amazingly from one extreme to another: from cheap money and expensive shares to the reverse. When, at the beginning of February, base rates dipped to 5 1/4 per cent and the Footsie index was around 3,500, the timing for issues was perfect. Today's Johnny-come-latelies may have missed the boat, but some still think it is worthwhile trying to get through the tunnel. In America, the new issue cycle has been somewhat ahead of the UK's. Equity underwritings rocketed from a trough of Dollars 24bn in 1990 to a peak of Dollars 131bn in 1993, but have been falling back this year. The key to it all is the turning point for short-term interest rates. This has been reached in the US although not yet in the UK. But longer-term rates have jumped already in Britain, leading to the present hiatus in the housing market where buyers had become hooked on the very low medium-term fixed rates on offer during the winter but which now have been jacked up from, say, 6 1/2 to 8 1/2 per cent. Short-term sterling interest rates have not risen since October 1989 (apart from the transitory flurry on Black Wednesday) and bank base rates have actually fallen 15 times in a row. But once these short-term floating rates begin to climb, the behaviour of savers will change significantly. Remember that in 1989, when base rates finished at 15 per cent, the personal sector increased its holdings of bank and building society holdings by Pounds 39bn while being a net seller of company securities worth Pounds 20.1bn (and gilts worth Pounds 3.3bn). Last year, the corresponding rise in savings deposits was only Pounds 10.3bn (less than the interest credited) and the personal sector was a net buyer of company securities and gilts to the tune of Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 5.4bn respectively. The clever new-issue sponsor is the one who catches the precise moment at which investors feel under maximum pressure to switch into long-term investments. Perhaps I could single out Kleinwort Benson with its brilliantly-timed European Privatisation investment trust launched in January. It collected commitments of Pounds 500m from 85,000 investors - and that was after sending Pounds 380m back. Unfortunately, a good time for selling is not likely to be a good time for buying. The 50p paid shares have tumbled to an effective 36.2p and investors will soon have to dig into their pockets for the other 50p instalment due in August. (See page VI). The new-issue glut has not by itself caused the recent stock market setback but there is an accumulating burden upon the capacity of both private and institutional investors, especially for shares in small companies. In 1990, share issues raised only Pounds 4.4bn; and after a leap to Pounds 11.1bn in 1991, when many big companies patched up the damage of the recession through rights issues, the total fell back to Pounds 6.4bn in 1992. Last year, however, the figure soared to Pounds 16.3bn and has been running at an even higher annual rate in 1994. This supply problem has been aggravated by the low level of company take-overs. It is all part of the same logic: companies have seen shares as being expensive and so have preferred to sell them rather than buy. Whereas in 1989 Pounds 17bn was paid in cash to the shareholders of acquired companies, providing them with plenty of extra resources for investment elsewhere, that figure was less than Pounds 2bn in 1993. Much of the money raised by recent new issues has been used to pay off bank loans. Last year, for instance, industrial and commercial companies reduced their bank indebtedness by Pounds 12bn (serving perhaps to explain the eagerness of the banks to buy their way deeper into the house mortgage business). Perhaps the banks should watch and wait patiently. After all, corporate loan demand is reviving again in the US and banks are reported to be short of loan officers, until recently thought to be a redundant breed. This mirror-image feast and famine of loans and flotations would be viewed by Germans as a typical symptom of Anglo-US short-termism. Companies rush through a 'window' so their backers can find an 'exit'. Next year may be too late. Ironically, the big market newcomer caught up in this tangle is the UK's premier venture capital group, 3i, which has itself helped to float more than 800 companies. But it is hard for a big company with a March year-end to float any time other than summer. Fortunately, most investors are ready to make room in their portfolio for a substantial company with a good name and reputation. For scores of flimsy minnows still hoping to cash in on the tail end of a boom, the outlook is much less promising.</p>

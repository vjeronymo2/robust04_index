			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / People: Pentos seeks to turn over a new leaf at Dillons Pentos has had a rough time of things lately; no signs of fair weather in the offing yet either, as Frank Brazier, 50, chief executive of Dillons, the bookstore chain, yesterday abruptly cleared his desk and departed from the Pentos board and the helm of Dillons after spending 11 years with the company. Bill McGrath, Pentos' chief executive, was unavailable for comment on Brazier's resignation, though his going will inevitably be seen in the context of Pentos' recent financial and structural difficulties, which some close to the company describe as a 'horrible mess'. McGrath formally took over as chief executive at the beginning of this year. Analysts are forecasting significant group losses for the current year's trading, following exceptional charges likely to be near the Pounds 30m mark. Having paid Pounds 3.7m for 53 Ryman Computer Stores two years ago, Pentos sold off the chain for Pounds 100,000 at the beginning of this year to People's Phone. Some of the group's 172 Athena poster shops are believed to be on the market. Group debts peaked at Pounds 86m before Christmas. Strapped for cash, Pentos is imminently expected to announce a rights issue in order to fill a black hole which some expect to be as high as Pounds 65m in total losses this year. Back in February the group was ticked off by the Financial Reporting Review Panel for failing sufficiently to disclose the level reverse premiums on its shop leases - the payments made by landlords to attract key tenants - contributed to 1992 profits. Turning the pages of Pentos' recent fortunes has not, therefore, been a happy experience, and recovery will not be easy. Evidently McGrath has thought it time to act, and to address Dillons' problems at a senior level, Paul Hogarth, 51, has been brought back to be operations director from a similar role with another part of the group, the Ryman stationery stores. Meanwhile, Brazier's successor is to be Joe Sinyor, 36, former chief executive of the clothing company Pepe Group between 1990 and 1992. Sinyor's title will be managing director at Dillons; he will have his feet under the table by the end of March. His strategic expertise will come in handy at Dillons, where control over inventory levels and management information systems is regarded as having gone rather awry.</p>

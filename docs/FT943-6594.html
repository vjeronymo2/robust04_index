			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Manifesto for the party party In what is bound to prove a lucrative deal for one of my companies, Party Animals plc, I signed up this week to handle image projection and media manipulation on behalf of Tony Blair, the young and vibrantly dynamic leader of Britain's Labour Party. You don't like vibrantly dynamic? Then tune out, vamoose, because at Party Animals that is how we talk, hiply and tautologously, knowing, as we do, that while all our clients are hip, some are also brain-dead and need all the help they can get, though not Tony Blair, I swiftly hasten to add. What does Party Animals do? Well, one of the things it does, obviously, is organise parties. In recent months I and my assistants - Mark, Winston, Mariella and Kinkyboo - have organised parties for Madonna, George Michael, Ben Elton, Charles Saatchi, Maurice Saatchi, Samantha Goggin, Olivia Jackson-Pugh, Princess Margaret, Eddie George, Michael Portillo and Giles Bartleet-Zinn-Pasternak. I have become London's most sought-after party planner. I also organise previews, premiers, exhibitions and club openings - any high-profile, media-friendly event that creates by association a trendy image for a product or a person at a fraction of the sum it costs to use a slick advertising agency. As I told the Labour Party bigwigs when summoned to a meeting at Walworth Road this week: 'Ad agencies start by asking how big the client's budget is, whereas I start from the other end by telling them how big my fee is, and grossing things up from there. 'My average party deal gives me a profit of Pounds 13,000. Madonna was far bigger, as was Princess Margaret, whereas Eddie George - sherry and a cheese dip for the relics of the banking press - yielded only Pounds 300. But my parties for Tony would probably hit the average: Pounds 13,000 for me, which means Pounds 20,000 to you. Between now and the general election I will organise 30 parties for Tony at a cost to you of Pounds 600,000, an unbelievably microscopically invisible-to-the-naked-eye sum when expressed as a fraction of the mainstream advertising budget I believe you were contemplating.' I glanced at my assistants. Mark, Winston, Mariella and Kinkyboo stroked the frames of their Benetton sunglasses, tapped their Haagen-Dazs ice-cream spoons on the rims of their Haagen-Dazs ice-cream tubs, drummed their Gucci loafers, flicked back their Tony &amp; Guy hair, flashed their Swatch-swathed wrists, straightened their Comme des Garcons jackets, waved their Dunhill pens - and smiled their youthful, laundered, laid-back smiles to signal approval of the course I was plotting. 'Why parties?' asked one of the drabbies on the other side of the table. (Labour's key election committee is comprised entirely of smart-alecs and drabbies.) 'Well,' I said. 'The voters have a good idea of where Tony is coming from. Durham childhood, Scottish schooling, played in a band at Oxford called Ugly Rumours, never did drugs, hardly even drank, became a Christian and a socialist, joined Labour, qualified as a barrister, ear-marked as a certain Labour leader very early on, spearheads the modernisers, into partnership, social justice, cohesion and community, charming, fluent and telegenic. 'Good. Extremely good. Very good poll vibes. Whichever way you slice the Haagen-Dazs, Tony comes out well. But I've been looking at the demographics, and there is one little chink of worrying concern talking to me loud and clear. Blairism scores mega-ratings with the 18-25's, the 26-39's, the 40-46's, the 56-79's and the over-79's. See what I mean? There is a little chink of worrying concern among the 47-55's, the age group that derived its life-values from the mores of the 1960s - air-heads, most of them, but significant as a voting bloc. 'What the demographics tell me is that Tony skates home against Major with all but the 47-55's. They recoil from his straightness and clappy-happy evangelism. So with the 47-55's I nurse this little chink of worrying concern. What do the 47-55's like most? They like parties. So we'll platform Tony at 30 parties at a cost to you of Pounds 600,000, an unbelievably microscopically - ' At that moment, Tony walked in. He was wearing jeans, T-shirt, Swatch and beads. 'Hi, guys,' he said, smiling pleasantly. 'Are we ready to boogie?' I knew that my fee was in the bag.</p>

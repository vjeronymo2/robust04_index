			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A report has come out envisaging the reactivation of  the Super-Phoenix [fast breeder reactor] under certain  conditions. (Andre-Claude Lacoste) of the Nuclear Safety  Directorate says in this report -- which was submitted this  morning to the Industry and Environment Ministry -- that from  the point of view of safety, the reactivation of the reactor  could be authorized given two conditions: that the work on  combatting sodium leaks is completed successfully, and that the  reactor should be brought into service at reduced power for a  few months. In other words, Super-Phoenix will be reactivated.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emission tests which include driving cycles are called ``transient tests,'' and are performed by running a vehicle on a treadmill device known as a dynamometer which allows the vehicle to be driven in place and which can be made to simulate road load conditions by increasing the resistance on the treadmill rollers. Transient tests capture a known volume of exhaust and produce actual grams-per-mile results as opposed to the relative concentration values generated by steady-state, idle tests. Transient, mass emission testing also measures fuel economy, and the results can be provided to the vehicle owner. A transient test known as the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) has been used for certification testing of new vehicles for over twenty years and is considered the yardstick by which other testing strategies are measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A full Federal Test Procedure involves special vehicle preparation and takes several hours to conduct, making it impractical as an I/M test type. But EPA has developed a shortened version of the FTP known as the IM240, which more closely reflects how vehicles perform under actual driving conditions than do current idle inspections, while also being short enough to be practical in an I/M setting (the ``240'' stands for the maximum number of seconds it takes to perform an IM240 test). In its development and evaluation of the IM240, EPA has found the test to be superior to alternative I/M testing strategies for all relevant evaluation criteria, including accuracy and overall cost effectiveness. Using the pass/fail limits proposed in this action, the IM240 has been shown to have a zero percent false fail rate, while also accurately identifying the vast majority of the highest emitting vehicles. The result is that the IM240 is able to get more emission reductions by failing fewer cars than is the case for other I/M tests yielding comparable emission reductions. Furthermore, since the equipment required to perform the IM240 is based upon that used to perform certification testing, IM240 test sites will not become obsolete with future changes in vehicle technology; driving cycles and testing algorithms may require changes in software, but the hardware configuration will remain substantially similar well into the next century. Transient testing is also the only currently known reliable way to test for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> something not possible with an idle-based test, yet nevertheless required in order to achieve the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions necessary for ozone attainment, and specifically required by section 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enhanced I/M program being proposed in this action also includes two functional tests to detect excessive evaporative emissions. Over the last several years, EPA has learned that vapors which escape from various points in a vehicle's fuel system represent a huge source of hydrocarbon emissions, generally greater than those present in now highly controlled tailpipe exhaust. In response to this finding, EPA has developed two functional tests which can determine whether vehicle evaporative emission control systems are operating properly. The first test is a simple pressure check to find leaks in the fuel system (e.g., bad gas caps or cracked evaporative system hoses). The test, referred to as the ``pressure test,'' is simple to perform and highly cost effective. The second test_called the ``purge test''_is a check of the evaporative system's purge function, which involves removing gasoline vapors stored in the charcoal canister and routing them to the engine where they can be burned as fuel. The purge test is performed in conjunction with the IM240 (i.e., while the vehicle is operating on the dynamometer). Performance of the purge test is not possible using a traditional idle inspection, since most automobiles are not designed to purge extra vapors when they are not needed during the idle mode.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to use the IM240, and purge and pressure testing, as the main group of high-technology emissions tests around which the FIP's I/M program would be built. The FIP's I/M program would also retain the current Smog Check program's visual antitampering inspections for the air pump and PCV system, but would eliminate the catalyst, inlet, and evaporative canister inspections. The evaporative canister inspection would be eliminated because it would be redundant in the face of the more rigorous purge and pressure tests. The catalyst and inlet checks would be eliminated because the IM240 is sufficiently sensitive to detect the fact that a catalyst has either been removed or poisoned through the use of leaded fuel. The air pump check, on the other hand, would be retained because this emission control device only operates during cold start conditions and its malfunction affects emissions only in this driving mode. Since vehicles will generally be warmed up by the time they arrive for their I/M inspection, this type of malfunction is difficult to detect without a visual inspection. The PCV inspection would be retained because malfunction of this device can produce emission leaks that are not detectable through the tailpipe. Lastly, the FIP's I/M inspection would also include a test portion involving connection to and the interrogation of the onboard diagnostic (OBD) computer on vehicles so equipped beginning with the 1994 model year. Information in the form of trouble codes would be downloaded from the OBD computer and analyzed for the presence of emissions-related system malfunctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the proposed FIP I/M program's inspections would be conducted in compliance with the test procedure guidance developed and issued by EPA in conjunction with the I/M rule. The IM240 standards will be set at the following gram-per-mile cutpoints for HC, CO, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , respectively, for Tier 0 vehicles (with somewhat more stringent first and second test cycle standards for Tier 1, TLEV, LEV, and ULEV vehicles in the pre-1999 model year group):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First test cycle: 1.2 / 20 / 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second test cycle: 0.8 / 15 / 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third test cycle: 0.6 / 10 / 1.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third test cycle cutpoints represent the final IM240 cutpoints for 1983&hyph;1998 model year vehicles and would be used for all subsequent test cycles. Model year 1999 and newer vehicles are addressed as part of the discussion of the enhanced in-use compliance program in section III.D.2.d of this preamble; I/M cutpoints for these vehicles are contained in Appendix 1, section A(4). EPA is also in the process of developing test procedures for performing the OBD check portion of an I/M inspection and will propose these as amendments to the I/M rule later in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / MPs angry at delay to Bingham SIGNS from the Treasury that the Bingham report on the collapse of BCCI may not be published until after the Commons summer recess provoked an angry response from MPs yesterday, Ralph Atkins writes. More than 100 MPs - mostly from the Labour party - have signed an early day motion calling on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to ensure that the report is released before the summer recess which begins on July 16. The motion was also signed by Mr Hugh Dykes, Conservative MP for Harrow East. The delay appears to have been caused by the complexity of the affair. When Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced the inquiry under Lord Justice Bingham last July, he said he hoped the inquiry's conclusions would be released before the general election. The Treasury, however, has still not received a copy of the report. The report's conclusions are likely to be controversial. The government will publish as much of the report as possible, but will hold back parts which it considers might prejudice criminal trials or which must remain confidential under banking law.</p>

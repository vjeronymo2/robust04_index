			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Ted Turner's Turner Entertainment Networks has bought future cable rights to  show CBS' hit miniseries, "Lonesome Dove," both on Turner's Atlanta  superstation, TBS, and his new TNT channel. The purchase price wasn't  disclosed, but speculation put it around $2 million. CBS, which aired the  eight-part Old West show last month, has rights for a second broadcast. A  Turner spokeswoman said "Dove" probably won't air on Turner's cable empire  until 1991. The miniseries, which starred Robert Duvall, averaged a 26.1  rating, the highest for a miniseries in five years. Each ratings point  represents 904,000 homes. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

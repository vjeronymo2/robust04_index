			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NWRe closure sparks concern over capacity CONCERN ABOUT a shortage of capacity at the London insurance and reinsurance market is growing in the wake of last week's decision by NWRe to cease underwriting. NWRe is the latest in a number of withdrawals from the market, where companies frequently do business alongside syndicates at Lloyd's. The company, jointly owned by Norwich Union, Winterthur of Switzerland and Chiyoda of Japan, announced its closure last Friday. It said its 1992 trading results were 'unacceptable', partially due to claims from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. The company has also been hit by continuing claims on marine, aviation and liability insurance policies. Some 180 jobs, including 40 in London, will be lost as a result of the decision taken at a board meeting last Wednesday. Established in 1976, NWRe wrote a broad book of London market business, and was a leader in both marine and non-marine reinsurance. Premium income was Pounds 110m in 1992. Underwriters said yesterday the decision could have a substantial impact on the marine liability reinsurance market. Others suggested it could dent the confidence of management at similar sized companies, triggering further closures. 'At a time we are trying to attract new business to London, it will knock people's confidence in the market,' said one prominent company underwriter. Over the last few months, a number of companies, including English &amp; American, Cigna and Yasuda, have either withdrawn from the London market or reduced their involvement.</p>

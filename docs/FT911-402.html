			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Banesto near to insurance deal with French group BANCO Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's third largest commercial bank, is close to selling a large minority share of its insurance division, La Union y El Fenix, to the French insurance group, Assurances Generales de France (AGF). The deal is also expected to include a possible exchange of shareholdings between the two parent groups, as well as broader co-operation in insurance marketing. Trading in La Union y El Fenix shares was briefly suspended in Madrid yesterday as the stock market commission announced negotiations to construct a holding company in which Banesto, through its industrial corporation, would hold a majority. La Union y El Fenix is Spain's fifth largest insurer, with premium income of Pta68bn (Dollars 660m) in 1989, while AGF's Spanish operation ranked 17, with Pta22bn in premiums. Banesto would not comment on the talks yesterday, but it has been expected for some time that the bank would need to dispose of assets this year to make up for heavy provisions forced on it by the Gulf crisis. This week it confirmed it was selling its Catalan banking affiliate, Banc Catala, to the Italian bank, San Paulo di Torini. It is also understood to be contemplating the sale of part of its oil refiner, Petromed. A merger of AGF's Spanish operations with Union y Fenix would open up large parts of the country - western Europe's fastest-growing life insurance market - to the French group. Not only would it be able to use Union y Fenix's branch network, but, possibly, Banesto's network of almost 2,000 bank branches as well. AGF has been among the most cautious of France's insurers in expanding abroad. Its French rival, Union des Assurances de Paris, has already bought a 3 per cent stake in Banesto's closest Spanish banking competitor, Banco Central, and is forming a holding company with one of Central's insurance companies, Vasco Navarra, to sell policies through Central's regional banking affiliates. Allianz, the big West German insurance group, has a stake in Banco Popular, whose branch network it also hopes to use to sell insurance. Many Spanish banks see linking up with foreign insurance companies as a way of increasing profitability at their branches.</p>

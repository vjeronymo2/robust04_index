			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BOOKS;  </P> <P> ENGLISH GARDENS, RUSSIAN ICONS, AMERICAN MOODS  </P> <P> The two most interesting volumes to be plucked from this season's crop of art  books are not in the conventional sense books about art. One of them is, in  fact, about gardening; the other is what amounts to the first official  English-language survey of the Russian Orthodox Church's incomparable  iconographic heritage.  </P> <P> Though their publishers clearly intended something more serious, both books  have the additional virtue of suggesting useful reflections on two significant  movements in contemporary life.  </P> <P> Gardening, after all, is part of a complex of current preoccupations -- like  cooking, domestic architecture and a renewed interest in so-called traditional  values -- that, together, constitute what might be called the revival of  private life. Whether this trend derives from social exhaustion, the final  triumph of narcissism or the realization of a decent sense of our own limits,  we Americans increasingly are a people concerned with how we will live our own  lives, educate our own children and provide for our own futures. Anyone who  doubts this need only look at our major corporations' rush to capitalize on the  "cocooning" phenomenon. Mikhail Gorbachev may no longer believe that history is  economically determined, but it's an article of faith among marketing  directors.  </P> <P> Similarly, that which against all odds has remained an object of belief among  the people of the East is a matter of considerable interest in this era of  glasnost and perestroika. One of the least understood aspects of the historic  upheaval now underway in the Soviet Union is precisely what place Gorbachev's  new thinking will make for the ancient traditions of the Russian church. As  orthodox communism declines, Orthodox Christianity may reassert itself as a  focal point of cohesive social values, national identity and, perhaps, of the  messianic aspirations great powers seem inevitably to assume. Moscow, after  all, was the "Third Rome" centuries before it was the capital of the Socialist  Motherland.  </P> <P> Historical speculation is fascinating, of course. But fully realized historical  fact is far more satisfying. And in this regard, British architectural  historian David Ottewill has made an altogether admirable success with The  Edwardian Garden (Yale University Press: $50; 230 pp., illustrated;  0-300-04-338-4).  </P> <P> Today, when we think of an "English garden" it is invariably those of the  Edwardian period we have in mind. Given that fact, it is hard to believe that  Ottewill's history actually is the first comprehensive survey of the  personalities, ideas and artifacts of this influential movement. His  accomplishment, however, is sufficiently magisterial that no other will be  required for years to come.  </P> <P> This handsome, oversized volume from the Yale University Press was designed by  Gillian Malpass and printed in Hong Kong, facts worth noting because of the  unusually adroit integration of Ottewill's intelligent, but unpretentious text  with the book's 125 excellent colorplates and 180 black-and-white  illustrations. Many of the latter are period photographs and reproductions of  the architects' and designers' working drawings.  </P> <P> When juxtaposed with contemporary photos, as they often are, these lend real  substance to the architect Francis Inigo Thomas' pointed admonition: "To design  a garden is one thing, and to garden it so as to obtain the desired effect is  another."  </P> <P> Vita Sackville-West aptly described the Edwardian gardeners' approach as one  which combined "maximum formality of design with maximum informality of  planting."  </P> <P> As Ottewill recontructs it, the Edwardian school of garden design began in a  controversy rooted in that very dichotomy. By the late 19th Century, the  principles of the Arts and Crafts movement were widely held among  forward-looking Britons concerned with aesthetic issues. Among the many simple  pleasures the movement commended to its followers were those of country living  and the garden. Simplicity, however, is often a rather contentious thing, and  controversy erupted over what kind of thing this new sort of garden ought to  be.  </P> <P> On the one side were the architects, who -- rather unsurprisingly -- insisted  that the new gardens ought to be designed by architects as integral complements  to the houses they surrounded. On the other side were the professional  gardeners, who argued that principles derived from the experience of wild and  cultivated nature ought to prevail over formal design.  </P> <P> The greatest and most influential of the Edwardian gardens were a synthesis of  these two views as achieved in the inspired partnership of the "amateur  artist-gardener" Gertrude Jekyell and the her one-time pupil, the architect  Edwin Lutyens. They were in many ways an odd couple: Lutyens, in fact,  apparently cared little for the physical experience of gardens; each was a  design problem to be solved before moving on to the next. It was a trajectory  that inevitably lead away from the Arts and Crafts movement and into  classicism. Toward the end of his career, he caustically remarked that if one  of his wealthy clients had come into possession of the Parthenon, she doubtless  "would have added a bay window to it."  </P> <P> Jekyell, from whom Lutyens obtained an appreciation of natural building  materials he never lost, cared for little else but gardens. The principles she  enumerated in her many elegant writings remain for gardeners around the world  the conscience of their endeavor. "Planting ground is painting a landscape with  living things," she wrote, "and as I hold that good gardening ranks within the  bounds of the fine arts, so I hold that to plant well needs an artist of no  mean capacity."  </P> <P> Edifying as all this may be -- and it is -- it is impossible to overlook the  historical parallels between the Edwardian era and our own, which has come to  be marked not only by a frantically acquisitive interest in Arts and Craft  artifacts, but also an extravagant revival of formal garden building.  </P> <P> Ottewill summarizes the Edwardian historical context thusly: "The purchasing  power of the pound rose steadily. . . . There was an accompanying rise in  consumption. Owing to the introduction of the mass market this was no longer  confined to the wealthy, but the working mass of the population was a little  worse off during the Edwardian period compared with the 1890s. In general, the  situation allowed a small elite to amass, more quickly than ever before,  immense personal fortunes. . . . Many businessmen acquired at least a semblance  of landed status by building a new house or enlarging an old one. The  combination of surplus resources and a plentiful supply of labor enabled both  groups to indulge in the luxury of gardens on a scale never to be seen again."  </P> <P> These, of course, were people on the edge of apocalypse.  </P> <P> While Ottewill fixes the Edwardian garden convincingly within an aesthetic and  historical context, Father Vladimir Ivanov's Russian Icons (Rizzoli: $75; 219  pp., illustrated; 0-8478-0952-8) is rather confusing in its implications.  Father Ivanov, an orthodox priest and chairman of the Ecclesiastical Archeology  Department at the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy, is an internationally known  authority on icons. His book, which is meant to commemorate the 1,000th  anniversary of the introduction of Christianity into what is now the Soviet  Union, is visually stunning, containing 160 color reproductions of icons dating  from the 12th to the 20th Century. According to the volume's notes, 100 of the  icons pictured have never before been published.  </P> <P> Within the context of Father Ivanov's explication, however, responding to these  images as something other than an arresting curiousity becomes problematic.  </P> <P> Among practicioners of the three great monotheistic religions, only Christians  make religious images. In the West, those images are not only part of, but  central to the great artistic tradition. Father Ivanov argues rather  insistently that Russian icons stand outside this tradition -- that they are  not simply objects worthy of veneration; that they possess inherent powers to  protect the faithful; and serve as a kind of gateway through which the believer  may obtain direct access to "the divine prototype." With this in mind, Father  Ivanov insists that iconographers be judged not according to their painterly  achievements, but on their fidelity to tradition and the creator's  manifestation of a "tested knowledge of spiritual situations."  </P> <P> Taken in this way, Russian icons present the same problems of critical  interpretation as tribal or other primitive art: To take them out of the  context of their creation is to deny a full understanding of their meaning;  allowing them to remain there is to make them all but unintelligible to our  aesthetic.  </P> <P> Admittedly, most Westerners who care about such questions have had their  understanding of Orthodoxy, particularly Russian Orthodoxy, spirituality shaped  by the publications of the church in exile and by the works and translations of  Orthodoxy's influential converts, such as the late Archimandrite Lev Gillet and  the former Timothy Ware, now Bishop Kallistos of Diokleia. The spirituality of  those believers formed within the Soviet Union may differ from these,  particularly in its points of emphasis.  </P> <P> Perhaps Father Ivanov simply intended to simplify his text for a secular,  Western audience. Even so, some ommissions are surprising. For example, despite  several glancing references to what I take to be the Athonite doctrine of the  Uncreated Light and its importance to Russian iconography, the name of the  concept's author, Gregory Palamas, never appears. Is this because he remains a  controversial and divisive figure among Western theologians?  </P> <P> Similarly, the discussion of the 19th-Century Russian situation lacks any  reference to that great anthology of spiritual texts, "The Philokalia," to "the  unceasing prayer of the heart" or Jesus Prayer and to perhaps the greatest  exponent of both, Theophan the Recluse. All three exerted a decisive influence  on 19th-Century Russian spirituality and it is difficult to understand how they  could not have had some impact on icon painting. If the contemporary Russian  church no longer considers them of great importance, it would be interesting to  know why.  </P> <P> Most disturbing, however, is Father Ivanov's description of 20th-Century icon  painting. Suffice it to say that it does not ever mention the Communist Party,  the imposition of Soviet power or the state-sponsored persecution of religion  believers. In a historical narrative this is something of a defect.  </P> <P> From this evidence, it appears that the Patriarchate of Moscow no less than the  Kremlin stands to benefit from a little glasnost.  </P> <P> Historicism seems to be breaking out all over this spring, and among its other  notable offshoots are a pair of impressive explorations of the work of  Francisco Goya. The more formidable of the two, Goya and the Spirit of  Enlightenment, Alfonso E. Perez Sanchez and Eleanor A. Sayre, co-directors of  the traveling exhibition (Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown: $65; 407 pp.,  illustrated; 0-87846-299-6, cloth;) is the catalogue designed to accompany the  exhibition of the same name currently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York. (It previously has been reviewed by Times Art Critic William  Wilson) As the title implies, this volume employs more than 400 pages, an equal  number of illustrations and well-constructed essays by an impressive array of  Spanish and American Goya specialists to document the influence of the  Enlightenment's philosophical and political preoccupations on Goya's art. As  the political children of that era, Americans will find this discussion of  particular interest.  </P> <P> A briefer, though intellectually bracing alternative, is provided by Janis A.  Tomlinson's Graphic Evolutions: The Print Series of Francisco Goya (Columbia  University Press: $29.95, cloth; $15, paper; 67 pp., illustrated;  0-231-06864-6, cloth). Tomlinson is a Columbia University art historian and,  while the five essays compiled here are intended for a scholarly audience, they  will be of great interest to anyone devoted to this artist or, for that matter,  the graphic arts.  </P> <P> While not denying the significance of Goya the social critic, the author  explores the evolution of his graphic work as it responded to the discernable  individual impulse of the artist. This is intelligently and nicely done,  indeed.  </P></p>

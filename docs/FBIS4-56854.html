			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 6 May (EFE) -- Chilean Socialist Party  deputies have voiced their concern that the free trade agreement  Chile intends to negotiate with the United States will  negatively influence commercial relations with the EU and Asian  countries. The deputies have asked for a special meeting of the  Chamber of Deputies to analyze the meaning, purpose, and terms  of a free trade agreement with the United States.    Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, president of the Socialist Party  bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, told reporters that Chile's  foreign trade is very diversified, that its main trade partners  are in Asia and the EU, and that the U.S. share of Chile's  foreign trade is only 20.5 percent. The socialist deputy  underscored that Chile's trade with the EU and Asia yields a  surplus while its trade with the United States generates a  deficit.    Viera Gallo emphasized that an agreement with the United  States will not greatly benefit Chile and cautioned against "a  mirage." He added that a free trade agreement will probably  improve the sales of manufactured products which currently pay  high customs rates in the United States, but will harm exports  of raw materials which now pay just 1.8 percent in the United  States.    Viera Gallo pointed out that the United States has already  raised objections regarding three sensitive areas: price  brackets for agricultural products, waiting periods for the  repatriation of capital which the United States wants to be less  than 1 year, and intellectual property rights because the  Chilean law on patents is considered inadequate.    Socialist Party deputies, who belong to the ruling  coalition,  have also indicated that a new agreement must be reached with  the members of the Common Market of the South: Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.</p>

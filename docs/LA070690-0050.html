			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOURTH OF JULY LOST SOME OF ITS BANG: GUNS;  </P> <P> CELEBRATIONS: AMMUNITION SALES WERE BANNED IN LOS ANGELES DURING THE WEEK  BEFORE THE HOLIDAY TO STEM THE SOMETIMES DEADLY TRADITION OF FIRING GUNS INTO  THE AIR.  </P> <P> For some city residents this July 4th was unlike any other in recent years.  There were the usual barbecues, fireworks shows and traffic jams. But the sound  of gunfire, which normally fills the holiday night in many neighborhoods, was  noticeably absent.  </P> <P> "I heard no gunshots," said 85-year old B.A. Smith, a resident of Shelter Isle  Mobile Home Park in Pacoima. "I've lived in here for 21 years. Without  reservation there was less noise and less confusion than I've ever witnessed."  </P> <P> In May the Los Angeles City Council banned ammunition sales during the week  before the Fourth of July in an attempt to end the sometimes deadly tradition  of firing guns into the air on the night of July 4th and New Year's Eve. The  city of San Fernando also bans ammunition sales before the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> On New Year's Eve, eight people were wounded by falling bullets and 70 were  arrested for discharging firearms in Los Angeles. Police confiscated 134 guns.  </P> <P> Although statistics were unavailable from police Thursday, some officers and  residents said the city's pre-holiday ban on ammunition sales may have been the  reason for what they describe as a decrease in the amount of random gunfire  Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "It's something that had to be done. It was just getting worse," said Sgt. Tom  Toutant of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division. "I  think it's a great idea."  </P> <P> Toutant, an assistant watch commander, said there was considerably less gunfire  in his division Wednesday compared to previous years.  </P> <P> At least one North Hollywood man was arrested on suspicion of shooting a  firearm in a residential area, but that person used home-made ammunition,  Toutant said.  </P> <P> Similar comments came from police in other areas of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "It seems to work," said Lt. Tony Pennington of the San Fernando Police  Department. "We only had one call and that wasn't confirmed. . . . That's  definitely a decrease. In the past years we've had six to a dozen calls."  </P> <P> The ban won high marks from residents of Shelter Isle Mobile Home Park where in  past years residents spent the days after the holidays plucking bullets from  walls and furniture.  </P> <P> No bullet impacts were reported Wednesday night, said Muriel Lazo, manager of  the 260-unit mobile home park.  </P> <P> "We use to have them shooting from the hillside behind us. We had bullets going  through people's homes a lot. It's certainly a big improvement for us."  </P> <P> In the Foothill Police Division, Capt. Valentino Paniccia said officers have  "seen a tremendous decrease over the last three years," in the wake of an  intensive campaign known as "Deadly Celebration" to discourage holiday  shootings.  </P> <P> Beginning in June, officers distributed flyers and spoke to neighborhood groups  and other organizations warning of the dangers of fireworks and firearms.  </P> <P> Paniccia said there were no arrests or incidents Wednesday, but it was still  too early to determine the specific impact of the ammunition ban.  </P> <P> "It's only been in place for one holiday," he said, but added: "The ammunition  ban I'm sure is going to help as far as continuing that decrease."  </P> <P> In some areas, the impact of the ban was unclear.  </P> <P> Sergeants in the Devonshire, Van Nuys and West Valley divisions said they had  insufficient information to determine immediately whether there had been a  decrease in the numbers of shots fired.  </P></p>

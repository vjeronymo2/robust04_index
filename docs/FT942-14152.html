			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recs line up Kleinwort for Grid sale The regional electricity companies yesterday set in motion a potential disposal worth more than Pounds 1bn when they appointed Kleinwort Benson to advise on the future of the National Grid, the power transmission company which they own. Yesterday's announcement was seen in the City as the precursor to a sale next year of at least 25 per cent of the National Grid, the monopoly transmitter of high voltage electricity in England and Wales. The likely route is through a flotation on the Stock Exchange, although Kleinwort Benson will look at other possibilities. These could include issuing shareholders in the regional companies with equity in the National Grid. The Grid, which is setting up a telecommunications company, Energis, and is looking for opportunities to expand abroad, is likely to be valued at about Pounds 5bn. Some analysts expect the sale of a second tranche of shares to be sold nine months to a year after the initial disposal. Yesterday's announcement said only that directors had decided to 'put in hand a study of their options in relation to the future of the National Grid Company. '(They) have therefore appointed Kleinwort Benson and Herbert Smith (the legal firm) to advise them.' One regional power company chairman said last night it was possible the study would result in no changes. 'We really do want to look at all the options,' he said. Analysts believe, however, that it is highly unlikely the regional power companies will want to remain in control of all the shares in National Grid as the general election approaches. The Labour Party has said in previous elections that it wants the state to take control of the Grid. That would be more difficult to achieve if share ownership were more diversified. The timing of any disposal will be influenced by the government's sale of its 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen, the power generation companies. This is expected early next year but could be as soon as this autumn. Kleinwort Benson, in conjunction with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is advising the government on the generator sales.</p>

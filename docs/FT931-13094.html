			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Arnotts considers share buy-back ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, is considering a share buy-back scheme to support the share price after the closure on Thursday of a takeover offer by Campbell Soup, the US food group. Arnotts said the scheme had been suggested by Schroders Australia, the merchant bank which is advising the board. The buy-back would apply to up to 10 per cent of the stock. However, Mr David Johnson, Campbell managing director, said the scheme was 'a transparent ruse born of panic'. Mr Johnson said Campbell would use its shareholding to block the scheme. 'Campbell clearly has the power to block the buy-back. Make no mistake, we would use that power,' he said. Arnotts' shares have consistently traded above Campbell's offer price of ADollars 9.50, but analysts have suggested they could fall as low as ADollars 7 (USDollars 4.80) after the offer closes. Schroders is believed to have suggested that the buy-back scheme might persuade institutional shareholders to reject Campbell's offer by providing an alternative buyer for part of their holdings. Mr Paul Binstead, a Schroders director, said Campbell had agreed to the inclusion of buy-back provisions in Arnotts' articles of association in 1990. However, Mr Binstead said no decision on whether to proceed with the buy-back would be made until after the offer expires. Campbell has lifted its stake in Arnotts to 34.1 per cent from 33 per cent since launching the bid. However, Campbell needs 85.1 per cent of the shares to control the board because of a 1985 shareholding agreement. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said he was confident that Campbell had 'no chance' of acquiring control because small shareholders and members of the Arnott family were reluctant to sell.</p>

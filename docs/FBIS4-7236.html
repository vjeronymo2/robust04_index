			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippines is voicing its "serious concern"  over "disguised non-tariff barriers" being imposed by rich  nations like the United States on their poor trading partners.    High-level sources at the Department of Foreign Affairs  (DFA)  said these disguised barriers include human rights and  environmental issues which are being incorporated by the United  States and other Western powers into the mainstream of their  foreign trade policies.    A DFA official said that developed countries went  'overboard'  on using such barriers under the new world trade order after the  Uruguay Round was signed last April.    "So now we have issues on environment, human rights,  sanitary  requirements and wildlife being invoked by the United States,  the European Union and other rich countries," the official said.    The DFA, meanwhile, said the Philippines will push for the  inclusion of its serious concern over trade issues in the agenda  of the U.S.- ASEAN conference in Washington next month.    Describing it as "ridiculous," DFA officials took notice of  trade sanctions recently imposed by the United States against  Taiwan for its failure to close down the illegal trade in  wildlife, specifically the poaching of wild cats or tigers.    Taipei has protested the trade sanctions, asking why the  Clinton administration spared the mainland China despite reports  from environmental experts that it is even a bigger market for  wildlife products than Taiwan.    "This is what I call as a form of disguised non-tariff  barriers which we view with serious concern," a DFA source,  asking for anonymity, said, "hindi na [no longer] tariff, hindi  na quota dahil bawal na 'yan sa [because that's prohibited in]  GATT (meaning the new world trade order or WTO)."    It must also be noted that Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo  earlier assailed the United States for linking China's record of  human rights violations in its renewal assessment of the  most-favored-nation status to that country.    Romulo has also expressed relief over failed attempts by the  United States to include "social clauses" into the GATT which  involve the protection of the workers' rights and other labor  standards. He said that labor and human rights issues be  separated from trade accords.    Under the GATT, developed countries will cut industrial  tariffs by 38 percent and farm tariffs by 37 percent over the  next 10 years. The developing countries have no tariff slashing  figures but they agreed to "bind" or not to add extra fees and  payments to their tariff rates.    DFA officials said the United States and its allies are  looking for ways to cushion negative effects of the GATT to  Western market, which will have to compete against the influx of  Asian export to the world economy.    Asia is said to benefit the most out of GATT since it has  the  fastest growing and most trade oriented economies. Asia will  generate more than 50 percent of the new trade by developing  countries, which will bring in more jobs, higher incomes and in-  demand products.</p>

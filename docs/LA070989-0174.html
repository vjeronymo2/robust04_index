			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAR 'OOZE' IN SCHOOL'S PLAY YARD IS MYSTERY  </P> <P> Where a month ago schoolchildren played, a team of federal environmental  experts drilled 2 1/2 feet into the ground Saturday, seeking clues to the  mysterious oily, tar-like substance that oozes through the asphalt at Cudahy's  Park Avenue Elementary School.  </P> <P> For four hours, the representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  -- wearing protective clothing, gloves and masks -- collected water, air and  ground samples from the school's playground.  </P> <P> They shoveled, they poked, they scraped, they sniffed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Gooey and Smelly'  </P> <P> And still, they had little idea exactly what the substance was or what was  causing it to appear.  </P> <P> "It's black, gooey and smelly," said Doug Frazer, EPA regional project officer,  noting he believed it contains traces of hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of  discarded oil sludge with a pungent scent.  </P> <P> The visit by the EPA was the latest attempt by school, health, environmental  and community officials to identify the substance that has been appearing  periodically for 20 years and get to the bottom of why it continues to bubble  to the playground's surface.  </P> <P> "It was coming up when I attended school there from 1971 to 1975," said Jose  Mireles of Cudahy, a 26-year-old a Los Angeles policeman. "There was also a  rotten egg smell in the summer. You couldn't breathe. We thought it was  normal."  </P> <P> In the face of a new round of complaints by parents and teachers, school  officials two weeks ago fenced off about one-fourth of the playground, making  the tar-like spots off-limits to students of the year-round school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Committee Formed  </P> <P> Cudahy officials have accused the Los Angeles Unified School District of acting  slowly, teachers at the school have formed what they call an "ooze committee"  to keep abreast of the issue and a handful of parents have withdrawn their  children from the school -- with more threatening to do the same.  </P> <P> Some parents complain that their children suffer from eye irritations, rashes  and headaches.  </P> <P> As early as 1968, when the Cudahy school opened, school district workers had  patched leaks in the asphalt, long-time school employees said.  </P> <P> EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said Saturday it will take the agency about four  months to analyze the samples and determine whether the ooze is hazardous.  </P> <P> What is known is that the school and a nearby city park were built atop  landfills that had operated since the 1930s and were shut down before the early  1960s, Wilson said. Trash, oil sludge, abandoned vehicles and old boats were  reportedly dumped there, he said.  </P> <P> Although EPA officials said it was yet to be determined whether the substance  is hazardous, a recent study by an environmental firm for the school district  identified the ooze as either a type of toxic coal tar or a petroleum-based  asphalt tar.  </P> <P> School district officials, too, seemed to agree that hazardous compounds are  present in the ooze but they said they pose little danger to students at the  school.  </P> <P> "We are confident right now that unless students ate a bunch of this stuff or  rubbed it all over their bodies, there is no problem," said Don Coleman,  district public information officer.  </P> <P> In a report to the district in December, Thomas N. Dixon, a project geologist  for Anaheim-based Thorne Environmental Inc., said the firm found in the ooze  methylene chloride, a potential carcinogen that can cause eye and skin  irritation and kidney and respiratory ailments.  </P> <P> It also found methylnapthalene, known sometimes as white tar, which can cause  headaches, eye irritation, abdominal ailments and mental confusion. In  addition, phenanthrene, a potential carcinogen, and pyrene and benzo pyrene,  combustion products that are carcinogenic and toxic, were discovered in the  substance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sources of Danger  </P> <P> The report said the "immediate danger" would come from eating the ooze,  breathing the vapors if it were burned or from prolonged skin contact.  </P> <P> Engineers and scientists for the state Department of Health Services, which  investigated the seepage last month, found some different compounds, all of  them mild to moderate toxins.  </P> <P> Dennis Leonard, a program supervisor in the department's toxics division in  Burbank, said that the substance may be a "petroleum hydrocarbon, possibly a  refinery byproduct."  </P> <P> Leonard, who performed a preliminary review for the EPA, said the black ooze  could cause skin burns because of its acidic nature and would be harmful if  eaten.  </P> <P> School officials stress that the seepage has occurred in isolated spots, not  throughout the playground's surface.  </P> <P> "They are small spots of asphalt that become gooey when there is hot weather,"  said Shirleen Bolin, a school district administrator. "They are not bubbling  pools out there like on the Beverly Hillbillies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Sizes  </P> <P> She said the ooze spots range in size from that of a half-dollar to 6 to 8  inches in diameter.  </P> <P> At first, Cudahy City Manager Gerald Caton accused school district officials of  not being cooperative in responding to inquiries about potential toxins at the  school site. District officials have denied this.  </P> <P> Now, "We are just pleased that people are taking this seriously and things are  in motion," Caton said.  </P> <P> The district was ordered last month by state authorities to begin checks of the  playground and to install barriers until the ooze spots were covered or  removed. School board member Leticia Quezada said she hoped the installation of  the fence would "calm any fears and anxiety of parents and the community."  </P> <P> About 100 parents met with district and state health officials last month, with  some parents demanding promises that children would be unharmed by the  substance. School officials said that, although they have seen children  sometimes play with the ooze, they do not know of any cases when a student has  been harmed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH REPORT: BIG BASS ARE AVAILABLE AT LAKE CASTAIC  </P> <P> Los Angeles County's Lake Castaic continues to be the hot spot for largemouth  bass, except when high winds close the launch ramp, keeping boats off the lake.  </P> <P> Both the upper and lower reservoirs have been productive. Kevin Morris of Sun  Valley took a 13-pound 4-ounce bass in the lower lake, and Bob Jones of Canoga  Park caught an 11-pounder in the upper.  </P></p>

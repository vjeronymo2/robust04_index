			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE OVER MONUMENT HAS A DEEPER MEANING  </P> <P> Bravo to Harry Akune for his thought-provoking quotes in discussing the  veterans' groups disagreement on who should be listed on a proposed monument to  Japanese-American soldiers ("Battle Zone," June 28). Akune's message conveys to  the public a meaningful insight to the purpose of the memorial.  </P> <P> Since I read the article, I have given the subject considerable thought. If the  purpose of the memorial is to (cause) people to think, if they have not, and to  understand the difficulties we, the Japanese-Americans, faced during pre-World  War II days to be accepted into the majority society and our desire to be fully  accepted, then I have to agree that the World War II veterans were the catalyst  toward meeting that goal.  </P> <P> J.

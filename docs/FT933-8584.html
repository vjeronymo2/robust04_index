			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners discover the joys of going Dutch - Overseas buying has helped Amsterdam to enjoy a record-setting summer Contrary to all forecasts, the Amsterdam stock exchange is enjoying a record-setting summer. The appetite of foreign investors for European shares has touched off an unexpected rally in Dutch cyclicals, catching domestic investors off their guard and surprising professionals who had gone short on the assumption that share prices would limp through July and August. The climb in share prices has been translated into a series of 12-month highs for companies involved in some of the most recession-hit areas of the domestic and European economy, and the main bourse indices have reached a series of all-time peaks. The rally in cyclicals, which had not been expected until late 1993 at the earliest, has stolen some of the limelight from 'defensive' bourse stalwarts like Elsevier, the publisher, and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group. In recent days Hoogovens, the steel group, and DSM, the chemicals company, have been 'rewarded' for their weak first-half figures and their gloomy assessment of economic prospects with sharp increases in their share prices. Hoogovens jumped by 10 per cent on Wednesday, after predicting that losses would fall in the second half but also after saying that the economic outlook of its main European customers remained bleak. Spurred on by Hoogovens and other cyclicals, the CBS Tendency index rose to a record 128.4 on Thursday, up nearly 35 per cent since the start of the year, before easing to 127.9 yesterday. By contrast, at the end of May, when Amsterdam investors usually sell and go away, the cumulative rise for the year was only 10 per cent. This surprising turn of events has caused a 'short squeeze' for investors and stockbrokers who sold shares earlier with an eye to buying them back at a lower price later. One small brokerage, Nusse Brink, was suspended from trading at the end of last week when it could no longer cover its short positions. This has also affected Van den Broek, a company with a clearing role, which is owned by James Capel's Amsterdam operation. Capel and the bourse's management are so far at odds over whether Van den Broek is entitled to compensation from the exchange's contingency funds. Stocks shorted by investors include DSM, Fokker and Philips, all three of which have reached 12-month highs, partly by a scramble to cover positions. But analysts say the cyclical rally is being fuelled by more than short-covering and that it could be sustained into the autumn. Philips, for example, is benefiting from second-quarter figures which revealed that the company's financial position and its debt ratios are improving, even although operating profits continue to suffer from the malaise in consumer electronics and communications. This improvement, together with the planned acquisition of Motown by its majority-owned PolyGram record company, has taken Philips's shares to around Fl 37 compared with a low of Fl 16.90 last November. Foreign buying has helped to turn other investors' attention to the prospects for lower interest rates, to the widespread restructuring of Dutch industry which will pay off when economic recovery comes and to the expected strengthening of the dollar, traditionally a positive factor for the outward-looking companies listed on the Amsterdam exchange. Apart from the likelihood of profit-taking in some individual stocks, analysts are not predicting a major correction in prices soon. Mr Rob Sweers, an analyst at Banque Paribas in Amsterdam, says: 'Underlying sentiment is strong, the market is becoming broader and volumes are on the increase.' The bourse should remain well-supported by some investors covering short positions and by others anxious not to miss the rally, he adds. His preference is for 'quality cyclicals' such as Akzo, Philips, Hunter Douglas and Oce-van der Grinten, as well as financial stocks, rather than the food and beverage sector or publishers which benefited most from the higher prices earlier this year but whose share performance now is more modest than the high-flying cyclicals. Companies in the throes of restructuring could also be well-placed. At Mees Pierson, the Amsterdam-based investment bank, Mr Frank Hoogendijk attributes the summer rally to a willingness among foreign investors in particular to take a long-term view rather than to dwell on the current economic climate. 'Private investors have not been terribly active so far,' he says, noting that their entry could extend the rally. He believes that there is room for selective profit-taking in 'heavy cyclicals' but says that a substantial correction across the board seems unlikely. Steady performers such as Royal Dutch, financial issues and publishers make up more than 60 per cent of Amsterdam's market capitalisation. 'The trend for these companies will remain good as long as profits continue to rise and interest rates are not raised,' he believes.</p>

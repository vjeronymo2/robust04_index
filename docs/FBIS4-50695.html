			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The stable exchange rate  of the Chinese currency -- the yuan -- against the U.S. dollar  serves as an illustration of the initial success China has  scored in the reform of its foreign exchange system, according  to bank executives.    Executives of 14 banks authorized by China's central bank to  trade in hard currency are meeting here to summarize the  experiences since the two-tier exchange rates were merged at the  beginning of 1994.    According to these executives, the yuan has been quoted at  8.70 against the U.S. dollar since then.    They agreed that the stability of the yuan has provided a  stable financial environment for China to expand trade and  economic cooperation with other countries.    Such stability has also made it possible for Chinese  enterprises to improve management, China to gear its economy  with the economy of the world as a whole, they said, adding that  it also encourages more overseas firms to invest in China.    They cited a big increase in exports as another success in  the reform of the foreign exchange system.    For example, exports shot up 18.7 percent in the first  quarter of this year over the same period in 1993. Developed  areas in China reported an even bigger increase in exports  during that period.    They agreed that another success was that the inflow of hard  currencies exceeded selling and state foreign exchange reserves  are eight billion U.S. dollars more than in early 1994.    In April, banks designated by the central bank to deal in  hard currency registered an inflow of hard currency totalling  7.31 billion U.S. dollars and sold 4.18 billion dollars, leaving  a surplus of 3.14 billion dollars.    Also in April, 2.69 billion U.S. dollars and 2.4 billion  Hong  Kong dollars changed hands in the Shanghai-based foreign  exchange trading center.    The operation of inter-bank hard currency trading markets  has  created a mechanism under which exchange rates are set according  to market demand, they said.    That will enable the central bank to intensify its  macro-economic control, they added.    The executives also noted that sufficient hard currency was  traded in swap centers to meet the needs of foreign-funded  businesses.    In April, such businesses sold a total of 135 million U.S.  Dollars and 64 million HK [Hong Kong] dollars in 19 swap centers  all over the country.</p>

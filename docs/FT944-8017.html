			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: A question of standards - Robert Rice on resistance to further regulation of the derivatives industry In the two and a half years since Mr Gerald Corrigan, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned bankers to take a very hard look at their off-balance sheet activities or risk tighter derivatives regulation, relations between regulators and the derivatives industry have improved markedly. In March this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with the UK Securities and Investments Board, issued a statement on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives  -financial instruments such as futures and options - calling for the industry and regulators to work together. The industry welcomed the initiative. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), an industry-backed organisation set up by dealers in New York in 1984 to standardise derivatives documentation to reduce credit risk and increase legal certainty, wrote to the regulators offering help. Suddenly, however, this spirit of co-operation is threatened by pending litigation in the US. Bankers Trust, a leading derivatives dealer, is being sued by two US companies, Gibson Greetings, a greeting cards manufacturer, and Proctor &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods company, for losses on derivatives contracts sold by the New York bank. Gibson alleges it was misled by Bankers Trust on the risk of a complex interest-rate swap and Proctor &amp; Gamble that it was sold financial instruments without a full explanation of their risks. Bankers Trust denies liability, claiming Gibson and Proctor are sophisticated clients which entered into the transactions with their eyes open and, in Proctor's case, that it formally suggested the company limit its risk by unwinding all or part of the transactions when changes in market rates began to affect its position adversely - advice Proctor ignored. Few derivatives lawyers believe the banks have anything to fear from these actions. But there is a nagging concern that, if either company wins, other dealers may find themselves in court and a rash of derivatives litigation would lead to calls for tighter regulation. For ISDA, tighter regulation would be a big reversal. One of ISDA's legal advisers, US derivatives lawyer Jeffrey Golden, now a partner with City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, says broad-based litigation should not obscure how hard a lot of people in the derivatives industry have worked to reduce risk and increase legal certainty over the past 10 years. Regulators have spent a great deal of time worrying about largely theoretical legal problems which might affect the derivatives markets, he says. But the search by regulators for absolute legal certainty can be overdone. Further regulation, rather than co-operation with ISDA to reduce legal uncertainty and credit risk by encouraging wider use of standard documentation, could prove counter-productive, he says. Mr Ernest Goodrich, managing director of Merrill Lynch, New York, and an ISDA board member, says that, against the growth in the global derivatives market - an estimated Dollars 13,000bn in notional value this year - the amount of litigation has been minimal over the past 10 years. Standardised documentation will not prevent a Drexel Burnham Lambert or British &amp; Commonwealth insolvency. But standardisation may make it easier to find a white knight or help evaluate the swap portfolio of a troubled market participant, Mr Golden says. In the early days, before ISDA was formed, lawyers used to draft individual swap agreements for market participants which resulted quickly in a battle of the forms. As the inter-dealer market developed, dealers began to enter several swaps with the same counterparty. Looked at gross, their exposure to each other based on each transaction was misleading. A more sensible picture of their exposure came from netting the results of all transactions with each other, setting off obligations against sums owing. Negotiating a new contract for each trade no longer made sense and dealers pushed for master agreements which would facilitate such things as netting of counterparty exposure. ISDA's first efforts at standardisation came in 1985 with a Code of Standard Wording, Assumptions and Provisions, a menu of provisions for dealers in drawing up contracts. It produced a revised code in 1986, followed in 1987 by forms for master agreements for dollar rate interest swaps and for multi-currency interest rate and currency swaps, plus definitions and an ISDA agreements user's guide. Other documents followed and then in 1992 a new generation of ISDA documents were produced. These included a master agreement for multi-currency cross-border deals and one for local currency single-jurisdiction deals, foreign exchange and currency options definitions and confirmations and a confirmation for over-the-counter equity index option transactions. Since then the pace has hardly slackened. ISDA has produced a bilateral credit support annex to the master agreement, where collateral will be held in the US under New York law, and an over-the-counter single share option confirmation where it is thought the option will settle by physical delivery. Obstacles to ISDA's attempts to reduce legal uncertainty and credit risk through standardisation have included a preference by some international dealers to document derivatives under separate master agreements for different products, such as the international foreign exchange master agreement which caters exclusively for spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, rather than using a single, multi-product master agreement such as the 1992 ISDA master agreement. ISDA members find it hard to fathom why any dealer should go to the expense and difficulty of negotiating and handling several master agreements with the same counterparty. Mr Golden says multiple masters waste time, cost money, invite documentation backlog, increase the risk of mistakes in agreements, divert management attention and potentially increase credit risk and capital costs. ISDA has powerful allies. The study in July 1993 by the Group of 30 top industrial countries of derivatives concluded market participants should use one master agreement with each counterparty, which provides for close-out and settlement netting to document existing and future derivatives transactions including foreign exchange forwards and options. A single master agreement creates the greatest legal certainty that credit exposure will be netted, it said. Yet the G30 survey found only two-fifths of dealers documented derivatives transactions under a single, multi-product master agreement. There will be cases where parties want to use separate master agreements. But ISDA is not saying a single multi-product master should always be used; simply that using separate masters as a matter of course is inefficient and costly. If regulators are tempted by an upsurge in litigation (unconnected with attempts to reduce legal uncertainty) to extend the regulatory regime, they might do better to think again. More could be achieved by working with the industry to increase standardisation.</p>

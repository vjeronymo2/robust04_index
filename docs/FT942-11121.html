			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (13): Pioneers in the chalk - Maurice Samuelson recalls earlier attempts to burrow to France The first attempt to bore a tunnel under the English Channel was made in 1880, using a machine designed by Colonel Frederick Beaumont, a retired Royal Engineers officer with a wide experience in military tunneling. His machine, operated by compressed air, had at its head two revolving arms fitted with 14 cutting blades. As the chalk was cut away it fell on to a conveyor belt to be loaded on to skips. The tunnel, which was about 2.4m in diameter, started from an access shaft and reached 2km in length when the project was halted. A similar tunnel was started in France from near Sangatte. The work at Dover was stopped in 1883 when the Government obtained a High Court order to prohibit further activity. In 1922, a trial bore 3 metres in diameter was made at Folkestone using a Whitaker machine. The steam-powered, electrically driven machine had originally been developed by the Royal Engineers for mining under the German lines in the Great War. It was left on the site when boring ended and part of it has been recovered and restored for display at the Eurotunnel exhibition centre in Folkestone. In 1974, work began on a much larger tunnelling system, similar in size and configuration to that used to complete the present tunnel. In the UK an access tunnel was made at Shakespeare cliff near Dover and a rail access tunnel bored to the level of the present rail tunnels. Some 400m of service tunnel were bored before the work was abandoned in 1975. During these works the 1880 Beaumont tunnel and shaft were found to be in good condition. They have now been sealed off. However, the 1974 tunnelling at Shakespeare Cliff has been incorporated into the Eurotunnel system.</p>

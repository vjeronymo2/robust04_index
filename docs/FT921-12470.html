			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Dublin gears up for a leadership contest MR Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister, is expected to announce his resignation on Thursday, following last week's ultimatum from his Progressive Democrat coalition partners to restore the credibility of the government or lose their support. Backbenchers in Mr Haughey's Fianna Fail (FF) party expect him to announce that he will step down as party leader at a meeting of the FF parliamentary group on Thursday, the day after the presentation of the 1992 budget. There are three main contenders to succeed Mr Haughey. Mr Albert Reynolds, a former finance minister, is the strongest. He was sacked by Mr Haughey last November after leading an attempt to oust the prime minister. He has strong backbench support, although many of his former cabinet colleagues are likely to oppose him, as will Mr Haughey himself. Mr Reynolds said last week he intended to be a candidate 'once the prime minister's post is vacant'. Mr Bertie Ahern, who replaced Mr Reynolds in the Finance Ministry, would be Mr Haughey's preferred choice. He commands respect in the party as an able negotiator, and is trusted by the country's trade union leaders. Mr Ahern may be seen as the best candidate to steer the economy through a difficult year ahead. However, he has consistently disavowed any leadership ambitions. He said he would make his intentions known 'before Thursday's vote'. Mrs Mary O'Rourke, the minister for health, is the only other serious contender to have emerged since the leadership issue came to the fore at the end of last year. Mrs O'Rourke is seen as a strong reformer on social issues and could win support from an electorate that increasingly sees Irish legislation on issues such as divorce and women's rights as outdated. Mr Haughey's succession will hinge on whether Mr Ahern decides to stand himself, or to back one of the other contenders. Intense lobbying can be expected, in which Mr Haughey will play a central role. The possibility of Mr Haughey deciding to fight on as prime minister cannot be ruled out. He could ask the president, Mrs Mary Robinson, to dissolve the government after the budget is approved, and call a snap general election. There is considerable resentment within Fianna Fail that the Progressive Democrats have been able to force the leadership issue in Fianna Fail by threatening to pull out of the government. The PDs hold only six seats in parliament, against Fianna Fail's 77. Fianna Fail backbenchers, especially those in marginal seats, would rather not face an immediate election. The party could lose support because of its failure to deal decisively with its internal problems. 'We could expect to lose at least eight seats,' said one backbencher. 'A general election must be avoided.' If Mr Haughey resigns, the coalition government could hope to hold together until the next general elections, which must be held before June 1994.</p>

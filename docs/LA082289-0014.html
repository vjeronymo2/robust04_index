			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in new  three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.99%, down from 8.01% last  week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average  discount rate of 7.85%, up from 7.83% last week. The new discount rates  understate the actual return to investors -- 8.27% for three-month bills, with  a $10,000 bill selling for $9,795.80 and 8.29% for a six-month bill selling for  $9,603.10. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when  government securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

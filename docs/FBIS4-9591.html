			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 28 (AFP) -- The Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) expressed concern Thursday [28  April] at worsening human rights in the mainly Albanian Serbian  province of Kosovo. The international grouping, based in  Vienna, has asked authorities in Belgrade to allow the  resumption of long-term CSCE missions in the southern province  and other mixed areas, the Sandzak and Vojvodina, a statement  said.    "The CSCE is very concerned by the deterioration (...)  especially the recent suppression of human rights and basic  freedoms which have led to increased tension and instability in  the region," it said. The body has been notified of many cases  of arrests, detentions and arbitary police brutality against the  ethnic Albanian majority, "a flagrant violation of the  principles of the CSCE and the commitments made by the Serbian  authorities," it continued. The resumption of long-term  missions, banned by Belgrade last July, "could contribute to the  prevention of conflicts in the region," it said.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Investments with a sense of Balance  -A sector that looks attractive for first-timers THE UK Balanced sector might seem attractive for investors making their first move into unit trusts. Funds invest in a mixture of bonds and equities and, accordingly, tend to have a relatively high yield - which can be made even more appealing in a personal equity plan. As a sector, UK Balanced ranked eighth of 21 in the industry over the three years to April 1, with the average fund returning 24.9 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested); and seventh of 20 over 10 years, with an average return of 284.2 per cent. To qualify for the sector, a fund must have no more than 80 per cent of its portfolio in either shares or fixed interest. This gives the manager a lot of latitude. At the most conservative end, the fund could have 80 per cent in gilts and the rest in utilities such as water stocks. But an aggressive manager could have 80 per cent in equities and the rest in convertibles. So, first-timers need to choose a fund which meets their own risk preference. Unit trust managers should be prepared to send potential investors an annual report, setting out the fund's policy. The best performer in the sector over 10 years is Henderson Extra Income. Manager Kate Medd tries to run it for the private investor: her portfolio is split 80 per cent equities and 20 per cent bonds and she tends to favour high-yielding shares, a section of the market which has performed well over the past few months. Over three years, the fund is 17th of 33 and it has an above-average performance over both one and five years. The present quoted yield is 5.06 per cent. Over the short term, the best performer is Perpetual High Income. This fund is top over both three and five years and second over one year. Neil Woodford, who runs it, says the maximum 80 per cent is invested in equities. The trust holds more than 80 stocks, with no position worth more than 5 per cent. In terms of selection, it has been recovery-oriented. Although Woodford admits the move into recovery stocks might have been premature, it meant the fund was well placed for the market's post-ERM change of direction. The trust has moved gradually into an overweight position in medium and smaller sized companies, which also has improved its showing in recent months. Perpetual's performance - which has won it a number of fund management prizes - brought in a lot of funds from Pep investors at the end of the 1992-93 tax year. Micropal quoted its size on April 1 as Pounds 62m, but Woodford says the valuation is Pounds 95m now. The latest quoted yield is 4.52 per cent. N&amp;P's Higher Income trust is second in the sector over three years and top over one year. The trust is managed by Capel-Cure Asset Management (which also runs the highly successful Capability Growth and Capability Special Situations trusts). Crispin Finn, co-manager with Leonard Klahr, says it does not own any conventional bonds but has a mixture of equities and convertibles. The trust takes a contrarian view and has benefited from its holding of recovery stocks. At Pounds 3m, it is small, but funds are flowing in with the help of the link to the National &amp; Provincial building society. The present quoted yield is 5.07 per cent. Gartmore's High Income fund is third in the sector over 10 years. Ross Watson, the manager, says it has a 35 per cent weighting in fixed interest; it switched into these because of a disappointing performance from high-yielding shares. The fund has a below-average performance over one, three and five years. Its latest quoted yield is 5.02 per cent. The launch of three funds with a bond-equity mix earlier this year indicates this is a sector of the market which is likely to grow. Broadly speaking, the higher the proportion of bonds, the greater the yield and the more attractive the fund is to income-seeking Pep investors. A maximum of 49 per cent can be held in bonds for a trust to qualify for Pep status. Cazenove's Bond and Utility fund, which has a 7 per cent yield, should appear in Micropal figures for the sector next month. But M&amp;G's Managed Income trust, although it will have a bond-equity mix, is classed in the fund of funds sector and Fidelity's High Income fund will be classed under UK equity income. The vagaries of unit trust classification do not make the investor's life any easier.  ----------------------------------------   BEST UK BALANCED TRUSTS OVER 3 YEARS  ---------------------------------------- Fund                       Percent growth  ---------------------------------------- Perpetual High Inc             63.6 N&amp;P Higher Inc                 48.4 Buckmaster High Inc            48.1 Arkwright Inc                  40.8 Brit Life High Yld             40.8  ---------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: Bohemian bad behaviour - Cinema HOUSE OF ANGELS (15) Colin Nutley EQUINOX (15) Alan Rudolph BENNY AND JOON (12) Jeremiah Chechik SUPERMARIO BROS (PG) Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel Would you believe a Swedish film-maker called Colin Nutley? Before you reach for your Guinness Book of Cultural Incongruities, let me explain. Mr Nutley was born in England but lives and works in Sweden. House Of Angels is his third feature there: he has also made documentaries and, back in his brief British career, a controversial TV series called Annika. That tale of Swedish au-pairs, lapped up by the Swedes, became Nutley's calling card in Scandinavia. House Of Angels is a comedy of social disaster - and a delightful one - somewhere between Ibsen and Emmerdale Farm. Nutley is blithely offhand in setting up the plot. A village elder drops dead in an eccentric road accident - involving a rifle, a singing priest and two youngsters coupling in a parked van - and then a mysterious blonde girl appears at the funeral. 'I'm sorry I never knew you, grandpa,' she murmurs to the open grave: whereupon an older lady mourner, the old man's daughter, faints in shock. The newly-revealed illegitimate granddaughter (Helena Bergstrom) inherits the deceased's farm and the village trembles when her leather-clad boyfriend and fellow cabaret artiste (Rikard Wolff) moves in. He is followed by an army of louche friends who parade nude on the riverbank by day, wassail by night and are then indulged by the conscientiously peacemaking vicar when they bid to hold a concert in the church hall. Chainsaws, transvestism, sexy songs . . . Urban Bohemia meets the pastoral petit bourgeoisie; and the film could have been trampled underfoot by its own programmatic two-party comic politics. Instead - call it the great tradition of bruised British understatement (see Mike Leigh, Les Blair and company) - House Of Angels gives us laughter as subtle and oblique as reflected light. The reaction shot rules, and Nutley has found the faces to make it tell. Not just born comic victim-figures like the priest, his road to Hell-on-earth paved with good intentions; but the gnarled phizzes of the two old farming brothers whose jaws drop at tales of Berlin decadence, or the girl who runs the village shop and sees her boyfriend drawn to the blonde like metal to a magnet. The film's satiric bonhomie conjures breezes of comic euphoria from nowhere. In one scene the two codgers clump down a tree-lined avenue in their humble Sunday best - tight-buttoned shirts, ill-matching ties, freshly shined sandals - to meet the new neighbours while a full-throated hymn fills the soundtrack. The absurd presentational pride; the sense of interchangeable best-behaviour protocols (going to tea is a solemn, uplifting social event just like going to church); the pictorial play-off between nature's luxuriance and nurture's regimentation: all are here in a scene as casual as an aside. Finally, the film yields too much to its own feel-good instincts. Happy endings are distributed too glibly; irreconcilable opposites are forcibly reconciled. But not even this late surge of sentimentality, though it may account for the film's runaway popularity in Sweden, where it has broken box-office records, can smother the sly wit and astringency of what went before.                           *        *       * Equinox could only come from the pen and lens of writer-director Alan Rudolph. The film-maker defines his film as 'a regular movie with all the regular bits taken out.' (Compare similar Rudolphs such as Remember My Name, Choose Me and Trouble In Mind). But Equinox is a doppelganger thriller with all the thrills not so much taken out as teasingly internalised. Matthew Modine dons alternate hairstyles - hedgehog and flop-mop - as two identical twins who have never met since the womb. Now grown up in Empire City (New York), one Modine is a gangster's assistant, the other a garage hand. Paths are set to cross when their unknown Ma dies, leaving a letter, a mysterious fortune and a vacated movie screen ready to be filled with the largest supporting cast since Noah's Ark. Check them as they come: the garage Modine's fat, soft-boiled foster-father (M. Emmet Walsh), the gangster Modine's slim, hardboiled boss (Fred Ward), the aspiring lady writer who pilfers Ma's letter and pieces the story together (Tyra Farrell), Modine 1's best friend (Kevin J O'Connor), Modine 2's best friend (Tate Donovan) and the sea of girlfriends/sisters/wives/hookers. Here the style ranges from Lara Flynn Boyle's noirish temptress in the upstairs apartment, part spinster part spiderwoman, to Marisa Tomei's good-hearted, drunk-on-giggles, funny-accented whore. If Antonioni and Fellini had ever teamed up to adapt Poe's William Wilson it might have come out like this. But no, not even then. Rudolph's style has an inimitable absurdist melancholy. This plot's convolutions begin by irritating and end by becoming a monstrous, marvellous lingua franca for the confusions of life itself. Which of us has not felt himself living parallel identities in a world divided between violent purpose (gangsters) and homely purposelessness (garage hand)? And which of us has not sometimes echoed Modine's cry of 'My whole life seems to be taking place without me in it'?                           *        *       * Benny And Joon is one of those films that have crashed through the looking-glass into that mythical land called Middle America. You recognise a Hollywood film about medium-poor people in the provinces by the fact that they live in a palace, mildly distressed, somewhere in Small Town, USA. Benny (Aidan Quinn) runs a garage; his sister (Mary Stuart Masterson) paints and is mentally disturbed; and the new boarder (Johnny Depp) in their rambling clapboard mansion idolises and imitates Buster Keaton. Upshot: holy-eyed innocent falls in love with brush-wielding mad girl and greasy-handed brother is saved the trouble of putting her in a home. The film, of course, never expresses itself so brusquely. Sugary songs caress the soundtrack; Mr Depp bats his large emotive eyes in a no-make-up reprise of Edward Scissorhands; and Miss Masterson's mental illness is one of those conditions you only find in a medical dictionary under 'H for Hollywood.' Scripted by ex-circus clown Barry Berman and produced by MGM, this project may have seemed to promise a second benediction at the box-office for the studio that brought us Rain Man. But it is more like death by slow drizzle: notable only for the few surreal learning experiences we witness through the curtain of schmaltz, like how to make toasted cheese with a steam-iron and how to mash potatoes with a tennis racket.                           *        *       * In Super Mario Bros the age of Nintendo reaches the large screen in a film that should carry a health warning. If you do not get epilepsy from the parent video game, you may acquire it here. Seeking to save the universe from destruction, swashbuckling Brooklyn plumbers Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo break through into a parallel dimension peopled by ageing Hollywood delinquents (Dennis Hopper as Koopa the Lizard King), ex-RSC actresses slumming it (Fiona Shaw as Mrs Koopa) and frenetic special effects. Pushed from plot-point to plot-point like human cursors, they and we are presented with alligator-headed stormtroopers, sub-Spielberg baby dinosaurs, chases through hi-tech futureworlds and large quantities of are-we-hearing-correctly dialogue. ('Trust the fungus'; 'De-evolve him right now'). For anyone but Nintendo addicts the film will be complete Greek: with just a few lifelines to the adventure cinema we once knew and loved in Mr Hopper's snarl, Mr Leguizamo's swashbuckle and a nubile heroine-in-distress (Samantha Mathis) who scampers through the story with the bare covering of a Ph. D. in prehistoric anthropology.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Doctor Subtle's twin pillars: Prof Giuliano Amato, Italy's new prime minister, explains his plans for economic and political reform Prof Giuliano Amato, Italy's new Socialist prime minister, has dumbfounded even his closest colleagues. No postwar Italian prime minister has headed such a fragile government coalition with a mere 16-seat parliamentary majority. Yet after less than two weeks in office he has emerged as a man determined to make up for the long years in which successive governments ducked reform of an increasingly ossified political and economic system. 'We are going to change the rules,' insists the 54-year-old law professor and former deputy head of the Socialist party. Nicknamed 'Dr Sottile' (Doctor Subtle) for his slight frame and formidable intellect, he signalled his intentions in last Friday's emergency budget, which went well beyond a simple financial operation. He set in motion a series of reforms to pensions, healthcare, local government spending and civil service employment, as well as a privatisation programme heralding the biggest shake-up in state ownership since Mussolini pioneered state-sponsored development in the 1930s. Surrounded by documents in the prime minister's 17th-century Rome palace, he is aware that one of his hardest tasks is to win credibility. Italians and foreigners alike have come to regard any promise of reform from an Italian politician with the cynicism reserved for an oft-heard cry of wolf. The prime minister was already a treasury minister in the 1980s and heads a government composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - the very same parties who ignored the budget deficit, pension reform and electoral reform over the past three years precisely when Italy was being obliged to bring itself into line with European Community norms. So what is different now? Prof Amato recounts a conversation he had with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany at last week's Munich summit. He asked Mr Kohl if he was surprised that the same four-party coalition was in power after being battered in the April elections. Mr Kohl said that he was not, because they were the only viable majority, providing the faces were different. 'The people are different, so are the circumstances,' Prof Amato says. His 24-person cabinet contains, unusually, six technicians, three of whom are directly concerned with economic and industrial reform. As for the circumstances, Italians have been warned that with an uncontrolled public-sector deficit of more than 10.5 per cent of GDP, Italy is on 'the edge of an abyss'. Rather than seeing himself as tainted by involvement with previous governments - he was the key organiser for Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, when premier from 1983-87 - Prof Amato sees this as an advantage. 'People who know the system are familiar with its rules and have in mind how the system can be changed,' he maintains, adding, however, that 'change is never easy. Those who want change are not experts in the areas they want to change - so generally when they come on the scene it's a disaster. The experts usually don't want to change anything because the reason they are experts is because they defend the system.' He regards his government as guiding a 'transition' from a corporatist state and patronage politics to Italy becoming a modern member of the EC. His strategy is two-pronged. The first prong might be called the Me-or-Else scenario. He is introducing his budget and reforms by decree, which must be approved by parliament within 90 days. The decrees contain the broad principles of legislation, but once approved by parliament the government then has the authority to fill in the details. This avoids the interminable process of sabotage and change suffered by previous initiatives (pension reform has been under discussion for more than 10 years). If the decrees are not approved, then Prof Amato will seek a parliamentary vote of confidence. He believes he can obtain approval by presenting the unattractive alternatives. Who could form another government? Would a disgruntled electorate support a return to the status quo ante? Would the heavily fragmented and internally divided parties accept new elections without prior reform of Italy's unworkable system of proportional representation? Finally, who could solve the problem of Italy's disastrous public finances? 'It is very difficult to expect another cabinet to do tomorrow what has to be done today,' he says. This calculation gives him confidence, and he adds bleakly: 'I don't see a great future if they (the political parties) don't understand.' Perhaps because this message is sinking in, the reaction to his programme has so far been muted. The second prong has yet to be fully appreciated by the politicians. He has told parliamentary leaders he regards institutional reform, which is also being pressed by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, as their prerogative. In other words, parliament must draw up plans for changes in proportional representation, direct election of mayors, new powers for the regions and even a redefinition of the prime minister's and president's roles. However, Prof Amato has assumed responsibility for economic management and by his own definition economic reform. The thrust of these reforms would be to slim down the role of the state, increase competition and remove political interference. Thus economic reform, which is likely to come faster, could in itself precipitate political reform. Prof Amato says his philosophy is that of 'the market whenever possible, the state whenever necessary'. But he is very much a pragmatic Socialist. The budget, in which he exercised considerable influence, reflects his frustrating two-year experience as treasury minister. 'As treasury minister I was perfectly aware that the typical Italian budget was like a devaluation  -it produces effects for a few weeks but does nothing to change fundamentals such as public expenditure.' He recalls preparing a budget for Italy's army of teachers only to discover that some 50,000 'new' staff had crept on to the payroll after the calculations had been made. 'If you don't change these sorts of things, it is pointless to bother people with one budget after another.' He left without being able to tackle these fundamentals. 'And now we are exactly at the same point three years later.' Friday's budget seeks to find L30,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn) to hold the public sector deficit down to its original 1992 projection of about L128,000bn. The cabinet has gone for anti-inflation measures weighted towards special taxes on property and a one-off tax on bank deposits - as opposed to swingeing spending cuts. He answers criticism of avoiding such cuts by saying: 'First I have to tackle the rules and principles which condition spending.' The latter cover five areas: pensions, public employment, health, decentralisation and privatisation. The current generous state pension scheme risks gobbling up the entire budget if unchecked. The pension scheme outlined in the budget envisages a gradual move to retirement at 65 for both sexes, with a combination of incentives and sanctions for those who wish to avail themselves of the current 55 years for women and 60 for men. Final benefit will also be slightly reduced. While pension reform was widely anticipated, Prof Amato has surprised everyone by tackling other issues head on. On public employment he is determined to revitalise the civil service with greater job flexibility, new job definitions and gearing pay to productivity. 'There is no control of what our senior civil servants do . . . It is essential to introduce productivity,' he says. 'Experts have been saying for years that it is impossible to raise productivity in the public sector. They are right, because the way the system is organised, it is impossible. Productivity is foreign to the system.' On the national health service, he is proposing to remove political control from local health authorities, which will be given greater autonomy and the possibility of hospitals opting out, as in the UK. Until now local health authorities have had no budgetary control and have been one of the biggest sources of corruption. As a result large sums are spent to little effect. The same considerations apply to local government at the municipal and regional level. Each year the state merely transfers funds, with no sanction for overspending. The government now proposes that municipalities will be able to raise additional property taxes (1 lira per 1,000 on a house), additional income tax (starting at 1 per cent above national rates, rising to 4 per cent by 1994), as well as increased road taxes. The biggest immediate shake-up, however, concerns privatisation. 'We have an overload of state ownership and we have to reduce it not just to pay debts, . . . and at the same time we need a better financial market. We are trying to create a system with which we can face the European financial market saying we can make deals in which you can buy,' says Prof Amato. Already the four big state entities - IRI, the main holding company; ENI, the oil concern; ENEL, the electricity authority; and INA, the insurance institute - have become joint stock companies under the treasury's tutelage as a preliminary to selling off stakes in their subsidiaries. 'I am creating a machine that will be forced towards privatisation,' Prof Amato insists. 'There is no capital, no financial backing in the system as it is.' The two new holdings, to be created under the treasury to hold state assets worth some L60,000bn, will be attractive to investors, he believes. But their real value, in which the private sector will take a maximum 45 per cent, will be in the performance of the companies they control and intend to sell off, he claims. Deflecting criticism that the state still harbours ambitions to be a majority shareholder, he says: 'Those who understand these operations can easily see that under the two super-holdings there is a big push towards privatisation because that's the only way for the system to work.' To listen to an Italian prime minister talking in these terms is perhaps the beginning of revolution, turning the seemingly impossible into the possible: changing the Italian way. But the lack of challenge to his vision so far may be deceptive, because his changes threaten so many of the country's entrenched vested interests.</p>

The source told the BANGKOK POST that two Burmese army  battalions of about 800 soldiers had set up positions near the  NMSP headquarters at Baho and appeared poised for an attack.    The 104th and 433rd Battalions from Tavoy township had been  located near Ale Sakan village, only about 30 kilometres south  of the NMSP headquarters.    The two infantry battalions are believed to be poised for an  attack, the source said.    The NMSP headquarters is located about 50 kilometres south  of  the Three Pagoda Pass.    The evacuation of Mon ethnic refugees from Lo Loe Camp in  Sangkhla Buri District to a new camp at Hlakhani in Burma has  continued. About 300 Mon refugees were moved to the new camp  yesterday.    About 8,000 Mon refugees had been housed at Loh Loe camp,  and  about 5,000 of them have been moved to the new camp since last  month.    The Mon believe that Thailand wants to please Burma so that  in cooperation with the Petroleum Authority of Thailand they can  lay a gas pipeline from the coastal town of Amherst in Burma to  Kanchanaburi Province.</p>

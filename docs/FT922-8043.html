			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commercial vehicle output surges: April car output down on last year CAR PRODUCTION in the UK was 2.3 per cent lower last month than in April last year but output of commercial vehicles was sharply higher, continuing the strong recovery started late last year. Car output in April, at 108,641, fell from 111,138 in the same month a year ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office. In the first four months of this year, car production was 1.2 per cent lower at 451,959 compared with 457,301 in the same period last year. Output for the domestic market has strengthened and rose year-on-year by 13.8 per cent in the first four months to 263,962. That was offset by falling production for export markets, which were 16.6 per cent lower at 187,997. On a seasonally adjusted basis, car output in the past six months was 1 per cent higher than in the previous six months but 6 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. Commercial vehicle production of 22,555 in April was 24.6 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago. Output in the first four months was 17.5 per cent higher, at 89,399, compared with 76,063 in the same period last year. Output of commercial vehicles has been helped by an increase in output of small vans by Ford, which started producing its new Courier high-roof Fiesta van range at Dagenham late last year. UK sales have fallen for 31 consecutive months year-on-year and the domestic commercial vehicle market remains depressed, but the rise in output this year has been supported by a big jump in exports.</p>

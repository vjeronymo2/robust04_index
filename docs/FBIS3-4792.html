Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister,  disclosed that he had talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter  Mondale last weekend.    Mondale said Japan has more to do to open its auto market  than addressing macroeconomic issues, Kumagai told a regular  press conference.    Mondale spoke "very harshly" on Japan's trade stance, said  Kumagai.    Kumagai's remarks indicate Tokyo's understanding that the  United States places highest priority on auto and auto parts  issues under the bilateral trade "framework" talks.    Kumagai said the Japanese auto industry should "listen  earnestly" to U.S. discontent over slow access to the Japanese  auto market, which is to suggest the industry should push ahead  with a voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made  automobiles and auto components.    On the state of the nation's economy, Kumagai said there are  signs of an increase in activity, citing the latest improvement  in employment and manufacturing statistics.    It is still unclear if the recession has bottomed out or not  but overall sentiment has turned upward, he noted.    It is unlikely that Japan's economy alone would stay in the  doldrums, Kumagai said.</p>

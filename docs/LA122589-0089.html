			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAND SIGNS CRUCIAL IMF LOAN DEAL  </P> <P> Poland has signed an important loan package with the International Monetary  Fund that will help the East European nation switch to a Western free-market  style economy.  </P> <P> The deal, reported by the official PAP news agency Saturday, will release a  $725-million IMF standby loan and trigger other Western aid for Poland's  near-bankrupt economy.  </P> <P> It will aid the Solidarity-led government, running the country after decades of  communism, in efforts to move away from a cumbersome, centrally planned  economy.  </P> <P> "Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and Polish National Bank President  Wladyslaw Baka signed the letter of intent to the IMF," the agency said.  </P> <P> The deal was delayed last Tuesday because the entire Polish cabinet wanted to  examine its provisions closely before the letter was signed.  </P> <P> The letter sets out a detailed program designed to curb Poland's 500% annual  inflation and start restructuring its economy along market lines.  </P></p>

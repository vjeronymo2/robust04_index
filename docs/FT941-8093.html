			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact relaunch likely today Cocoa-producing and consuming countries are expected today to launch a new five-year agreement to bring supply and demand into balance, despite continuing delays in signing up members. Delegates at a council meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) in London yesterday were optimistic that a gathering under United Nations auspices would put the agreement into force. The cocoa pact, agreed last July, requires the backing of countries representing 80 per cent of world exports and 60 per cent of imports. It appeared yesterday that these thresholds had still not been formally reached. It was unclear whether Brazil, the second largest producer, had completed membership formalities, while Italy, Portugal and Ireland on the consumer side faced procedural delays in ratifying the agreement. However, countries that have joined have the right to decide under the sponsorship of the UN Conference on Trade and Development whether to start the new agreement anyway, pending the arrival of the new members. The pact, which was due to come into effect last October, will set up management committees to control output and encourage consumption. Despite the prospect of a third or even fourth consecutive shortfall in cocoa supplies, world stocks are around 1m tonnes and the ICCO still has 180,000 tonnes of buffer stock to liquidate. World prices are about Pounds 900 a tonne, compared with Pounds 2,000 in 1984.</p>

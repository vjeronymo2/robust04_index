			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The western approach to gentle persuasion / A look at a scheme for young east European entrepreneurs In a room at the top of a grand period residence in Queen Anne's Gate, London, five eastern European young entrepreneurs are considering the following proposition: 'Selling is a persuasive process where one individual motivates another individual to buy'. Aniko Mirtse, aged 22, product manager of a small company in Debrecen, Hungary, checks her dictionary against the flip-chart. The words 'persuasive' and 'motivates' are causing her some problems, but it is difficult to tell whether her difficulties are principally linguistic or ideological. For Mirtse and her fellow entrepreneurs, the seminar on selling is part of a British-based project to provide first-hand experience of a western European market economy. Participants spend a month or two seconded to a small business in Britain, combining practical experience with training sessions and social events. For the sponsoring small businesses the programme may provide, in return, an entree to eastern European markets at a cost of nothing but their time. The scheme is organised by a small charity called Enterprise Europe, which was set up in 1990 by a group of people in their twenties. Pippa Markus, former press officer for the Institute of Directors and a founding member of the charity, is now its full-time director. 'A group of us watched the Berlin Wall coming down and felt we wanted to play some role in the vast changes that were happening. We particularly wanted to do something practical for people like us, of our age, who were interested in work and getting on. Some of us also had eastern European backgrounds,' she says. The need for technological know-how in eastern Europe is not as acute as the need for training in, for example, marketing, financial planning, presentation and customer relations, according to Markus. Money to fund the scheme is raised from charitable trusts and large companies, some of which have also paid the full costs of placements. For small businesses, all the expenses are met by the charity, and on-the-job training is supplemented by seminars organised by Enterprise Europe. Stephen Cowan, director of a sales training group called Focus and a member of the charity's ruling council, is the volunteer trainer at the Queen Anne's Gate session. Trainees are principally from Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia although, as the programme establishes itself, the intention is to extend the scheme to Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic Republics. About 100 applications a week from prospective trainees land on the London office desk - 14 have passed through the programme since the second part of last year and further expansion has been limited by lack of suitable small business placements. Enterprise Europe prefers trainees to be under 35 and in full-time employment in their own country, commonly at a pre- or lower management level - 'the next generation of business leaders in eastern Europe,' says Markus. For example, of the present batch battling with 'persuasion' and 'motivation' in the selling seminar, is Marcin Slupski, from Poznan, Poland. He is 28, and the managing director of a small private company called Inkey, which sells security systems. It is Slupski's first visit to the UK and he has spent a month with TDSi, a company in Dorset which develops access controls. He has been examining ways the two companies can co-operate, as well as studying TDSi's products and management. Richard Benda, from Brno, Czechoslovakia, is 27 and a manager with a trade fairs and exhibitions company. He has been teamed up by Enterprise Europe with a mobile exhibition company in Northampton called Business Link. This placement is an example of the mutual benefits possible under the scheme: Benda's stay is leading directly to a Czech venture for the company, says Business Link managing director Anthony Lunch. 'We've increasingly been taking exhibitions abroad and we've had an eye on eastern European opportunities, but what we needed was a friendly pair of hands on the other side. Richard Benda has lived very much up to expectations. We're taking a mobile exhibition to Czechoslovakia in October,' says Lunch. Benda has covered the range of Business Link's work from going out and about selling, to using data bases back at the office. He has networked ferociously during his month's stay, meeting local authority officials, Chamber of Commerce chiefs, and dining at the House of Commons with the local MP. And, reports Lunch, Benda has had a taste of operating in a more informal, questioning and less bureaucratic environment. While travel, accommodation costs and other expenses are met by Enterprise Europe, sponsoring small businesses have to pledge to set aside time conscientiously for training and supervision. The time involved should not be underestimated. Says Lunch: 'In a small company there's no-one to delegate to. It can be difficult to keep the person busy all the time.' Meanwhile, back at Queen Anne's Gate it is Benda's turn to puzzle over the flip-chart; this time the problem is very definitely ideological rather than linguistic. In front of the trainees is a triangular diagram depicting Maslow's 'hierarchy of needs'. Maslow's theory, roughly, is that there are five levels of human need for satisfaction, starting with basic physiological needs, for example for food and shelter, and finishing with the need for self-fulfilment, which can never be completely satisfied. In between the base of the triangle and its apex are security, social and ego needs. The triangle forms the basis of marketing and professional selling, explains Stephen Cowan. Benda earnestly questions Cowan in the coffee break about the morality of Maslow's theory. Physiological, security and social needs, he has been taught, should be taken care of by the state, while ego and self-fulfilment needs are anti-social and should be denied. However, to Cowan's delight, Benda and his fellow young entrepreneurs are, by the end of the day, filled with enthusiasm and are practising western selling techniques on each other. They appear to be fully equipped to exploit any ego needs that might be burgeoning among customers in their own countries. Enterprise Europe, 36 Broadway, London SW1H 0BH. Tel: 071 976 8157</p>

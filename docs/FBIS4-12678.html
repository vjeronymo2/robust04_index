			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat's plane landed in Amman,  without any prearrangements, and was received by Prime Minister  Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. Meanwhile, a senior Jordanian  official asked: Why has this man come and what does he want?    Foreign Minister Talal al-Hasan, King Husayn's political  adviser Marwan al-Qasim, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali arrived  one after the other at the al-Hashimiyah Palace, where President  Yasir 'Arafat was staying. At 2130, his majesty the king and  his royal highness the crown prince arrived at the al-Hashimiyah  Palace. The two sides talked for approximately one hour and  then went to dine with the king.    Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] reviewed part of the talks with  Israel and complained about the Rabin government's  procrastination, prevarication, and oscillating policies. He  added that the Rabin government, which shows enthusiasm for  achieving progress in the settlement process, keeps retreating  from this enthusiasm as a result of pressure from the Army.    Abu-'Ammar said that Israel is divided and that the views of  the politicians in the Rabin government regarding the peace  process are different from the views of the Army, which is  becoming influential on the political level. Abu-'Ammar said  that it has been decided that the settlements in Gaza will be  dismantled, but Israel wants a high price in return. Regarding  the Hebron settlements, the Government of Israel promised to  tighten their grip on them and to place harsh conditions on the  settlers there to force them to leave.    Abu-'Ammar expressed his belief that all of the settlements  in the West Bank will not be that difficult of a problem in the  long run, however, he added, the major complication lies in the  issue of Jerusalem and the settlements around it, which are  growing every day.    Following his review of the Palestinian stand, King Husayn  asked 'Arafat: What do you want from Jordan? And how do you  view Jordanian-Palestinian coordination and cooperation at the  present time?    His majesty said: We, in Jordan, call on you to form a  permanent bilateral coordination committee so that our acts will  not conflict with yours, so that the dialogue with Israel will  not be at both our and your expense, so that the results of your  talks with Israel will not undermine Jordanian interests, and so  that the solutions will not be at the expense of Jordan and its  role.    When President 'Arafat failed to respond and attempted to  change the course of the discussions, Prince Hasan repeated the  demand to launch a permanent coordination committee, as his  majesty the king had just proposed. Prince Hasan added: What  we want is to create a permanent framework for cooperation, one  that brings together politicians and specialized experts. This  framework must have a permanent headquarters and meet regularly.  This is important if our coordination is not to be accomplished  in pieces.    Abu-'Ammar approved this proposal. He insisted, however,  that both sides start with a joint committee on Jerusalem, with  the understanding that the powers of this committee will expand  in the future to include all aspects of cooperation and  coordination between Jordan and the PLO. This is because the  Palestinian president, who is planning to return to Gaza on 15  May 1994, believes that his bargaining position will be enhanced  once he sets foot on Palestinian territory. He believes that  once he does so, his dealings with Jordan will be on an equal  footing.    His majesty the king reiterated the need for continuous and  clear coordination between Jordan and the PLO in the face of  Israeli ambitions and U.S. pressure. He also urged President  'Arafat to hold consultations with Syria and Lebanon, and to  cooperate with them. He insinuated that true cooperation is  currently taking place among Amman, Damascus, and Beirut, noting  that the PLO's involvement in this cooperation would consummate  inter-Arab cooperation.    President 'Arafat halfheartedly agreed to the king's  proposals. But, he changed the subject addressing King Husayn  jokingly, saying: Your Majesty the King, please protect me from  the PLO Executive Committee members. They disagree with me on  most issues. Then, Abu-'Ammar plunged into a lengthy talk on  the U.S. penetration of Islamic movements. He cited many things  that he said he learned when he attempted to mediate between  [former president of Afghanistan] Najibullah and the Afghan  mujahidin. He said that he then discovered the great influence  the United States wielded within the ranks of the Afghan  mujahidin, an eventuality made possible by the arms provided to  them by the CIA. He said that U.S. planes landed in  Afghanistan, carrying the most sophisticated weapons to the  mujahidin, and returned with planeloads of heroine and various  other drugs.    It was midnight, and the royal banquet was over when his  majesty the king and other Jordanian officials left the  al-Hashimiyah Palace with hopes of effecting a transition from a  phase of piecemeal coordination to a phase of regular and  continuous coordination between Jordan and the PLO.</p>

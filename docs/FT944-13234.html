			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Loss of prudence: Canada's big government debt burden There was a time when one of the world's safest investments was a bond issued by the government of Canada. With a stable political system, a solid, sophisticated economy and a reputation for prudence, Canada was among a handful of sovereign borrowers that could boast a triple-A credit rating. Canadian bonds are no longer such a safe bet. Together with Sweden and Italy, Canada is now at the top of the list of industrial countries where public-sector profligacy has reached dangerous proportions. 'We are in hock up to our eyeballs,' finance minister Paul Martin bluntly told a parliamentary committee in Ottawa last week. The federal government's debt will reach CDollars 550bn (Pounds 250bn) early next year, bringing the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, a common measure of a country's ability to service its debt, to 74 per cent. More than a third of Ottawa's revenues is now channelled into interest payments, up from 11 per cent in 1974. But this is by no means the full extent of the problem. The 10 provinces and public utilities, such as Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec, are also heavy borrowers. Ontario, for example, is among the most active non-sovereign borrowers in the euromarkets. At the end of the current fiscal year, the provinces will have a combined debt burden of more than CDollars 200bn, or 28 per cent of GDP. 'The sheer magnitude of Canada's foreign debt in relation to the size of the economy means that Canada has be-come excessively vulnerable to the volatile sentiments of global financial markets,' was the warning in a document distributed by Mr Martin's department last week. 'We have suffered a tangible loss of economic sovereignty.' Such warnings do not appear misplaced. The proportion of Canada's total debt held outside the country is now equivalent to 44 per cent of GDP, with more than a quarter of the federal government's debt in foreign hands. According to one senior Toronto banker, it would not take much, in such a finely balanced situation, to engulf Canada in a full-blown financial crisis. Investor confidence appears to be holding up, but it is fragile. The gap between Canadian and US bond yields has recently narrowed, with the 10-year spread down to 1.27 percentage points from more than 1.6 points in July. This would normally indicate favourable investor sentiment. However, with inflation virtually non-existent in Canada, real returns are extraordinarily high. The real return on Canadian bonds is more than 9 per cent, against about 5.3 per cent on comparable US treasury bonds. Some warning shots have been fired across Canada's bows. The triple-A rating has gone. Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, has downgraded half of Canada's 10 provinces over the past three years, and upgraded none. The agency has also warned that 'high public-sector deficits and uncertainties regarding the new Quebec government's sovereignty goals could further agitate the debt markets'. High deficits are certainly agitating Canadian business leaders, who charge that they constitute the most serious drag on the country's long-term economic prospects. The Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief executives, recently noted that the 'fiscal crisis' had given Canada 'real interest rates that are among the highest in the industrialised world, a devalued currency, an alarming amount of foreign indebtedness, declining confidence among Canadian and foreign investors in the management of Canada's public finances, the export of capital, and the expectation that taxes will rise even higher to deal with bloated deficits.' Canadian politicians' record on fiscal policy is dismal. The former Progressive Conservative government, which held office in 1984-93, missed almost every deficit-reduction target, and the budget shortfall in its final year in office was a record CDollars 42bn. Making matters worse, Ottawa has little control over the provinces' fiscal policies or borrowing activities. Yet transfers to the provinces, to help fund health, welfare and education, consume about 23 per cent of federal spending, excluding debt-service. The federal government and most of the provinces have so far avoided spending cuts in social programmes, although these account for almost 60 per cent of federal spending. Weary of carrying one of the world's heaviest tax burdens, Canadians appear willing for the first time in decades to accept public service cutbacks. The Conservative government in Alberta is one of the most popular in the country, despite closing schools and hospital beds, and privatising many public services. Thanks partly to rising oil revenues, Alberta is on track to achieve a balanced budget in fiscal 1996-97. Mr Martin has now put his Liberal government's credibility on the line by promising to chop the federal deficit from CDollars 42bn or 5.4 per cent of GDP last year to about CDollars 25bn or 3 per cent in 1996-97. 'It is a target we will meet, come hell or high water,' he said last week. He plans to outline specific deficit-cutting measures in next February's budget. He will be helped by accelerating business activity, which has begun to boost tax revenues. While federal and provincial deficits were fuelled by overspending during the 1980s, stagnant revenues have since been the main reason for the failure to achieve deficit-reduction goals. However, there will also have to be cuts in social programmes. Mr Lloyd Axworthy, minister responsible for overhauling the social-security net, has yet to convince the business community that he is willing, or able, to make substantial savings. Fearful of a political backlash, Mr Axworthy published a paper earlier this month which raised numerous options, but contained no firm proposals. He aims to introduce legislation next spring. But the timetable could slip as special interest groups and the provinces resist change. And Mr Axworthy has avoided the thorny issue of pensions, which the previous Conservative government tried, but failed, to tackle almost a decade ago. In February's budget, therefore, Mr Martin is likely to fall back on tax increases and the closure of tax loopholes to reach his target. For financial markets, an austere 1995 budget would be no more than a start in tackling Canada's debt problem. A CDollars 25bn deficit in 1996-97 would stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio, but not reduce it significantly. Mr Martin has given no timetable for achieving his long-term aim of a balanced budget. In view of the broken promises of the past, he and his provincial counterparts will need to build a track record before holders of Canadian bonds can relax.</p>

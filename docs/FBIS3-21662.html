			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Lieutenant General Chettha  Thanacharo, the 1st Army Region commander, talked with reporters  on 12 December about the arrest of Major General Thanat  Phakpadiphat, an officer assigned to Supreme Command, by DEA  [Drug Enforcement Administration] officials in Hong Kong on  narcotics-trafficking charges. He said that this is a personal  matter and that he doesn't know much about this. If he knew  anything about this, he would be smarter than American  officials. Those who do something wrong must be dealt with in  accord with the law. That's it. As for issuing statements about  this, that is the duty of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The  military probably won't get involved.    The reporter asked, If someone in the military is involved  in  narcotics trafficking, will that affect the military? Lt. Gen.  Chettha said that it shouldn't. The military is a huge  organization. If only five out of a hundred people are bad,  that's pretty good. But there are more than 100,000 people in  the military. This shouldn't have any adverse effect on the  military. We have constantly carried on narcotics suppression  activities. Even abroad, even if the president or prime minister  is involved in such activities, action must be taken in accord  with the law. If there is clear evidence that a high-ranking  official is involved, he must be punished in accord with the  law. But if he is innocent, the military has disciplinary  measures to provide help.    General Charan Kunlawanit, the secretary general of the  National Security Council (NSC), said that foreigners have  frequently charged that Thais are involved in  narcotics-trafficking activities. But he would like to ask  foreigners, "Instead of focusing on the traffickers, why don't  you stop buying drugs? If foreigners focus on just the one  aspect, they will never solve this problem." The reporter said  that there have been reports that both civilian and military  officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. Gen. Charan  said that he doesn't know anything about that. But he said that  this does not concern the security of the nation. Rather, this  is a matter of someone breaking the law. The units concerned  must conduct an investigation. He does not, however, always  believe what foreigners say, because foreigners like to meddle  in Thailand's affairs. Thailand has done good things, but  foreigners have never praised us. Thus, things must be done very  carefully. [passage omitted]    General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the minister of interior and  minister of labor, was interviewed by a reporter at Wat Phra  Simahathat about the reports that other senior government  officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. He said that  the person's position has nothing to do with it. Anyone who  violates the law must be punished. As for coordinating things  with American officials in arresting high-ranking military  officers said to be involved in narcotics trafficking, police  officials are monitoring and investigating things. There are  data, but before any action can be taken, there must be  compelling evidence. An investigation must be conducted first.  We can't base our actions on what they say. He said that  everything will turn out fine. We have to do things in our own  way. There is no reason for concern, because we know what is  what. We know what is going on. Thailand has constantly helped  the United States on narcotics matters. It's not true that we  won't help. We have given more help than people realize.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / City report scorns Treasury policy for rail: Charges for road use in the capital urged THE GOVERNMENT'S view that private-sector money will help fund new railway projects has been sharply contradicted by a detailed report for the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City. The study, by the London School of Economics, says the solution to London's transport problems lies in higher fares, heavier property taxes and the introduction of charges for road use, rather than 'unrealistic' attempts to get the private sector interested in unprofitable projects. The report comes just days after the chancellor's Budget speech reaffirmed the government's determination to involve the private sector in funding transport projects - including the Pounds 2bn east-west CrossRail scheme through London. It says investment in public transport projects in London is 'so fundamentally unprofitable' that private finance will not make a very significant contribution. 'There is a danger that unrealistic aspirations for attracting private finance will divert attention from the real issues and continue to sanction delay,' it warns. 'All concerned will have to face up to the hard fact that if new major investment is to take place in London's transport infrastructure then some form of tax financing is going to have to be the majority source of funds.' The report, by Mr Stephen Glaister and Mr Tony Travers of the LSE, is being published as part of the City Research Project, a three-year study into London's competitive position in international financial services. It says about Pounds 1.9bn a year is needed to fund London's public transport needs. The Corporation of London believes that the low rents accompanying London's over-supply of office space make it an attractive place to do business, but the offices will be filled only if there is sufficient capacity in the transport system. Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation of London's policy committee chairman, said yesterday: 'Financial services thrive in city-centre locations and have to be served by rail connections. 'CrossRail, the most important of the infrastructure improvements for the City of London, would equip the Square Mile to achieve its leadership role in international finance. Without it, yet another opportunity to promote the powerhouse of the nation's invisible earnings capability will have been lost.' The City Research Project: Meeting the Transport Needs of the City.

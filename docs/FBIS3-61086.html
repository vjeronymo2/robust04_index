			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Utitsin under the heading "Search": "Metal </F> Rock"]    [Text] First of all I want to give my best regards to  the members of the militia on the event of their recent holiday,  in hopes that they will also give us a holiday someday: a little  respite from banditry. Secondly, let us talk about a serious  matter: the smuggling of strategic raw materials and rare earth  metals out of the former USSR. And here is why: if Mariya Devi  Khristov has prophesied the end of the world correctly (24  November, or according to posters in Moscow October -- mark it  down on you calendar), then the buyers of nuclear weapons  components will only warn a "close circle of restricted  individuals" about it...  <H5>  Spherical Thieves </H5>   Journalists have gotten in the habit of saying that when the  organized crime members shoot it out with each other they are  dividing up spheres of influence. When you ask militiamen about  the structures of these groups, the answer you get is that that  all depends on spheres of influence. What sort of spheres are  these? It is hard to describe them precisely, the militia  explains, because the term includes both the areas in which the  gangs operate, various operations by commercial structures which  serve as fronts, and the high-paying crime business in which the  bandits themselves engage. According to Ministry of Internal  Affairs representatives, the oldest (i.e. most well-established)  and profitable of those types of business are antique smuggling  and the drug trade. A new business in existence since about 1988  involves the smuggling of strategic raw materials and rare earth  metals.    A press briefing on this topic was given by the Moscow  Internal Affairs Main Administration last Wednesday. First  journalists heard Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics: the  number of cases of theft and smuggling of strategic raw  materials increased by a factor of two in 1993 compared to the  previous year. The briefing organizers' explanation for this  phenomenon was twofold: firstly, the raw materials are now  freely available for sale and, secondly, there is inflation,  which is forcing citizens to carry off magnesium from plants in  sacks or in convenient hiding places in their clothing. This  situation leads one to the conclusion that if ordinary workers  are carting off our country's defensive wealth, then they must  have gotten their example from someone in management. As noted  at the briefing, the administrators of enterprises often  conspire with commercial structures. The administration writes  off materials as waste, after which businessmen export that  "waste" to other countries. And not to very distant countries  either -- the Baltic countries, for example.    Also alarming is the fact that, according to KOMMERSANT's  information, for the past three years Moscow has not been the  focus of attention by law enforcement organs as a center of  strategic raw material smuggling. But now comes this briefing...  <H5>  How It All Began </H5>   In the mid-1980's, almost immediately after the beginning of  perestroyka, uranium, plutonium and other materials of interest  to those wanting to build nuclear weapons began to be quietly  shipped out of the USSR. In the early 1990's I was invited to  meet with a secretary of the South Korean Embassy, who spent a  long time telling me about the possible effects of a nuclear  strike by North Korea on the people of his country. According to  that individual's figures, North Korea had four secret plants  working to manufacture nuclear weapons using components stolen  from the USSR.    Let us go back in history a bit. In 1991 two kilograms of  red  mercury were seized in Milan. According to some sources this is  used in missile and torpedo guidance systems. A short while  later the KGB (as that agency was then called) officially  informed the world public that the red mercury did not exist.  One month ago foreign television showed foreign scientists  analyzing that very same mercury and finding it ready for use.    Somewhat later came Rutskoy's scandalous report that  bureaucrats were dealing in red mercury.    The most interesting thing is that some people (capitalists  and communists) are saying that it does not exist, while others  (communists and capitalists) are saying that it does. We will  only get to the truth in this debate when it is used...    But the problem is not mercury, the problem is that uranium,  plutonium, tellurium and other materials are being taken out of  the country.    According to KOMMERSANT's figures, the sources of those  materials are secret state-run enterprises and USSR Ministry of  Defense bases that have now become bases belonging to other  countries' ministries of defense. With the complicity of certain  military officers, nuclear components are flowing out of areas  where military units are based. As a rule, the items most  interesting from a theft standpoint are the nuclear weapons  which are slated for destruction (under an agreement between  Yeltsin and Clinton).    According to reports from KOMMERSANT informants, reactor  fuel  is the most commonly stolen item. Usually anything radioactive  is shipped out by train in the same cars that carry industrial  wastes.    In the same train or following it there travels an observer,  who is termed a "middleman" in organized crime language. From  the moment the material is loaded to the moment it crosses the  border of the former USSR this "middleman" stays with it, and if  the goods get through all right he receives 0.5 percent of the  final payment for the exported items (by way of example,  according to one source's figures one kilogram of red mercury  costs between $200,000 and $300,000 at its destination).    Whereas previously this was all done by structures close to  the KGB or similar agencies, now this kind of business is being  handled by organized crime groups that have gained access to the  trade on account of their money, connections and sales market.  And so it began...  <H5>  Stabbed </H5>   Aleksandr Svechinskiy, director of the Karaganda  Metallurgical Combine, was killed in Temirtau by a bullet in the  back of the neck. According to some sources, Svechinskiy had  opened up a channel for under-the-table shipments of iron from  Kazakhstan to accomplices in the Baltic countries.    According to the official version of the investigation, this  version does not exist. According to the unofficial version, 10  days later Kazakhstan karate champion Sergey Shmakov, who had  allegedly covered for the metal shipments to the Baltic  countries, got stabbed (coincidentally). That's the way it  goes...    Sergey Shmakov, the holder of a 3rd-degree black belt in  karate (in 1990 a student of his became champion of the USSR),  died at 3:35 am on 8 January, bleeding to death from a deep  knife wound to the abdomen. His killers have not been caught.  Unofficial sources say that in 1991 Shmakov had started  combining his professional sports activities with business. In  1991 he tried to do joint projects with the director of the  metallurgical combine, among other things by shipping the  enterprise's products to Lithuania. According to one version,  Shmakov must have been killed by outsiders, because he was  widely respected by the locals.   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-001C-52A>           Approximate Diagram of the Current Flow of Strategic and Radioactive Materials </FIG></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Work to start on office complex Work will start next month on a Pounds 58m office development in Manchester, the largest single project in the city centre for 30 years. Agreements were announced yesterday for the pre-letting of 70 per cent of the 219,000 sq ft to lawyers Addleshaw Sons &amp; Latham and accountants Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse. The complex of two office blocks and a public piazza will be next to Manchester's Pounds 42m concert hall for the Halle Orchestra. The hall, which is under construction, was largely publicly funded. It will be developed by Amec Developments and funded by PosTel Investment Management, which represents the Post Office and British Telecommunications pension funds. The project - a flagship for the government-backed Central Manchester Development Corporation - almost failed to get off the drawing board because of the recession. Amec rescued it in 1992 in partnership with Beazer and the development corporation but has since taken over as sole developer and negotiated the three pre-lets. The project will enlarge Manchester's city centre, where good office space has come under increasing pressure in the past 10 years as the financial and professional services sector has been bursting the seams of what is known locally as the 'Square Half-Mile'. Greater Manchester has had no shortage of office development, particularly around the airport and at Salford Quays and Trafford Park in the disused docklands at the end of the Manchester Ship Canal. But the new project is the most significant in the city centre since the Piccadilly Plaza complex in the 1960s. National Mutual Life Assurance has acquired 6.8 acres of land next to Birmingham International Airport and plans to start work on a 230,000 sq ft office development next year, Simon London writes. National Mutual has yet to find tenants for the Trinity Park scheme. It is building speculatively in the hope that better rents can be achieved by the time work is finished.</p>

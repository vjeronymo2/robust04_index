			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / People: Michaelson moves from MAM The revolving door at the top of Mercury Asset Management took another turn last week with the announcement that Bob Michaelson, a director of the group and chairman of its North American subsidiary Warburg Investment Management International, is joining Citibank Global Asset Management at the end of August. In the past 18 months MAM, which once had a formidable reputation for holding on to its staff, has lost star fund manager Leonard Licht, as well as two other main board directors Richard Bernays and James Dawnay. Neville Bowen, chief executive of Citibank Global Asset Management, says the attraction for Michaelson was the international nature of his operation. Based in London, Citi's new unit, created early last year, manages Dollars 68bn in assets, mostly for non-UK clients, via 26 investment teams around the world. Mercury, by contrast, is a much more domestic operation. 'He has been concerned with international markets all his life,' says Bowen. Michaelson, 46, joins in the newly created role of global chief investment officer. Bowen says he, together with a number of colleagues, had been determining overall investment policy up to now. 'I am an investment person and so that was not a problem, but what has happened is that we have been growing so rapidly, we needed new resources.' In his new job, Michaelson, who will work from London, will be managing all the investment teams, determine global asset-allocation strategies, and also be in charge of some of the largest accounts. Earlier in his career, Michaelson was a managing director of Putnam International Advisors in London; he had also worked for Putnam at its Boston headquarters from 1978-1981. Joining MAM in 1984, he spent three years in New York from 1987, returning to London in April 1990. In his current assignment he has been in charge of investments in continental Europe.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cash-rich corporates put own stock top of buy lists and some are finding more ways to return it to their shareholders. On Friday, General Electric said it would buy Dollars 5bn worth of its shares in the market over the next two years. That took to a record Dollars 65bn the value of stock buy-backs announced so far this year, topping the Dollars 62bn reached in 1989, according to Securities Data. Does this mean, as US chief executives have been saying, that shares are cheap? Or is it a signal that the US stock market is past its prime, and due for a further correction? This year's buy-backs are, first and foremost, a sign of the strength of US corporate cashflow. The last big wave of buy-backs came at the end of the 1980s, before the US recession. Now, after the faltering early years of the recovery, the US economy has surged and a bigger flow of cash into corporate coffers has been one result. Some companies have given up this cash willingly, while others have been strong-armed by shareholders into unlocking their war-chests. Chrysler was pressured by its biggest shareholder, Mr Kirk Kerkorian, into announcing a Dollars 1bn buy-back at the end of November. And the biggest programme of the year - a Dollars 6bn plan by Philip Morris announced in August - came after a management upheaval prompted by shareholder dissatisfaction. Many companies are combining buy-backs with higher dividends to distribute their surplus cash. Chrysler's 60 per cent dividend rise lifted the yield on its stock from a meagre 2 per cent or so to over 3 per cent, ahead of the market average. GE's announcement also included a 14 per cent dividend increase, the latest in a long string of higher cash pay-outs by the industrial giant. In spite of announcements such as these, the overall dividend yield on the broad-based S&amp;P index of US companies remains below 3 per cent. 'Dividends are generally below traditional levels,' says Mr Byron Wien, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. There is still room for some big dividend increases as 'some companies continue to catch up', he says. To the companies buying in their shares, the rational is simple: they are cheap. 'GE stock today makes the best investment we can make,' Mr Jack Welch, GE chief executive, said on Friday. This is in part just another version of the standard rhetoric of company bosses: that the stock market does not value their shares highly enough. But it also indicates that companies such as GE have reviewed all the ways of using their cash - through higher capital investment or buying other companies, for instance - and decided that none offers a better alternative. That suggests a cautious view of future growth following the series of US interest rate rises this year. One result could be a further slowdown in the takeover market, which has been cooling since a surge of activity over the spring and summer. GE itself had planned to use more than Dollars 2bn of cash to buy Kemper, a financial services group, this year - but it has shown no sign of returning to the fray now that a rival bid for Kemper has collapsed (although GE says it could easily suspend its buy-back programme to make acquisitions). Many of the buy-backs are direct responses to slowing earnings growth. The banking sector remains the clearest example. Replete with capital and facing modest revenue growth at best, many banks have embarked on share repurchases to maintain double-digit growth in earnings a share - reducing the number of shares outstanding is the most direct route available to a company to do this. Are companies simply looking for ways to support their share prices as the surge in profits passes? Most US analysts predict that the earnings cycle is not over yet, and that 1995 profits will mark a further steady rise from this year. But after the round of interest rate increases and the chance of another, perhaps as early as tomorrow, the prospects for 1996 are getting hazy. That weakens one of the underpinnings for share prices at their current levels - whatever companies do to buy in their own stock.</p>

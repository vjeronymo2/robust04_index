			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Sales of trucks and vans falter: Leyland Daf leaders January market figures - Iveco concedes second place THE RECOVERY in commercial vehicle sales that began last autumn appears to be running out of steam. On a year-on-year basis, total sales were up only 4.4 per cent in January. That compares with increases of nearly 8 per cent in December and 15.25 per cent in November. The figures reflect 'the continuing serious state of the commercial vehicle industry which has been all-too-tragically demonstrated by events of the past few days', according to Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, in a reference to the collapse of UK truck market leader Leyland Daf. The society's statistics show that sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes were only 0.77 per cent higher last month than in the previous January, while sales of heavy trucks over 15 tonnes were 5.43 per cent lower. The irony of Leyland Daf's position - in receivership while being UK market leader - was emphasised by its own 28.23 per cent sales rise in January compared with a year ago, giving it a market share of 25.39 per cent. The receivers warned yesterday they could shut the company if workers at Leyland, Lancashire, strike today. Its rivals are preparing to capture any vacated sales territory. The Iveco group, which has been Leyland Daf's main rival, has taken out full-page national newspaper advertisements stressing its Pounds 2.5bn European investment programmes. The campaign is clearly intended as a public statement of opposition to any government bail-out of Leyland Daf. However, the group's move comes as it is being demoted from second place in the market by Mercedes Benz. The German truckmaker achieved record UK sales in January, capturing 21.47 per cent of the market. The total number of sales in January of 17,418 compared with 16,677 in the same month a year ago. Imports rose sharply to take 38.97 per cent of the market compared with 36.82 per cent in the same month last year. This increase was almost wholly accounted for by Vauxhall importing nearly 1,500 Astramax vans, production of which moved to Portugal last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Volume    Volume   Share (%)  Share (%)                                 (Units) Change (%)  Jan 93     Jan 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                   17,418     +4.44    100.00     100.00 Imports                          6,788    +10.54     38.97      36.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                            6,961    +24.15    100.00     100.00 Imports                          2,399   +108.07     34.46      20.56 Ford                             3,237    +57.90     46.50      36.56 Vauxhall (GM)                    2,582    +25.77     37.09      36.61 Rover (British Aerospace)          314    -36.57      4.51       8.83 Peugeot (incl.

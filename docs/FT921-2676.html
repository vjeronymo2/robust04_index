			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Manley, epitome of developing world's dilemma: 30 years of a third world socialist faced with diminishing wealth to redistribute A WEEK before he was returned to office in a general election in 1989, Mr Michael Manley found himself facing a barrage of questions from incredulous journalists about his reported change in political thinking. After several attempts to explain his transition from socialism to an advocate of the free market, Mr Manley looked at one of his interrogators and asked: 'Is your outlook on everything the same as it was 10 years ago?' Mr Manley, who announced at the weekend that he was resigning as Jamaica's prime minister at the end of the month at the age of 67 because of poor health, epitomised the change which has overtaken the politics of the developing world in the past three decades. Between 1972 and 1980, in his first two terms as prime minister of the island of 2.5m people, Mr Manley put a leftward slant on the Fabian socialist principles in which he had been schooled by his father, Mr Norman Manley, founder of the People's National Party and one of Jamaica's national heroes. His administration then trumpeted the cause of Third World control over its patrimony, advocated state control of the pillars of the economy, supported changes in the patterns of international trade to encourage south-south links and sought to restructure Jamaican society by redistributing elusive wealth to close the yawning gap between the rich and the poor. He antagonised even the more liberal elements in the corridors of influence in Washington by developing close economic and political links with Cuba, Jamaica's closest neighbour. Yet although his detractors, including many in Jamaica, regarded him as something of a closet communist, Mr Manley's place on the ideological spectrum was closer to that of Tanzania's Julius Nyerere and Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda, than it was to Fidel Castro. noscenti in Jamaica, Mr Manley's political outlook puts him somewhere to the right of Mr Neil Kinnock and the left of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. The transition came after Jamaican electors overwhelmingly rejected Mr Manley's socialism in 1980 in favour of more conservative policies of the Jamaica Labour Party led by Mr Edward Seaga. Mr Manley said that between then and 1989, when he was returned to office with a handsome majority, he reflected on the need for a new strategy to deal with Jamaica's problems. Mr Manley's retirement has set off a contest for the leadership of the PNP and for the prime ministership. Mr P J Patterson, the party's chairman, and a former deputy prime minister and finance minister, and Miss Portia Simpson, labour and welfare minister, have thrown their hats into the ring. The PNP, which recent polls showed with roughly equal support to the opposition Jamaican Labour Party, will meet on March 28 to choose a successor. Miss Simpson, a relatively inexperienced politician with strong popularity ratings, has pledged her 'absolute commitment' to continuing Mr Manley's free market-oriented policies. Her relative inexperience has been seized upon by backers of Mr Patterson, who announced his candidacy yesterday. In January, Mr Patterson was replaced as deputy prime minister amid allegations he approved a waiver of Dollars 1.47m of duties on unleaded gasoline for Shell. The head of Shell in Jamaica, Mr Howard Hamilton, is a member of the party's governing board. The winner of the leadership contest will have more than a little difficulty successfully continuing the economic process Mr Manley started. Having put the PNP's hard left faction to the sword, Mr Manley did an ideological volte-face, concluding that the private sector, not the state, should be 'the engine of growth' and that the government should play less of a role in the economy. Since his return to office three years ago, this has been reflected in a programme to deregulate the island's economy and divesting state enterprises to local and foreign investors. 'Getting the party in the 1980s to accept that this new path was the one which should be pursued was a major task,' Mr Manley said at the weekend. 'It is getting this policy accepted which I regard as being among my most significant achievements during my 40 years in politics.' In an earlier interview he had said: 'We all learn new things and we all change because we want to and because circumstances with which we deal have changed. 'All over the Third World people have had to learn. The experience of political independence, when one was full of optimism, is followed not by a change of ideals, but by a period of learning what can be accomplished and what cannot be.' Mr Manley graduated from the London School of Economics after serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force in the Second World War. He later worked as a journalist with the BBC between 1949 and 1952, when he returned to Jamaica to became an organiser of the National Workers Union, affiliated to the PNP led by his father. He entered politics in 1967 when he became a member of parliament, and has been an MP since, except for five years in the 1980s when the PNP boycotted a general election over a row about the state of the voters' register. As he disengages, Mr Manley may conclude that those who follow him will have an easier time. 'Politicians cannot run countries,' he once said. 'They only set directions.' He did try to run Jamaica in the 1970s. His memoirs are likely to suggest that he tried too hard.</p>

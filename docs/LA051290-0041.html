			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHERS SHOULD LEARN FROM LESLIE'S LESSON  </P> <P> Lisa Leslie of Morningside High has every right to feel frustrated over her  poor showing on the SAT.  </P> <P> She has been misled and cheated. Her 3.5 grade-point average just does not jibe  with her 750 SAT score. She had every reason to believe that she was getting a  good education when she obviously wasn't.  </P> <P> My fear is that there are far too many others like Lisa in the inner city who  are being shortchanged without even having a clue. To Lisa's teachers: Shame!  To Lisa: Use your scholarship as a key and work like the devil to catch up and  excel.  </P> <P> HUGH COBB, Simi Valley  </P></p>

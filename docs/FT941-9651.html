			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Procedural war set to escalate A row over the workings of a Commons committee is threatening to trigger a damaging escalation of Labour's procedural war against the government. Sir Terence Higgins, a senior Conservative backbencher, is trying to defuse the argument, which has arisen over the Labour leadership's refusal to allow its MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee to go on a planned trip to South Africa. Matters may come to a head on Wednesday when Tory MPs who form a majority on the committee are threatening to force a vote of no confidence in Mr Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman. Such a move would be expected to provoke Labour to retaliate. Sir Terence, a former Treasury minister, has been handed his troubleshooting role by virtue of his chairmanship of the liaison committee, the body which co-ordinates the work of the select committees. Sir Terence said last week that the liaison committee was strongly of the view that it would be wrong for any dispute between the political parties to interfere with the work of the select committee system. Mr Keith Hampson, a Conservative member of the trade and industry committee, said Mr Caborn could have been removed last week but it had been decided to give Labour time 'for common sense to prevail'. He added that the move was not a personal attack on Mr Caborn. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, moved on Friday to scotch fears that Labour's retaliation might take the form of removing its MPs from all Commons committees. He said Labour would not take such a step because these bodies were 'part of the work of parliament'. Labour broke off all relations with the government in December in protest at plans to curtail debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance contributions. Under its protest even non-contentious legislation is being obstructed and the practice of 'pairing' - whereby MPs can miss a vote by being linked to a member in an opposing party who agrees to be absent as well  - has ended.</p>

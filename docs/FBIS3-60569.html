And more patients are arriving  continuously at an emergency field hospital in the area, while  others are being transferred to hospitals in the  Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging region and Garankuwa.    So far one death has been confirmed, that of Marinda Zulu,  23, who died in the Delmas Hospital on Tuesday morning. She  first felt the symptoms three days ago but went to the field  hospital only on Monday. She was transferred to Delmas Hospital  on Monday afternoon and died early on Tuesday. Another woman  and a primary school pupil had also died, but it had not been  confirmed they died of typhoid.    Brig Louis du Preez, the officer commanding the field  hospital on Tuesday said: ``I don't see it subsiding for at  least the next week since the disease has an incubation period  of seven to 14 days.''    The Delmas Town Council set up the emergency hospital at the  local airport by Saturday morning to deal with the influx of  people from Botleng township who could not be accommodated in  nearby hospitals. At least 50 SA [South African] Defence Force  medical corps personnel are working around the clock treating  patients at the field hospital. One of the doctors contracted  the disease and was evacuated to one military hospital in  Voortrekkerhoogte, Pretoria, on Monday morning.    Brig du Preez confirmed there were more than 1,000 cases of  suspected typhoid, including those that had been sent to other  hospitals. Nearly 150 people were admitted to the field  hospital on Monday, although more than 40 were discharged by the  end of the day and a further 50 on Tuesday morning, with tablets  for them to continue treatment.    Brig du Preez said 21 cases of typhoid had been confirmed so  far, but added that since test results took 72 hours to be  determined, the figure was certain to rise dramatically.  Ambulances would continue transporting people from Botleng to  the nearby hospital. Loudspeakers were being used to urge all  those with diarrhea to report to the hospital, Brig du Preez  said.    According to Acting Town Clerk Henre de Hart, older people  and children were more susceptible to the highly contagious  disease, which is spread through body fluids and contaminated  food.    Delmas Management Committee Chairman David Swanepoel said  water had been tested weekly in the past, but was now being  analysed daily.    Most cases had come from the Mandela View squatter camp on  the outskirts of Botleng, although the syringe needles stuck in  a map to indicate the origin of each case, clearly showed the  disease had struck the entire township.    Mr de Hart said the causes were unhealthy living conditions,  which were being addressed by a R[rand]6.9 million grant for the  development of 2,700 new stands.</p>

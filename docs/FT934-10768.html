			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Paris and Bonn to be Emu symbol FRANCE and Germany will be able to demonstrate to their EC partners later this month 'the credible convergence of Europe's two largest economies' by the mid to late 1990s, Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, claimed yesterday. Speaking a day after he and his German counterpart, Mr Theo Waigel, jointly unveiled the thrust - though not yet the detail - of their medium-term convergence plans, Mr Alphandery defended his government's estimate that the French economy would recover to grow by an average 3.2 per cent in 1995-1997. He said this estimate was tenable in view of France's growth record in past decades, and of the fact that France would be bouncing back from its 1992-1993 recession. Mr Alphandery described the French and German governments' joint preparation of their convergence plans as 'symbolic' in the context of the Maastricht treaty's requirement that EC economies should converge on spending and inflation criteria to qualify for monetary union. EC ministers are to discuss their countries' medium-term plans on November 22, paving the way for the EC summit in December to set general guidelines for economic convergence, as laid down in the Maastricht pact. Convergence discussions with Germany, which started right after the monetary upheaval of early August, 'have led us to adapt our own medium-term projections,' Mr Alphandery said. The French government had been working on the minimum assumption that France's economy would grow by 2.8 per cent annually in 1995-1997, which would at least bring its budget deficit under 3 per cent of gross domestic product, as required by Maastricht. But emboldened by official German insistence that Germany, which is France's biggest trading partner, would have average growth of 3 per cent throughout that period, the French government has now put possible post-1995 growth in its own economy at up to 3.5 per cent. In the much shorter term, Mr Alphandery scaled down his estimate of this year's contraction in the French economy from 0.8 to 0.7 per cent, in line with the forecast of Insee, the official statistics agency.</p>

			<p>921112 FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Astra profits surge by 32% at nine months ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals group, lifted pre-tax profits by 32 per cent to SKr3.42bn (Dollars 570m) in the first nine months of 1992, as sales of its anti-peptic ulcer drug, Losec, continued to soar. The result compares with profits of SKr2.58bn in the first nine months of last year and is ahead of the SKr3.41bn profit achieved in the whole of 1991. Sales in the latest period climbed 26 per cent to SKr11.21bn from SKr8.92bn. Astra's Losec sales rose 41 per cent to SKr3.06bn, but total sales, after including sales through licensees, climbed to SKr5.00bn from Skr3.40bn. Sales of the anti-inflammatory asthma agent, Pulmicort, climbed 59 per cent to SKr1.38bn from SKr847m, making it Astra's second-largest selling product after Losec. The group stands by its earlier forecast that group sales this year will be 20-25 per cent above last year's SKr12.5bn. Lex, Page 22</p>

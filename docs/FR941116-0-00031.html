			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the FAA notes that one operator and a manufacturer, Pneudraulics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already have provided these data to the FAA, and the final rule has been revised to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain Pneudraulics valves to the category of valves subject to a 1,000-flight hour leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check interval. (Without the submission and approval of this data, these valves would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been required to be leak checked at the 200-flight hour interval.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Differences Between Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter maintains that the FAA's safety objective in addressing the ``blue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ice'' issue should be to ensure that each and every operator has a comprehensive lavatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drain service program in place. The commenter points out that the FAA attempted this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach under the provisions of proposed paragraph (b), but made the conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance more stringent than those of proposed paragraph (a), such that no operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would elect to comply with paragraph (b). The commenter considers this unfortunate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since it will result in a less effective ``blue ice'' prevention program fleetwide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA acknowledges that a difference exists between the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (a) and (b), both in the supplemental NPRM and in this final rule. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as explained elsewhere in this preamble, the FAA has revised several requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b) of the final rule to make it more ``attractive'' to operators. Certain of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised requirements include extended leak check intervals for some valves. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does consider that revising the maintenance program to include the procedures specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (b) will be more effective overall in addressing ``blue ice'' as an on-going  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. The provisions of paragraph (b) are more comprehensive in approach: they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include requirements not only for leak checks of the valves, but replacement of valve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seals, repetitive visual inspections for leakage, procedures for reporting leakage, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training programs to inform pertinent personnel on ``blue ice'' awareness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA considers that it is appropriate to maintain the provisions of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) as an option, so that operators without an FAA-approved maintenance program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have some means to comply with the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along this same line, another commenter points out other differences between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b). The commenter indicates that any valve service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history data that is gathered by an operator complying with paragraph (a) may not be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valuable as data gathered by an operator complying with paragraph (b). Unless there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific, scheduled maintenance program, there is no way to determine if a valve may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have begun leaking before a leak check was conducted and was subsequently repaired;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, merely passing a leak check successfully, as under the provisions of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a), does not verify the valve's reliability. The FAA acknowledges this commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observations. However, the FAA expects that some operators will choose to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions of paragraph (b) and will provide the FAA with valve service history data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These data may indicate that the current leak check intervals are acceptable for operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating under a maintenance program, but should be shortened for operators without a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance program. If, as the commenter suggests, leak tests alone prove to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate to prevent ``blue ice'' formation, the FAA may consider revising this rule at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later time to modify or delete paragraph (a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters request that a revision be made to proposed paragraph (b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would allow for the use of an alternative method of recordkeeping to that otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by Federal Aviation Regulations &sect;121.380 (14 CFR 121.380),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Maintenance recording requirements''. The commenters' main concern is that it should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be clear to the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspectors (PMI), and other FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials in the years ahead, that once the maintenance program revision is made and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, the AD is ``signed off as complete.'' No other special records should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to track the various tasks specified in proposed paragraph (b) (such as valve seal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement, training, reporting procedures, visual checks, etc.), which are in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recordkeeping requirements that now exist within each of the affected operator's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request for many of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons it did not concur with a similar request made in response to the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemental NPRM. The FAA considers that, even though this AD would affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance program, it is of such importance that it warrants other than ``normal''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to be followed in certain aspects. Some method of recordkeeping must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained to ensure that the required valve seal changes and periodic leak checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue, and to ensure that the procedures required by this AD are not eventually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dropped from any operator's maintenance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and reports carried by Seoul vernacular dailies on 22  April on the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry regarding North Korea's possible possession of enough  plutonium to produce four or five nuclear weapons.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 200-word  report entitled "North Korea Will Possess Enough Plutonium To  Produce Four or Five Nuclear Weapons." The report begins: "U.S.  Secretary of Defense William Perry said on 21 April that there  is political tension, but no military tension, on the Korean  peninsula. The United States does not want a war to be waged on  the Korean peninsula, nor provoke a war, nor invite it."    Referring to the remarks by U.S. Government officials in the  past that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to produce  one or two nuclear weapons, the report writes: "U.S. Secretary  of Defense Perry said that North Korea will have enough extra  plutonium within weeks to produce four or five nuclear weapons."    CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled  "The Remarks by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry."  Referring to his remarks that there is no danger of a war on  the Korean peninsula, the editorial expresses relief, because  Perry's remarks must have been made based on good information.    The editorial continues: "It is important to make people  trust in the government's readiness in dealing with North  Korea," referring to the people's attachment of more importance  to the government's action and steps. The editorial adds that  "it is important for the government to always prepare for the  danger of war."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 300-word report  entitled "There Is No Immediate Danger of War on the Korean  Peninsula." Referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry's remarks that media reports on tension on the Korean  peninsula is exaggerated, the report writes: "He said that  North Korea would change fuel bars in its 5-megawatt reactor  within weeks and this fuel would provide sufficient plutonium to  make four or five nuclear bombs."    HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled  "The Changing Situation Regarding the North Korean Nuclear  Issue." Referring to the meeting between ROK National Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae and U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry on the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial writes:  "It is very significant that the ROK and United States have  agreed to strengthen their joint combatant capabilities to  prepare for a surprise attack by North Korea."    The editorial continues: "The ROK and U.S. Governments have  set the timing of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise at  around November, which is an expression of their firm will to  cooperate on dealing with North Korea." Noting remarks by U.S.  Government officials that North Korea possesses enough plutonium  to produce nuclear weapons, the editorial writes: "These  remarks attract the people's attention because they negate the  remarks made by President Kim Il-song that North Korea will not  produce nuclear weapons, nor feel the need to produce them."    Referring to North Korea's reaction to the International  Atomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, request for additional inspections  of its nuclear facilities, the editorial writes: "It is not  hard to access the background of North Korea's change of  attitude. The reason North Korea has changed its attitude is  the fact that there is only a few days remaining until the IAEA  deadline for additional inspections, as set forth in the  presidential statement by the UN Security Council."    The editorial continues: "The change in North Korea's  attitude is to gain much more support from the United States  during the third round of U.S.-DPRK high-level talks," and urges  the government to be more prudent in dealing with North Korea in  close cooperation with the United States. The editorial  concludes: "It is important for the government to ask the  United States to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks  after North Korea accepts overall inspections [chonmyon sachal]  of its nuclear facilities, as well as special inspections of its  two nuclear waste material storage facilities [haekpyogimul  chojangso]."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "ROK, U.S. Reaction to North Korean Nuclear  Issue." The editorial writes the decisions made by ROK and U.S.  defense ministers are very significant because it will prevent  any difference between ROK and U.S. opinions regarding the North  Korean nuclear issue and strengthens military alliance between  the two countries.    The editorial continues that the decision to modernize the  combined forces is more significant because "reaffirming the  need for improvement of combat capacity, which is discussed in  every annual Security Consultative Meeting, reflects the  importance at this point."    The editorial stresses that in the meantime, the ROK and the  United States should not rule out peaceful and diplomatic  efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "If North Korea Has Nuclear Bombs."  Referring to the "shocking" remarks of U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry that North Korea will be able to make four to five nuclear  bombs within weeks, the editorial writes it serves as a warning  to the ROK Government's relaxed judgment underestimating North  Korea's nuclear capability.    Denouncing the government's inconsistent policy on North  Korean affairs, the editorial urges "immediate" and "major"  changes of the security policy, the establishment of an  independent intelligence system, and a review of the hasty  denuclearization decision giving up nuclear reprocessing  facilities.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,100-word  article  by reporter Yi Sang-ki entitled "Did He Sell Weapons or Not?"  The article reports that although Secretary Perry denied he had  tried to sell U.S. weapons, "there is a high possibility that  the subject was discussed by the working-level officials of  Secretary Perry's entourage by noting that the purchase of arms  systems, including the global positioning system, was included  on the agenda."    The article also analyzes that ROK Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae hinted at additional arms purchases by saying that  priority will be given to counter-battery capability,  night-fighting capability, and the enhancement of  inter-operability to improve the combined forces.    The article reports that some officials of the ROK Defense  Ministry expect more pressure to buy U.S. weapons and that the  Defense Ministry is establishing its own new purchasing  strategies irrespective of U.S. pressure.</p>

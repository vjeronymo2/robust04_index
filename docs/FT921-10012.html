			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (The Bottom Line): Docklands EZT dwarfs the competition JUST as the 800 ft Canary Wharf tower now dominates the London skyline, so events in the Docklands Enterprise Zone towered above the tax shelter market last week. The Enterprise Zone Trust announced for Docklands on Thursday dwarfs all previous EZTs. The Cabot Square Trust aims to raise Pounds 215m for 10 Cabot Square, a building on the Canary Wharf development. The previous largest EZT raised Pounds 80m. Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property company responsible for the Canary Wharf tower, is the developer. IPS organised the deal, and Property Enterprise Managers will manage the trust. EZTs offer arguably the strongest shelter from tax now available in the UK. Money invested in EZ property qualifies for top-rate tax relief, so 40 per cent taxpayers effectively only part with 60 per cent of the value of their investment. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is no upper limit. Tax treatment is this favourable because property investment in EZs - run-down areas which the government thinks worthy of support - is speculative. Tax relief comes to little if the investment is not safe. But the sponsors have gone out of their way to make sure the Cabot Square Trust does not run into difficulties. Investors have a 'put' option after ten years. If a majority of the trustholders vote to exercise it, O&amp;Y will have to buy back the property for the price paid by the trust this year - Pounds 215m. For all its well-publicised problems, it is likely to be able to pay this. The real coup is that O&amp;Y's ability to pay has been guaranteed by Morgan Guaranty, a triple-A rated US bank. This makes this part of the deal as secure as can reasonably be expected of any investment. Top-rate taxpayers effectively have a certain capital gain of 67 per cent over ten years. It is also a great deal for Olympia and York - even if investors exercise their 'put', O&amp;Y has negotiated a ten-year interest-free mortgage. And even Morgan cannot guarantee a rate of inflation. Over the ten years to the end of 1991, the cost of living index rose by 73.5 per cent. Average inflation over the last five years has been 6.4 per cent. Exercise O&amp;Y's 'put' option in March 2002, and you receive an equivalent annual compound interest of 5.25 per cent. Many economists argue that inflation will be lower than this during the 1990s, but 5.25 per cent is not that exciting. In return for a limit on potential 'downside', investors must accept a series of 'call' options for O&amp;Y which limit the 'upside'. After 12 years, O&amp;Y can buy back the building from the trust for Pounds 230m - a 78 per cent increase over 12 years. At the end of 2006 (after 15 years) it would pay Pounds 264.5m (105 per cent). This rises to Pounds 322m (150 per cent) after 20 years, and Pounds 382.3m (196 per cent) after 25. O&amp;Y's purchase price rises by Pounds 11.5m each year. This steadily diminishes the equivalent compounded annual return received by investors. In the unlikely event that O&amp;Y leaves it this long the effective annual interest rate after 25 years would be less than 5 per cent. However, none of this accounts for income from the rental yield, which would start at 7.325 per cent. This is revisable upwards after five years, although some analysts, such as Stephen Bantoft of the Allenbridge Group, are bearish about the chances of this happening. The yield is just high enough to allow a self-financing investment. Tax relief is allowed on loans taken out to finance EZ investment, if they are serviced using rental income. Fixed rate finance is available from the Bank of Scotland to help this. Investors might foresake their income, but would make no effective outlay. In return, they would receive tax relief at the beginning of the investment, and, following the sale of the building, effectively receive the value of their tax relief again. This aspect of the deal, which Cabot Square shares with other EZTs, could be attractive. But the Bank of Scotland's requirements will be strict. This is a low risk instrument of potential use in tax-planning. Investors wanting more chance of an 'upside' should balance their portfolio with other tax-efficient investments, including EZTs and BES companies. They should also seek professional advice.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Australian strikes begin The wave of industrial action threatened by some large union wage claims in Australia got under way yesterday. About 1,500 members of the Transport Workers' Union, which is pursuing a 15 per cent wage claim to be spread over two years, decided to strike over the weekend. Their action is targeted at supermarkets, and is expected to leave many stores without food or milk deliveries. This could be followed by a 24-hour strike by aircraft refuellers and oil tanker drivers on Monday. The federal Industrial Relations Commission ruled yesterday that the TWU was seeking to avoid enterprise bargaining by lodging a sector-wide pay claim, and withdrew the union's right to strike on Monday without risking heavy fines. Despite this, there were indications that workers still plan to go ahead with the action. If the action does take place, it is expected severely to disrupt domestic and international airline services.</p>

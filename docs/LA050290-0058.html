			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMERGENCY AGENCY CALLED SLOW TO ACT  </P> <P> Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) Tuesday criticized the performance of  the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Loma Prieta earthquake last  fall, citing excessive bureaucracy that resulted in a "circle of frustration"  for victims.  </P> <P> "In many instances I felt that I had to exert great pressure on these officials  to have them provide services that should have been provided without my  intervention," Panetta told a House Public Works and Transportation  subcommittee that is investigating FEMA's ability to cope with major disasters.  </P> <P> FEMA officials said that the agency's top official for disaster response, Grant  Peterson, is scheduled to testify before the subcommittee today. He would not  discuss the criticism of the agency before his appearance, they said.  </P></p>

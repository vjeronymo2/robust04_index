Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WOMEN AT HEAD OF IDITAROD PACK  </P> <P> Two women led the male-dominated field today one-third of the way through the  marathon Iditarod Sled Dog Race, but the men were nipping at their heels.  </P> <P> Dee Dee Jonrowe held a slight edge over three-time champ Susan Butcher when the  two women pulled into Nikolai before dawn today.  </P> <P> Nikolai is 367 miles from the Anchorage starting line, where 70 teams set out  Saturday across the Alaska wilderness in the 1,161-mile race to Nome.  </P> <P> Once in Nikolai, teams have passed the worst threat from moose and buffalo and  have come into the first in a series of Alaska native villages.  </P> <P> Jonrowe reached Nikolai at 4:52 a.m. Alaska time followed by Butcher at 5:22  a.m.  </P> <P> Running an hour behind them was Rick Swenson, the race's only four-time winner,  followed by two other top Alaska mushers Lavon Barve and Jerry Austin.  </P></p>

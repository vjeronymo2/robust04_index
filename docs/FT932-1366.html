			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Coastal 'no-go' zones rejected LORD DONALDSON, chair-man of the government's inquiry into marine pollution, will not recommend banning oil tankers and ships carrying hazardous cargo from Britain's most environmentally-sensitive coastal waters when he reports later this year. The former Master of the Rolls signalled his views when he faced calls from environmental organisations for stricter ship routing and the designation of a large number of shipping exclusion zones to protect the coast. English Nature, the statutory body which advises Whitehall on wildlife protection, has identified 28 candidates for 'no-go' areas. Lord Donaldson said the idea of banning ships from long stretches of the UK coast was 'desirable but not possible' after hearing evidence that most of the British coast was vulnerable. He conceded that the international community might agree to the wholesale designation of exclusion zones in the future - but not for 30 years. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds told the inquiry shipping lanes should keep tankers 20 km offshore from the Scottish and Northumberland North Sea coasts.</p>

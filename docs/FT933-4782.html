			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Asset sale helps lift Carrefour to FFr1.6bn CARREFOUR, the leading player in French food retailing, yesterday announced a steep increase in interim net profits, to FFr1.66bn (Dollars 291m) this year from FFr277m in the first half of 1992. A capital gain of FFr1.36bn on the sale of its stake in the Castorama furniture chain helped the result. Despite the sluggish state of the retail sector, Carrefour managed to increase pre-tax profits before exceptional items from FFr281m to FFr565m. Its poor performance last autumn, when Carrefour disclosed a sharp fall in interim profits, triggered the resignation of Mr Michel Bon as chairman. Mr Daniel Bernard, the new chairman, said Carrefour was on course for further profits growth in the second half. He predicted that consumer spending in France would remain static, but said he hoped to boost profits through improvements in productivity. He forecast an increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items of 20 per cent for 1993. He also anticipated sales growth of 5 per cent. Carrefour, like other French retailers, has been affected by the economic recession and by increased competition from German discounters, notably Aldi. However, it increased turnover from FFr55.2bn in the first six months of 1992 to FFr57.64bn in the interim period this year. The group in March made a FFr1.36bn profit on the FFr1.8bn placing of its 28.8 per cent stake in Castorama, one of France's largest DIY chains. The proceeds have been used to reduce debt. The windfall from the Castorama deal was tempered by a provision for the closure of two hypermarkets in Philadelphia. Mr Bernard said Carrefour was still committed to maintaining a strong presence in the US. It is the largest shareholder in Costco Wholesale, now in the process of merging with Price Co to form a Dollars 16bn group with 200 stores.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSH HASHANAH  </P> <P> Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, will begin this year on Wednesday evening,  launching Judaism's reflective Holy High Days, which culminate with Yom Kippur  on Sept. 29.  </P> <P> TRADITION: The Jewish New Year is a solemn time in which each person's fate is  said to be subject to review and judgment in the divine "Book of Life," thus a  greeting in Hebrew that translates, "May you be inscribed for a good year."  </P> <P> Central to services is the blowing of the shofar, or ram's horn, calling the  assembled to repentance.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: Selichot, or prayers for forgiveness, are part of the whole cycle  of High Holy Day services and is the name of a pre-Rosh Hashanah service which  will be held tonight at many synagogues. Rosh Hashanah services will be  conducted in synagogues Wednesday night and Thursday, then on the second day in  Orthodox, Conservative and some Reform synagogues. Some congregations observe  tashlich, the custom of throwing crumbs into a stream or lake, symbolically  casting one's sins into running water.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIAN COMMUNISTS ARE EXPECTED TO WIN  </P> <P> Communists, with support from Bulgarians who favor a slower pace toward reform,  are expected to clinch a strong parliamentary victory in runoff elections held  Sunday.  </P> <P> State television reported some voting irregularities, including illegal  canvassing near polling stations. But the voting generally appeared to go  smoothly.  </P> <P> The 400-seat Parliament, the first freely elected legislature in Bulgaria in 58  years, will have a substantial number of opposition lawmakers, and their  presence will mark the end of rubber-stamp approval for policies of the former  rulers.  </P> <P> The Communists -- who now call themselves Socialists -- were the winners in the  first round of voting on June 10, garnering 172 seats. They needed to win only  29 of the 81 seats being decided in the runoffs to gain an absolute majority.  </P> <P> Communist leader Alexander Lilov was a first-round winner, but Prime Minister  Andrei Lukanov faced a runoff.  </P> <P> The main opposition alliance, the United Democratic Forces, won 107 seats in  the first round, and other opposition groups won 40. The alliance and the  Agrarian Party, a once docile ally of the Communists, have both vowed not to  join a coalition with the new Communists.  </P> <P> However, Communist and United Democratic Forces officials have said they might  form a government of specialists chosen on the basis of their expertise rather  than their political affiliation.  </P> <P> Polls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Dimiter Popov, secretary of the Central Electoral Commission, said the  commission expects to announce the results Tuesday, the state news agency BTA  reported.  </P> <P> State television said 75% of the eligible voters had cast ballots shortly  before the polls closed. In the first first round, 91% voted.  </P> <P> First-round results show that in 22 of the 81 constituencies where balloting  was repeated Sunday, Communist candidates had a substantial lead over their  rivals, and in 33 others they had a slight edge.  </P></p>

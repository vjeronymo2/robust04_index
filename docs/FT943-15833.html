			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Observer: Babbling Brooke A further leak concerning Prime Minister John Major's cabinet reshuffle? Peter Brooke - national heritage secretary - yesterday addressed the House of Commons on the future of the BBC. Opposition wags asked him why he hadn't made the statement three years ago. Brooke pointed out he was not then in government. Up piped Labour's shadow minister for vitriol, Dennis Skinner: 'And you won't be soon.' Brooke merely added: 'Ministers are here today, gone tomorrow.' But the acid lives on forever.</p>

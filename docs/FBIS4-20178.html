			<p>BFN     [Text] Central Bank Governor Avxendis Avxendiou  categorically rejected a report in a French magazine that Cyprus  is a transfer point of dirty money. Avxendiou stressed that the  banking system in Cyprus is clean. Correspondent Petros  Konstandinou has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Konstandinou] Cyprus' banking system has  become a target in the foreign press. A report in the French  magazine L'EXPRESS represents Cyprus as a transfer point for  dirty money. Central Bank Governor Avxendiou categorically  rejected the report and added that it is not the first time that  something like this has happened.    [Avxendiou] I cannot rule out that there are isolated cases,  but I reject the possibility and the claim that Cyprus is a  point of systematic laundering of dirty money.    [Konstandinou] Have there even been isolated cases of which  you are aware?    [Avxendiou] No, not even one case has come to our attention  because if we become aware of something like this, you realize  that the measures that we would take would be really drastic.    [Konstandinou] In order to safeguard the banking system,  Avxendiou said, there is continuous and systematic control of  both Cypriot and foreign banks. All officials of all banks, he  said, have been given strict instructions to be very careful in  their dealings. The banks have also been instructed not to open  an account for anyone unless they first prove their identity.  [end recording]</p>

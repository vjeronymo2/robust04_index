			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Milosevic attacked on ethnic cleansing WESTERN embassies in Belgrade yesterday accused Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of failing to condemn ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and that warned UN sanctions will not be lifted until the violence in Bosnia stops. A statement sent jointly by the EC, the US, and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), accused Mr Milosevic of not using his influence to press Bosnian Serb forces into stopping ethnic cleansing or atrocities in Bosnia. It criticised Mr Milosevic for failing to publicly diassociate himself from ethnic cleansing. 'The governments are appalled at the continuing evidence of human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it added. The letter named Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, as the 'principal offenders'. It warned Mr Milosevic to heed the UN Security Council resolution on war crimes of October 6.</p>

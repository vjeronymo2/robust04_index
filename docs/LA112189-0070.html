			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Are the pronouncements of the Roman Catholic bishops truly pro-life and are the  bishops "the only moral conscience in our country," as Los Angeles Archbishop  Roger Mahony has stated? I think not.  </P> <P> The Catholic bishops are caught in as much moral ambiguity as other religious  leaders. In fact one can argue that the results of their teachings put them in  the position of being pro-abortion and anti-choice. Abortion cannot be dealt  with in a vacuum but must be seen in the wider context of family planning,  contraceptives, the rights of both the woman and the fetus, and even the moral  issues of poverty and world population. When one looks beyond the highly  charged words of Catholic bishops on abortion and sees the increased need for  abortions caused by their flawed teachings on human sexuality one can only  conclude that they are pro-abortion and anti-choice.  </P> <P> I served as a bishop of the Lutheran Church in America for most of the past  decade. During this decade the Christian denominations made great strides in  their ecumenical relations. It saddens me that the Catholic bishops are willing  to sacrifice this progress in the name of a claimed superiority of moral  position on the subject of abortion.  </P> <P> I am less than satisfied with my own anti-abortion and pro-choice position but  will live with the moral ambiguity of my position in preference to theirs.  </P> <P> STANLEY E. OLSON  </P> <P> Pastor, Grace Lutheran Church  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

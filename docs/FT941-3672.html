			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Persimmon calls for Pounds 49.2m - Latest to join growing list of share issues from UK housebuilders Persimmon yesterday joined the growing list of UK housebuilders to announce share issues to finance land purchases and take advantage of the housing market recovery. The company is raising Pounds 49.2m in an underwritten right issue by offering shareholders shares at 282p apiece on a 2-for-11 basis. Persimmon also announced a 96 per cent jump in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.6m. Earnings per share doubled from 6.8p to 13.7p. The dividend for the year is raised from 8.6p to 9.2p, with a 6.2p final. The group's share price slipped from 337p to 333p following the rights issue announcement. Housebuilders by this spring will have raised substantially more than Pounds 1bn from rights issues, share placings and flotations since the beginning of last year. Some of this money has been used to repair balance sheets but a good proportion has been set aside to acquire land. To support sales of 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s, compared with 2,973 sales last year, Persimmon says it will need to increase the number of plots owned with planning permission from 15,200 to 20,000. The effect of the issue would be to leave the group with virtually no debt. Borrowings, however, would be expected to rise as land buying and output increased. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'Depending upon the strength of the market we would be comfortable with gearing of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent indicating net debt of up to Pounds 80m at our present size.' He added the group had usually financed land purchases out of shareholders funds, leaving work in progress to be financed by borrowings. He and his wife Sarah, are not taking up their rights, reducing the family holdings from 19.4 per cent to 16.4 per cent. Persimmon said that recovery in the housing market was continuing with forward orders, including reservations, more than 10 per cent higher during the first ten weeks of this year than the corresponding period last. Prices had also risen a little. The average price of a home was currently about Pounds 64,000, compared with Pounds 61,000 last year. Part of this increase was due to change in product mix but some of it was due to a genuine rise in prices. Turnover in 1993 increased from Pounds 140.6m to Pounds 169.3m. COMMENT The latest cash call by Persimmon on its shareholders is a little bit cheeky. Since the end of 1990 the number of Persimmon shares in issue will have risen by 49 per cent from 77.8m to 116.1m following the latest rights issue. The offer price is at a sufficient discount to be attractive to shareholders and the rights should be taken up. Persimmon's net margins have climbed to more than 10 per cent after interest and are better than many of its competitors. Nonetheless, some of the gloss has gone off the company as it has embarked on an ambitious expansion programme. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 27m for the current year puts the group on 19 times earnings which is probably high enough.</p>

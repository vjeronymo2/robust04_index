			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Five offenders were  recently released from education-through-labor institutions  before their terms expire, according to a department concerned  here.    Chen Zhuman, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai and Zhang Li were  ordered to be re-educated through labor respectively between  December 1991 and September 1993 because of disturbing social  order and endangering public security by making use of religion.    Decisions to release them were made by the  eduction-through-labor committees of Quanzhou City in Fujian  Province, Weifang City in Shandong Province and Zhangjiakou City  in Hebei Province. The department concerned said that they were  released ahead of time because they had been amenable to  discipline and behaved themselves during correctional period.</p>

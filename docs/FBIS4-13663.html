			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali has denied a BBC report  attributed to him on the morning of 8 April that he is engaged  in hostile acts against the Egyptian Government.    Shaykh al-Ghazali told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the BBC cited an  interview with him conducted by a British journalist from THE  GUARDIAN. There was a mistake in the translation, he said.    AL-GHAZALI stressed that the report is unfounded. He said he  is serving the heritage and message of Islam within the limits  of public order. He said he never thought of violating the  state's general law.</p>

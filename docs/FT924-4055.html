			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / US health reform backed IN A significant reversal yesterday the Health Insurance Association of America, representing 270 commercial insurance companies, endorsed the principle of universal health coverage, coupled with cost controls and a limit to the tax-free status of health care benefits. The move serves to confirm that the ice is finally breaking in efforts to reform the US health-care system, with some of the most powerful groups in the health industry beginning to accept solutions that go directly against their own interests. Although health-care reform was a central plank this year in the campaign of President-elect Bill Clinton, many observers believed fundamental reforms would be obstructed by the conflicting claims of health insurers, doctors, businesses, local governments and those who are left out of the current system. Most US citizens have health insurance provided by their employer, tax deductible for employers and excluded from taxation for the employee. A meeting organised by the National Governors Association and involving local government and business representatives this week endorsed limiting this tax-free status. Critics argue that the tax exemption had helped allow inflation in the medical industry, because neither employer nor employee is fully sensitised to the costs of their health care. At the same time, the estimated Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16bn) that could be raised by taxing health care benefits above a certain basic level would help to pay for coverage of those currently left out. Businesses have in general remained firmly opposed to limiting the employer's deduction, but Mr Thomas Pyle, a director of the American Business Conference and a participant in the meeting, reluctantly concurred. 'I don't think any business group is enthusiastic about capping deductibility and I think that most groups would prefer to see a reduction in the amount that's exempt from taxation rather than capping deductibility. But the bottom line is we end up feeling comfortable with this as a step towards pushing down on costs in health care,' he said. Yesterday's HIAA policy statement also favoured limiting the tax exclusion on health care benefits for employees, and backed greater government involvement in overseeing the prices charged by doctors and hospitals. These new proposals may not fit exactly with Mr Clinton's plans for reform, many of whose details remain unclear but health-care specialists believe there are now clear signs of a reform consensus beginning to coalesce.</p>

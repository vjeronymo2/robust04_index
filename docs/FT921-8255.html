			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bulls ignore intervention on Dollars SENTIMENT remained bullish on the dollar, in spite of attempts by the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to weaken the US currency in the early hours of yesterday morning, writes Peggy Hollinger. Traders said the intervention had offered buying opportunities at the expense of the D-Mark, among other currencies. They speculated that a large buying order from the Middle East, believed to be the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, had helped the dollar to recover some of the ground lost through intervention. The actions from the US and Japanese central banks at 4.40 GMT pushed the dollar from Friday's close of Y128 to Y126.70 at the London opening. However, the US unit ignored attempts from Japanese officials to talk it as low as Y123 to Y125, and it closed at Y126.95 in London. Mr Peter Luxton, a senior economist at Barclays, said: 'Unless they intervene again, it is unlikely they will be able to talk it down to that level.' However, the central banks' actions had resulted in a more cautious approach to dollar/yen trade. 'There is a reluctance to push the dol-lar up too rapidly,' said Mr Luxton. Dollar trade was also said to have been muted as a result of the US public holiday. There was no reluctance in dollar/D-Mark trade, which saw the German unit weaken from DM1.6117 at the opening in London to a close of DM1.6230. Comments from Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger that Germany was not likely to raise rates in the near term made the currency a prime target, said traders. The market for D-Mark/yen trade had also been quite active, said Mr Luxton. The D-Mark weakened in tandem with the dollar early yester-day morning, and closed at Y78.21, compared with Y78.44 on Friday. The D-Mark held last week's gains against the Swiss franc, to close unchanged at 90.14 centimes. Traders suggested that the franc would fall as low as 91 to 92 centimes in the near term, as it was unlikely that any help would be forthcoming from the Swiss National Bank. Sterling finished unaltered against the D-Mark, and remained glued to the floor of the European exchange rate mechanism. Economists said sterling's position was more a problem for the Spanish than for the Bank of England. The UK currency stood at just 39 per cent of its allowed divergence from the central Ecu rate, while the peseta was at 70 per cent. Economists also dismissed the possibility of an imminent cut, even as little as a quarter of a point reduction, in UK interest rates. The pound's resistance in the foreign exchange markets had so far been the result of a dollar focus. The danger was that if the authorities did lower rates soon, sterling would no longer be ignored. The peseta continued to hold the lead in the ERM. It closed steady against the German unit, at Pta 62.70 per D-Mark.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / EU business urges public sector reform European business leaders yesterday called for a sweeping overhaul of the public sector, including privatisation of postal services, telecommunications, energy and transport, in order to recover competitiveness and tackle Europe's unemployment crisis. In a move aimed at lobbying Europe's political leaders before this week's EU summit in Corfu, Unice, the employers' federation, appealed to governments to set targets for cuts in public spending as a proportion of GDP and to take steps to reorganise the welfare state. Mr Francois Perigot, the leading French industrialist and newly-appointed Unice president, said it was time to reduce the burden of the state on business and roll back the public sector. 'We have kept our eyes closed for 20 years. We can't go on like this.' The Unice report - Making Europe more competitive: Towards world class performance - is business's most detailed response to the White Paper on competitiveness, jobs and growth launched last year by President Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The report sets out several areas for action to shrink the public sector through deregulation and privatisation so that Europe can compete more effectively with the US and Asia: Reducing the cost of healthcare, through the introduction of new 'market type' mechanisms to match supply more closely to demand. This would involve bringing private companies into the health care market. Trimming the costs of pensions. This would provide a 'basic' state pension for everyone who has worked, with an optional complementary pension financed by companies and/or individuals. Reducing the costs of unemployment benefits by limiting the period of entitlement and enforcing tougher criteria for eligibility. Reducing the costs of sickness and disablement benefits, with responsibility for additional insurance transferred from the public sector to companies and individuals. In addition, the report urges more flexibility in labour markets, through reductions in minimum wage levels, lowering the costs of employing people, and reducing the cost of protection against dismissal. Unice also wants much small business to be freed of red tape, both from Brussels and national capitals. Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary-general, acknowledged the recommendations implied Europe was moving toward US-style deregulation at the very moment the Clinton administration was looking to the European social model for inspiration. Mr Perigot said that Unice was not advocating the dismantling of the welfare state, rather it was seeking new incentives for companies and individuals to reduce their reliance on the state.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Gonzalez submits to questions Mr Felipe Gonzalez yesterday took a leaf out of the British parliament's book when he inaugurated a prime minister's question time, but his answers dealt a blow to his government's efforts to engineer a restrictive budget. In his first appearance in what will be a weekly 15-minute interrogation by the lower house in Spain's Cortes, Mr Gonzalez in effect promised pensions would be indexed to inflation. The commitment will place a considerable burden on the government's economic team as it tries to craft a budget that will reduce the public deficit next year to 5.9 per cent of GDP, from 6.9 per cent this year. The question time is part of an effort by Mr Gonzalez to regain the initiative following strong gains by the opposition conservative party in June's European elections. Since he gained power in 1982, the prime minister has only attended major parliamentary debates.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELDER CARE: CARING FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION;  </P> <P> FAMILIES WITH STRONG ETHNIC TIES ENCOUNTER ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> There is a popular belief that the elderly in urban areas of the United States  are not treated as well as their counterparts in other countries.  </P> <P> Many Asian immigrants worry that when they get old, they will not be accorded  the place of honor in their families that went to their grandmothers and  grandfathers. Latinos and blacks -- along with Anglos -- fear that, as they  age, their children will abandon them for the suburbs, leaving them to face the  ravages of age alone, prey to the crime and poverty of city ghettos.  </P> <P> In fact, recent studies suggest that American city dwellers, whether black or  white, rich or poor, are not being ignored by their families as they enter  their final years. Quite the contrary.  </P> <P> One study, conducted by James E. Lubben, a UCLA professor of social welfare,  found, for example, that elderly Chinese in San Francisco were receiving more  support from their children than did their counterparts in Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Yet in accommodating themselves to the pressures of American life, families  with strong ethnic ties face special problems in dealing with the difficulties  of aging, particularly in getting help from government agencies.  </P> <P> For example, many experts have observed that blacks and Native Americans in  general do not receive nearly as much financial assistance from Social Security  or Medicare as do other U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> The reasons are many and complicated, said Fernando Torres-Gil, former staff  director of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging, now an  associate professor of public administration and gerontology at USC.  </P> <P> "Probably because of high blood pressure, improper diets over a lifetime, many  blacks and Native Americans simply do not live long enough to collect  benefits," he said. "Even if they do live long enough, many minorities, black  women especially, have not worked in jobs where they are in a position to  collect government (employment) benefits."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, there are public and private services that provide personal and  medical care for all racial and ethnic groups, but because of their particular  backgrounds and cultural experiences, some ethnic groups are far less willing  than others to take advantage of what is available.  </P> <P> Social workers have observed that many Asians and Latinos shy away from outside  help, especially from services provided by government agencies.  </P> <P> One of the barriers is language, Torres-Gil said. But even when language  difficulties can be overcome, many immigrants harbor fears of and prejudices  against government intervention into their lives or the lives of their  families.  </P> <P> In contrast, Jews and blacks, experts say, take advantage of social services  such as group meals and activities for the elderly.  </P> <P> Elderly people living in cities seem to be better off than those in rural  areas, where virtually no support exists outside the family. But residence in  highly populated areas where there are a large number of elderly people does  not guarantee adequate support for seniors' services.  </P> <P> Studies have shown that Florida, which has among the nation's highest  concentrations of the elderly, is among the worst in providing social services  for senior citizens. One of the states that ranks among the best in services  for the elderly is Pennsylvania, which has a relatively large population of  elderly people. But Massachusetts and New York are also highly ranked and do  not have high percentages of elderly citizens.  </P> <P> California is a relative newcomer in the field of gerontology, and its  population is also relatively young, according the the American Assn. of  Retired Persons. Although the programs in California are far from ideal, many  experts in the state and elsewhere agree that they are above average and seem  to be improving.  </P></p>

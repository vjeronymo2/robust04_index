			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Layla Shahid, Palestinian </F> representative in France, by Mouna Naim; date not given: "The  Palestinians Are Outraged By Washington's Behavior"]    [Text] The Palestinians are outraged. The United States  literally "payed off" the UN Security Council, Layla Shahid, the  Palestinian general representative in France protested. It was  at Washington's wish alone that the vote on the draft resolution  on the Hebron killing was delayed for three weeks, although the  text had been amended and the voting procedure -- paragraph by  paragraph -- had been drawn up several days ago, she explained  to us.    And, above all, this is the first time that a U.S.  Administration has ventured to exclude East Jerusalem from the  perimeter of the occupied territories. The paragraph of the  preamble relating to Jerusalem -- on which the United States  abstained -- makes provision for the Council to "reaffirm its  relevant resolutions which state that the fourth Geneva  Convention of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the territories  occupied by Israel in 1967, including Jerusalem, and Israel's  responsibilities in this regard..., condemns, and so forth."  The French Government even approached Washington to obtain  explanations on this subject, she said. In vain.    Washington's position on the eastern part of the holy city  is  particularly serious because it violates the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September by the PLO and  Israel, in other words by the two sides most directly involved.  Indeed, the text makes provision for the city's fate only to be  discussed during the second phase of the peace negotiations and  for "the two sides to agree that the agreements secured in the  interim period should not undermine the result of the  negotiations on permanent status or anticipate it."    Before the vote, Washington "used outright blackmail on the  Palestinians: Return to the negotiating table and we will  discuss the measures to be taken," Dennis Ross, the U.S.  coordinator in the peace negotiations, said in substance to  Yasir 'Arafat last week, Layla Shahid explained. The PLO is  reversing the terms of the equation and refusing to be held  solely responsible for the suspension of the process.    The Palestinian general representative thinks that the U.S.  attitude on Jerusalem is a "negative message, an insult not only  to the Palestinians but to the whole Muslim world," she said.  In addition to Washington's attitude, Mrs. Shahid thinks that  it is "the cowardice" of the international community which,  through the Council's slowness in approving a text, is another  "negative message" to the population of the occupied  territories. Although Russia has the merit of "at least having  tried" to show the United States that it could not lay down the  law, Europe, our interlocutor deplored, is totally incapable of  acting on its words at Security Council level. Before resuming  negotiations, the PLO and Israel must discuss what this  "international presence" stipulated by the resolution will be:  "Will it be UN or multinational forces, civilian or military?  From whom will they receive their mandate, how many men will  they have?," Layla Shahid asks. In short, we are not out of  the woods, and the situation on the ground will continue to be  at the mercy of all the extremists.</p>

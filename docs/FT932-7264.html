			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Management: Back on the track at BSI British Standards Institution. The title conveys a feeling of solidity, establishment, of being above the commercial fray. In fact the BSI has a monopoly in only one area of activity - that of standard writing. In the fields of testing and certifying products and companies, BSI faces tough competition from a range of commercial rivals. Even so, the widespread recognition in industry of BSI and its kitemark seal of product approval do give it an advantage in the market place. On the international scene, BSI's dominance of standard setting and the range of its other activities also give it an undoubted advantage over its continental counterparts such as DIN in Germany and AFNOR in France, says Michael Sanderson, chief executive (pictured below). Established in 1901 as the Engineering Standards Committee, the BSI has a wider range of activities than any of its national or international rivals. BSI also avoided the split between the electrical sectors and the rest of industry which has marked other standards organisations. These arose because the International Electrotechnical Committee was founded in 1907, 40 years before the International Organisation for Standardisation, responsible for all other industry areas, and has never merged. All the standards organisations which were subsequently set up mirrored this split. One of BSI's first actions was to bring order to the manufacture of structural steel sections used to make tramway rails. Within a year of the introduction of a kitemark for tramway rails in 1903 the number of steel sections used had fallen from 75 to five and industry made an estimated saving of Pounds 1m a year. Despite Britain's early lead in standard setting, quality slumped after the Second World War. It was a realisation of just how far standards had slipped which prompted a revival of interest in the 1970s and the creation of BS5750, a quality assurance standard, in 1979. That standard has proved phenomenally successful for BSI and quality assurance work, certifying, approving and testing companies to BS5750, accounted for 45 per cent of BSI's total 1992 turnover of Pounds 74m and nearly two-thirds of its Pounds 7.5m operating income. The growth in quality assurance work is almost solely responsible for the rapid rise in staff numbers to more than 2,000 in the past two years. BSI's monopoly of the standards setting business gives it an undoubted advantage in the market for its other services but also helped foster a sleepy, bureaucratic atmosphere. A programme to improve efficiency was launched in the late 1980s. A layer of committees has been removed and a smaller main board created. In the early 1980s BSI made an unsuccessful attempt to gain a monopoly over certification, alongside its existing exclusive mandate for standard-setting, but was rebuffed by the government. This has no doubt played a part in its becoming more commercial. BSI, 2 Park Street, London W1A 2BS. Tel: 071 629 9000.</p>

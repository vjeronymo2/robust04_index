			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: Union power over pay levels in doubt Sir, Samuel Brittan's analysis of the link between average earnings growth and unemployment during three recessions ('The unwelcome pay-jobs link', February 18) highlights the macro failure of Thatcherite labour market reforms to deliver. What is particularly noticeable, and what Mr Brittan fails to point out, is that equilibrium unemployment has remained stubbornly high (around 2.5m) despite the enormous reduction in union density and collective bargaining coverage in the second half of the 1980s. Ten years ago the high level of equilibrium unemployment would have been principally blamed on unions and their wider influence through pay bargaining. The decline in numbers covered by collective bargaining, combined with decentralisation of bargaining, has not produced the improved macro performance that many predicted it would. In light of this, perhaps we now also need to reassess the impact of 'union power' on average earnings growth in the past.

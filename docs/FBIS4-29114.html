			<p>Yamagishi   <F P=102>   OW1406134494 </F> <F P=103> OW1406134494 </F> <F P=104></F>    BFN     [Text] Meanwhile, Ozawa, too, is conducting underground  activities toward the LDP, holding "the Yamagishi card."    What has happened to the relationship between the two men  since the SDPJ left the government? "Kaishin went so far as to  expel the SDPJ. We are now on fighting terms with Ichi-Ichi  [Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa]."    When such remarks by Yamagishi were leaked out to Nagata-cho  [the center of Japan's politics], those who were looking forward  to "a general election through the coalition of the LDP and the  SDPJ under the multiseat constituency system" were encouraged,  and SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama advocated "dissolution of  the House of Representatives through mutual consent."    Meanwhile, Yamagishi was writing a different scenario,  displaying "the LDP card." The plan was to push for  resignation, through the pressure of Yuaikai, which is a pro-DSP  [Democratic Socialist Party] labor union within Rengo, and DSP  Chairman Keigo Ouchi, who took action to form "Kaishin." That  was to shake Ozawa up and at the same time to pave the way for  the SDPJ to return to the coalition government. Then, on 16  May, Yamagishi said to DSP Dietman Eisei Ito and others, "The  Hata administration will remain a minority government unless it  resigns en masse and makes a fresh start." This remark was made  five days before SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo made the  same remark.    In opposition to Yamagishi's speech and conduct aiming at  both "dissolution" and "returning the SDPJ to the coalition  government," the general tendency within Rengo was against "the  union between the LDP and the SDPJ." At the meeting of Rengo's  Central Executive Committee, held on 19 May, all joined in to  swell the chorus of calls for "a flat no to the union between  the LDP and the SDPJ." Some leaders of Rengo testified that "the  purpose of the meeting was to contain Yamagishi." It is not  clear whether Ozawa moved behind the scenes.    Meanwhile, Ozawa's footing is no longer as firm as it used  to  be. Concerning the formation of "Kaishin" and the SDPJ's  withdrawal from the coalition government, former Economic  Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, a leader of  Shinseito, said, "Ozawa committed a gross blunder."    This is the first time that Ozawa was publicly criticized by  name within Shinseito. On 19 May, Aino was released by Ozawa  from the post of chief director of the Lower House's Committee  on Rules and Administration. That night, Keiwa Okuda, chairman  of the Lower House's Committee on Rules and Administration, is  said to have said in excitement, "Why did Ozawa fire my  right-hand man without prior consultation? I can never tolerate  such a thing." Okuda is, in effect, the most influential man  after Ozawa in Shinseito. Aino, who is Okuda's confident, says  in a casual manner, "Ozawa the Terrible is the image made by the  media. Younger members have ceased to be afraid of Ozawa  because I do not fear him."    Now, on 26 May, the Political Reform Promotion Council [Ad  Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform], consisting of members  of business and labor, announced such emergency proposals as the  "holding of a general election under the new system." In  response to this, on the same day 88 supra-party Diet members,  excepting members of the Japan Communist Party, became promoters  and engaged in a signature-collecting campaign "against a  general election under the current multiseat constituency  system," which was to be completed by 10 June. At a press  conference of the Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform,  Professor Uchida and Rengo Acting Chairman Jinnosuke Ashida were  present. It is said that it was DSP Secretary General Takashi  Yonezawa who asked Washio to restore a good relationship between  Ozawa and Yamagishi. Ashida is the top leader of Yuaikai which  supports Yonezawa. Those who mediated for a meeting between  Ozawa and Yamagishi are also advocates of political reform.    Ouchi expressed his intention to resign as chairman of the  DSP on 1 June. Yonezawa, who had acted as a liaison in the  formation of "Kaishin," was elected as the next chairman and  Ouchi was made a scapegoat. On the following day, 2 June, at a  meeting of Rengo's central committee, Yamagishi highly evaluated  Ouchi's resignation, saying, "I hope that the SDPJ will present  its political ideas and return to the non-LDP coalition  government as soon as possible.    This can be construed to mean that Yamagishi has shown a  sign  for the restoration of a good relationship with Ozawa.

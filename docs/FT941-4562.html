			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: First-half downturn at ACP Australian Consolidated Press Holdings (ACP), the quoted media group in which Mr Kerry Packer's family company, Consolidated Press, has a 45 per cent interest, yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent drop in after-tax profits during the six months to end-December, at ADollars 30.2m (USDollars 21.6m). Sales revenues dipped from ADollars 212.3m to ADollars 208.5m, while operating profits, before both interest and tax, fell from ADollars 66.7m to ADollars 55.8m. However, ACP said that the comparisons were distorted by some changes to accounting policies in 1992, which bought a one-off benefit; by the sale of the Offset Alpine business; and by the impact of start-up costs of three new titles in Australia during the most recent half year - The New Weekly, SHE and National Enquirer. The latest half-year operating profit is after a ADollars 6.4m loss in respect of these titles and their launch costs. The National Enquirer joint venture was suspended in December, but ACP said that it was confident that the investment in the two women's magazine titles would 'add substantial value . . . over the longer term'. The company added that circulation revenues in Australia had improved by around 7 per cent, year-on-year, once the impact of new titles was excluded. However, it acknowledged that the forecast upturn in national display advertising had not occurred. 'Advertising revenues were flat compared to the same period of 1992. This situation appears likely to remain unchanged for the remainder of the current financial year,' it said. Because of this and the start-up costs, ACP said it was unlikely it would 'significantly exceed' last year's profits total this time round. ACP added that it was in 'final negotiations' with bankers over a restructuring of debt facilities, which it hopes will cut interest costs. Year-end borrowings are forecast to be below ADollars 270m.</p>

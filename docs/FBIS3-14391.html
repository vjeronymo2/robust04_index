			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [The "Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "A U.S. </F> Explanation Is Required"]    [Text] Has the U.S. Government under President Bill  Clinton's administration changed its position on Jerusalem  without making a candid declaration and without the Arab  governments discovering this? Can we be content with the  statement by Timothy Wirth, the State Department adviser on  population affairs [title as published], in which he said that  the statement citing President Clinton on Jerusalem was  distorted and that the U.S. stance has not changed. This stance  means that the fate of Jerusalem must be negotiated. Why wasn't  this statement or correction made by the White House or the U.S.  State Department, which are the parties concerned with  explaining stances relating to foreign issues?    The successive U.S. Administrations have adopted a clear  position on the issue of Jerusalem, which, from the Arab point  of view, is considered to be one of the most important issues  triggering the Arab-Israeli conflict. This issue will remain a  bone of contention unless a settlement is reached guaranteeing  the Arab rights in this holy city and preserving freedoms for  religions there without relinquishing the religious and  political rights of its Arab and Muslim population.    In all the negotiations and talks since the signing of the  Camp David Accords, the U.S. stance on the Jerusalem problem has  remained firm: Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories.  The disputing parties should settle things through  negotiations. Accordingly, the American Embassy has remained in  Tel Aviv and has not moved to Jerusalem. During the U.S.  presidential election campaign, Bill Clinton made statements in  which he pledged that Jerusalem would be the capital of Israel.  The Arab world did not bother much about these statements and  considered them to be electoral promises the value of which  would end with the election result. But at his recent meeting  with AIPAC's [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] senior  figures, President Clinton seized the opportunity to emphasize  that the United States considers united Jerusalem the capital of  Israel, thus violating all previous U.S. stances.    Regrettably, President Clinton's statement has not aroused  enough attention among the Arabs. No Islamic or Arab country  requested an explanation or clarification of the new position,  which followed the Hebron massacre and came when the peace  efforts were stumbling. The only comment was made by Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who declared that if this statement  means a new U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Egypt differs with it.  The question now is: Has the United States changed its  position on Jerusalem? Does the U.S. abstention from voting on  the clause on Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution  reflect a new stance? This is the required clarification.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Shares in Savoy rise on death of president SIR Hugh Wontner, president of the Savoy hotel group, has died at the age of 84. Sir Hugh had fiercely defended Savoy from hostile takeovers for nearly 40 years and news of his death lifted the group's 'A' shares 40p to close at 485p. Market attention focused particularly on Forte, which holds 69 per cent of Savoy's equity and 42.5 per cent of its voting shares. The Forte group has made no secret of its desire to gain control of its rival, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridges and the Connaught. Both companies said yesterday, however, that they were still bound by a 1989 pact under which Forte agreed not to purchase any more shares until the end of 1994. Savoy said that Sir Hugh, who died on Wednesday night after a short illness, was 'a distinguished man of many talents'. Forte said: 'We have not often seen eye-to-eye, but we extend our sympathies to his family.' Sir Hugh, the son of an actor, joined the Savoy in 1938 and became a director two years later. He was on the board for 48 years, becoming president in 1990. Although he was one of the most senior figures in the British hotel industry, Sir Hugh was often criticised for his failure to make more of the international prestige of the group. Takeover attempts in the 1950s by Mr Charles Clore and Mr Harold Samuel led the Savoy to create two classes of shares: the 'A' shares and the 'B' shares which carried more votes. The Savoy board retained control over enough of the 'B' shares to give them more than half the votes. The dual structure was sufficient to prevent control passing to Forte, whose then chairman, Lord Forte, conducted a bitter battle against Sir Hugh throughout much of the 1980s. Mr Rocco Forte, Lord Forte's son and now chairman of the group, has said he would like to create a new luxury hotel company in which Forte would have a majority stake. The company would consist of the Savoy properties and Forte's luxury hotels. Although the Savoy's independence is guaranteed for another two years, many in the industry believe that with Sir Hugh's death much of the hostility to Forte could disappear.

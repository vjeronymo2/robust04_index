			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Directors divided on EC schism: Business hopes the Maastricht shambles can be sorted out swiftly ALTHOUGH Mr John Major will have the unity of his party uppermost in his mind as he struggles to create order and consensus out of the Maastricht shambles, there will be another critical constituency watching his every move. Britain's business community is not prone to panic, but it hates instability and uncertainty. The outcome of the Danish referendum, the ensuing fall-out at Westminster and the chance that Maastricht might unravel are threatening to create both. Industry is adamant that the politicians must sort things out and do it quickly. British business has generally been more pro-European than many individuals. But boardroom opinions are divided on whether the setback to the treaty represents a possible calamity or a golden opportunity to strike a more beneficial deal. 'It is potentially quite a dangerous situation,' says Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods. 'It carries with it grave political uncertainties, with the threat that unstable currencies and rising inflation could come back into vogue. We could all go back to square one.' Mr Haskins says a prime concern is that enemies of the 'ever-closer union' envisaged at Maastricht will get the upper hand: 'We must keep the pressure on for a deal and make sure the loonies aren't let out again.' But Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, says the Danish vote is excellent news. 'The community was developing on profoundly undemocratic lines. It would one day explode and cause lots of damage. It has been punctured with a relatively small pin.' Mr Taylor, like many other business leaders, emphasises the need for pressing on with the completion of the internal market. For the most part, industry's interest has focused on the construction of a vast, barrier-free marketplace. Most reservations and suspicions have centred on the growing influence of Brussels and on plans for a broader social dimension to European development. The treaty signed in December was widely welcomed as an honourable compromise by commerce and industry. While it enables Britain to stand aside from the social chapter and to reserve judgment on monetary union, it also allows the UK to press on with building the internal market - the economic backbone of the community. Although the events of the past 10 days have left business, along with the politicians, bewildered about what happens next, there is universal agreement that progress made so far must not be jeopardised. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, says it is essential that talks over Maastricht should not impede the implementation of decisions already taken to help improve the business climate in Europe. He adds: 'In particular, it is vital that the momentum towards completion of the single market by the end of this year should be maintained.' During its presidency of the EC, the British government should make it a priority, he adds. Mr Geoffrey Sewell, director-general of the European Computer Leasing and Trading Association, whose members are responsible for supplying the European market with equipment worth Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn), says it would be a disaster if progress towards a single market were to be frustrated. There are also fear that progress towards a single currency may be halted. Industrialists such as Sir Patrick Sheehey, chairman of BAT Industries, regard the single currency as an essential part of a true single market. The Confederation of British Industry, which will debate the latest developments at its council meeting on June 24, also agrees that a single currency is essential. It believes any delays to economic and monetary union which arise from arguments over political union will be harmful. Although Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, says he is pleased that the Danes have 'ended the fudge' on Europe's political framework, he believes that the community needs a single currency now. Others are not so convinced. Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, is not certain that a single currency is realistic. 'I am sceptical about it, and where there is doubt I think we should stay as we are.' There is also some concern over prospects for the exchange rate mechanism, which is seen as the halfway house to monetary union. Mr John Early, the director responsible for strategic development at construction group Amec, says the stability of the UK economy would be under threat if the ERM were to disintegrate. Any additional delay to sterling moving into the narrow bands of the ERM would also be unwelcome, he believes. Mr Nick Temple, chief executive of the UK subsidiary of US-based computer group International Business Machines, says it sees no need for immediate strategic changes, but it will have to keep a very close eye on events. This response is shared by, among others, UK-based computer manufacturer ICL. Mr Hugh Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, says: 'It's sad it's fallen apart, but it's far from clear what the full implications are.' Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI, also agrees with that view. 'It is sad because I cannot really believe everything is back in the melting pot. It is serious because the Danes have sounded a warning to Brussels that they have to take more more notice of people's susceptibilities.'</p>

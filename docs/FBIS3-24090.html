Oshchenko: "Energy Crisis Remains Trump Card </F> in Political Dealings"]    [Text] On Friday Acting Kray Administration Head  Valentin Dubinin, Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov, and Yuriy  Ivanov, chief engineer of "Dalenergo," held a joint press  conference together with directors of large industrial  enterprises concerning the situation in the Primorye [Maritime  Territory] power industry.    In his introductory statements, Kray Vice-Governor Valentin  Dubinin noted that the situation continues to be extremely  complicated. By Friday there were 532,000 tonnes of coal in the  kray's coal yards, whereas on the same day last year there were  1,191,000 tonnes.    Valentin Dubinin said that a sum of 35 billion rubles, which  was finally allocated by the government in the form of subsidies  following the persistent appeals of Kray Governor Nazdratenko  and "Dalenergo" Director Basharov, was already on its way to its  destination, the coal workers of Siberia.    At the press conference, however, a shocking statement was  heard to the effect that the 35 billion-ruble boost would only  make it possible for the kray's power system to operate normally  for a maximum of 20 days. Meanwhile, a statement issued by  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko from Moscow, disseminated last week by the  kray administration's press service, said that the billions  procured by the governor would make it possible for Primorye  [Maritime Territory] residents to make it through the winter in  warmth.    Nevertheless, "Dalenergo" chief engineer Yuriy Ivanov was  not  thinking of political gain, but was being straightforward when  he said that in the near future it would be necessary to reduce  energy consumption by another 3.5 million kw/hr. As you will  recall, the industrial enterprises that shut down last week  reduced energy consumption by 3 million kw/hr. According to  Ivanov, in Vladivostok alone there were more than 60 such  enterprises.    Ivanov stated that in the coming days the electric power  station may begin using coal right off the trucks: only coal  transported from the open pits will be burned. This will mean,  said the "Dalenergo" chief engineer, that heat and light will  shut off in residential districts not according to a schedule  for an hour of day, but for 6 - 12 hours, and possibly with no  forewarning. If "Dalenergo" does not receive funds to cover its  indebtedness from kray enterprises, to include those which  belong to the Vladivostok municipality, then "in 10 days our  time will run out," Ivanov said.    As was explained during the conference, the notorious 35  billion rubles was for coal that had already been burned in the  electric power station's furnaces in January. After that coal  for Primorye will once again be on credit.    Vladivostok mayor Viktor Cherepkov said that the policy of  procuring subsidies in Moscow was short-sighted. In the mayor's  opinion, these billions would exacerbate, not reduce the problem  of indebtedness. Viktor Cherepkov also expressed doubts that  Vladivostok, which collects almost half of all taxes in the  kray, had a budget deficit, thus signifying planned deficit  spending on the part of municipal enterprises, to include  PZhETs, enterprises that are part of the heat network, and so on.    Meanwhile the "Dalenergo" chief engineer commented on the  mayor's statements saying: Such claims would be justified in a  situation that was the least bit normal, but not at all under  the emergency circumstances that exists today.    A VLADIVOSTOK correspondent questioned Cherepkov regarding  reports on local television about a statement he supposedly made  to the ITAR-TASS agency, alleging that there is a large store of  coal in Primorye, and that subsidies were procured from Moscow  only to be given to "mafioso structures." In response, Viktor  Cherepkov stated it was necessary to address such questions not  at him, but at the organization disseminating such reports. At  the same time he stressed that the kray's coal fields were more  than adequate, but that funds had not been invested in their  development, and that the kray's coal industry was dying.    "Dalzavod" Chief Engineer Viktor Kalinichenko summed up the  contradiction in opinions well when he said that once again the  energy crisis is being used like a playing card in the political  aims of the opposing sides, the kray and city administrations.  In his opinion, it is necessary to find a compromise at all  costs. A situation in which tens of thousands of people are  essentially out of work, enterprises have come to a standstill,  and housing construction has once again started simply does not  allow for political intrigue.</p>

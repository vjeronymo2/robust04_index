			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Delegates are advised to reject minimum wage Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called on his party to reject proposals for the introduction of a rigid minimum wage, urging them to back 'flexible' policies on the economy and the labour market. As Liberal Democrats prepared to debate the economic policies with which they will fight the next election, Mr Ashdown told delegates that they must issue a clear rejection of wage controls at this week's conference if they are to underline the distinction between their party's economic policies and those of Labour. In an eve-of-conference speech the Liberal Democrat leader poured scorn on Labour's 'umbilical attachment' to a rigid national minimum wage, which, he said, was foisted on them by the public-sector unions. Instead, he urged the introduction of 'wage watchdogs' which would 'investigate' allegations of exploitation by employers. He said: 'The right way to tackle exploitation is through targeted policies  -decentralised, flexible, running with the grain of the market - policies that protect both the wages and the jobs of the lowest paid.' Senior party officials admit, however, that the conference may endorse a call for more rigid wage regulation tomorrow in its discussion of employment. This would include the setting of a regional minimum hourly rate of pay by a Low Pay Commission. With debate already raging over how the Liberal Democrats should deal with a Labour party led by Mr Tony Blair, some of Mr Ashdown's colleagues believe the party must clearly reject 'old-style' socialist policies. They believe that the party will avoid calling for renationalisation in a debate today in spite of discontent in the Liberal Democrats' heartland in the west country. The Liberal Democrat leader is also determined to avoid a clash with delegates this week on the party's commitment to tax incomes over Pounds 100,000 a year at the rate of 60 per cent. Mr Ashdown is understood to believe a recent Liberal Democrat resolution calling for this level of taxation is far too punitive. The leader of the party's Parliamentary Candidates' Association said at the weekend that the party had 'pressed the self-destruct button' with its taxation policy. Nevertheless, some senior party figures take comfort that this level of taxation is less severe than the rate imposed by the Conservative government for most of the 1980s.</p>

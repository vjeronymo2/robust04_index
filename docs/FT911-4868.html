Mr Akbulut, however, said they would quickly be replaced on the mountains by up to 200,000 more Kurds streaming in from Iraq. Mr Akbulut said: 'Whatever we propose as a measure now is only a temporary solution. . . it is our policy that these people must by all means go back to their own homes. This is a must.'</p>

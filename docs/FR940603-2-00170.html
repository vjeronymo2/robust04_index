The purpose of this coordination is to avoid duplication of effort, to utilize materials already developed by Federal agencies and grant recipients, and to otherwise refer to and take advantage of ADA resources that have already been developed. Additionally, successful applicants will receive an orientation that will familiarize them with projects being undertaken by other successful applicants. Thereafter, 1994 grantees will be expected to exchange information and provide support to each other where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One goal of this grant program is to determine which education, information dissemination, and compliance assistance strategies are most effective in reaching as many persons as possible in the targeted population with information that serves their particular needs.

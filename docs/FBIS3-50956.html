She said the so-called  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] is an extremist  organization.    [Begin Diaz recording, in progress] ...violent,  professional,  and well trained. Its profile is highly ideological and uses a  language that is characteristic of extremist guidelines. [end  recorded]    The armed group includes the participation of ideologists  and  clergy; there are medics and transmission technicians, and it is  comprised of Mexicans and foreigners. Its operation strategy  for 1993 consisted of advocating the invasion of lands and  provoking an overall violence. In certain cases it kidnaps  children to force their parents to join the armed group.    Referring to the group's weapons, Diaz said it has machine  guns, shotguns, revolvers, and sophisticated weapons that are  suited for guerrilla warfare. The weapons were manufactured  mainly in the United States, Russia, and the UK.    [Begin Diaz recording] The so-called EZLN appeared in 1993  in five municipalities of Chiapas State--Ocosingo, Las  Margaritas, Comitan, Altamirano, and Chanal. It has an  organized network of activists cells that are in permanent  contact with civilian band radios. It has 15 training centers  in various municipalities; six of them are located in Las  Margaritas, five in Ocosingo, two in Sabanillas, one in  Altamirano, and one in Chanal. [end recording]    The report read by Mrs. Socorro Diaz is based on information  that was provided by the National Defense Secretariat and the  Attorney General's Office. She said the group has martial arts  instructors and health promoters. Each squad of activists is  comprised of one sergeant, one corporal, one radio operator, one  health promoter, and 20 activists. The group has 172 civilian  band radio stations in its camps, and authorities have found  propaganda of the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's  Union Party [Procup], which the group supports by distributing  its publications.    The aggressor group is comprised of and supported by various  extremist organizations. They have safe houses and assembly  centers where they show political-revolutionary movies to the  people. Diaz said many of its leaders have already been  identified.</p>

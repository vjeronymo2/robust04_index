			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: IHI hit by decline in domestic spending ISHIKAWAJIMA-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), the Japanese shipbuilder and heavy machinery maker, blamed a decline in domestic capital spending for an 8.1 per cent fall to Y11.2bn (Dollars 91.4m) in pre-tax profits for the first half. Sales for the half to end-September were down 0.7 per cent to Y371.7bn, although sales of heavy machinery for industry fell 45 per cent following slower demand from car and paper makers, which are suffering from excess production capacity. The company said the appreciation of the yen recently hurt export earnings, although the shipbuilding business, in recession until two years ago, reported a 25.8 per cent rise in sales. Japanese shipbuilders generally have full order books for the next two years, and are reluctant to increase production for fear of renewed price competition that would erode their healthy margins. IHI said an expected fall in domestic capital spending during the next few months had forced it to cut previous forecasts for the full year to end-March. IHI had expected a pre-tax profit of Y27bn, now revised to Y25bn, but higher than last year's Y21.4bn. Sales are expected to fall to Y800bn from Y811.5bn.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Traders brush off funding worries STRONG support for the largest gilt auction yet boosted the gilt market last week, enabling bond specialists to brush off worries about the large volume of funding expected later this financial year. Further signs that the UK economy is likely to grow only modestly over the next year gave a further lift to gilt prices, on the basis that inflationary pressures look like staying weak. The large underlying demand for gilts from many UK investors - who in recent years have run down their gilt portfolios - was evident from the success of the Bank of England's auction of Pounds 2.75m of 9 per cent stock due in 2012. As a result, with the financial year just three months old, the Bank has found buyers for about half the securities it will need to issue to fund this year's expected public sector borrowing requirement of around Pounds 30bn. With demand during the week steady rather than spectacular - and with the market's appetite for gilts weakened by the auction - movement in terms of prices was slight. At the long end of the yield curve, prices moved up slightly, corresponding to a fall in yields of about 10 basis points. This small movement, however, does not disguise the general change in the yield curve over the past few 18 months. This has flattened - with short yields coming down by more than those at the long end - as a result of expectations of low inflation. Thus in January last year, five-year gilts had yields roughly 80 basis points higher than those for 20-year gilts. At the end of last week, the difference was just 15 basis points. While for much of the past year gilt yields have generally fallen, they have been pushed up during the past month, a factor of concern about funding and speculation that the trend towards European inflation convergence may have been blown off course by the problems of implementing the Maastricht agreement on European economic union. Between June 1 and last Friday, according to figures from Deutsche Bank, 10-year gilt yields have increased by 26 basis points. Gilts have shown a worse performance than the equivalent German, Belgian and Dutch bonds - where yields have increased by 12, 9 and 5 basis points respectively - but have been more resilient to price falls than French, Danish, Italian and Spanish bonds - which have seen yield increases of 30, 32, 52 and 57 points. A reminder that any recovery from the recession will be weak came with reports of a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank notes and coins in circulation during June, adding to evidence of poor trading conditions in Britain's high streets. The Bank of England reported that banknotes in circulation increased by only 0.5 per cent in the week to June 24 compared with the equivalent week of 1991, following a 0.8 per cent annual increase in the previous week. The banknote figures were issued as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was releasing its latest forecasts for the UK. It said the UK economy would grow this year by a paltry 0.4 per cent and at less than a third of the rate projected for other the other Group of Seven industrial nations. The OECD also warned the expected recovery later this year would be constrained by high unemployment, the weak housing market and large debts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea recently  reshuffled a number of economy-related ministers, suggesting a  drastic change in its economic policy, NAEWOE press, the  official North Korea watcher here, said on Wednesday.    Change may be forthcoming given that Pyongyang appointed  Hong  Sok-hyong and Kong Chin-tae as State Planning Commission  chairman and vice premier, respectively, about two months ago,  according to NAEWOE.    Four ministers were also replaced recently -- the forestry  minister, Academy of Sciences president, mining industry  minister and chairman of the State Commission of Science and  Technology -- by unknown figures, NAEWOE said.    North Korea established a new Commission on Protection of  the  Environment last February, but its Chairman Yi Kon-il was  replaced by Hwang Sang-chun recently.    The exact reason for the ministerial changes is not known,  NAEWOE said.</p>

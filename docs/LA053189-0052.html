			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SURPLUS  </P> <P> When loose money is on the table, a scramble for it is to be expected.  Returning it to the people, spreading it out for teachers' pay, repairing  roads, etc. are worthy options.  </P> <P> Why not apply a reasonable portion of the state's $2.5 billion surplus to  shelter, food and medical help for the homeless, plus part to job training and  placement programs for the unemployed that would match business needs?  </P> <P> Since their burdens are human and immediate, I would think they merit priority  consideration. Just think of the benefits.  </P> <P> VICTOR H. JASHINSKI  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

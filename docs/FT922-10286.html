			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Costing of work directive 'arbitrary' THE GOVERNMENT'S asser-tion that the European Community working-time directive would initially cost industry Pounds 5bn is based on 'a fairly arbitrary measure', according to a senior statistician at the Department of Employment. An internal memo produced at the department on the costing of the directive admits that no allowance has been made for industries exempted from the directive, such as transport. It also predicts that employees currently working more than 48 hours a week, the limit required by the directive, will successfully resist a proportionate cut in earnings as their hours are reduced to comply. 'The overall offsetting cut in earnings (from phasing out working more than 48 hours a week) will not be more than half the cost of restricting working hours,' says the memo. The present cost to employers of staff working more than 48 hours a week is Pounds 7bn a year. The Department of Employment seems to assume that the costs of hiring new staff or paying for more overtime to accommodate the reduction in the working week will be about the same. But it then assumes a total cost of Pounds 3.5bn for this part of the directive, based on the prediction that employees whose hours are being cut will resist cuts in pay. 'There is not much evidence behind the assumption but we have had quite a lot of discussion about it,' said Mr Bill Wells, a statistician at the Department of Employment. The only other significant cost to employers is given as Pounds 1.4bn from introducing four weeks' annual paid leave, although that does not take account of the three-year period of grace for introducing that measure. Mr Wells points out that, cost arguments aside, UK employees register a high level of satisfaction with their working-time arrangements. He also says that the directive goes against the grain of annual working-time agreements which allow employers to use their assets for longer periods and allow employees large variations in the working week. About 6 per cent of UK employees currently have annual-hours agreements, and the idea is also being taken up in some other EC countries, especially Italy and Belgium. Supporters of the directive argue that it could improve productivity if employees are flexible enough. In the baking industry where hours average 54 a week, employers have said they would be happy to cut overtime if they could open the main baking plants seven days a week.

According to the source in the second phase during the year  1994-95 prototype field exercises will take place for giving it  final shape before its large-scale production for the induction  in the Pakistan Army.    Defence observers believe that the induction of Al-Khalid  tanks, which are being built in Heavy Industries, Taxila (HTT)  in collaboration with China, would surely narrow the  quantitative gap in armour between Pakistan and India.    It may be recalled that first phase of Al-Khalid project has  already been completed and the prototype have undergone trials  in Pakistan in various conditions. Experts from China and  Pakistan are now exploring further methods for improving the  tanks with more powerful engine, better fire control and  electronic system, before its production, source added saying  "production line would be expanded to manufacture in such a  number that can meet the country's defence requirement  adequately".    It is also worth mentioning here that the Chief of the Army  Staff General Abdul Waheed after taking over as army chief in  January this year is said to have directed the army authorities  to also examine the possibility of buying other types of tanks  including the Chinese T-85. Two-hundred T-85 Chinese tanks are  already in the process of being inducted in the Pakistan Army as  a part of Pak-Sino deal signed earlier. Pakistan Army has  budgeted a total of 311 million dollars for the purchase of new  tanks over the next three years.    A deal for buying T-691 IMP from China has also materialised  which will further strengthen the defence line of Pakistan  against any external threat.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / EC entry no match for EEA: Bigger benefits for Efta states seen in European economic area plan THE European economic area (EEA) is likely to give Nordic and Alpine countries an economic boost of up to 5 per cent of gross domestic product if it comes into effect next year as planned. According to an analysis published in London today by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the economic gains for Sweden, Finland, Austria, Switzerland and Norway stemming from the free-market EEA will probably greatly outstrip the benefits accruing from EC membership later in the 1990s. However, it believes the members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) are likely to maintain their bid to join the EC, above all because of the political benefits of full membership. The study says the economic gains from the EEA will come about particularly from the effects of greater competition in the Efta economies. This will lead to lower goods prices and more effective allocation of resources. Additionally, through linking up with the EC's 'single market', Efta states will benefit from additional capital investment which would otherwise have flowed to the Community. They would face an overall drop in economic welfare if the single market went ahead without them, the report points out. Efta countries will face additional budgetary burdens from full EC membership later in the 1990s. Since average per capita income in Efta is about 40 per cent above the EC figure in nominal terms, the Efta states preparing for EC membership will all become net budgetary contributors. They will make an estimated total net annual contribution to EC coffers of around Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.9bn). The report says the planned EEA agreement provides economic benefits to the Efta states without the 'political baggage' stemming from full membership - which would imply adherence to the Maastricht treaty. However, the Efta nations want to apply for full membership to win a role in the political development of the Community, as well as to participate in other areas of EC policies such as economic and monetary union and the common agricultural policy. The study provides a gloomy assessment of the chances of EC accession by the former communist states of eastern and central Europe. These countries will have to 'stabilise their economies, rationalise their institutions and achieve several decades of above average economic growth' before they can think realistically of full membership.

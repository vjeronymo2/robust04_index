			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  has set up special monitoring committees for securing fairness  in biddings for public works projects in all of its eight  regional construction bureaus, ministry officials said Thursday  [28 April].    The committees will keep watch on the procedures for  biddings  and receive complaints from companies that fail to get  contracts, the officials said.    The move came in response to a series of major corruption  scandals, which exposed rampant, illegal collusion between  politicians and big builders to fix public works contracts and  deflect official investigation into bid-rigging.    The committees, which comprise five experts, will advise the  ministry's local branch heads.    They will monitor and assess fairness of the qualifications  for bidders for the public works contracts given by the local  construction bureaus.</p>

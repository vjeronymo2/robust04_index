At a press conference here today organized by the Press and  Publication Administration of China, Professor Wang Xuan,  director of the Computer Institute of Beijing University, said  that all the technology of the new color printing and publishing  equipment is stored in a personal computer.    "The greatest benefit of the new technology is that Chinese  printing houses can now do their color printing without buying  and using the expensive imported electronic color analyzers,"  said Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of  Sciences.    According to Wang, China's printing houses have spent 70  million U.S. dollars importing some 400 color analyzers in  recent years. Many of the Chinese publishers have to go to Hong  Kong to get their high-quality color books printed.    "Our newly-developed technology has some features and  functions which traditional electronic color analyzers do not  have," Wang noted. "For example, publishers and printers can do  all kinds of artistic processing and creative designs through a  computer."    Due to its small size and low prices, Wang said, most small  and medium-sized printing factories can afford to purchase the  equipment.    According to Wang, the market for color printing equipment  in  China is worth at least two billion yuan.</p>

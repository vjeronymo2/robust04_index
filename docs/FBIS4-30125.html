			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The Asia-Pacific is one of, if not, the most dynamic  regions in the world. Spectacular economic growth of fast  developing countries of the region has been an inspiration and  sometimes the envy of the rest of the world. However, this  fortunate position should make the Pacific community  inward-looking and discriminating against the other regions. As  the prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, told the Pacific Basin  Economic Council at its general meeting in Kuala Lumpur  recently, we would be foolish if we of the Pacific got together  in order to circle our wagons to raise barriers and to keep  everyone else out.    The Malaysian leader knew what he was talking about. The  Pacific Basin owes it to themselves and the global community to  build upon the first foundation of a liberalizing economic  system that will eliminate the obstacles to the flow of goods  and services worldwide. That is the objective of the new world  economic order as enunciated in the Uruguay Round. That spirit  must be maintained at all times if the world is to progress  harmoniously together. There are bound to be differences in  approach towards achieving that goal. But there is a wealth of  opportunities to work with those whose interest vary from one to  the other. There are possibilities for agreements to be reached  without creating insurmountable stumbling blocks in the way of  progress and prosperity.    The Pacific era must be one in which areas of cooperation  must be identified and utilized for the common good. These can  include fields of communication, infrastructure development,  banking and financial services, telecommunications, energy  utilization, technology transfer, joint business ventures and  above all, increase trade with and among each other. Malaysia  has drawn praise from the EEC secretary general for its positive  support for the speedy conclusion of the Uruguay Round.    What is crucially important in this era of tension and  conflict in different parts of the world is for peace, stability  and security to prevail in the Asia-Pacific region. Everyone is  aware that there is conflict potential in some areas of this  region. If this is allowed to get beyond control, the entire  strategic picture and future of the Pacific may be changed. But  fortunately for the Pacific countries, the atmosphere has been  made conducive for peace through political, social, and economic  stability. The important thing for the countries in this region  to pursue is to maintain this trend in order to replace enmity,  confrontation, suspicion, and hatred wherever they may exist  with a spirit of cooperative peace.    The Pacific era has dawned. The basin must strive toward  open regionalism not only in the Pacific itself but at a global  level as well.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zheng Guoxiong and Chen Fengying Stress That </F> China's Most-Favored-Nation Status Must Not Be Linked to Human  Rights"]    [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch  deputy director; aide to the director Chen Fengying; and  National People's Congress Deputy Cheng Yiu-tong yesterday (6th)  held that China's earlier handling of Wei Jingsheng and others  was strictly in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. They  were not worried that Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] status would  thereby be affected and believed that the United States should  not link these two issues.    Zheng Guoxiong was asked at a Shunde City Investment Project  Fair to comment on the legal actions concerning Wei Jingsheng  shortly before U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's visit to  China. He said that the Chinese Ministry of Justice had handled  the relevant problems according to state laws and that it was  entirely China's internal affair. He held that China has always  opposed Western countries imposing their views and human rights  standards on China and that the actions of the Chinese Ministry  of Justice should not affect China's MFN status.    When attending a Kun Tong District Basic Law Promotion  Carnival, Chen Fengying said that the United States should not  talk about the law-enforcement actions of the Ministry of  Justice and China's MFN status in the same breath, because  countries would do anything they thought they should according  to law. MFN status is a problem of trade and mutual economic  benefits between China and the United States and should not be  linked to human rights problems.    She pointed out that the human rights problems contained in  U.S. accusations were also seen in the United States, some being  even more serious than in other countries. She did not believe  that the United States set human rights conditions when dealing  with trading or other types of relations with other countries.  Therefore, she believed that it was inappropriate for the  United States to set human rights conditions when discussing MFN  status with China.    Cheng Yiu-tong, who was also present on the same occasion,  argued that: China detained the persons concerned before the  visit of the American officials merely in accordance with its  own legal procedures. This fact reflects that China will not  yield to the pressure exerted by the United States under the  pretext of its human rights. In fact, China has also improved  greatly on the human rights issue in the past few years.    Regarding the question that the United States will first  have  to ascertain China's human rights status before considering  granting it MFN status, Cheng Yiu-tong said: This shows that  the United States confuses economics and politics over this  question. China's reaction clearly tells the United States that  China will make no compromise on these questions of principle  and that China will handle relevant questions in accordance with  its own legal procedures.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak report: "Drowned in a </F> Sea of Propaganda"]    [Text] The Baltic Institute for Strategic and  International Studies has held a conference in Tallinn on the  problem of "Baltic Cooperation and Security." Delegates from 16  countries took part. Seven NATO representatives, headed by  Brigadier General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the joint program  of miltary contacts under the U.S. Armed Forces Headquarters,  Europe, were at the conference. Also invited were the  ambassadors to Estonia of the FRG, Finland, and Norway. They  "forgot" to invite the Russian ambassador.    The two days at the conference were spent talking about  Zhirinovskiy's victory -- this was how one participant, in  conversation with myself, aptly described what happened in  Tallinn. The discussion of the problems of cooperation in the  Baltic region was exploited by the representatives of Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania for one purpose -- to describe the current  situation in Russia in the gloomiest tones and to try (yet  again) to get accepted as members of this bloc as quickly as  possible by putting pressure on representatives of the North  Atlantic bloc.    In my view, a conference on a very important issue was  transformed through the efforts of its organizers into a purely  propaganda event, and only the speech of Vice Admiral Viktor  Kravchenko, first deputy commander of the Baltic Fleet, infused  a fresh spirit into it, since his speech contained specific  proposals on the organization of cooperation in the Baltic Sea.    Unfortunately, the proposals of the Russian military were  supported only in the lobbies. From the rostrum Estonian  Defense Minister Juri Luik expressed support for the creation of  a unified concept of security of the Baltic countries, at the  same time suggesting Russia as the adversary. He called for the  creation of a military-political alliance of the Baltic states  without Russia's participation, but incorporating Ukraine as  "the main guarantor of opposition to Moscow's imperial policy."    Judging by the speeches of the Estonian defense minster and  other representatives of the Baltic countries, the leaders of  these states are trying to create an atmosphere of suspicion and  distrust around Russia in a cold war spirit.</p>

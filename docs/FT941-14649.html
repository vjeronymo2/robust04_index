			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Meeting on Banesto postponed A meeting between the governor of the Bank of Spain and the chairmen of Spain's top banks to discuss the future of Banesto was postponed yesterday as Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, continued a fresh audit of the troubled bank. The central bank had called the chairmen of the main banks - Argentaria, Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Central Hispano (BCH), Santander and Popular - to a meeting on Friday to discuss a possible restructuring plan for Banesto. The meeting will take place on Tuesday. Although the central bank would not comment on the change, one of the banks said it appeared that more data was required about Banesto before any rescue plan could be discussed in detail. The Bank of Spain estimated the over-valuation of assets at Banesto at Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) when it intervened to replace the bank's management three weeks ago. However, the Price Waterhouse audit is expected to produce a higher estimate. Price Waterhouse has been asked to examine Banesto's loans below a threshold of Pta250m, which was the limit observed by the central bank's inspectors. This has raised the likelihood of the accounting firm discovering additional problems.</p>

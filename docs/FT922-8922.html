			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due NEXT week should provide some much-needed first-hand evidence about whether the UK is finally pulling out of recession as some of the most influential retailers report results and comment on the consumer's state of health. On Tuesday, Marks and Spencer, which has been riding the rough trading better than most, is likely to edge profits 2 per cent higher to Pounds 635m. The company is also expected to make an announcement about the future of its loss-making Canadian operations. M and S's solid cost base and proven management skills should have enabled it to combat a loss of market share. But clothing margins will have been hit by widespread discounting elsewhere and the food business will have felt the force of furious expansion programmes of the big supermarket chains. One of these, J. Sainsbury, is likely to boast of a more buoyant trading picture the following day as annual profits are likely to surge by more than 20 per cent to the Pounds 610m mark. But Burton Group, the ill-starred fashion retailer which has seen two chief executives depart in as many years, is only likely to confirm the pattern of its recent grim trading fortunes when it reports on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley suggests interim profits will be near Pounds 20m - with only a token dividend - and predicts a sharp reverse in the second half. Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, is expected on Thursday to lay the foundations for the further 'year of progress' promised by Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman. A 3 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 390m is forecast with IDV, the drinks division, leading the way. British Gas is expected to report a drop in its first quarter net income on Thursday to Pounds 630m from Pounds 729m in the same period last year, according to forecasts by County NatWest, the Edinburgh-based brokers. The company saw profits eroded by warmer winter weather and lower gas production at its Morecambe Bay field. Royal Dutch-Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, is estimated to have made a profit of Pounds 685m in the first quarter on a replacement cost basis which strips out stock losses and gains. This is half the level made in the same 1991 period when income was Pounds 1.22bn. The company is expected to be hit by a weakening in refining margins , particularly in the Far East and a loss in its chemicals division as well as lower gas prices.

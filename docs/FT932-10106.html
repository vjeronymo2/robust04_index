			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government staves off VAT revolt THE GOVERNMENT last night avoided a highly damaging defeat over its plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel, in spite of failing to stamp out a surprisingly stubborn backbench rebellion. The tightness of the result comes as an unpleasant reminder after last week's morale-sapping election results that it is not just on Maastricht that the government, with its majority now trimmed to 19, is vulnerable. The government's determination to go through with the measure was immediately pounced on by Labour, who said it showed ministers still believed that they were right and the people were wrong. On last night's principal vote the government scraped home by a majority of 10 (295 votes to 285), with two Conservative MPs - Mr William Powell (Corby) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) - voting with the opposition. A further five Conservative MPs - including Mr Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth) and Mr Michael Stern (Bristol North West)  - abstained. A Labour amendment to exempt charities from paying VAT on their fuel bills was defeated by 297 votes to 286, a government majority of 11. In what was a shaky start for the government to the Finance Bill's committee stage, the focus of Tory misgivings was ministers' failure to outline fresh steps to soften the impact of their plans on people with pensions and savings marginally above the level entitling them to support from the social security system. In March the threat of a backbench revolt forced prime minister John Major to promise extra help for 10m people on low incomes who stood to be hit by the plans to extend VAT to domestic fuel from next April. The move marked a rapid climbdown from earlier indications by ministers that compensation would be limited to uprating income-related benefits in line with retail prices. Mr Powell said he would vote against the government 'with enthusiasm', adding: 'I know my constituents would feel ashamed of me if I were to vote for it tonight.' He accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of making a 'very serious error of judgment' in extending VAT into an area never previously contemplated by the Commons. He said it was this extension of VAT that had encouraged traditional Conservative voters in Northamptonshire to stay at home in last week's county council elections. Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, took pains to emphasise both the urgency of the need to tackle the public sector borrowing requirement and the full extent of the benefits which pensioners and those on income support derived from other government policies. 'It may be that the increases the government has made in help to the poorest people have been so numerous and so large that the House is out of touch with where we have now reached,' he said. Details of the proposed measures to help those worst hit by the VAT extension would be set out in the autumn uprating statement. But he said it would be 'unrealistic to give extra help to all pensioners over and above the retail price index effect' because 'we could be talking about another Pounds 1bn on benefit.' Later, Sir John Cope, paymaster general, said help would be provided for 8m households.</p>

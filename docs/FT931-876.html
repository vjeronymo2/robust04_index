			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph directors approve deal INDEPENDENT directors of The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group 68 per cent owned by Hollinger, Mr Conrad Black's Canadian company, have approved the deal to take a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group. The deal is subject to a vote by the minority shareholders of The Telegraph. A circular recommending the deal is being sent to shareholders shortly and a special meeting will be held, probably on or about April 13. Hollinger agreed to buy a 22.5 per cent stake in November at CDollars 18.10 a share and offered half to the Telegraph, at a the same price, costing Pounds 72.3m. The deal was going to a vote of shareholders when Power Corporation, another Canadian company, bought new shares in Southam at CDollars 14 each representing 18.7 per cent of the company and diluting Hollinger's holding to the same level. Hollinger and Power also came to a shareholder arrangement. Sir Frank Rogers, deputy chairman of The Telegraph said the directors unanimously approved the deal. Mr Tony Hughes, finance director of The Telegraph, said the deal would still be slightly dilutive of The Telegraph's earnings as the benefit of the extra money Southam was getting would offset the dilution of the Hollinger stake. Sir Frank said that the combined Hollinger, The Telegraph and Power stake of 37 per cent and the right to nominate six directors to the Southam board, would give them influence to 'improve Southam's newspaper assets and enhance shareholder value'.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES' FORUM SCHEDULED TUESDAY  </P> <P> Oxnard City Council and mayoral candidates will get a chance to present their  views to both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking voters Tuesday night.  </P> <P> A three-hour forum, sponsored by the League of Women Voters and a variety of  local civic groups, will give the public a chance to meet the 12 council  candidates and six mayoral candidates.  </P> <P> At stake are two council seats and the mayorship.  </P> <P> Because Oxnard is more than 50% Hispanic, the event's sponsors believed that it  would be appropriate to offer on-the-spot Spanish translation, as well as  Spanish and English telecasts of the event, said Gloria Postel, a League of  Women Voters member and coordinator of the forum.  </P> <P> Questions for the forum will be formulated by both the Oxnard Community College  students and the audience. The forum will be held in the community college's  Room LA 6 from 7 to 10 p.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> A videotape of the forum has been scheduled, twice in English and twice in  Spanish, for Oxnard cable subscribers later in the week on Channel 19.

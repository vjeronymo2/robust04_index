			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Gradual recovery from Europe's currency crisis THE European currency crisis last year helped fan concerns about some sovereign credits. Three were particularly badly hit: Sweden, Finland and Italy. Eurobond yield spreads in these sovereign credits ballooned as rating agencies downgraded their debt, and the fight back has proved a difficult one. Swedish borrowers have been the quickest to recover. Last week's Dollars 200m five-year deal for Spintab, the Swedish mortgage bank, launched at 85 basis points over the comparable US Treasury, showed a marked spread contraction. A five-year Spintab deal launched in April 1992 at 80 basis points over the curve had widened to 135 basis points by November. Sweden's continuing presence in the primary market, paying higher spreads where needed, has proved successful. Its cost of funds has fallen from about 25 basis points over Libor on D-Mark and sterling deals at the end of last year, to just above Libor on recent French franc and Canadian dollar issues. Finland, which fared rather worse, followed the same pattern. Finnish Export Credit's funding costs, which rose as high as 50 basis points over Libor, are closer to Libor flat now. However, Finnish banks would still find it difficult to come to the market. Italy is having the roughest ride. It is still trading largely on an asset-swap basis. This means that, unlike most high-quality debt, gauged in terms of its yield spread above the relevant government bond, it is treated as a high-yielding floating-rate asset, viewed in terms of the margin over Libor produced by asset-swapping. In these terms, Italy's 10-year Eurobonds are trading at 50 basis points above Libor. Last month, Italian Treasury officials hosted presentations in London in the hopes of addressing some of the concerns of international investors. Italy is expected to return to the Eurobond market once Moody's has completed its latest review of the country. In March, Moody's placed Italy's AA3 rating under review for possible downgrade. If a downgrade goes ahead, the potential investor base for Italian debt will shrink further, as many investors cannot buy debt rated below AA.</p>

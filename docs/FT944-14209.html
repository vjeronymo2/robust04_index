			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Dublin - Other Markets Irish Permanent, Ireland's largest building society before it converted to plc status, is listed in Dublin and London on Thursday, in an otherwise quiet week. Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin note that the market is down about 3 per cent so far this year and is about 12 per cent off its January 1994 high. Mr Robbie Kelleher says that because this price weakness has occurred at a time of exceptionally strong earnings growth, the market is now trading on multiples that are at the bottom end of the range that has been experienced over the past decade, and he sees plenty of scope for price appreciation.

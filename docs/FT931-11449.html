			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cobalt price slide halted by Zaire crisis BLOODY RIOTS and killings in Zaire, like those seen in the past few days, once would have sent the price of cobalt soaring because that country is the world's biggest producer. But traders said yesterday that, while the latest orgy of violence in Zaire had made buyers nervous, cobalt metal prices had moved up only by between 50 US cents and Dollars 1 a lb. Similar events in Zaire in September 1991 sent the free market price of cobalt from Dollars 20 to Dollars 35 a lb in a few days. It had started that year at only Dollars 7. Since then the market has been revolutionised by the collapse of the Soviet Union and a dramatic rise in Russian exports. Meanwhile, demand for cobalt - a hard, silver-white metal used in superalloys in such things as cutting tools, high-strength magnets and jet engines, as a powder in catalysts for the oil and man-made fibre industries and in radial tyres - has eased back because of recessionary conditions in much of the industrialised world. According to the Cobalt Development Institute, about 23,000 tonnes of cobalt metal was produced last year, while demand was roughly 21,300 tonnes. Political turmoil in Zaire played havoc with production there and it slumped by 2,000 tonnes or nearly one quarter to 6,600 tonnes. At its peak, in 1986, Zaire's state-owned Gecamines produced 14,500 tonnes. Last year Russian exports more than made up the deficit and reached an estimated 5,000 tonnes. Russian production was probably 4,500 tonnes while the rest came from various stockpiles. 'The power in the cobalt market has shifted from Africa to Russia. There has been an avalanche of Russian material so that all last year's bad news about Zaire could not stop the cobalt price falling,' pointed out Mr Nick French, a director of the Wogen Resources minor metals trading organisation. The African producers' price set by Zaire and Zambia, where annual production is steady at about 4,500 tonnes, was cut last month from Dollars 25 to Dollars 18 a lb. The free market price of Russian cobalt is Dollars 11 to Dollars 12 a lb. Mr French said: 'Present events in Zaire have not changed the outlook (for cobalt production there) - it remains atrocious. However, the killings have moved the story on to front pages so sentiment has been affected.' Consumers were still not willing to sign long-term contracts but were no longer waiting until the very last moment to make short-term purchases, he said. Speculators had withdrawn from the market and traders and merchants were reluctant to take positions.</p>

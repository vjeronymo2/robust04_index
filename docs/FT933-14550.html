			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Output rises across industry and a 2.1 per cent increase in the last three months - was widely spread across industry. Output fell only in the food, drink and tobacco industry, but this was mainly because of abnormally high sugar output in February, which distorted the three-month on three-month comparison. Growth was particularly strong in the engineering industries, which account for more than 40 per cent of manufacturing output. Car and car parts production increased by 7.9 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter, while strong computer output fuelled a 2.5 per cent rise in electrical and instrument engineering. The milder winter was behind a strong rise in building materials output. This prompted a 6.1 per cent increase in output of minerals and mineral products in the three months to May compared with the previous three months. A 1.9 per cent rise in output of the chemicals and man-made fibres sector stemmed from a strong performance by the pharmaceuticals industry. Output of total production industries - manufacturing plus energy output - rose only 0.4 per cent in the latest three months because of a fall in energy and water pro-duction. Output of coal and coke fell 9 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Istvan Balsai, a member of </F> the Hungarian Democratic Forum National Executive Committee, by  Karoly Lencses; place and date not given: "The Minister, Too,  Is Primarily a Party Politician"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Lencses] Your role is  often seen to be controversial. While you have achieved  spectacular successes in the area of the administration of  justice, you have been attacked for your views on the provision  of justice for past crimes and your role in the disciplinary  action against the media chairmen.    [Balsai] I have indeed been attacked many times, but this is  mainly due to the political situation. In Austria, for example,  this position is often filled by people not committed to  parties; therefore, the Justice Ministry is a kind of guarantee  against party politicians. However, the situation is different  in Hungary because it would have been alien to the unfolding  democracy to place an expert rather than a party politician in a  governmental position. Therefore, the justice minister has to  implement the coalition's requirements, and from this it follows  that his activities cannot always be supported by a full  consensus. At the same time, this ministry was given a  prominent role in establishing the legal background for the  change of the regime, and the various political forces did not  agree on this as well. People who have different views on all  these issues tend to attack the justice minister, stating that  he is not allowed to take part in politics because he would then  exert pressure on the administration of justice.    [Lencses] It is indeed difficult to interpret some of your  statements in any other way.    [Balsai] In theory, I might even agree with this view.  However, when the coalition promised compensation in the form of  the punishment of the responsible people belonging to the past  regime, when--mainly in the interest of the legitimacy of the  judges--it made its goal the replacement of the former leaders  of the judiciary, or when our ministry was given the task of  conducting disciplinary action against the leader of the public  service medium that, according to the government, is under the  supervision of the executive power, the justice minister could  hardly be a politically neutral player in current affairs.  [passage omitted]    [Lencses] Let us return to your more immediate area: What  achievements are you most proud of, and have you had any real  painful failures?    [Balsai] The complex legal regulation of compensation can  give us cause for some satisfaction because we implemented the  goals laid down in the Program of National Renewal. Similarly,  I view it as a success that the courts have become truly  independent and legitimate in every sense. I quietly note that  the level of the performances might be lower than expected on  the basis of the judges' income and conditions. However, this  is not politics because it is a fact that the procedures are  often protracted. On the other hand, the probable rejection of  the draft bill on the public prosecution is one of my failures.  It is possible that the timing was wrong and the gap between  the opposition's leading jurist-politicians and our views has  become too wide, although, some time ago, we held the same views  on settling the constitutional position of the public  prosecutor's office.    [Lencses] Some people oppose subordinating public  prosecution to the government precisely because you are the  minister.    [Balsai] This is an unjustified and impractical approach:  We are leaving serious gaps in legislation because of  short-term thinking and that focusing on particular people. As  a matter of fact, it is also not true that the subordination of  the prosecution to the government cannot be implemented because  of the current court structure. However, we should now start to  think about whether the next government will have better chances  of getting the bills passed, which requires a two-thirds  majority in Parliament.    [Lencses] What are your views on the failure of the media  bill? Because of the missing law, the provision of unbiased  information will soon be out of the question, and we should also  not forget about the peculiar personnel decisions and the many  dismissals.    [Balsai] I am not convinced that the Justice Ministry had  the best conditions for preparing the bill. Therefore, I do not  really see this as a personal failure. We did all we could and,  if the talks are broken off, the reason will be that the  opposition is insisting on the sacking of the two deputy  chairmen. It is clear that this points beyond the media law  because the preparation of a law cannot be linked to personnel  decisions. As for unbiased reporting, I try to watch the news  on television and the program "The Week" [A Het] and, in my  view, they fulfill this requirement. [passage omitted]    [Lencses] The parties making up the current coalition will  probably not get an absolute majority [in the elections]. In  this case, what will happen?    [Balsai] It is almost certain that none of the parties can  expect a similar result to that in 1990, namely, more than 40  percent of the mandates. What kind of government can be formed  will obviously be decided at the coalition talks. However, it  is certain that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] will not  enter into a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  or the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Apart from this, we  do not exclude any possibilities. At a time like this, it is  wise to speak with caution and not to exclude certain factors  from the start. However, the MDF would not be able to work  together with the MSZP or the SZDSZ without a significant change  in its political direction.    [Lencses] Does this mean that you trust that you will be  able to divide the liberal bloc and separate the Federation of  Young Democrats [FIDESZ] from it?    [Balsai] Indeed, it is only the FIDESZ that can be taken  into consideration from there because it is possible that the  Agrarian Federation or the Entrepreneurs' Party will not be  parliamentary factors. I see much difference between the SZDSZ  and the FIDESZ because the latter describes itself as a center  party that represents national values. The term liberal has  little meaning on its own because all parties would accept the  values of liberalism! As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ is  characterized much more by pragmatism than liberalism.    [Lencses] However, what do the voters think about the  FIDESZ's rapid approach to the MDF?    [Balsai] In my view, the FIDESZ has not really changed;  rather, it is the SZDSZ that has moved considerably to the left.  Let us remember that, in addition to expressing a willingness to  reach agreement, the statements of the leaders of the MSZP and  SZDSZ actually reflect the intention to cooperate. [passage  omitted]    [Lencses] It is not impossible that, once the votes have  been counted, the result will not be in your favor.    [Balsai] [passage omitted] If the current coalition does  not emerge victorious from the elections, rather than being a  natural phase in the system of political rotation, this would be  a failure because it would mainly indicate that a large number  of citizens are disappointed with the process of the change of  the regime. In this case, to whom would they give their vote of  confidence? The legal successor of the former state party!    [Lencses] Is this your failure or would it also be Hungary's  fall?    [Balsai] This would mean applying brakes to the development  process; let us just think about the Polish example where the  willingness of foreigners to invest has decreased, a general  strike is imminent, and they have already moved further away  from European integration.    [Lencses] Are you afraid of the restoration of the former  system?    [Balsai] Here, we no longer need to be worried about a  dictatorship, but we have to worry about the halting of a  process that has already started and that is promising; in other  words, we would find ourselves lagging further behind.  Naturally, we cannot know yet whether the voters are patient  enough and whether they can assess the events of the past four  years with the necessary maturity. If they do, then they will  give us another four years; if not, they will give preference to  the rather uncertain new factors that might be appearing with  fine-sounding promises. In this case, the economy will  obviously be put on a different course of development,  privatization will take a different direction, and welfare  policy will be placed on different bases. However, I wonder who  would benefit from a fundamental change in this phase of our  development? [passage omitted]</p>

According to data supplied by the  China Materials Information Center, as of the third quarter, the  following adjustments had been made with the approval of the  state departments concerned.    State Determines Scope of Fixed Price Commodities    In 1993 state fixed prices were retained for approximately  33  product categories.    1. Coal: Raw coal, mixed coal, bitumenite, and powdered coal  (including washed coal and washed refined coal) produced by  mines under central control and local mines brought under  central control.    2. Electric Power: State unified fixed price electric net  and  locally produced electricity. Thermoelectricity produced by  thermoelectric plants under state controlled investment.    3. Petroleum: Natural crude oil, natural gas, oilfield  liquified gas, gasoline (including central first class station  adjusted allocated price and 73 centrally managed market sale  priced), kerosene, diesel, heavy oil, and refinery gaseous  naphtha.    4. Chemical Industry: Dimethylbenzene and urea and  agricultural use nitroammonium produced by designated  enterprises (including the portion under unified selling price).    Special Railroad Use Steel Material Adjusted Price    The State Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the State  Planning Commission from 1 August determined the adjusted state  unified producer price of such steel materials for special  railroad use as heavy rails, wheels, tires, and fish-tail  [switching] panels. The price after adjustment is implemented  without distinguishing between products in the plan and those  outside the plan.    The adjusted per ton prices of heavy rails (GB2585-81) are:  38 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,450 yuan; U74, 3,480 yuan; U71Mn,  3,570 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,680 yuan; 43 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,420  yuan; U74, 3,450 yuan; U71Mn, 3,540 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,650 yuan;  and 50 kilogram/meter: U71, 3,380 yuan; U74, 3,410 yuan; U71Mn,  3,500 yuan; U70MnSi, 3,600 yuan.    The producer prices for each wheel with external diameters  of  840mm, 915mm, and 950mm are 1,580 yuan, 1,840 yuan, and 1,920  yuan, respectively.    The per ton producer prices of tires with external diameters  of 660-1,400mm and above are 1,030 yuan, 1,150 yuan, 1,420 yuan,  1,750 yuan, and 1,880 yuan, respectively.    The per ton price for fish-tail [switching] panels with  specifications of 22, 38, 43, and 50 kilograms per meter is  adjusted to 3,500 yuan.    All Lead and Zinc Mines Float Up the Prices of Zinc Ore  Concentrate in the Plan    The producer price of zinc ore concentrate in the plan has  been lowered because of the effect of market supply and demand.  Also the effects of rising prices for electric power and  railroad transportation and higher bank loan interest rates have  caused the mines' economic performance to seriously decline. To  ensure that the task of turning over zinc ore concentrate is  completed for 1993, with the agreement of the State Planning  Commission Pricing Department, in 1993 the price of zinc ore  concentrate in the plan can be floated up 5 percent on the basis  of the [1993] number 169 jiagong [price and  label;0116 1562] fixed price. The price of zinc ore concentrate  produced by other zinc ore concentrate enterprises within the  plan also can be implemented based on the stipulations given  above. This was implemented from 1 August 1993.    Jilin Papermill Adjusts Up the Price of Newsprint  Outside the Plan    Beginning this year, the production costs of a series of  newsprint products outside the plan has greatly increased  because of such factors as the constantly rising price of lumber  and upward adjustment in energy and railroad transportation fees  and it is difficult for the enterprises to absorb them. To  maintain newsprint enterprises' normal production of newsprint,  the Jilin papermill, from 10 July, adjusted the producer price  of a series of newsprint products in accordance with relevant  regulations. From 10 July 1993, 51 gram common newsprint is  3,800 yuan per ton; 49 gram offset print newsprint is 4,000 yuan  per ton; special class-A offset print newsprint is 4,150 yuan  per ton; and 45 gram offset print newsprint is 4,250 yuan per  ton.    State Tax Rate on Finished Oil and Some Chemical  Industry Products    To adapt to new reforms in crude oil prices, the Ministry of  Finance has decided to adjust current tax rates and methods of  levying taxes on finished oil and some chemical industry  products.    Generally product taxes are levied on finished oil produced  by petrochemical enterprises in accordance with actual sales  income. Finished oil product tax rates have been adjusted to 10  percent for gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oil, and solvent  oil; 8 percent for diesel, tar, and other refined oils; and 3  percent for heavy oil, naphtha, and chemical industry light oil  and other unfinished oils. The product tax levy on gasoline,  kerosene, and diesel produced from crude oil not in the unified  plan is temporarily lowered to 5 percent in 1993, and the  product tax on solid paraffin, liquid paraffin, pitch, petroleum  tar, petroleum benzene, polyethylene, polypropylene,  polystyrene, butadiene rubber, acrylonitrite rubber, and nylon  66 has been temporarily reduced to 10 percent.    The State Has Decided To Temporarily Reduce the Levy on  Caustic Soda Products    In recent year, costs have increased for caustic soda  producing enterprises because of the rising prices of raw and  auxiliary materials, leading to a rather large number of  enterprises experiencing losses. Out of concern for the actual  difficulties of caustic soda enterprises and to support the  development of their production, after study by the State Tax  Bureau and relevant departments, on 9 June of this year, a  notice was issued determining a temporary reduction of the tax  rate on caustic soda products to 12 percent (formerly set at 15  percent).    The notice also stipulated that after the temporary  reduction  of the tax rate to 12 percent, no localities could further open  up tax reductions or exemptions.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Drama on off-Broadway - The changing face of New York theatre Might this be the year that the Tony Awards will be finally forced to change? Though it has been true for years that the centre of the American theatre has shifted off-Broadway and to the regions, the Tonys, the annual awards that are the most visible manifestation of American theatre, have maintained their policy of honouring only Broadway shows. But recent events have sounded Broadway's death knell louder than ever before. First was playwright Neil Simon's announcement that he is bringing his next play, London Suite, to an off-Broadway theatre when it reaches New York after its current Seattle engagement. 'It's just not economically viable for us to go to Broadway any more,' said Simon of his decision; bringing a straight play to Broadway costs a minimum of Dollars 1.5m, as opposed to Dollars 0.5m off-Broadway. This is a scathing indictment indeed from the only American playwright whose name still guarantees a certain level of financial success on Broadway. A further blow was struck with this week's announcement that Tony Kushner's Angels in America, the most lauded and hyped Broadway play of the past decade, is to close on December 4, felled by dwindling audiences and high overhead costs, having recouped less than 70 per cent of its backers' investment. Meanwhile, the best-received American play since Angels, Edward Albee's Three Tall Women, continues its healthy run at the Promenade Theatre  -off-Broadway. Only one new American play is set to open this year on Broadway, while off and off-off Broadway is buzzing during the busiest theatrical autumn in recent memory. The first big hit of the season is Terrence McNally's warm and very funny serio-comedy Love] Valour] Compassion], which is playing at the non-profit making Manhattan Theatre Club through January 15, with plans for a commercial transfer. Unabashedly gay in its milieu and viewpoint, and addressing as it does the search for love and the ever-presence of death in the age of Aids, the play inevitably begs comparison to Angels in America, but Love] Valour] Compassion] neither aspires to nor achieves Angels' scope nor its level of socio-political commentary. McNally's gift is his ability to create believable characters and evocative situations in which exhibit their foibles and strengths; he also writes some of the best laughs lines. This play finds McNally straying further from the traditional domestic comedy form than he has in recent years - characters break from the action to speak directly to the audience, and time flows freely between flashback and forward action. The play follows the events in the lives of eight gay men over three holiday weekends in an upstate New York country house. As the house's owner, famous choreographer Gregory Mitchell, endures and overcomes creative block, his angelic, blind boyfriend fends off the advances of a sexy Puerto Rican dancer and tries to find sense in his sister's tragic death. The 14-year perfect-couple relationship of Perry and Arthur endures quiet crisis ('we're role models,' explains Perry, 'it's very stressful'), while Buzz, a musical theatre-obsessed, HIV-positive costume designer falls in love with James, an Aids-infected Brit who comes to America to mend bridges with his mean-spirited twin brother (both twins are played, in a bravura turn, by John Glover) and to die. But to dwell on plot is to miss the point. The play is at its weakest when it gets hung up on storytelling and at its best at evoking that languid holiday atmosphere in which nothing much seems to be happening, except moments that the characters will remember for the rest of their lives: bantering exchanges in hammocks and on lakeside rafts; spontaneous skinny dips (frontal nudity is rampant in this play as is, for that matter, ribald language); dinner parties that unexpectedly turn ugly; over-competitive tennis games; charged late-night encounters. Joe Mantello's lovely, intelligent production meets the play more than halfway, playing up its lyrical qualities without stinting on pace. Mantello and set designer Loy Arcenas have wisely given the production a unstructured, non-literal design, creating a heightened world in which the play's breaks from naturalism make perfect sense. The ensemble is, on the whole, first-rate. Stephen Spinella, in his first performance since his double Tony-Award winning turn in Angels in America, is admirably restrained as the uptight businessman Perry. Nathan Lane, one of America's funniest actors, reveals the breadth of his dramatic talent in the showman's role of Buzz; his transformation of a third-act speech about why life should be more like musical theatre from a show-off rant to an agonised cry beautifully captures the play's funny-tragic spirit. Stephen Bogardus, sporting an unconvincing stutter and an uncomfortable manner as Gregory, is the only weak link.</p>

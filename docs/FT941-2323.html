			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: EU hits at China, S Africa The European Union has imposed tariffs of nearly 50 per cent on Chinese and South African imports of ferro-silicon, a material used in iron and steel production, saying these producers are dumping their products on EU markets. The tariffs, which will last for five years, follow a six-month commission study which shows thatin the last four years Chinese and South African imports have risen from 9,000 tonnes to 31,000 tonnes while European production has fallen from 190,000 tonnes to 102,000 tonnes, the study says. Chinese and South African imports now represent 6 per cent of the market. The new anti-dumping tariffs, which came into effect on Sunday, will be set at 49.7 per cent for Chinese imports, and 47.4 per cent for most South African imports.</p>

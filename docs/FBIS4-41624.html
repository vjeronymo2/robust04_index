			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol 25 June TASS -- The Crimea, remaining an  integral part of Ukraine, should become a free economic zone, a  sort of a launching site for the economic processes, which will  later be adopted by the whole of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma said  here on Friday [24 June]. The Crimea became the last region he  visited in the course of his tour of Ukraine as a presidential  candidate.    The Ukrainian ex-prime minister, who, according to the  results of some public opinion polls, is the second most popular  politician after President Kravchuk, had meetings with electors  at industrial enterprises and farms and held talks with senior  officials from the Crimean Government.    Speaking at a press conference, Kuchma said that he liked  the  reforms which are being worked out in the Crimea. He expressed  confidence that the Crimea could not be brought back to its  previous state, that of one of Ukraine's regions. When tackling  controversial problems, it is necessary to take into  consideration the real situation, the characteristic features of  each particular region, he said. In his opinion, talks between  Ukraine and the Crimea should be on the same level as between  Russia and Tatarstan.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Comments by Larisa Alaverdyan, principal expert of the </F> Special Artsakh Commission of the Supreme Council of the  Republic of Armenia, recorded by M. Grigoryan: "`Azerbaijan Is  Not Ready for Peace'"]    [Text] May has been unusually rich in all kinds of  peacemaking initiatives and meetings and documents on the  Karabakh conflict. It is now clear to everyone that Russia has a  firm grip on all the "reins" of the mediation process and is  single-mindedly and methodically attempting to bring the parties  to the common denominator that it has devised. It is just as  obvious, however, that this process is proving extremely  painful, and this is not surprising, considering the neglect and  intricacy of the Karabakh knot.    Many people called the last meeting in Moscow at the  foreign minister level a most decisive step toward peace. It is  as yet somewhat too early to be talking about peace, I believe;  nonetheless, certain trends in the development of events may be  traced quite clearly.    At the paper's request, Larisa Alaverdyan, principal  expert of the Special Artsakh Commission of the Supreme Council  of the Republic of Armenia, expresses her viewpoint.    We have witnessed one further latest stage of the  peacemaking  process on the Karabakh problem. There have been sufficient  commentaries in the press in this connection, and everything has  been said, it would seem. But, perusing the press, one odd  circumstance may be observed: The process is described in highly  positive terms, whereas it ended very unsuccessfully, to put it  mildly. It is a question of the fact that we achieved  recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict at  quite a high price: First, Armenia also was, essentially,  recognized as a "party," and, second, Azerbaijan, it transpires,  no longer now recognizes itself a "party." Thus the situation  concerning the subjects of the conflict is once again uncertain.  Despite the well-known statement of Guliyev, head of the  National Assembly, to the effect that it would appear to be time  to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict if only  to have "someone to hold to account," the mood in Azerbaijan has  not changed one iota. It seems to me more important, therefore,  to comment not on the document itself, which was never signed by  Azerbaijan, but to view events from a somewhat different, but  closely connected, viewpoint.    For the peacemaking process to become a reality and for any  agreement to be converted from paper into actual action the  consent and readiness of all parties--recognized and  unrecognized--are essential as preconditions. This is an  entirely objective condition: They must all be ready for peace.  Unfortunately, all that we are observing in Azerbaijan--the  press, broadcasting, statements of officials, up to and  including the largely strange fuss in the National Assembly  apropos Bishkek--in a word, the political aura in this country  and the atmosphere and ideology testify that Azerbaijan is not  ready for peace. And this applies not only to the "top," what is  more--a certain stratum in society that shares in their entirety  the views of political leaders is emerging. Azerbaijan was  formerly not ready for any compromise even while part of the  USSR, although there are more than 30 known instances of  agreements having been achieved on issues identical to the level  of the Karabakh conflict at that time. Nor was Azerbaijan ready  for the start of the war, but started it. It is fitting to  recall here, incidentally, that the war began under Mutalibov,  with whom many people are today linking their hopes that with a  change of regime in Baku there will be change in policy also.    Now, however, this country is not ready for peace. It has  regretfully to be stated that all that is happening currently on  the Karabakh front is merely a precursor of a big war, plans for  which are, evidently, being hatched by Azerbaijan's political  leadership. Only a radical change not only of the leader but of  the entire leading stratum and a change in official ideology  could give us hope of peace. Otherwise, it will be difficult to  hope for anything, however zealously we express our aspiration  for peace negotiations and a readiness to sign any document.  Yes, there are in these documents clauses that are unacceptable  to Armenia also, about which the speaker of the Armenian  parliament has spoken, incidentally, but what is important is  the actual will and readiness for peace. It should be considered  that the peacemaking process is quite lengthy and entirely  allows of all possible kinds of adjustments in the course of the  negotiations.    It has to be said in connection with all this that many of  us  linked certain hopes with the formation in Azerbaijan of a civil  society. But, unfortunately, there has been no particular  success in the plane of systematic and stable contacts of the  public of this country with representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh  and Armenia, which is being drawn so actively into a resolution  of the conflict, and perhaps we also share some of the blame for  this. The shoots of such contacts have simply remained in  embryonic state. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal  to representatives of political parties and grassroots  organizations of all three republics: If the political  leadership is incapable of commencing a search for a practicable  path toward peace, perhaps it would be easier to do this "from  the bottom." Many organizations in Armenia are today prepared  for contacts and dialogue with their counterparts in Azerbaijan,  and, in my view, the state structures that are involved in  external relations should be giving thought to a strengthening  of relations between the civil society of Azerbaijan, the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia.</p>

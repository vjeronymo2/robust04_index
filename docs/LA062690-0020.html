			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKID ROW TENANTS FORCED OUT OF SHELTER SUDDENLY  </P> <P> Residents of a Volunteers of America shelter for the homeless on Skid Row  suddenly found themselves out on the street with no place to go Monday, when  the facility locked its doors in the early afternoon.  </P> <P> No VOA personnel would talk about the shutdown at the 83-bed Women and Couples  Shelter. An attorney for several of the residents claimed the closure was  related to the organization's intention to sell the building at 611 E. 5th St.  to the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> That $800,000 sale is contingent on the building being vacant, a CRA spokesman  confirmed.  </P> <P> About 20 residents Monday afternoon piled into the cramped waiting room at  Inner City Law Center, the legal aid center on Skid Row, wondering where to go  and how they would get their belongings out of the building.  </P> <P> "They won't let me in to get my medicine," said Judy King, who returned from an  outing to find she could not go back into the room she had been renting for  $240 a month for four months. She needs the medicine for a kidney condition,  she said.  </P> <P> With the help of Mayor Tom Bradley's staff, the residents were given free  lodging at the nearby Weingart Center for the night.  </P> <P> The VOA shelter has a reputation on Skid Row for being run down. County records  for one four-month period last year, for example, listed several violations for  cockroach infestations, broken toilets or inoperative showers.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, conditions have been worse than usual, said Debra Niles, 35, a  resident since November.  </P> <P> "The elevator doesn't work. They stopped all mail service. We can't get toilet  tissue. And the telephones are gone," she said. "They want to put pressure on  us to go."  </P> <P> The pressure, and apparently the lockout, resulted because the residents  threatened to thwart the projected sale of the building to the CRA, Tha Win, an  attorney with the law center, said late Monday.  </P> <P> Win said shelter residents first appeared in his office in mid-May, after the  VOA handed out eviction notices saying everyone had to leave by the end of the  month.  </P> <P> "They (VOA) said it was transitory housing. But I've had tenants coming in  saying they've been there more than six months, and paying rent -- $240 for  women and $480 for couples," he said.  </P> <P> Win claims such residents under state law deserve 30-day notices and relocation  assistance. But his attempts to negotiate with the VOA failed. At least 24  residents did not move.  </P> <P> Before Monday's lockout, Win said, he attended one meeting during which CRA  officials made it clear to VOA personnel that they wanted to buy only a vacant  building.  </P> <P> "That put the pressure on VOA," he said.  </P> <P> CRA spokesman Mark Littman said the redevelopment agency had been planning to  buy the five-story shelter in order to turn it over to the Skid Row Housing  Trust for renovation and eventual use as low-income apartments.  </P> <P> He added, "We hadn't opened escrow on the building because the relocation  issues weren't resolved . . . We don't have money to pay relocation."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO LAUNCH ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> State health officials today will unveil the first phase of a bold anti-smoking  advertising campaign built on the theme that smokers are being duped by  cigarette companies.  </P> <P> The $28.6-million ad campaign, part of a $220-million project funded by the  Proposition 99 cigarette tax, is expected to infuriate the tobacco industry and  provoke a counterattack.  </P> <P> The winner in the war of words could dictate U.S. smoking trends, said Dr.  Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> Several of the statewide television, radio, print and billboard ads will  address the advertising practices of the tobacco industry, which health  officials charge is targeting susceptible groups, such as youths, minorities  and women. The state's anti-smoking campaign will focus on the same groups.  </P> <P> One anti-smoking advertisement addressing young blacks will feature a song  about tobacco by the rap musician Deezer D with the lyrics: We used to pick  it/and now they want us to smoke it. The ad will appear on radio and  television, including MTV.  </P> <P> Another television spot will depict a smoke-filled office where tobacco  industry executives are discussing tactics to lure individuals to smoke,  despite the known health risks of smoking. "We're not in business for our  health," a fictitious tobacco executive says.  </P> <P> Kizer said his office is braced for a backlash from the tobacco industry. And  Monday, an industry spokesman labeled the state's campaign a "political" first  step in an attempt to ban cigarette advertising altogether.  </P> <P> Said Kizer: "There is some stuff people will be quite bothered by. I anticipate  controversy. It's the most competitive, aggressive and largest advertising  campaign both to discourage people from smoking and prevent them from getting  habituated. If the campaign is successful, it's going to hurt (cigarette  sales). And the tobacco industry is going to translate that hurt into  something."  </P> <P> The advertising and marketing segment of the two-year, anti-smoking campaign is  considered the key element in achieving the state's goal of a 75% decline in  smoking by 1999. According to Kizer, smoking is the state's leading preventable  cause of death and disease, costing Californians $7.1 billion each year in  health care and lost productivity.  </P> <P> Proposition 99, which increased the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack on Jan. 1,  1989, also includes funding for anti-smoking education in public schools and  health departments, which would focus on health risks.  </P> <P> The central theme of the advertising campaign, however, is to reverse the  seductive image of smoking created through decades of cigarette-company  advertising, Kizer said. The campaign was created by the Los Angeles  advertising firm of keye/donna/pearlstein. "The objective is to change the  image that the tobacco industry has created for smokers -- that it's sexy,  glamorous, youthful -- to it's dumb, dirty, dangerous," Kizer said. "A lot of  young people may not realize how much they're being duped. They've been sold a  bill of goods. Some of the ads are going to let them know that 1,000 people  give up smoking each day by being buried. They (youths) are being recruited to  take their place."  </P> <P> But, according to a tobacco industry spokesman, anti-smoking advertisements  that address the marketing techniques of cigarette companies would violate the  intent of Proposition 99.  </P> <P> "They pitched Prop. 99 as: 'We want to reach underaged children. We want to  educate children to the purported health effects of smoking,' " said Thomas  Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, a Washington-based industry  group. "Anything beyond that is not educational, it's political."  </P> <P> Lauria said cigarette advertisements are designed to persuade smokers to switch  brands, not to attract new smokers. He said he had not seen the state's  anti-smoking ads and that industry leaders would view the ads before deciding  whether to respond further.  </P> <P> But, he said: "These ads sound like they are trying to educate adults in terms  of a political agenda. Those attacks are trying to lay the groundwork for a  next phase of a political agenda, which is to ban advertising from cigarette  companies. These people are on a long march toward prohibition of tobacco."  </P> <P> Although most people are aware of the health risks of smoking, the tobacco  industry has been successful in selling an illusion that smoking is harmless,  said Paul Keye, who directed the campaign for keye/donna/pearlstein.  </P> <P> The anti-smoking advertisements will attempt to shatter that illusion, he said.  A full-page ad scheduled to appear Wednesday in newspapers statewide contains  the message: "First the smoke. Now the mirrors."  </P> <P> "What we really want to do is show the connection between the tobacco industry  and its advertising and promotional practices," Keye said. "This campaign goes  right at tobacco companies' predatory marketing."  </P> <P> While smoking rates have fallen 20% among adults in the last two decades, a  similar decrease has not been seen among minorities, youths or women, Kizer  said. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke,  high blood pressure, emphysema and several types of cancer.  </P> <P> In blacks, the rate of lung cancer, which is highly correlated to cigarette  smoking, is 58% higher than whites. Lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as  the leading cause of death among women.  </P> <P> The failure of anti-smoking campaigns to influence minority groups is due to  both the lack of effective education designed for those groups and a shift in  cigarette-company advertising, he said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't just de facto that the message wasn't reaching these folks. They  were targeted to think that smoking is a good thing," Kizer said.  </P> <P> To counter that advertising, anti-smoking messages must deliver images and  emotions instead of information, he said. The campaign will rely heavily on  television spots, most of which will be paid for by the state, although it is  expected that stations will donate some time for public service spots. Some ads  will be in Spanish and, possibly, an Asian language.  </P> <P> "It's clear that respectable people -- teachers or doctors -- standing in a  room reciting facts about the dangers of smoking has a modest to minimal  effect," Kizer said. "That's why I think we have to appeal to the visceral  response. The message is, 'What is cool? Who do I look up to?' "  </P> <P> The campaign will also address the dangers of smokeless tobacco and secondhand  smoking. In one television ad, a smoker seated next to a nonsmoker inhales on a  cigarette. The nonsmoker then coughs and exhales the smoke.  </P> <P> In another ad, a baby observes his parents smoking and raises his spoon to his  lips to imitate them.  </P> <P> Kizer said the campaign will be monitored for its effectiveness. While  anti-smoking television spots in the late 1960s appeared successful in reducing  smoking rates, little evidence exists to prove that such ads work, he conceded.  </P></p>

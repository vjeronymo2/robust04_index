			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Holzstoff withdraws motion to limit shares AN ALLIANCE of foreign and Swiss pension funds yesterday scored the first success against Swiss companies' restrictions on ownership of their shares. At its annual meeting in Basle, the board of Holzstoff Holding withdrew a motion that would have limited the number of registered shares which one person or group could hold to 2 per cent of the total and voting rights to 5 per cent of the total. This is the first occasion on which opposition from shareholders has prevented a Swiss company from imposing shareholding limits since Nestle, the foods group, opened its stock register to foreigners in 1988 but at the same time restricted the number of shares an investor could hold. Mr Alexander de Beer, a Zurich lawyer representing a UK pension fund, said he hoped Holzstoff's decision would serve as a signal to other companies. Earlier attempts by Swiss pension fund managers to block the imposition of limits by such companies as Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, the big chemical groups, faded. Both foreign and Swiss pension funds have built up stakes of more than 5 per cent in Holzstoff, a rapidly diversifying paper manufacturing group with substantial net assets. They would have been partially disenfranchised had the board's proposal been accepted yesterday. Informal contacts between the pension funds led to agreement to vote against the motion. The board, noting an unusually high 71 per cent of the voting stock was represented at the shareholders' meeting and having apparently got wind of the alliance, said it was withdrawing the restrictive proposal. Under the existing statutes the board has the discretion to decide which shares it will register. The board said it wanted to wait for expected amendments to Swiss corporate law and for developments in EC corporate rules before proposing new rules.</p>

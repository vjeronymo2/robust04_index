			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Permanent interest-bearing shares --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Coupon   Issue      Minimum  Price*   Yield*                                  price Stock                   (gross   (p)        (Pounds) (p)      (gross                          %)                                    %)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires     9.375   100.165    1,000    90.25    10.382 Bradford &amp; Bingley      11.625   100.129    10,000   113.50   10.242 Bradford &amp; Bingley      13       100.2      10,000   126.00   10.317 Bristol &amp; West          13.375   100.338    1,000    127.50   10.490 Britannia               13       100.423    1,000    123.75   10.505 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     11.75    100.962    50,000   116.25   10.108 Coventry                12.125   100.749    1,000    115.00   10.528 First National          11.75    100.247    10,000   102.75   11.436 Halifax                 8.75     100.615    50,000   90.00    9.722 Halifax                 12       100.28     50,000   119.75   10.021 Leeds &amp; Holbeck         13.375   100.227    1,000    127.25   10.511 Leeds Permanent         13.625   100        50,000   135.25   10.074 Newcastle               10.75    100.317    1,000    102.125  10.526 Newcastle               12.625   100.446    1,000    117.50   10.745 Northern Rock           12.625   100.135    1,000    120.00   10.521 Skipton                 12.875   100.476    1,000    121.25   10.619  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price as at midday 15 December 1994 excluding accrued interest.

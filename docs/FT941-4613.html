			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Provisions cut behind Alliance rise Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society raised pre-tax profits by 67 per cent from Pounds 123m to Pounds 205m in 1993, helped by lower provisions for bad and doubtful debts and increased income from its Girobank subsidiary. The total charge for provisions dropped from Pounds 204m to Pounds 126m, and reflected falls across all classes of lending - on residential, commercial and unsecured loans. Girobank increased its contribution to profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 75m. The group's cost/income ratio remained high, although it fell slightly from 65.6 per cent to 63.9 per cent. The impact of Girobank was evident in that the same ratio for the society alone was 44.6 per cent (47.2 per cent). A&amp;L property services, the estate agency subsidiary, cut its pre-tax loss to Pounds 5m (Pounds 8m). Mr Peter White, group chief executive, said that increased mortgage lending in the second half had taken mortgage advances for 1993 as a whole to Pounds 1.5bn, up 22 per cent. Retail savings rose by Pounds 0.5bn to Pounds 14bn, and wholesale funding fell by one percentage point to 25 per cent of shares and deposits. Total assets rose from Pounds 20.53bn to Pounds 21.09bn. Exceptional costs of Pounds 23.1m in 1993, arose mainly from redundancy payments, consultants' fees and the write off of some premises. Staff numbers fell by almost 1,000. A&amp;L, the UK's fourth largest society, is going through a strategic review, which has already led it to announce that from the beginning of May the 1.4m Girobank personal customers will be transferred to A&amp;L.</p>

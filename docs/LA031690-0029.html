			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: SPICY COOKING FROM THE DESERT FINDS WELCOME NICHE  BY THE SEA  </P> <P> There is a certain incongruity to dining on a cuisine inspired by arid New  Mexico while sitting a few hundred yards from the Pacific.  </P> <P> This is 1990 and Southern California, however, and it may be readily  understandable that Southwestern cuisine, trendy elsewhere for years if never  widely popularized in San Diego, should finally blossom like some modest desert  flower on the edge of Torrey Pines State Park.  </P> <P> The fetishes and talismans of Southwestern cooking -- ancho chilies, black  beans, tart lime as a substitute for lemon -- pop up regularly on the menu at  Torreyana Grille, the rather overwhelming but attractive dining room at the new  Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines hotel. The kitchen practices a highly stylized,  hybridized brand of cooking, but one that also is quite clever, and  exceptionally pleasing in the case of such dishes as seared lamb loin with  eggplant marmalade and Southwestern-style crab cakes.  </P> <P> It should be obvious immediately that crab cakes are not traditional in the  desert Southwest. Such minor distinctions mean absolutely nothing in  contemporary Southwestern cooking, however, because style and seasonings rather  than ingredients determine this cuisine. In the case of the crab cakes -- or  crab cake, because the dish is offered as an appetizer -- the distinguishing  marks are the chili-warmed, subtly flavorful beurre blanc that underlies the  butter-crisped patty, and the pyramids of spiced black beans arranged around  it. The treatment is a happy one for the cake, which consists of virtually  nothing but crab and is quite nicely done.  </P> <P> The presence of beurre blanc, of course, adds yet another dimension to the  cooking, in this case French. This is only natural, because French technique  has allowed the creation of any number of hybrid cuisines, many of them  qualified by the preface nouvelle. Strong Oriental overtones also find their  way onto this menu (there is an appetizer of "Southwestern spring rolls," for  example), and these fit quite well. As if all this were not enough, the kitchen  also possesses a pasta machine, of which it makes much use, although the end  results are merely starchy accents rather than anything that could be  identified as Italian. Given the culinary confusion that could result from a  union of too many styles, this is just as well.  </P> <P> The crab cake is one of several appealing starters. The stuffed shrimp turn out  to be a equivocation of that hotel dining room stand-by, shrimp cocktail, but a  playful one; five fat prawns are stuffed with herbed cheese and arranged over  twin sauces, one a fairly traditional tomato-based dip, the other suavely tart  and sparkling with lime. The Southwestern spring rolls follow the classic egg  roll format but substitute grilled chicken for the stuffing, and again are  garnished with a pair of sauces, and there is even a "grilled" soup of smoked  chicken, braised Guinea hen and vegetables in chicken broth. The Southwest is  underlined by the offering of red chili fettuccine (the chili worked directly  into the pasta dough) topped with grilled sausage, and by the gazpacho  garnished with lime-seasoned sour cream. Like nearly every restaurant in town,  Torreyana Grille offers Caesar salad, but unlike most, it makes a good one.  </P> <P> The entree list is split between grilled foods, all priced at $16.95, and a  higher-priced but more interesting selection mentioned as "signature items."  This is a neat resolution to the problem always faced by hotel dining rooms  that wish to attract a local clientele; the grilled choices include all the  standards that hotels must offer, such as lamb chops, steaks, chicken and fish,  while the "signature" dishes allow the kitchen to range more widely.  </P> <P> The grills are, however, prepared in the style of the menu, and the choice  includes such things as ahi with papaya salsa, swordfish in ancho chili butter,  chicken breast with tomato vinaigrette and lamb chops in smoked tomato sauce.  </P> <P> The kitchen gives some thought to the "signature" dishes, and these sometimes  are startlingly good. The pan-seared lamb loin, served as several slices over a  bed of chopped, highly seasoned eggplant, was exquisite, both for the buttery  texture of the meat and for the marvelous, highly professional brown sauce  given a tantalizing edge by the addition of fresh tarragon. The squat, squishy  "muffin" of buckwheat and pureed chanterelles that served as a most unusual  garnish was an interesting idea, but one whose time has not yet come.  </P> <P> The evening's special, a teaming of grilled scallops and shrimp with rice  noodles in a sharp soy vinaigrette, was a brilliant evocation of Oriental style  tailored to suit Western tastes. Black sesame seeds added a pungent undertone,  but it was the sweetly vinegary dressing that really brought the dish together,  and if the noodles starred, the shellfish were cautiously cooked and quite  good.  </P> <P> Other choices here include a combination of avocado and grilled lobster over  black bean pasta, and pesto-basted guinea hen over roasted garlic linguine. But  the most ambitious may be the "California" bouillabaisse, which is ladled from  an elaborate, fish-shaped tureen over a bed of barley-sized pasta flavored with  saffron. While ambitious, the dish also was perfunctory; the guest who ordered  this grumbled that the melange of lobster, shrimp, scallops and fish in broth  "lacked the fire and imagination of the first courses." Luxurious in its  ingredients, it was rather timidly seasoned, and might have been happier as a  soup than served over pasta. Table settings include bottles of herb-and-garlic  infused olive oil, which servers pour out into small dishes and offer as a dip  when they serve the good, house-baked breads. This is another of Torreyana's  attempts at establishing a distinctive style, and if it seems just a touch  put-on, it is pleasant enough.  </P> <P> The kitchen also bakes a good selection of pastries, including a mixed fruit  tart that can seem rather soothing after the strongly seasoned entrees, and a  chocolate pecan tart that rises a notch or two above the average.  </P> <P> The decor matches the menu in its aggression. All the elements are strong;  there is much marble, trimmed here and there with rich woods, and highly  polished copper tiles add a brassy note. Because hard surfaces reflect voices,  the place can be noisy when only moderately populated. Oddly enough, tables are  set well away from the broad windows, and while everyone knows that you can't  see the ocean at night, it would seem that guests at breakfast and lunch might  appreciate getting a crack at the hotel's terrific view.  </P> <P> TORREYANA GRILLE  </P> <P> Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines  </P> <P> 10950 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla  </P> <P> 558-1500  </P> <P> Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $50 to $100.  </P></p>

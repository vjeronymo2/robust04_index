			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 19, IRNA -- The London office of the  Persian daily ETTELA'AT announced Thursday that it had  successfully issued its special international edition in New  York for the first time this week.    The international edition was launched initially in London  two months ago as a weekly to cater for the Iranian community in  the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Its 12-page format includes a  section in English and was said to have proved very popular.    The paper is edited in Tehran and beamed for publication by  satellite to London as well as New York, which will assist the  speed of publication throughout America.    Plans were said by ETTELA'AT to be well advanced for a  special daily international edition, which could start as early  as next week and like the weekly version, will differ in content  to the Persian afternoon edition available in Tehran.    The London office spoke favorably about the successful  launch  of Iran's first newspaper to be printed abroad since the Islamic  revolution, which is available from newsagents, Iranian shops or  through subscription.</p>

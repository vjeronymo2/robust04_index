			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOT INTERVIEW: The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, above, the Anaheim-based crusader for  "traditional values" and a well-known foe of gay rights measures, is the  subject of a major piece in Los Angeles magazine. . . . In the article,  entitled "Son of Falwell," Sheldon says he wants to create "a movement, not an  organization" and asserts that "I am the inspiration and prophet" of that  movement. . . . Much space is devoted to Sheldon's personal sexual experiences,  including at least two approaches by homosexuals. . . . Sheldon said he was  shocked by the way the piece was edited, calling it "a poor attempt to distort  my values and beliefs. The true Rev. Lou Sheldon did not come forth in that  article."

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: Consultant Pat Oh dear. The hot favourite to become director of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research has dropped out of the race. Patricia Hewitt, the IPPR's telegenic deputy director, has decided to follow in the footsteps of Margaret Hodge, the ex-Labour leader of Islington, and become a management consultant. Hewitt, 45, is off to be head of research at Andersen Consulting, the UK arm of the world's largest consultants. Her experience as general secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties and policy co-ordinator for Neil Kinnock will now be deployed on behalf of Andersen's capitalist clients such as Barclays Bank and BP. That leaves the IPPR without a director or deputy director at a time when the left's electoral chances look better than ever. Whoever gets the job could expect to fill Sarah Hogg's seat, as head of the Prime Minister's powerful policy unit, if Labour won the next election.</p>

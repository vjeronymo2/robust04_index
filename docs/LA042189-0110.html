			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> James B. Wyngaarden, who has been director of the National Institutes of Health  since 1982, called an unusual meeting of institute directors and senior  officials to tell them that he will resign at the beginning of July, the  Washington Post reported. The NIH, the world's largest biomedical research  establishment, will dispense more than $6.7 billion in funds during the 1990  fiscal year. The departure of Wyngaarden, 64, has been rumored for months.  Wyngaarden came to the NIH from Duke University Medical School, where he was  chairman of the department of medicine.  </P></p>

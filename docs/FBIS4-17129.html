			<p>BFN     [Text] A communique on Tajik refugees was signed in Moscow  on Tuesday during the first round of talks between  representatives of Dushanbe and Tajik opposition, INTERFAX  learned from one of the members of the opposition delegation.    The communique envisages the registration of all Tajik  refugees who are currently outside their homeland. After the  registration the UN should start giving them aid on a regular  basis. So far, according to one of the Tajik opposition leaders  Akbar Turadzhonzod, the aid was granted to only one camp of  22,000 people in Afghanistan.    The inter-Tajik talks will continue in Islamabad (Pakistan)  and Teheran (Iran) in a month, the personal representative of  the UN General Secretary for Tajikistan Ramiro Piriz Ballon said  at a press conference. He also noted the constructive role  played by Moscow in the inter-Tajik settlement. Answering  questions by journalists, Ballon said that he sees no  contradiction in the fact that Russia has geopolitical interests  in Tajikistan.    INTERFAX learned that late on 19 April the Tajik Government  delegation is to return to Dushanbe.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE FUELS RAIDERS PAST BEARS, 20-3  </P> <P> After floundering during a 16-14 exhibition victory over the Dallas Cowboys  last weekend, the Raiders took a step forward, beating the Chicago Bears, 20-3,  Friday night before 58,285 at Soldier Field.  </P> <P> "We took a lot of heat from everybody last week," quarterback Jay Schroeder  said. "But we did a great job bouncing back tonight."  </P> <P> But Coach Art Shell is still concerned about the Raider offense, which has  produced only two touchdowns that weren't set up by the defense in four games.  </P> <P> "I feel better than I did last week," Shell said. "But we still have a lot of  work to do."  </P> <P> The Raider offense scored only one touchdown against the Bears, with the  defense setting up another touchdown with a fumble recovery. Jeff Jaeger, who  has made nine of 10 field goal attempts this exhibition season, was successful  from 46 and 31 yards after drives stalled.  </P> <P> Jaeger's first field goal would have been unnecessary if wide receiver Willie  Gault hadn't dropped a touchdown pass on the Raiders' first play of the game.  </P> <P> After racing past cornerback Vestee Johnson, Gault had to turn to catch  Schroeder's pass, but the ball sailed through his outstretched hands.  </P> <P> "I misplayed the ball," Gault said. "I thought I had it in the right position,  but by the time I looked up it was going away. I've been in this league eight  years, and I've never dropped a pass."  </P> <P> Was Shell disappointed with Gault?  </P> <P> "I'm not disappointed, those things are going to happen," Shell said. "Like I  told him after he dropped it, I said, 'Hey, you're going to get another  chance.' "  </P> <P> With the score 3-3, Gault gave the Raiders a 10-3 lead when he caught a 26-yard  touchdown pass from Schroeder with 1:33 remaining in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Gault sprinted past defensive back Donnell Woolford, reversed his field on a  crossing pattern and caught Schroeder's pass in the corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> Although that was the only touchdown the offense produced, it was all the  Raiders needed. Their defense gave up only a 41-yard field goal by Kevin  Butler.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well tonight," Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said. "There's no  reason for it."  </P> <P> The Raiders harassed quarterback Mike Tomczak, sacking him four times for 43  yards in the first half. Defensive end Greg Townsend, playing his first game  after ending a month-long holdout last Monday, had a sack and linebacker Aaron  Wallace, the Raiders' No. 2 draft pick, had three sacks for 34 yards.  </P> <P> "He had as many sacks tonight as I've had in a season," Raider nose guard Bob  Golic said of Wallace. "He's right on course for breaking my career record."  </P> <P> Defensive end Lyle Alzado, making a comeback after a five-year retirement,  played for the first time this summer. Alzado, who underwent arthroscopic  surgery on his right knee three weeks ago, intercepted a pass by Bear  quarterback Jim Harbaugh in the fourth quarter, but the play was nullified  because Alzado had jumped offsides.  </P> <P> "I had my eyes closed," Alzado said. "Let's be honest. I didn't intercept it,  he just threw it to me."  </P> <P> With the Raiders cutting to 60 players next week, does Alzado think he will  survive?  </P> <P> "It's up to them." Alzado said. "I'm not worrying about it. Everybody saw that  I can still play with the best of them."  </P> <P> Can Alzado, 41, still perform well enough to play in the NFL?  </P> <P> "I'm still capable, and whoever wants to deny it can look at the films  tonight," Alzado said. "Besides that, how many 41-year-old men have a body like  this?"  </P> <P> With that, Alzado struck a bodybuilder-like pose.  </P> <P> With the Raiders leading, 10-3, after Gault's touchdown catch, quarterback  Vince Evans replaced Schroeder in the second half and directed the Raiders to a  field goal and a touchdown that was set up by linebacker Darin Jordan's fumble  recovery at the Bear 37.  </P> <P> Evans, trying to earn the Raider backup job, put together a six-play drive  after Jordan's fumble recovery, scrambling away from the Bear defense and  hitting wide receiver Sam Graddy with a 14-yard pass to give the Raiders a  first down at the nine. After Evans threw a four-yard pass to wide receiver  Jamie Holland, fullback Steve Smith got the touchdown on a five-yard run.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Former USC defensive back Mark Carrier, the Bears' No. 1 draft pick, played  well in his first start at free safety. Carrier made a big hit on running back  Kerry Porter to knock a pass loose. . . . Bear defensive tackle William Perry  suffered a sprained right ankle. . . . The Raiders will finish their exhibition  season next Saturday when they play the San Diego Chargers at the Coliseum at 1  p.m.  </P></p>

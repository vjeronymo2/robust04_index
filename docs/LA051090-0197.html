			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL BUYS TIME IN MOBILE HOME FLAP  </P> <P> Temporarily sidestepping the controversial issue of rent control for mobile  home parks, the Laguna Beach City Council is supporting a one-year plan that  would freeze rents for low-income senior citizens while allowing a 7% maximum  rent increase for other park residents.  </P> <P> The plan was initially proposed by the owners of Treasure Island Mobile Home  Park, but the City Council voted unanimously to encourage the other two parks  in the city to accept it.  </P> <P> If the agreement can be reached before the June 5 council meeting, city  officials will use the next year to develop a long-term plan for Laguna Beach's  mobile home parks.  </P> <P> During that year, the Planning Commission will consider specific mobile home  park issues, such as whether mobile home owners should have the first  opportunity to buy their parks if they go on the market and whether the city  should have a relocation plan for residents if a park is sold.  </P> <P> "Tonight's issue is not an issue of rent control for me," Councilman Robert F.  Gentry said Tuesday. "It's an issue of neighborhood preservation."  </P> <P> Others, however, said it is unreasonable for residents to expect special  protection.  </P> <P> "If you can't afford where you're living, you should find a place where you can  afford," said Laguna Beach resident Debra Wright.  </P> <P> The issue of rent control for the 435 mobile home park spaces in Laguna Beach  was raised largely as a result of a continuing dispute between Treasure Island  Mobile Home Park and the park's new owners.  </P> <P> The 27-acre oceanfront park was purchased for $40 million last August by  Merrill Lynch Hubbard and Costa Mesa businessman Richard Hall, who expect to  eventually close the park to make way for other development. Residents would  like to someday buy the land and maintain it as a mobile home park.  </P> <P> If the interim measure approved Tuesday night is agreed upon, park owners who  have no other tenant-lease agreement in place could then boost rents by 7%,  excluding low-income seniors.  </P> <P> In the interim, the City Council extended a rent freeze placed on mobile home  parks in December through June 5. If an agreement is not reached by then, the  item will be back on the council agenda for discussion. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

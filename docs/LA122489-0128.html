			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SEX EDUCATION: A REASONED VIEW'  </P> <P> I disagree with The Times editorial titled "Sex Education: A Reasoned View"  (Dec. 15), which found the recently passed class-visitation policy of the  Newport/Mesa School District "correct" and "reasonable."  </P> <P> By insisting on three-day advance written notice for a parent to visit his or  her child's class (and even though the wording does allow for unspecified  exceptions), I think the school board is sending the wrong message to the  community. All around the nation parents are asking that their schools be more  accessible and more accountable. This new policy, far more restrictive than  that of any neighboring school district, suggests there is something our  schools want to hide.  </P> <P> In taking this position I do not mean to condone the continued activities of  the Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE). I do  believe, however, that it should be acknowledged that they were the ones who  focused public attention on the school board's lack of specific guidelines for  the teaching of sex education. And indeed it was discovered that some topics  were being taught that reasonable people would agree are not in the  need-to-know category. However, these discoveries do not grant the CREATE group  license to continue to put teachers on the defensive, or to press a further  agenda.  </P> <P> Specific guidelines have now been adopted by the board, albeit belatedly, with  opportunity for the full spectrum of parental input. The trust of supportive  parents must now be placed on school administrators to monitor curriculum and  classrooms to ensure that those guidelines will be followed. If they're not,  the next opportunity for recourse will be election 1991.  </P> <P> KAREN EVARTS  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claus Reitan: "The Latest Poll: 41 Percent of </F> Austrians Still Undecided About Vote"]    [Excerpt] "This referendum will be the most thrilling race  for votes that we have witnessed in the past few years. It  might just lead to downright anxiety of the government. A  forecast is hardly possible three weeks before voting day,"  Professor Fritz Karmasin, who is regarded as a serious opinion  researcher, says in summarizing the views of the nation based on  a representative poll carried out on a particularly large scale  (2,000 personal interviews).    At first glance, however, the race seems to be clearly  decided. In informal interviews in the middle of May, 50 percent  of all interviewed Austrians voted "for Europe" and were fully  convinced they would vote "yes." In the latest --  representative -- Gallup poll, only 38 percent say "no." At  present, only 13 percent of Austrians say officially that they  do not yet know how they will vote.    In an additional wave of interviews, however, Gallup  analyzed  in detail the certainty of Austrians about the vote. And what  do you know? Suddenly, only 57 percent of Austrians have firmly  decided on how they will vote on 12 June. Literally to the very  last minute, the decision of 41 percent is open -- which is  indicated in plain language:    -- At present, only 32 percent of the total population will  "certainly" vote yes.    -- They are facing 25 percent who are firmly determined to  say no.    -- Between them, the government and the opposition have to  struggle for 41 percent who are more or less undecided (plus 2  percent of the people who refused to give an answer). In  absolute figures: 2.3 million of 5.6 million people entitled to  vote still have to be convinced. Particularly noteworthy is  that almost two-thirds of the undecided -- 27 percent of the  total population --want to decide "on the vote at the last  moment." [passage omitted]</p>

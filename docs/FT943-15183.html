			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Credit plan will push pay down Sir, John Willman highlights the increasing trend towards the use of Family Credit to top up the incomes of those willing to accept low-paid employment ('Search for a way to stay afloat', July 8). The Treasury is considering spending Pounds 1bn to extend the benefit, currently payable only to families with children, to single people and childless couples. In fact the cost would tend to be rather more than this over time. Employers who found that the link between pay levels and the net incomes of many of their staff had been broken would have every incentive to reduce pay still further, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill. Many companies already see Family Credit as an explicit government subsidy: if a profit margin can be guaranteed because staff are working for state-subsidised wages, what incentive is there to take risks or invest in training or better techniques of production? The overall efficiency and competitiveness of the economy is likely to suffer. Family Credit may be a lifeline for many families trying to make ends meet on a low wage, but it increases their benefit dependency, placing them firmly in the sort of poverty trap which Chris Tighe describes in the accompanying article ('Life at the sharp end'). As wages rise (or taxes are reduced) benefit entitlement declines, leaving wage-earners little better off, and with little incentive to earn more through their own efforts. In his speech to Tuesday's Trades Union Congress conference, Confederation of British Industry director-general, Howard Davies, warned that 'the rapid growth in earnings dispersion is emerging as a more serious social and economic problem than is yet appreciated by most politicians'. The encouragement of low-paid employment through an extension of Family Credit will serve only to increase that problem. Why a policy of state subsidies to companies, which increases benefit dependency and the burden on the taxpayer while depriving large sections of the workforce of economic incentives should appeal to a government committed to free-market economics remains a puzzle.

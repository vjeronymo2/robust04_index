			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Fifth arrest in Maxwell SFO probe POLICE yesterday arrested and charged a fifth man in connection with the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the collapse of the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Albert Fuller, the former group treasurer of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud Credit Suisse bank. The charge against Mr Fuller also names Mr Robert Maxwell himself - the first time the late publishing tycoon has appeared on the indictment set to go before a jury. The charge alleges that, along with Mr Robert Maxwell, his son Mr Kevin Maxwell, former adviser Mr Larry Trachtenberg, and Mr Robert Bunn, a finance director with MCC, Mr Fuller conspired to defraud Credit Suisse by making dishonest and false representations in share transactions. The false representations were allegedly made about shares given to Credit Suisse as security for loans or advances made to the Robert Maxwell group (formerly known as the Mirror Group plc). The Robert Maxwell group is alleged to have claimed that the full beneficial ownership of the shares lay either with itself or with a wholly owned subsidiary. Although their names appear on this charge, Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn have not at this stage been charged with any offence relating to Credit Suisse. Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Trachtenberg have both been charged with a number of theft and conspiracy charges involving Pounds 135m. Mr Ian Maxwell, another of the late publisher's sons, and Mr Bunn both face single charges of conspiracy to defraud. However, in a previous case involving Mr Trachtenberg, SFO lawyers stated that, in his case, the charges against him are only sample ones and that more are likely to be brought in the future. Mr Fuller was arrested and charged at Snow Hill police station in the City by arrangement with the City of London fraud squad. He was released on bail to appear at City of London magistrates court tomorrow. As head of Maxwell Communication Corporation's treasury operation, Mr Fuller occupied a senior position within the company, but was not on its board of directors. It is expected that the trials of the five men will begin in the first half of next year, although no date has yet been fixed.</p>

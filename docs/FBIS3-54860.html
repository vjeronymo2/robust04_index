			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 4 Jan -- In an appeal to the citizens of  Ukraine, the Interior Ministry of the republic has called for a  decisive fight against corruption, speculation, bribery, and the  squandering of national property to be carried out on a broad  front with the help of the population.    Foodstuffs, industrial goods, and essential raw materials,  the document stresses, are being taken out of the country in  various ways. The existing transparent borders, the lack of  respect for laws, and the desire of some enterprises, commercial  organizations, and individual citizens to get rich in this way  are to a certain extent helping to make the situation  significantly more acute. A criminal group that was trying to  take 30 metric tons of nickel into Poland worth a total of  $113,000 dollars was recently discovered by employees of  interior affairs bodies.    Over the last two years, more than 40,000 attempts to  smuggle  out of Ukraine goods worth 1 trillion karbovantsi have been  foiled by the military. More than 5,000 metric tons of grain,  almost 12,000 metric tons of sugar, more than 1,000 metric tons  of vegetable oil, and 3,000 metric tons of non-ferrous and rare  earth metals have been returned to the state.    In connection with this, the Supreme Council and government  have recently adopted several legislative acts for stabilizing  the economic situation in the republic and defending its  consumer market. The interior affairs bodies are relying on the  understanding and support of the population for implementing  these measures.    Ukraine's Interior Ministry, the appeal stresses, along with  the security bodies, border guards, and customs officials will  do all they can in the future to make sure the border is firmly  closed and to protect the consumer market in a reliable fashion.</p>

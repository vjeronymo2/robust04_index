			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The United States has called  on Japan to stop bank remittances and cash gifts from Korean  residents of Japan to North Korea because of Pyongyang's  suspected nuclear development program, a top Japanese diplomat  said Wednesday [8 Jun].    Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's  Foreign Policy Bureau, quoted U.S. Government officials as  saying that there are strong demands in Congress and mass media  for Japan to halt cash remittances.    Yanai made the statement at the day's session of the House  of  Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. He represented Japan  at weekend trilateral talks in Washington with Robert Gallucci,  U.S. assistant secretary of state, and Kim Sam-hoon, South  Korean special envoy for the nuclear issue.    The Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimated  the aggregate annual amount of cash flow between Japan and North  Korea, including two-way trade and investment, at 180 to 200  billion yen.    Yanai also quoted Gallucci as saying the U.S. will urge  China  to stop exports of oil to North Korea, which reportedly depends  on China for 60 percent of its oil imports and 75 percent of its  food imports.    Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials told a team of the no.  1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on  Wednesday that Japan has expressed its willingness to comply  with the U.S. call to stop cash remittances to North Korea, LDP  officials said.    Yanai and other diplomats told the team headed by LDP Policy  Affairs Research Council Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto that it is  possible to regulate cash gifts to relatives from Korean  residents of Japan traveling to North Korea by sea and air, the  officials said.    Japan need only take "legal measures" to put a ceiling on  the  sum of money Korean travelers are legally allowed to take out of  Japan to North Korea, Yanai was quoted as saying.    A ministry official said, "some rationale is needed to hold  down the maximum sum of money a traveler would be allowed to  take to a specific country."    Ministry officials also said it is legally possible to ban  the entry of North Korean diplomats to Japan as part of a  package of sanctions.    However, they said the maximum curb Japan could impose on  limiting the travel and reentry of Korean residents of Japan  between Japan and North Korea is a nonbinding "recommendation  for them not to travel to North Korea."    "It is impossible to ban the travel of ordinary citizens in  view of international laws and the U.N. Convention on Human  Rights," a ministry official was quoted as saying.    The official also told the LDP team that he believes the  U.S.  would not be able to slap multilateral sanctions with Japan and  South Korea "without awaiting the issuance of a UN Security  Council resolution."    In a related development, a government source expressed  distrust in North Korea's handling of its people.    "North Korea spends most of its national income on military  expenditure," he said, and added that the country's common sense  is beyond comprehension for Japanese people.    "A dictatorship tends to create tension among foreign  countries and tries to impose order domestically while keeping  its people hungry," he said.</p>

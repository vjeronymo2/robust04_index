			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Take a risk on sterling Sir, The UK chancellor's protestations, the Bank of England's intervention in the market and the government's latest heavy borrowing of foreign currency all seem unable to achieve the object of raising sterling from its ERM limit or just above it. Why does the chancellor not reduce the base rate by, say, 2 percentage points? Such a dramatic move might immediately bring sterling straight down to its ERM limit, but the government is in any case committed to defending it at that level. On the positive side a drop in the base rate (and it would have to be of the order I have indicated) should revive the UK economy (it is so depressed that the danger of inflation seems minimal); encourage the purchase by foreigners of British equities (and thus the purchase of sterling); generally renew confidence in the UK and its currency; reduce the cost of UK government borrowing; and perhaps encourage the Bundesbank to consider reducing its rates. This may seem a risky solution, but the conventional ones do not seem to be working. Rowan M L Marsh, rue de Moillebeau 52, 1209 Geneva, Switzerland</p>

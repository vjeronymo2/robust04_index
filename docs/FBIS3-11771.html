			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Mar (EFE) -- The Cuban Government  approved a law whereby stiff fines, ranging from 500 to 1,500  pesos (the same amount in dollars at the official exchange rate)  will be imposed on persons authorized for self-employment who  violate official regulations.    More than 141,000 persons, 4 percent of the 3.5 million  Cuban  workers, currently work independently on the island, protected  by a law that was approved in September and increased to 136 the  number of self-employment categories.    The new law, announced on Sunday, establishes a fine of  1,500  pesos for persons who engage in an activity that is not legally  authorized, and 1,200 pesos for persons who do not have a  certificate that accredits them as independent workers. A  Cuban's average salary is approximately 150 pesos per month. A  1,200-pesos fine will be imposed on persons acting as  intermediaries to provide services or sponsor the sale of  products manufactured by a self- employed person, whether  legally authorized or not.    Likewise, Cubans who take advantage of the market conditions  to sell or offer services at clearly exorbitant prices can also  be sanctioned by the law.    Also, a fine of 600 pesos will be imposed on persons who  violate health regulations; and a 1,200-pesos fine to whoever  "hides, denies, or forges information that is officially  requested by the appropriate authorities, or whoever  intentionally obstructs the authorities' actions.    According to statistics from the Labor Research Institute,  more than 141,000 Cubans are self-employed, including  electricians, masons, carpenters, photographers, electric  appliance repairmen, masseurs, and craftsmen. Persons who want  to work independently must obtain a permit from the State Labor  and Social Security Committee, and are required to pay a tax to  the State Finance Committee, based on the type of activity they  carry out. In order to obtain self-employment authorization, a  person has to be retired, a housewife, or be registered under  the subsidy system due to a reorganization or paralysis of  activities. Professionals in active service and directorate  board members are excluded.    Cuban economic authorities have affirmed on more than one  occasion that self-employment is necessary given the lack of  full-time jobs and the state's inability to provide certain  services. Since the authorization of self-employment jobs  increased, handicraft street vendors, bicycle parking  attendants, and automobile washers, and other articles have  proliferated throughout the island. In most cases they offer  their services and products in dollars.</p>

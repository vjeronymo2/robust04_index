			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Yalovenko, chief of the Chelyabinsk Oblast </F> Regional Organization of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia  and member of the Central Committee of the Liberal-Democratic  Party of Russia, under the rubric "Point of View": "Elections,  After All!"]    [Text] The Regulations on Elections in Chelyabinsk Oblast  have been confirmed by a decree of the head of the oblast  administration. Its main principles differ considerably from the  proposals that were developed by a working group under  representative of the president V.V. Seleznev consisting of the  activists of various parties and movements.    The regulations are being vigorously discussed in the local  newspaper. An interview with deputy head of the Oblast  Administration B.A. Mizrakhi has been published in which he  tried to justify individual provisions of the regulations. Notes  have been published in which the author scares readers with the  strength and cohesion of opposition parties before the election  to the oblast duma.    All this was preceded by a heated debate and discussions  among the representatives of various parties and movements  concerning development of the draft regulations on the duma  itself. Surprisingly, parties that are absolutely different in  terms of their directions found a common language in developing  the regulations; mutually satisfactory compromises were found.  Parties with a democratic orientation also took part in this:  There were representatives of the RDDR [Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms] and the Republican Party. B.A. Mizrakhi also  participated. Strangely, following attacks against him, B.A.  Mizrakhi by way of justifying himself made the quite strange  assertion that proposals for the Regulations on Elections had  been developed mainly by the representatives of communist and  national-patriotic parties and movements.    The very process of the development of proposals for the  Regulations on Elections exemplified the fact that the parties  can cooperate fruitfully in the oblast duma. Thus, the LDPR  [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] proposed to insert  restrictive requirements for candidates for oblast duma deputy  into the Regulations on Elections in terms of age (no younger  than 30), educational standard (higher education), specific  activities (mostly economists, lawyers, economic managers), and  residence (residing in the oblast for no less than five years).  Although these requirements were not adopted, the LDPR did agree  to compromise proposals that were worked out jointly.    It is sad that the oblast administration was not aware or  did  not wish to be aware of this effort of the parties and movements  and did not take into account the jointly developed proposals.    It is now becoming clear that the executive authorities  cannot and do not want to yield to the representative  authorities. The main principles of the Regulations on Elections  confirmed by the oblast administration facilitate this.    First of all, nomination of candidates by party lists is  omitted, and only the majority system is used. So, what is  happening: They used to talk about the development of a  multiparty system all the time, but after receiving the results  of elections by party lists on 12 December 1993, which they (but  not everyone else) found strange, they began to talk about  parties and movements being underdeveloped here, about their not  reflecting the interests of the population. Of course, it might  be that the parties with a democratic orientation are weak in  our oblast. However, that the parties of an opposition variety  are gaining strength is a real fact which neither the  administration nor the press rejects. To our mind, this was the  only reason for using solely the majority system in the  forthcoming elections to the oblast duma.    Second, there is the numerical strength of the  representative  organ. In his interview B.A. Mizrakhi gives examples of the  numerical strength of the dumas in various oblasts of Russia  while failing to mention the oblasts in which the numerical  strength of the duma has been confirmed to be 50 deputies;  meanwhile, about one-half of the oblasts are that way. The  design in this instance is also clear: The small numerical  strength of the duma gives the administration an opportunity to  manage it, to make it a "puppet" duma. It is clear to all that  the smaller numerical strength of the duma means taking a small  number of opinions into account, frequently failing to get a  quorum, and having a poor connection between the duma and all  strata of the population. After all, even in Tsarist Russia,  proportionate numbers of representatives from various social  strata--the merchants, the nobility, the craftsmen, the  Cossacks, and so on--were elected to the Chelyabinsk Duma.    Third, there is the introduction of very stringent  requirements for the collection of signatures in favor of  nominating a candidate. After all, 4 percent of the total number  of voters in the district translates into a number upward of  7,000 signatures. It sufficed to collect 5,000 signatures for  nomination even in the election to the State Duma. Of course, it  is good for the oblast administration to believe that the traits  of a candidate for the oblast duma should be superior to those  of our candidates to the State Duma; however, common sense seems  to be absent in this instance. After all, collecting this number  of signatures will prevent the participation of many  knowledgeable, sensible specialists in the election to the  oblast duma who are not associated with the executive  authorities or parties and movements because the collection of  signatures calls for a great organizational effort and  considerable financial outlays. It would be interesting to learn  what financial outlays are required for this purpose if the  press printed the financial reports of contenders for deputy  positions in the 12 December 1993 election. Besides, the  employees of personnel departments and housing maintenance  offices could tell a lot about the collection of signatures in  favor of individual candidates for deputies and blocs of parties  and movements. It is clear that either candidates with ties to  the administration or those abusing their official position in  the process will have the advantage.    The existence of these "strange" shortcomings in the  Regulations on Elections was also noted by our State Duma  deputies at a meeting with the TV viewers of the oblast.    It is now possible to discuss the shortcomings or virtues of  the Regulations on Elections. However, they have been approved  and have the force of a local law from which we should proceed.  Given that compliance with the law is one of the main principles  of the LDPR, the Chelyabinsk Regional Organization of the LDPR  will strictly proceed from the approved Regulations on  Elections, all their shortcomings notwithstanding.    With cooperation from the leading specialists of the oblast,  the activists of our LDPR organization have completed the  development of an election program of the party for activities  in the oblast duma. We expect to make it available for  publication in the press shortly.    Our aspiration to have a greater number of LDPR members  working in the oblast duma is natural. At present the party has  at its disposal in Chelyabinsk Oblast skilled economists and  lawyers, economic managers and workers, clerical employees, and  also representatives of the creative arts intelligentsia, that  is, an active contingent that can accomplish a lot in these  difficult times in the oblast.    Spring is coming, and the time of renewal in nature along  with it. We would very much like this to be also springtime in  politics, economics, and the social sphere, so that renewal will  affect every one of us, so that everyone will perceive the  measure of his responsibility for the future and for Russia.</p>

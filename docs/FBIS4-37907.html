			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 24 Jun (MENA)--The Interior Ministry's  official spokesman has stressed that there are no conditions for  releasing repentant terrorists because there are no conditions  attached to the security safeguards. Detainees are released  after changing their deviated ideas, and after being closely  observed.    In statements made today following the release of 22  repentant extremists, the spokesman said that meetings and  debates are being held with them in the presence of al-Azhar  scholars and then they are secretly monitored after their  release. He added that the Interior Ministry solves the  extremists' financial or moral problems with the other executive  groups through the Interior Ministry's "post-release care"  program.    He stressed that the intellectual combating of terrorism is  a  unique and new experience that many societies before us have  followed and it is constantly being developed in light of the  new security changes.    The official spokesman went on to say that whenever a number  of prisoners repent, they are then released; but stressed that  this does not mean that the Interior Ministry has huge numbers  of prisoners to whom the emergency laws are applied, adding that  the majority of those in prisons are held for crimes they  committed.    He said that the remaining extremists who declare their  repentance will be released during the next four months. He  added: We regard the extremist as a sick person and we try to  treat him by arresting him therefore discontinuing his  activities and restraining him. The law will be applied to  anyone who commits a crime or abets it.    Regarding repentant Hasan al-Hillawi who played a major role  in making the terrorist groups' members repent, the spokesman  said that the ministry is studying the possibility of reducing  his seven-year prison sentence.    Reviewing the Interior Ministry's security strategy of  dealing with terrorism and extremism, the spokesman said that  there is a short-term plan that involves upgrading the Interior  Ministry's facilities and equipment, by training policemen, and  modernizing transport and communications. He noted that there  is a medium-term strategy that the Interior Ministry is  currently implementing and is based on involving all executive  and popular organs in confronting the causes of extremism. He  added that among the organs that have already started their  action are the Education Ministry, the Youth Organization, and  the Awqaf Ministry. He noted that there is a long-term strategy  that involves developing all the facilities that serve the  people, such as the police stations and centers, the passport  and civil records departments, and the traffic department.

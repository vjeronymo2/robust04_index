			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The issue of Russia's joining  the "G-7" economic programme may be raised after the summit  meeting in Naples, but is not on the current agenda, according  to presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov.    President Boris Yeltsin "is satisfied in principle" with the  formula which envisages his fully-fledged participation in the  political discussions at the G-7 summit in Naples, Kostikov told  reporters on Thursday.    As far as the economic part of the discussion is concerned,  "Russia is not raising the issue about fully-fledged  participation in (what would be a) G-8", he stressed and added  that there should be no haste in the issue.    "However, it is not ruled out that at the next after Naples  meeting the issue of a full-scale Russian participation in the  economic programme of the Big Seven would be raised", he said.    He also stressed that Boris Yeltsin is preparing for the  Naples summit and details will be discussed during his talks  with the French and British foreign ministers.</p>

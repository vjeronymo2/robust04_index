			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Israel worries about future pressure MR Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's deputy prime minister, said yesterday Israel would reject a US ultimatum linking the provision of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan guarantees to a halt on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. He warned that if the Jewish state accepted this ultimatum, it would find itself under pressure to succumb to further American demands in the future. 'Any government - I hope a responsible government, and Israel is one - will draw a line and say no. Don't pile on pressure when it comes to human consideration. We will stand and we will not adopt this draconian choice between land and people,' Mr Netanyahu told reporters in the first official reaction to the ultimatum to come out of prime minister Yitzhak Shamir's office. Mr Shamir himself remained silent. Ever since it became clear Washington would issue the ultimatum, some Israeli politicians have said the US may be using the loan guarantees in order to bring down Mr Shamir's hard-line government. It is widely believed the Americans would prefer the more dovish Labour party, which favours a significant slowdown if not a complete halt to settlement activities, to emerge victorious in the June elections. Explaining why Israel could not accept the US conditions, Mr Netanyahu said: 'What do we have next? Pressure on relinquishing East Jerusalem? Pressure on absorbing or receiving in Israel millions of Arab refugees?' Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, has let it be known that his ministry is formulating contingency plans for raising money to absorb Soviet Jews, should the loan guarantee request be rejected. Ministry officials say these plans include a rapid acceleration of the country's privatisation programme and an appeal for aid from world Jewry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 June (MTI) -- The Presidium and the  parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) held  a five-hour joint session on Wednesday [15 June] evening.  Topics discussed included how the former ruling party should  prepare for its four-year opposition role, party spokesman  Karoly Herenyi said at a press conference in Budapest on  Thursday [16 June].    Among the tasks considered the most important by the MDF are  to protect the Constitution and law, to preserve the  achievements of the last four years, to safeguard human freedom  rights and private property, and to enforce freedom of the press  at least to the extent that characterized the last four years.  According to the two bodies, the press can be both a brake and  a guarantee against the future two-thirds coalition majority.    The participants set down as a basic principle that the MDF  would like to receive at least 10 percent of the places in the  newly formed parliamentary committees, but would consider it  ideal if it could enjoy the same conditions as the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) did in the previous cycle, in other  words, that it receive greater representation than its numeric  proportion, and have a representative in all parliamentary  committees.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hartwell takes Trimoco after share buy HARTWELL, the Saudi-Arabian controlled motor group, yesterday won control of Trimoco, another motor trader. Its target capitulated after another 5 per cent of the shares were sold to Hartwell, taking its stake to 46.5 per cent. The cash offer, increased this week to 20p a share, values Trimoco at Pounds 29.6m. The towel was thrown in with some reluctance. Trimoco said it continued to believe that the offer undervalued the group and its prospects. Its recommendation, following the increase in Hartwell's stake, aimed to clear up any uncertainty among the group's 14,000 small shareholders. Hartwell now faces the prospect of being asked by Ford to sell four dealerships. The combined group will have a total of 12 Ford dealerships and the maximum dictated by the manufacturer is eight. Mr Ron Farrall, Ford's director of dealer operation, said: 'We have an eight dealership rule: that I will not negotiate on. The two parties, Trimoco and Hartwell, are fully aware of our policy.' He believed the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on UK new car sales, which was critical of some manufacturers' restrictions, would not affect rules on the number of dealerships. If disposals were enforced, about a year's grace might be given and Ford would help with the sales, he said. Hartwell would only say that it would continue its discussions with Ford. Trimoco is dominated by Ford dealerships, of which it has six. It also has two Vauxhall and one Peugeot.</p>

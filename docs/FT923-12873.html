			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Scots training payments faulted THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, has qualified the first annual accounts of Scottish Enterprise, the body that replaced the Scottish Development Agency last year, saying there is 'a risk of error which could be material'. The qualification in the statement on the accounts from Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, relates to payments made by Scottish Enterprise to the 13 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) under its control which they passed on to training providers. Lecs are the Scottish equivalent of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales. Sir John says that at five of the Lecs, financial appraisal and monitoring systems for the disbursal of training funds were not in place for the whole of the 1991-92 financial year. One did not implement them until last November. He says that the appraisal and monitoring systems at one Lec were 'giving Scottish Enterprise concern at the end of the financial year' and that 11 Lecs had not arranged an internal audit to be carried out in the form required by the rules. Business people in several sectors in Scotland are becoming slightly more confident about their prospects and there are signs of a modest rise in demand, according to the latest quarterly Scottish business survey conducted by chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Glasgow.</p>

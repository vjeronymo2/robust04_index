			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme </F> Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, on the third  anniversary of the "15 Sha'ban uprising", issued on 26  January--read by announcer]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate: To those against whom war is made, permission is  given to fight, because they are wronged; and verily, God is  most powerful for their aid [Koranic verse].    On these blessed days, we are reliving the memory of the 15  Sha'ban uprising, which reflected our heroic Iraqi people's deep  association with great Islam and their readiness to make any  sacrifice for its sake. The uprising also reflected the extent  of injustice and persecution practiced by Saddam's criminal  regime against this zealous people, and the rejection of this  regime by the Iraqi people of all their sects, nationalities,  and social groups. [passage omitted]    On this blessed anniversary, we call on our Iraqi people to  perpetuate the confrontation against the ruling tyranny in  Baghdad. We call on them to be vigilant of the plots being  hatched against our beloved Iraq by its enemies, both Saddam's  gang and the covetous forces that are trying to find a foothold  in Iraq to practice their sabotage mission on behalf of the  arrogant forces that seek to serve their own interests.    On this anniversary, we also remind the world and all  virtuous forces that the Iraqi people are experiencing a major  plight at the hands of Saddam's regime, and are being subjected  to plots of physical liquidation, terrorism, and confiscation of  public and individual freedoms. We call on the world and its  virtuous forces to make continuous efforts to force the ruling  regime in Baghdad to stop its criminal schemes from being  implemented in the Iraqi cities in the north, south, center, and  in the marshlands in particular. The regime is engaged in  operations of pursuits, killing, economic blockade, continuous  dry-up efforts, and annihilation of all features of human life.    We call on the world and the virtuous forces to abandon  their  silence over the Saddam regime's genocide against the Iraqi  people everywhere. We appeal to the Security Council, the  United Nations, and their humanitarian organizations to play  their legal role regarding the crimes and tragedies of Iraq.    O sons of the Armed Forces; O Iraqi officers and soldiers:  The sons of your Iraqi people everywhere have unleashed their  outcry in the face of the criminal tyrant, expressing their  rejection of him. They have paid with their lives and pure blood  for this outcry. They wanted to rid themselves of the tyrant and  its regime and establish a system that ensures their freedom,  independence, dignity, might, and honor. You belong to this  steadfast, brave, mujahid people who seek salvation. This  people calls on you to be the strong and striking force to  topple this criminal tyrant, who has violated dignities and  sanctities, destroyed the country, ruined all its resources, and  forced humiliation, death, displacement, and disgrace on the  Iraqi Army. The Iraqi people warn you against being used by  Saddam to realize his personal whims of despotism, crime, and  corruption.    O honorable officers and soldiers: The current situation  provides the best chance for the Army and the Iraqi people to  join forces and wage the battle against tyranny, crime,  corruption, humiliation, and slavery, a battle for Iraq's  independence and freedom, which Saddam is relinquishing--after  having destroyed everything--to preserve his power.

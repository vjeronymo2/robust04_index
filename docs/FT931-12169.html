			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Look abroad before you decide on gilts - Bonds / Foreign markets may offer better prospects this year, with France currently a favourite UK RETAIL investors are currently being offered a plethora of unit trusts investing in gilts. These appear to be an attractive alternative to bank or building society deposit accounts, following the recent fall in short-term rates and rise in long-term sterling bond yields. But sterling-based investors should examine other options before plumping for the gilts market. Foreign bond markets may offer better prospects this year, so unit trusts investing in international bonds rather than just gilts should also be considered. Although 10-year gilt yields of 8 1/2 per cent appear relatively attractive, most analysts expect longer-dated gilt yields to edge higher, so investors could do well to wait. The main problem for the gilts market, for the foreseeable future, is supply. The government's burgeoning funding needs translate into weekly sales of gilts averaging more than Pounds 1bn this year. The market may well have some support in the short-term: ahead of the start of the new financial year in April, the funding position is well in hand, and there is even some prospect of further short-term interest rate cuts. But after that, the pressures of supply are likely to lead to a steepening of the yield curve - that is, long-term yields will rise relative to short-term rates. In order to meet its funding needs, the UK government needs to be able to attract foreign investment in gilts. But the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism has exacerbated fears about the pound's instability among foreign investors. Further, the returns available in the gilts market are not sufficiently generous to tempt them away from other European markets with stronger currencies. For example, current 10-year gilt yields of around 8 1/2 per cent offer only  1/2 point more than 10-year French government bond yields, while 10-year German bonds are yielding around 7 per cent. Those differentials will have to widen in order to attract foreign investors. Moreover, while other markets are expected to experience falling yields, gilt yields are likely to rise: UBS predicts 10-year gilt yields of 9 per cent by the end of the year. Away from the market's supply problems, there is very little good news in the pipeline. The current decline in the inflation rate may give some initial support to the index-linked sector, but that could well fade, as the effects of sterling's devaluation, and the economy's expected emergence from recession, take effect. 'Inflation will fall in the next few months, but could be as high as 3 1/2 per cent by the end of the year, so gains on index-linked gilts will be relatively short-lived,' according to Mr Michael Burke, international economist at Yamaichi International. 'The gilts market is facing a double whammy of rising inflation by the end of the year and a deluge of supply,' he added. However, he suggested that investors interested in income rather than total returns might want to pick up the long-dated gilts when yields reach 9 1/2 per cent to 9 3/4 per cent. But for investors looking for capital gains, Mr Michael Hughes, head of economic research at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, suggests that there is a better case for equities than for gilts. However, he also suggested that some sterling corporate bonds may perform well, as the economy emerges from recession, judging by the strong support for smaller companies in the equity market. Among foreign bond markets, the French market is currently a favourite. Although the market has failed to take off so far this year, analysts remain very positive about its prospects, based on strong economic fundamentals. It is widely expected to outperform other European markets once the elections in March are over. Currently, the margin between 10-year French government bond and Bund yields is around 90 basis points, and, according to Mr Burke of Yamaichi, this could widen further (that is, France could underperform Germany) in the run up to the elections. But once that uncertainty is removed, France's relatively strong position, relative to other European countries, should pay dividends. The French market can boast low inflation, a current account surplus, and reasonable economic growth (by European standards), and although the state of government finances is deteriorating, they are still in a better position than in the UK or Germany. Meanwhile, the reduction in the German repo rate has lent support to the franc, and reassured most investors that the worst of the pressure on the French currency is over. Even if, against expectations, the franc were to be devalued, this does not imply substantial losses for sterling-based investors, because the franc is not considered to be currently overvalued against sterling. In fact, since leaving the ERM, sterling has benefited from the continuing turmoil within the system, and most analysts say that, over the course of the year, the franc is likely to appreciate against sterling. The other market favoured by analysts is the US Treasury market, which also combines the prospects of currency appreciation and stronger economic fundamentals.</p>

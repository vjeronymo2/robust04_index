			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Observer: Tie broken 'I'm not going to waste time scouring 16th century poetry.' So snorts chartered accountant J L Mapley in riposte to Observer's tie-breaking question, printed last Monday, to decide which of the 62 all-correct entrants to the previous week's numeracy-style quiz should receive the prize bottle of malt whisky. The tie-breaker had two parts. The first was to show how an old problem - which number when added to one seventh of itself equals 19? - would have been solved by pre-algebraic methods such as the so-called 'way of falsehood'. Part two asked which 16th-17th century English poet hinted he understood the then new algebra, and in which poem. The reason for the switch to matters literary was the pusillanimous one that, as the 62 previous winners were evidently all numerate enough to solve any calculating problem, something different was needed to break the tie. Fortunately most of the 20 of them who (along with a dozen other readers) had a go at the decider, did not resent the switch. As for the tie-breaker itself, everyone solved the first part, reaching the answer 16 5/8 . But part two produced a dilemma. It asked specifically for the name of a '16th-17th century' English poet: ie one who lived across the turn of those two centuries. That rules out solely 17th century poets such as Samuel Butler, cited by five entrants, and solely 16th century versifiers including Robert Recorde, cited by two. The answer Observer had in mind, and to which the clue was the phrase 'the way of falsehood', was John Donne in Woman's Constancy. In it, he runs through various specious reasons his lover might voice for ditching him. And one of them is that, since the truth is that she always intended to be false to him, she might say she 'can have no way but falsehood to be true.' He then goes on: Vaine lunatique, against these scapes I could 'Dispute, and conquer, if I would . . . In other words, he can prove that falsehood is not the only way to the truth, because he knows how to use the way of algebra. Alas, although eight entrants named Donne, nobody cited that particular work. Even so, three of the previously all correct 62 cited another poem called variously The Second Anniversarie, Of the Progresse of the Soule, and An Anatomie of the World, which refers to 'quantities' in a way that strikes Observer's untutored mind as basically algebraic. So a bottle of malt each goes to those three: Dick Saunders of HM Treasury, L Reich of Manchester, and the banking and capital markets team at Baring Brothers.</p>

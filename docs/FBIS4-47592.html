Sidorenko, I.Yu. Korobko, A.I. Pavlova, </F> Belarussian Scientific Research Institute of Cardiology; UDC  616.12-008.331.1:615.849.19]    [Abstract] Increasing applications of low-intensity laser  radiation for treatment of various cardiovascular diseases,  e.g., hypertension, prompted an investigation of the efficacy of  low-intensity laser irradiation for treatment of hypertension by  affecting the projection areas of sinocarotid zones in a pulsed  mode biosynchronized with the physiological activity of the  carotid artery barozones. To this end, 21 men and 7 women aged  17-54 were exposed to low-intensity laser radiation, and the  treatment efficiency was monitored by the patients' state of  health, arterial pressure, and central hemodynamic indicators  determined with the help of an R4-02 bipolar thoracic rheograph.  An analysis of the central hemodynamic indicators after a course  of treatment shows that the use of low-intensity laser  irradiation has a verifiable hypotensive impact, improves the  patients' subjective status, and produces no side effects. Such  laser therapy may also be used as an independent treatment  method for categories I and II hypertension patients. The  systolic/diastolic pressure was reduced from 151.8/96.8 before  the treatment to 135/88 after the treatment. Tables 1;  references 11: 9 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

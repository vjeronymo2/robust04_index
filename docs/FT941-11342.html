			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Texan with mission to sell oil prospects to cynics - A US company seeking Pounds 18m through a listing Mr Eugene Fiedorek is either a masochist or a missionary. In each of his encounters with institutional investors in recent weeks, he and his colleagues have faced a barrage of hostile questions over their motives for floating a US-based company in the UK. Yet he still comes back for more. Mr Fiedorek, a silver-haired 62-year-old Texan, is the man behind Energy Capital Investment Company, which is raising an estimated Pounds 18m through an institutional placing. The company, designed to be wound up in eight years if shareholders approve, has been set up to meet the demand for financing of smaller independent oil and gas producers in the US. The argument is that smaller producers are missing out on a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) bonanza as the leading oil companies abandon uneconomic production in the US. Smaller operators, with their lower overheads and greater flexibility, are better placed to squeeze production out of the properties. However, banks will rarely lend more than 65 per cent of the value of proven producing reserves, leaving the operator unable to exploit the potential of proven but undeveloped reserves. Since 1988, Mr Fiedorek and four colleagues - all former executives of the RepublicBank in Texas - have been providing debt and equity finance for the oil and gas sector through EnCap, their US fund management vehicle. They boast a track record of assisted financings totalling Dollars 1.6bn. However, so far they have managed to raise the funds directly from investors, without recourse to a public market. The decision to go after a listing in the UK - to broaden the investor base, according to EnCap - has been greeted with some trepidation by gun-shy institutions. Many have had their fingers burned by the raft of small US-based explorers, floated during the so-called gas bubble of the mid-1980s, which never lived up to expectations. ECIC and its advisers argue that such concern is misplaced in this case. Flotation, they say, is the appropriate route, given the UK investment climate. The partnership method employed by EnCap with US investors is not attractive to UK institutions who would have to file tax returns in two countries. Partnerships are also exempt from tax in the US and not here. Finally, investors such as insurance companies would have to write off the total value of investments in non-quoted vehicles. Mr Fiedorek is not perturbed by the cynics, even though ECIC has had to look abroad for about half the funds needed in the absence of a rush from UK investors. He insists that ECIC has a welter of checks which will help to balance the risk of investing in oil and gas. First, ECIC has sought to bolster its nine-strong board with names such as Sir Peter Cazalet, former deputy chairman of British Petroleum and Mr Peter Tudball, chairman of the Baltic Exchange. The company also intends to avoid exploration and fund only those projects supported by proven, although possibly undeveloped, reserves. Financing will be through debt, equity or a combination of both, and each project will have to offer a pre-tax return of 20 per cent, ECIC says. Repayment of the earliest investments will also allow ECIC to recycle some of the funds into new projects. Independent surveys will be made of proposed investments by institutionally approved engineers. All investments will also be made alongside a Dollars 30.5m partnership in the US, which includes Lincoln National LIfe Insurance, one of the largest life companies in the US, and EnCap. The projects will be presented to ECIC by EnCap, which will monitor each investment on a quarterly basis. In return EnCap will receive an annual management fee equal to 1 per cent of the company's net asset value. At the end of the company's life, or in 2001, EnCap will be entitled to 25 per cent of the increase in the net asset value, after allowing for an 8 per cent annual rate of return. Management fees totalling 0.8 per cent of net asset value will also be payable to ECIC's sponsors, the US corporate finance boutique, Rauscher Pierce &amp; Clark, and its corporate manager Abtrust, a subsidiary of Aberdeen Trust. While some observers have suggested that the number of parties benefiting from the fee structure may be somewhat high, 'if they can fulfil their promises . . . who says they shouldn't get paid?' said one analyst. At the end of the day, even ECIC with all of its checks and balances cannot escape the speculative nature of oil and gas investment. The prospectus is expected to detail a number of dangers, from government regulation and price volatility to simply drilling a dry hole. There is also the significant currency risk to UK investors. 'The risk profile of oil and gas suggests to me that they cannot get all the investments right,' said one cautious analyst in London. 'It means the ones they do get right will have to go even better to fulfil their promises to investors.'</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Minister blamed for sugar scandal Mr Kalpnath Rai, the Indian food minister, yesterday came under renewed pressure to resign following the publication of a government report which found him 'fully responsible' for the costly mishandling of a sugar shortage this year. The government, which had earlier maintained the report blamed several officials and ministers, yesterday bowed to opposition party demands to publish the full report. The report said Mr Rai had aggravated a sugar shortage by delaying imports in order to push up sugar prices to the benefit of sugar producers. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, wants Mr Rai to quit so that he can remake his cabinet and exclude scandal-tainted ministers, following recent state elections in which corruption was an important issue.</p>

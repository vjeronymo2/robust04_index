			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> YELLOW SUB GETS TO BOTTOM OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCENE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TRAVEL TO THE SEA FLOOR FOR HANDS-ON RESEARCH  EXPERIENCE. INNER-CITY YOUTHS WILL BE AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS.  </P> <P> As the yellow-hulled Delta slips below the surface in the Gulf of Maine 22  miles off Massachusetts, bubbles form outside the portholes. The submersible  craft enters a different world.  </P> <P> The tiny, two-person sub dives to the sea floor, scattering fish as it skims  the bottom noiselessly, moving through rocky canyons. This once-in-a-lifetime  experience 200 feet underwater is part of high school program designed to bring  the reality of the ocean and the environment up close.  </P> <P> "Don't be scared!" the pilot barks at a reporter as the sub hits the edge of a  sharp ledge and bounces off, backwards, into a murky crevasse. "It sounds bad,  but nothing's gonna break."  </P> <P> As the sub meanders along the bottom, an unfamiliar realm slowly comes to life.  Vivid pink and red stems of algae rise from the rough sand and flutter eerily,  like long-stemmed roses. Ivory-colored sponges decorate the black, craggy  rocks.  </P> <P> Flounder swim lazily past the portholes. An enormous skate, lying flat on the  bottom like a gray rug, heaves awake under sub's bright floodlights and circles  the craft in apparent irritation.  </P> <P> The High School Aquanaut program allows students and their teachers to  participate in real undersea research in the waters off southern New England,  the mid-Atlantic Bight and the Laurentian Great Lakes.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe what I was seeing," said Mary Wohlleber, 17, who will be a  freshman at Eastern Connecticut State University next year. She has made two  dives. "It makes you appreciate the ocean more. You're there doing the work  firsthand, and until you do it firsthand you don't respect the animals or their  environment."  </P> <P> The program is sponsored by the federally supported National Undersea  Foundation at the University of Connecticut. The students are from southeastern  Connecticut high schools, and there are plans to include inner-city students  from New York next year.  </P> <P> "There's no better way to get youngsters excited about the ocean and the  environment than to make them diving scientists," Richard A. Cooper, director  of the National Undersea Research Center, said.  </P> <P> The course is safe, too. The Delta has made 1,969 dives without an accident.  The sub is made of reinforced steel and is equipped with the same type of  battery that powers a golf cart. It can go down 1,200 feet without pressurized  air.  </P> <P> Students in the program, now in its third year, take part in research  experiments. They are selected on a competitive basis from their schools, and  plan their individual projects with their teachers and program coordinators  before they go to sea.  </P> <P> "It was the experience of a lifetime," 17-year-old Brad Martin said. "The  views, the crew, being in a place that not many others are able to travel and  explore. The program has been a dream come true."  </P> <P> In the so-called Pigeon Hill area at Jeffrey's Ledge off Gloucester, students  help marine biologists measure the pollution content of scallops to determine  the contamination of surface sediments. They set scallop cages and later  retrieve them with the aid of the Delta's mechanical arm.  </P> <P> "We want to make them see that it takes only a short time to pollute the planet  and several thousand years to reverse the process," said Cooper.  </P> <P> Data from the scallop samples also have a larger significance, said Bill  Robinson, a marine biologist with the New England Aquarium who is a program  coordinator.  </P> <P> "We know more about corn in the Midwest than we do about fish in the ocean," he  said. "That's why we can harvest corn so well. We don't know anything about  scallops, but once we know about their reproduction cycles, it'll make all the  difference."  </P> <P> Singer Richie Havens was aboard the research vessel J.W. Powell recently as it  left Gloucester with a group of scientists and teachers to discover firsthand  how the program works.  </P> <P> Havens, 49, grew up in Brooklyn and works with underprivileged students in New  York City. He helped to found the Northwind Undersea Institute for children on  City Island in the Bronx. He also heads the Natural Guard, based in Washington,  D.C., an environmental program for inner-city youths.  </P> <P> "I was a city kid, and city kids need a place to go away from the concrete,"  said Havens, who said he will bring students into the program next year. "We're  trying to raise their consciousness about their environment by showing them  something they wouldn't otherwise see."  </P></p>

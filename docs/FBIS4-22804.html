			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arevik Arutyunyan: "Not Only Moral Victories"] </F>   [Text] The garrison, which is located in one of the central  regions of the capital, consists of volunteer units, people  serving in the army on a voluntary basis. The volunteers are  considered to be the best fighting men in the army. They are  distinguished by their good organization and ability. They are  capable of performing any combat mission with small forces,  using a small amount of military equipment, and with minimal  losses. No matter what you say, experience accumulated over the  years plays its role. The majority of these boys, who responded  to the first call to protect the Armenian borders and to go to  Artsakh--are bonded to one another by strong friendship and have  been tempered by the harsh experiences of war. They are the  eagles of the Gayduk detachments who, recognizing the need for a  regular army, at the end of 1992 entered into contractual  service. There is no doubt that sometimes in the "detachment,"  group sentiments show through, but they do not seem to impede  service in the army any more.    For many of the old volunteers the main thing is  responsibility and self-sacrifice, and their families have  already become accustomed to this. The same task of protecting  the Armenian land from enemy encroachment during the last year  and a half has brought dozens of men of various ages to the army  to serve in it on a voluntary basis. But among those who have  signed up as volunteers, obviously, the largest number are  people who have been forced to take this step because of their  difficult socioeconomic position, and they hoped to use their  pay to feed their families.    The military unit leaves an infinitely sad impression. The  barracks, built during the forties, are unattractive. The  soldiers' uniforms are worn out and have holes in places. Soon  they will replace people who are in combat positions, although  it is apparent that they have not had a chance to rest properly.  Wounded men who have not fully recovered and even certain  Azatamart members who have been given certificates of disability  will be sent there. Such is the life of the volunteers, which  for many of them has gone on for six years now. By the admission  of the commanders, certain of them are not fit for combat duty.    Understandably, a contract army is something new for us. But  slowness and obvious incompetence in solving the most important  problems here are simply unforgivable.    The contract system leaves the impression that it is a  package of documents that has absolutely not been worked  through. The volunteer signs a contract without having an  opportunity to finally clarify his rights, responsibilities, and  privileges. The commander is also left in confusion because his  "rites" of command are not clear. Social problems--the miserly  pay, uniforms, treatment, medications, apartments, family, and a  multitude of other concerns--are constantly producing anxiety  and disturbing the soldier. A sense of being unprotected follows  him into combat positions as well, where he cannot feel at ease  about his family, who are far away and have been cast to the  will of fate. True, there is a certain edict from the president  of the republic concerning privileges and benefits for families  of deceased and wounded Azatamart members, soldiers who have  participated in combat activities, which the president mentioned  again literally a couple of days ago. But this involves such  insignificant privileges and benefits that all this gives the  impression of being nothing but a nice gesture.    And at the same time, problems are quite obvious in a  contract army. If the objective is indeed to create a  professional, well-trained army, then conditions generating an  interest in the service become especially important here.  Patriotic zeal can keep a soldier going only during the initial  period of his service, and in unfavorable social conditions with  time it gradually burns out, which is being felt even among the  volunteers who are devoted to military service. Is it not  surprising that even under conditions of ubiquitous unemployment  and a helpless socioeconomic situation, people very rarely  volunteer for military service?    There is no doubt that opportunities in Armenia are not  great  today, but one cannot say that there are absolutely no factors  that provide incentive for service in the army. The volunteer  who risks his life is offered an insignificant price in the  material sense. But the soldier has a family and children, and  to take care of them is also his permanent and sacred duty.    In Armenia today it is possible to buy an apartment,  according to a modest calculation, for one day's revenue from a  small store. Moreover, there are many apartments that actually  belong to no one. At the same time many military servicemen who  are protecting the homeland are living in dormitories and  basements, under unfavorable conditions. At least this part of  the army should be provided with apartments, and in general the  provision of an apartment should be the best incentive for  contract military service in Armenia. During the course of their  service soldiers lose years when they could have been living in  a different way. After service in the army it is exceptionally  difficult to become accustomed to civilian life and to acquire a  new specialty. And ultimately it is no secret that service in  the army, especially in a war situation, to put it mildly, does  not contribute to the development of intellectual capabilities.  Sooner or later our military servicemen return home, but what  will they do there?    This problem exists even today. Many volunteers are  continuing their service simply because they do not see how they  could make a living in this life, especially under conditions of  a market economy, which are completely unknown and  incomprehensible to them. In addition to material difficulties,  in the future military servicemen will also experience  psychological embarrassment and frustration. And a once strong,  vital man gradually develops the feeling of inadequacy. There  will be a new stratum in the society--superfluous people who  have served and fought for anything but this.    High wages, an apartment, education--these are obviously  important factors which could bring about competition among  those who want to enter the army and thus stimulate the process  of creating it.    In addition to the material incentive, there is also another  important condition--state propaganda. Let us pay attention to  the "respect" the soldier enjoys in Armenian reality. As  distinct from the Soviet soldier, whom the people accepted into  their homes as a native son, giving him warm hospitality  everywhere, the Armenian soldier today meets with reproof and  censure even when taking advantage of his right to free travel  on city transportation. Moreover, the soldier's uniform has  become somehow offensive to the eyes of those around him.  Soldiers who are protecting their native land, cruel as it may  be, are considered frivolous, rolling stones, somehow idle and  limited people.    Herein lies one of the main reasons why people try to avoid  service in the army, and this will continue as long as state  propaganda is so far removed from the national ideology.    The temporary shelter for draftees into the army and  reservists who have been called up for three months constitutes  the same unknown quantity. They spend a month here, after which  they are sent to a military training base. Without mentioning  the failures of the first draft, one must say that this time  there has been progress in the matter of organizing the daily  life of the soldiers. The new uniforms are issued right away.  Those people who are mobilized are fed three times a day and  given the necessary nutritional norm. The bedding is clean and  the bathing problem has been solved. There is always electricity  in the military unit and the television sets work. Theoretical  training lasts for one or two hours but practical training is  inadequate because of the shortage of equipment. After noon  those who wish to may leave the unit--under the condition that  they return at a certain hour. Many prefer to stay in the unit  where they can keep from getting bored.    So in the modern situation in Armenia the conditions created  for military recruitment can without exaggeration be called  favorable. The purpose of the active duty training is to  familiarize men from 25 to 45 years of age with at least the  fundamentals of military life and teach them to protect their  native home. Obviously, this is a sacred task, but how have we  prepared the most important thing for carrying it out--the  training base? The military unit does not even have enough  models of the most common weapons for instruction. There is only  one firing range for target practice, and it is used by draftees  from all seven regions of the capital. Firing practice is put  off under the most diverse pretexts--on the first day the base  is occupied, on the second day--the ordered transportation did  not arrive, the next day--there are no cartridges. Cases like  this exacerbate uncomplimentary ideas about the army, from the  very first day of service weakening the vigilance and the  composure of those who have been called into the army. We do not  know what awaits people who have been mobilized into the army  after a month, at the military training base. But if this kind  of situation prevails here, the effectiveness of recruitment is  greatly threatened.    We are not talking about questions of forms and methods of  mobilization that flout human rights. Nor are we talking about  the political objectives that are realized and the means that  are applied, but as for elementary military training of the  Armenian man--a most important and necessary matter of state  importance--here we cannot close our eyes to the frivolous,  antistate attitude toward this matter.    A former volunteer, speaking of the sad and difficult  realities of the army, which, if they seem harmless and less  than dangerous in the rear, become a cause of losses on the  battlefield, noted sadly: "It is necessary to do something so  that today's heroic battles are not regarded by future  generations as mere moral victories."</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Radstone Technology heads for stock market with valuation of Pounds 19.2m Shares in Radstone Technology, a specialist electronics group which is coming to market through a placing with institutional investors, were priced at 125p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 19.2m. The placing, sponsored by Beeson Gregory, involves about 10m shares, representing two thirds of the group's expanded share capital. Radstone, which designs and manufactures advanced computer sub-systems for industrial and military use, was founded in May 1988 as the result of a Pounds 4.1m management buy-out from Plessey led by Mr Charles Paterson, Radstone's managing director. The MBO team, which raised an additional Pounds 3.9m of financing, was backed by a syndicate of venture capitalist investors led by 3i. The placing includes 4.09m shares placed on behalf of existing shareholders. The placing will also raise about Pounds 7m net of new funds for the group, of which Pounds 3.9m will be used to repay convertible stock, leaving the group with a strong balance sheet and no gearing. Radstone, which pioneered the design and production of off-the-shelf computer boards for use in extreme environments, has three operating divisions - military products, industrial products and Foundation Technology, a specialist surface mount technology board assembler which was acquired in 1991. The group has manufacturing operations in Towcester and Corby and subsidiaries in the US and France. Radstone reported profits before exceptionals of Pounds 985,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.9m in the year to end-March 1993. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.87m. The board is forecasting profits before tax and Pounds 150,000 of exceptional items of not less than Pounds 1.5m in the current year and adjusted earnings per share of 7.9p. The shares are expected to begin trading on February 28.</p>

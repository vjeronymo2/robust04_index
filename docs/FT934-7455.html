			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: British Gas Pounds 225m in red for third quarter BRITISH GAS has blamed regulatory pressures, leading to a loss of market share to independent competitors and price cuts to consumers, as the main reason for a sharp deterioration in its third quarter performance. The net loss for the quarter, the period of lowest demand for gas, was Pounds 225m on an historical cost basis against Pounds 190m last year. The loss was higher than most analysts expected and was evidence of 'the declining profitability of the UK gas supply business arising from the regulatory squeeze,' according to Mr Robert Evans, chairman. Losses per share for the quarter were 5.2p (4.4p). The poor performance dragged down net profits for the first nine months to Pounds 409m, against Pounds 447m. Historical cost operating profits in the UK gas supply business fell to Pounds 515m in the nine months to the end of September, against Pounds 592m last time. This was despite colder weather during the year and a small increase in the volume of gas sold, mainly to low-margin power generation customers. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, yesterday warned that continuing losses could lead to price rises for mainly residential customers if the government implemented the recommendation of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas' trading arm be divested from the gas transportation division. 'These increasing losses carry a political health warning. If the government wants to divest British Gas trading as a profitable business, gas bills for 18m voters will first need to go up by several percentage points on top of a 17.5 per cent VAT increase.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is considering the MMC recommendations, and is expected to decide by the end of the year or early 1994 whether to implement them. British Gas yesterday called for an early decision to enable the company to make decisions on large investments. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said large-scale capital spending would remain on hold until the government announced what the company's future structure would be. The latest results highlighted the growing competition in the gas industry, with British Gas's share in the firm contract market, which supplies gas to large industrial and commercial users, falling to 34 per cent. Increased competition has also led to lower prices being charged for large users.</p>

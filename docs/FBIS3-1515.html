The suspects are believed to be African National Congress  [ANC] officials.    A ANC peace desk official confirmed the arrests, adding he  had "no clue" as to why they were detained.    Maj Naidoo said a vehicle was stopped in Port Shepstone on  Tuesday morning and police recovered an AK-47 rifle and  magazine, 20 AK-47 rounds, and a 9mm Luger pistol with rounds.    "The local offices of a political party", were subsequently  searched and a 9mm CZ pistol and a police camoflauge cap were  found, said Maj Naidoo. The men are due in court soon.</p>

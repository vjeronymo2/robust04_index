			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Industrialised nations rebuked on trade policy RESTRICTIVE trade policies by many industrialised nations are damaging the prospects for world growth, the BIS says in its annual report. In a strongly worded rebuke, it hints that the industrialised world has been hypocritical in encouraging trade reforms by developing nations, while at the same time clamping down on access to its own markets. The bank says many developed countries have protectionist trade policies particularly in farm products, semi-finished manufactured goods, clothing and textiles. In remarks which will add to concern about the stalled Uruguay round of world trade talks, the bank says the trade policies of many industrialised nations 'have in many ways become more restrictive in recent years'. It adds: 'The awakening of so much of the developing world to the benefits of free trade places a special responsibility on the countries in the industrialised world to open their markets.' The report criticises the trend in recent years towards 'managed' trade agreements by groups of industrialised countries, often on a bilateral basis. These include agreements covering exports of Japanese goods such as cars and semiconductors into the US and European Community. 'Such measures restrict consumer choice, inflate costs and raise prices,' the bank says. 'By allowing some enterprises to be quite relaxed about their own inefficiencies, a vital force for greater productivity in the medium term is considerably weakened.' The accords also 'do little to promote domestic output and employment as a whole, as measures that protect one industry inevitably hurt others'. The report also singles out restrictive policies over agricultural trade which 'insulate domestic markets from the influence of world prices' and lead to production inefficiencies. According to the bank, the policies of the developed nations have been at variance with the efforts by many developing countries to move to free-trade policies, through measures such as more competitive exchange rates, greater openness to foreign investment and elimination of import tariffs. In the past five years, 51 developing nations have announced unilateral measures to open up trade, which the bank says have been 'often far reaching'. These reforms 'will only bear fruit' if markets in the industrial countries themselves become more open.</p>

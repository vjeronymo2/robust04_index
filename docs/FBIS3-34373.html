			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Husayn al-Shahrabli: "Lobby and Lobby"] </F>   [Text] As often reported in the Arab press, some people  have swallowed the bait and have begun inching closer to  Washington in the hope of forming an Arab lobby similar to the  Zionist one. But little did they know that the bait is an  American hamburger on an Israeli hook.    This could not have been due to goodwill or naivete, because  some of them have swallowed the bait despite their knowledge of  the hook and its origin. There are also those who, from the  time of their grandfathers, have yielded to the humiliation of  slavery and have actually vied with one another in order to win  the favor of the American master.    But those rushing to the White House have been truly  deluded,  because the American master is no longer his own master. He has  lost control of his affairs to the Zionist lobby and placed all  his eggs in the Israeli basket.    Still, the devotees of the United States have formed an Arab  lobby that is not for, but against, the Arabs and their nation.    Let us now seriously compare the endeavors of the new lobby  with those of the established Zionist lobby.    The Arab lobby, if it is correct to call it by such a name,  is a generous lobby. For we have not heard of a single occasion  on which it has secured anything. On the contrary, it has  conceded everything with contentment and satisfaction. And as  the saying goes: Contentment is an inexhaustible treasure.    On the other hand, the Zionist lobby has secured everything  without becoming content or satisfied.    The Arab lobby specializes in increasing pressure, cooling  down hot spots, and loosening knots in order to clear the way  for the Americans.    Conversely, the Zionist lobby specializes in creating those  hot spots for the Americans, both president and officials, by  all possible means. The Zionist lobby controls the most crucial  areas of American society -- power, money, and the media -- and  holds the keys to every door. Thus, most of the decisions made  by the U.S. Administration come in attractive Zionist dress.    The Arab lobby makes blood sacrifices for the Americans,  even  if it is the blood of kinsmen and brethren, while the Zionist  lobby is among the leading guests to waste more Arab blood.    Let us now compare the most significant achievements made by  the Zionist lobby for Israel with those of the Arab lobby for  its nation.    The former has made the mighty United States a secretary  serving in the office of the Zionist prime minister, and has  subjected U.S. will to the decisions of the Knesset.    On the other hand, the latter has reduced Arab states,  governments, and officials to employees in a small section of  the U.S. State Department, begging for visas and identity cards  from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At the same  time, it has subjected Arab countries' will to the future and  comfort of the U.S. President, whether Republican or Democrat.    We all know that the Zionist lobby controls the United  Nations and its Security Council resolutions.    As for the miserable Arab lobby, the lame lobby, it is no  more than a folkloric group fit to decorate and add color to  conference tables (with their head gear, beards, and mustaches)  or become another number in a list of signatories.    The Arab lobby is destroying the Arab structure and dwarfing  the nation, from the ocean to the Gulf, and burning its history.    It is a stupid lobby, which has been charmed by blond  America, and it has disowned its mother, its father, and its  homeland for the sake of its love -- because America is its only  love.    It is a short-sighted lobby, which does not view its  national  wealth as lawful unless it is first blessed by the U.S.  treasury. It also does not consider its nation's problems fully  diagnosed unless they have been seen through the U.S.  microscope. The United States knows everything about the  nation.    It is a very tiny lobby that derives strength from the  Zionist lobby and looks taller, stronger, and more treacherous  in the shadow of that lobby.    The Arab lobby continues to claim that it works for the  nation and its interests. This is why it has offered its  territory as a bridge for the dirty infidel masters to come  occupy the homes of the poor faithful, who have performed  absolution for prayer.    An Arab lobby, a Zionist lobby, a Zionist Arab lobby.    Bless you, O Iraq, for you have been, and you will continue  to be, the nation's pivot, pure heart, and the banner under  which the nation seeks cover from the disgrace of the so-called  Arabs.    Bless you, for they have formed a lobby against you.    But you are stronger and more lasting, because you seek the  help of God. They heard you praying: O God, O Helper.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Public defender office urged by Bar A STATE-FUNDED public defender office to help defendants prepare for trial was called for yesterday by the Bar Council, which represents barristers. The office would help the defence in its search for witnesses, collate information on the state of scientific research and the quality of experts, and facilitate access to forensic science laboratories. The proposal is one of a number of suggestions made by the Bar in its submission to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice set up last year after the release of the Birmingham Six. The Bar calls for changes in the rules on confession evidence but stops short of suggesting that confessions should not be admissible in court unless corroborated by independent evidence. A confession should be admissible provided it is made in the presence of the defendant's solicitor, or is tape-recorded, or is put to the defendant and accepted by him in front of a judicial officer, or is corroborated. 'We have regretfully reached the conclusion that the danger that police officers may tell lies is such that special rules are required,' the submission says. The Bar also wants the role of the Crown Prosecution Service extended to give greater supervision over police investigations. It would like to see the appointment of a French-style examining magistrate to conduct an independent investigation in serious cases such as the Lockerbie bombing. It rejects the introduction of examining magistrates in most cases because it says this would result in unnecessary delay and expenditure. The Bar also calls for the abolition of the dock, allowing defendants to stand next to their lawyers as in the US. Its abolition would reflect the presumption of innocence, it said.</p>

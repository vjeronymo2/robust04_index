			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Economic Watch: French industrial output slips French industrial production fell 0.2 per cent in January from December, after falling 1 per cent in December from November, according to seasonally adjusted data from the national statistics office, INSEE. However, output in the building and public works sector, which is not included in the industrial index, rose by 8 per cent in January from December, returning to the levels seen before a sharp drop in December. Manufacturing output rose 1.2 per cent in January, while farm output fell 3.6 per cent and energy output dropped 2.4 per cent. However, INSEE said some figures for output of consumer and semi-finished goods had had to be estimated because of delays in collecting data after a new survey questionnaire was introduced to bring France into line with European norms. West German industrial orders rose 3.1 per cent in February, from January, and 3.2 per cent from a year earlier. Russia produced 24.8m tonnes (5.85m barrels a day) of crude oil and gas condensate in March, excluding the output of joint ventures, down 18 per cent from 30.1m tonnes a year earlier, but 10 per cent up on the 22.3m tonnes produced in February. Denmark's GDP will grow 4 per cent this year in real terms, compared with 1 per cent last year, the Federation of Danish Industries forecast.</p>

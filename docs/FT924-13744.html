			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: Germany at last discovers Martinu / Review of 'Julietta' and 'The Greek Passion' At long last, German opera houses are discovering Martinu. Bielefeld opened the new season with Julietta. Mainz chose The Greek Passion, a timely parable of Germany's refugee dilemma. Next month Mannheim will stage Comedy on the Bridge. Germany may have come a long way from the cultural chauvinism of the interwar years, but there is still a strong element of condescension towards Czech music - one reason why Martinu's operas have until now been almost completely ignored. Unlike Janacek, who is steadily winning acceptance as a repertory composer, Martinu had no Max Brod to translate and promote his stage works. Nor does his music conform to the German idea of structure or thematic development. Martinu's attractions lie elsewhere - as the Bielefeld and Mainz productions have underlined. Although separated by more than 20 years in date of composition, Julietta and The Greek Passion are very much from the same stable. Both are complex in harmony and texture, with idiosyncratic solos for accordion and piano. Both demonstrate Martinu's willingness to declare his debts without compromising his own distinctive musical personality - as in the opening Daphnis-like mirage and Czech pastoral moods of Julietta, or the explosive treatment of Orthodox chorale in The Greek Passion. The similarities extend to subject-matter: both operas reflect Martinu's life-long preoccupation with the relationship between reality and fiction. In Julietta, based on Georges Neveux's surrealist play, the central character Michel returns to a French coastal village in search of a girl whose voice captivated him years before. He finds himself in a world where no-one has a memory, sees his own grasp of reality growing less sure and ends up seeking comfort from the Kafka-esque Central Office of Dreams. In The Greek Passion, which Martinu sculpted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, villagers confronted by a group of refugees act out in real life the biblical parts they have been allotted for their Passion Play. Hearing the two operas within a few days of each other (and with the Lyon production of Three Wishes still fresh in the memory), one notices how all Martinu's main characters become captives of their roles. The Bielefeld Julietta was designed and directed by John Dew, who is at his best in his home theatre. The action took place on a V-shaped, crayon-coloured set, which went through a 360-degree turn in the course of the evening - an apt metaphor for the plot's mysterious deja vu circle. The characters wore stylised 1930s costumes, but the modern travel-agent associations of the Central Office of Dreams were suggested by a soul-less computer-desk. There was some humour - particularly from Ion Bric and Michael Vier as the Old Man and Woman - but the stage performance was more worthy than inspired. Richard Decker's tall young Michel seemed to be feeling his way into the role, an arduous one which keeps him on stage virtually the whole evening. As the elusive Julietta, whose brief contributions provide the opera's most memorable music, Claudia Taha sang better than she looked - appropriately so for a character who can be heard more often than seen. The production's chief asset was the orchestral playing under Geoffrey Moull. Dynamics, rhythm and texture were expertly judged, pointing up the many deft touches in Martinu's restless, underwhelming score. The Greek Passion at the Mainz State Theatre was both a revelation and an event of heartwarming consolation - that rare occurrence when one's own stubborn belief in a work is totally and utterly vindicated by a performance beyond one's dreams. Here was not the awkward stage oratorio of repute, nor the episodic quality which characterises Julietta. Instead, The Greek Passion emerged as a fully-fledged music drama, a concise and moving masterwork in which Martinu crowns his search for the humanity in man. Much of the credit goes to the excellent Mainz orchestra (well-remembered from last season's Gloriana) and its conductor, Peter Erckens, who made the most of Martinu's biting, richly-contrasted colours and exultant chorus music. The opera benefited from being played without a break. Heidrun Schmelzer's set amounted to little more than an open space shaped like a Crucifix, one of several subtle references to the work's Christian symbolism. Peter Brenner's staging grew out of the music and made sense of it, with dignified central performances and well-grouped, disturbingly familiar refugee scenes. Robert Ciesla was a Manolios of almost saintly conviction. Elaine Woods captured the moral frailty and virtue in Katerina, the opera's Mary Magdalene-figure. As the two priests, Friedemann Kunder (Grigoris) and Hannu Niemela (Fotis) offered rounded personalities. The smaller parts were all convincingly sung. If ever there was a landmark production capable of revealing an opera's true merit, this was it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Clarisse Lucas] </F>   [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel are  optimistic that a Hebron security accord will be signed here on  Tuesday [29 March] to clear the way for the resumption of  autonomy talks after a one-month break.    A senior Palestinian official said Sunday the PLO was  putting  to one side its demand for the evacuation of the 400 Jewish  settlers who live among 120,000 Palestinians in the massacre  town of Hebron.    "The departure of the Hebron settlers is a pressing demand  so  as to prevent further violence, but it is not a precondition,"  Muhammad Subayh, secretary general of the Palestine National  Council or parliament-in-exile, told AFP.    Although Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has ruled out  their withdrawal, an Israeli source said the settlers living in  five areas of Hebron could be regrouped.    The PLO and Israel agreed over the weekend that the only  serious issue left was the number of Palestinian policemen and  Norwegian observers to be deployed in the occupied West Bank  town of Hebron.    Israel accepted the deployment of lightly armed police and  foreign observers in talks with the Palestinians last week in  Tunis and Cairo.    The accord on Hebron could be signed when the two sides  reconvene on Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are  ironed out in time, the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said  Saturday.    "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on  launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately,"  after a one-month suspension by the PLO because of the February  25 massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a settler, he said.    The Palestinian police will be posted at fixed points around  Hebron to guard schools, hospitals and the university, said  Sha'th. Joint Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town.    He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have  the last word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will  be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be  launched.    As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the  launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which  the Israeli army was to have pulled out of the Gaza Strip and  West Bank town of Jericho, said Sha'th.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he  hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a  last session on the security arrangements for Hebron.    Rabin said an accord was in sight on security for Hebron  Palestinians, as demanded by the PLO as a condition for resuming  the autonomy negotiations. "I believe we have advanced in the  right direction," he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres said implementation of the autonomy accord could start "in  one or two months."    A deal on the launch of autonomy was to have come into  effect  on December 13, under the September 13 Declaration of Principles  signed in Washington, but it has been held up mainly by Israeli  security concerns.    Israeli state radio said Saturday that Palestinian police  would be deployed in nine day's time in Hebron, Jericho and Gaza.    Subayh raised an additional Palestinian demand on Sunday --  for police also to be sent to the rest of the West Bank. "The  settlers are everywhere and risks of a massacre exist everywhere  they live," he said.    "The question of the security of the Palestinians does not  only present itself in Hebron," said Subayh.    But Rabin has said the Hebron arrangements were  "exceptional," and would not be extended to other West Bank  towns such as Nablus or Ramallah.    UN Security Council Resolution 904, adopted on March 18,  condemned the Hebron massacre and called for protection for  Palestinians in the occupied territories.    After the massacre, the PLO demanded an armed international  protection force, the disarming of Jewish settlers and  dismantling of certain flashpoint settlements, including those  in Hebron.</p>

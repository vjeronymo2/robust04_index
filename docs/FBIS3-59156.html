			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN envoys Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel today  briefed the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council [UNSC]  permanent members in Nicosia on their deliberations with  President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf  Denktas on the confidence-building measures. The meeting took  place at the Russian Embassy.    A statement read after the meeting by Boris Zenkov, Russian  ambassador in Cyprus, noted that the five ambassadors called on  all interested parties to reply promptly to the UN secretary  general in a way that will allow the beginning of discussions on  ways of implementing the package on confidence-building  measures. The five ambassadors also reminded that the position  of the five Security Council permanent members is that the  package on Varosha and Nicosia's international airport will not  only prove beneficial for the two communities but will have a  significant effect in overcoming the current lack of confidence  between the two sides. It will also facilitate an overall  solution to the Cyprus issue.    The five ambassadors also referred to the Security Council's  position that both sides are committed to full cooperation with  the secretary general without delay in working promptly toward a  general framework of agreement, the first stage of which is to  reach agreement on the confidence-building measures package.    The statement also notes that Clark advised the five  ambassadors that the leader of the Greek Cypriot side repeated  its acceptance in principle of the package of  confidence-building measures for Varosha and Nicosia  international airport. He also reiterated his readiness to  discuss ways to implement this package when the leader of the  Turkish Cypriot side accepts as well. Clark noted that  Kliridhis informed him of his intent to repeat his acceptance of  the package in a letter to the secretary general.    Furthermore, the statement adds that Clark briefed the five  ambassadors on Denktas' latest letter and his deliberations with  the Turkish Cypriot leader on Monday [24 January] and Tuesday  regarding the contents of the letter. Clark underlined the  importance of insuring that the acceptance of the package by the  Turkish Cypriot side will lead to the implementation of the  package.    Speaking after the meeting, Clark said that he must be  certain that both sides mean the same thing when they say they  agree in principle with the confidence-building measures. He  said: I have to say we have not reached that point. Clark  expressed the hope that in the coming days and following his  deliberations in Athens, Ankara, and Istanbul he will be able to  tell the UN secretary general that there is agreement between  the two sides on the same issue.    Asked whether he is optimistic, he said that a lot of  distance has been covered. He also expressed the hope that both  sides will show real willingness to take steps that will allow  the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Clark  refrained from commenting on Denktas' letter to the UN secretary  general but added that after his discussions and deliberations  with the Turkish Cypriot leader, he wants to make sure that the  acceptance in principle will lead to discussing the  implementation of the confidence-building measures.</p>

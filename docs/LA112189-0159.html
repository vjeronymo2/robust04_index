			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW, TROUBLED EARLY BY PRICE REPORT, GAINS 7.25  </P> <P> The stock market wavered today, weighed down during most of the session by the  latest bout of inflation worries, before advancing at the close.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.25 points to 2,639.29.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 836 down, 626 up and 520 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 147.90 million shares, up from 128.17 million in  Monday's session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.02 to 188.05.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.50 to 370.98.  </P> <P> "People are pulling their horns in a little bit," said Ralph Acampora, an  analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "There's a little apprehension, a little  uncertainty."  </P> <P> Analysts said an early advance ran out of steam when the market took a closer  look at the government report today on inflation, which was slightly worse than  most analysts had been expecting.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5% last month as  higher gasoline and food costs gave the country its biggest inflation surge  since May.  </P> <P> "That obviously didn't help" stock prices, said Bill Raftery, an analyst at  Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The government blamed the increase on a jump in gasoline costs, higher prices  for new cars and a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices.  </P> <P> Much of today's selling focused on stocks of companies involved in takeover  attempts, analysts said.  </P> <P> The market appeared to be shaky after Monday's 20.62-point drop in the Dow  average, caused by a selling wave that hit defense contractors especially hard.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called Sunday for a $180-billion reduction in  military spending over the next six years.  </P> <P> Today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed Cheney's statements but  said President Bush has not decided yet what defense expenditures he will  propose to Congress for the next fiscal year.  </P></p>

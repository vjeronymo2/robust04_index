			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Pounds 150m tag on Field in summer flotation FIELD GROUP, one of the longest established and biggest carton packaging companies in Britain, will come back to the stock market through a flotation in the summer which is expected to value it at about Pounds 150m. Field was first listed on the stock exchange in 1929, but has had a series of different owners since being purchased by Reed in 1965. In 1988 it was sold as part of the management buy-out of its parent's packaging interests, Reedpak, which was in turn acquired in 1990 by SCA, the Swedish paper and packaging group. The recession caused SCA to sell Field in 1991 through a Pounds 109m management buy-out led by Mr Jim Gilchrist, the company's chief executive since 1986. In spite of these changes of ownership, Mr Gilchrist said the business had continued to grow steadily and now had 14.5 per cent by value of the UK market for folding cartons. Field's cartons are used to package brands such as Kodak, Cadbury's Milk Tray and Chivas Regal, and a significant proportion of its output is exported. Sales for the year to April 4 are estimated to have grown from Pounds 124m to not less than Pounds 135m. The group employs about 1,900 people and has six manufacturing sites in the UK and one in Belgium. Some 600 employees participated in the 1991 buy-out, which was organised by CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board pension fund, and Barclays Bank among others. Mr Gilchrist said: 'By focusing on market sectors with international exposure such as confectionery, drinks, tobacco and pharmaceuticals, Field has proved resilient to the recession, increasing sales by an average of 11 per cent per annum over the last five years.' Field is to use the proceeds to help it expand steadily in higher-margin areas such as pharmaceutical packaging.</p>

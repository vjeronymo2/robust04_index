In an article today, the paper notes a statement by a  Zionist  Energy Ministry spokeswoman that her government has received  offers from some Gulf regimes to supply it with natural gas in  line with cooperation agreements between the Zionist entity and  Gulf regimes, including the Saudi regime and the rulers imposed  on Kuwait.    The paper adds: The devils are eager to supply the enemies  of the nation with all the means of strength and existence, even  before they sign a single item of the settlement accords. The  parties to the settlement process are making more concessions so  the Zionists will agree to sign these accords.    The paper goes on: Iraq wanted those people to hold their  heads high and to be loyal to their peoples, religion, heritage,  and history. However, they chose treason and plunged their  poisoned daggers into the backs of those who sought to protect  them and who sacrificed the blood of their sons to protect them  and save their dignity and glory.    The Mother of Battles shall remain a major turning point in  the history of humanity and in the struggle for man's glory and  dignity.</p>

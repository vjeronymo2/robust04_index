			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Compass route raises eyebrows FOR 18 months Compass has said it wanted to move into Europe to establish a contract catering business in the fragmented market. It was therefore only the route that raised eyebrows yesterday when Compass group bought the SAS airport catering and contract catering business for Pounds 71.9m, financed through a rights issue. While the market greeted the deal favourably, the choice of Scandinavia, does require some explaining. As one analyst said, 'It is good deal but it could have made a better move into Europe.' First of all, the majority of the contract catering business is in Scandinavia - about 40 per cent of that is in Norway's offshore sector. And half the airports are in Norway or Sweden, with 20 per cent in the UK. It is not entirely clear why these northern reaches provide a better platform for growing in the Benelux, France and Germany - the key European markets - than does the UK. Secondly, Compass is increasing the risk profile of its business. Catering for workplaces or health services may be cut - throat but having won the contract the income line is at least nailed down. With airports, tomorrow's sales cannot be known for certain. Thirdly it is not clear that the Compass style of squeezing suppliers to improve margins will necessarily travel to the Continent or that it will be easy to implement across eight countries. Compass is confident, however, that it can deliver improved margins. Mr Roger Matthews, finance director says the SAS businesses will give the group experience of managing in Europe and the chance to grow organically from a modest base in Germany, one of its strategic target markets. By moving into airports, Compass has also gained exposure to a market segment that will recover earlier in the economic cycle than its existing businesses. Contract catering in the UK may now be bumping along the bottom but it could be a relatively late beneficiary of economic recovery while the push into hospital and educational catering will also take a while to bear fruit. Compass has also bought from SAS the option to introduce Burger King hamburger outlets at European airports outside France. This will give it a useful comparator for the Casey Jones hamburger and Upper Crust sandwiches, two much smaller brands it bought last year. Financially, the deal has done Compass no harm. Deferred payment and a rights issue slightly larger than the purchase price will reduce gearing from the 200 per cent that would have prevailed at the end of 1993. Gearing should now be about 77 per cent on debt of Pounds 39m. More importantly in this business, Compass's interest cover rises from about seven times to over 14 times. Following the deal some analysts have lifted forecasts of earnings to 38.9p for the first full year, which gives a prospective multiple of 13.6, a modest premium to the market.</p>

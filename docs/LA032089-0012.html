			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOST LAWMAKERS FROM COUNTY BACK HONORARIUM BAN  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier accepted a $10,000 reward for leaving her sickbed  to vote for a bill.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Peter Chacon was paid $7,500 to sit still while a group that  opposed a measure he was carrying "educated" him about the issue.  </P> <P> Sen. Wadie Deddeh collected $10,000 for 10 brief appearances before students at  San Diego City College.  </P> <P> The trio of San Diego lawmakers accepted the extra cash in the three years  before California voters enacted Proposition 73, the political finance measure  that now limits legislators' speaking fees or honorariums to $1,000 each year  from each source.  </P> <P> But examples like that of Mojonnier, Chacon and Deddeh have convinced some  lawmakers and political reformers that the new limit is not strict enough. Many  believe the time has come to ban all speaking fees, most of which come from  sources that are seeking to influence the Legislature. Often, legislators are  paid the money not for speeches but simply for meeting privately with a small  group or attending a cocktail reception.  </P> <P> </P> <P> '$1,000 Is a Lot of Money'  </P> <P> "A thousand dollars is a lot of money to a lot of people," said John Larson,  chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission. "Our feeling is that it  still leaves the impression of impropriety. If that's the case, why not just  say no?"  </P> <P> The 11 members of San Diego County's legislative delegation have not been among  the state's leaders in receiving speaking fees. Combined, their total of  $83,861 for 1987 and 1988 is less than half of what Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown (D-San Francisco) earned by himself during the most recent two-year  legislative session.  </P> <P> But what the San Diego delegation lacks in quantity it has made up in flair,  accepting money in a way that has attracted statewide attention each of the  past three years. The examples:  </P> <P> * In 1986, Deddeh, a Bonita Democrat, was paid $10,000 by the San Diego  Community College District Foundation for 10 speaking engagements. He spoke to  seven classes on American government, two groups of graduating students and a  group of senior citizens attending a career day sponsored by the school.  </P> <P> The payments outraged faculty leaders, who complained that Deddeh, as an  elected official, should be willing to discuss American government with  students without charging the college for his time. Deddeh defended his  relationship with the college but has not spoken for money at the school since.  </P> <P> * In 1987, Mojonnier, an Encinitas Republican, was given a $10,000 "legislator  of the year" award by the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. Leaders  of the prison guards group said they gave the money to Mojonnier, who had been  ill, for leaving her sickbed to vote on a bill that placed a prison in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> Mojonnier insisted the money was fair payment for the speech she gave when she  accepted the award at the association's annual convention. But the payment was  far greater than any others Mojonnier has received in the six years she has  been in the Legislature. Controversy over the exchange prompted the prison  guards to abandon their plan to make the payment an annual event.  </P> <P> * In 1988, Chacon, a San Diego Democrat, was paid $7,500 by the California  Check Cashers Assn. to tour several check-cashing stores and meet with the  group's board of directors. At the time, Chacon was carrying a bill to limit  the fees the check cashers could charge.  </P> <P> Chacon dropped the bill in committee on the same day that he received $4,000  from the check cashers group. He received another $3,500 three months later.  Chacon said the timing of the first payment was a "coincidence" and insists  that the money did not influence his action. But he now says he favors a ban on  honorariums.  </P> <P> Together, Deddeh, Chacon and Mojonnier accounted for nearly half of the fees  collected by the San Diego delegation in 1987 and 1988. Most members from the  county take in only a small amount each year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Worth the Trouble'  </P> <P> Former Sen. Jim Ellis (R-San Diego) had a policy of not accepting money for his  speeches. Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) accepts very few such  payments. But she does ask those who want to pay her for speaking to instead  contribute to a favorite charity, usually the Child Abuse Prevention  Foundation.  </P> <P> "It's not worth the trouble," Killea said of the honorariums. "I'm in the  fortunate position of not depending on that to pay my bills. Rather than  getting all involved in getting that income, paying income tax on it, I'd  rather go ahead and have them give the money to the charities I really want to  give to. They get the full benefit of it and it isn't taxed. It's a way of  tweaking Uncle Sam."  </P> <P> Soon, Killea may not have a choice. At least two bills have been introduced  this year to ban honorariums. One of the bills was written by Assemblyman Ted  Lempert, a freshman Democrat from San Mateo who won an upset election in  November as a candidate who promised to clean up the Legislature. The other  bill is by Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who was a  co-author of Proposition 73, the political finance measure that was approved by  the voters last year.  </P> <P> "I think we need to tighten down a lot further," Johnson said. "There have been  some obvious examples where the amount of these so-called speaking fees  certainly raises legitimate questions. I think we need to abandon them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Press 'Milked This Issue to Death'  </P> <P> Chacon and Deddeh said they would support the move to ban the fees. Deddeh made  it clear that he arrived at his position more from exasperation than anything  else. He said he has grown weary of the annual newspaper stories about the  groups from which he is accepting money. He said the press has "milked this  issue to death" and vowed to support a ban on honorariums "to make life easier  for everybody."  </P> <P> Deddeh brushed off questions about $1,500 he was paid in 1987 and $1,000 in  1988 for speeches to the California Assn. of Collectors, a bill-collectors  trade group. Deddeh has written legislation for the organization the past two  years, including a measure he is writing now that would loosen state regulation  of bill collectors and make it more difficult for the public to obtain the  collectors' home addresses and phone numbers.  </P> <P> Deddeh described the bill as "technical, corrective legislation" and pointed  out that past measures he carried for the group passed the Legislature without  a single dissenting vote. He said he carried the bills not because of the money  he received but because he was requested to do so by the group's lobbyist,  former Sen. Bob Wilson, who also lobbies for the community college district.  </P> <P> "Bob Wilson was a seatmate of mine for five years. He is a personal friend, he  comes to me and says, 'Would you carry this?' " Deddeh said. "I said I would."  </P> <P> Deddeh said he has never pressured anyone into giving him money for a speech or  panel discussion.  </P> <P> "Probably, over my 23 years in the Legislature, I have given 3,000 to 4,000  speeches, lectures, seminars, without any money in return for that," Deddeh  said. "I wouldn't ask for that. I don't ask for that. But if I'm going to give  a speech, and someone says here is $500 or $1,000, I'm not going to turn it  down. I'm going to take it."  </P> <P> Chacon, similarly, said inquiries about the money he receives are not worth the  aggravation. He said the perception of conflict of interest in such exchanges  "does not do anything to enhance the respectability" of the Legislature.  </P> <P> "Many of the commentaries written about our honorariums are right in at least  one respect: The perception by the public is that there is a quid pro quo, even  when there isn't," Chacon said. "There certainly wasn't in my case. But the  perception is bad."  </P> <P> Chacon said he believes the ban on honorariums should be linked to an increase  in legislative salaries. Lawmakers now are paid $40,816 a year, plus $88 a day,  tax-free, for living expenses while the Legislature is in session.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Doesn't Really Matter'  </P> <P> "I don't think California legislators are paid enough, especially when you  consider that if this state were a country, it would have the fifth-largest  economy in the world," Chacon said. But he said he would vote for a ban on  speaking fees even if no pay raise were offered with it.  </P> <P> Mojonnier, who collected no honorariums last year after being criticized for  taking the $10,000 from the prison guards, said she does not care if the  Legislature bans honorariums. She said her lack of speaking fees during 1988  was happenstance, not the result of a conscious decision to avoid speaking for  money.  </P> <P> "It doesn't really matter to me one way or another," Mojonnier said. "I don't  get a lot. So it doesn't matter. My position would have to depend on exactly  what the bill said."  </P> <P> One area lawmaker who opposes further regulation of legislators' outside income  is Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego). Stirling, who collected nearly $12,000 in  speaking fees during 1987 and 1988, said he favors a minimum of limits on  political finances and a maximum of exposure through the required reporting of  such transactions.  </P> <P> "I say just report it, disclose it, and let the press and your opponents and  the public make what they want of it," Stirling said. Endless tinkering with  the political finance laws, he said, does not accomplish anything "except to  further erode the public's confidence in the electoral process."  </P> <P> Stirling suggested that elected officials rarely change their behavior because  of a law or a gift or contribution from a special interest.  </P> <P> "These things do not affect people's character," he said. "Your character is  formed by the time you are 15 or 16 years old. It doesn't change when you get  to the Legislature."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New </F> Democracy, by Verica Rupar; place and date not given: "The Time  of One-Party Systems Is Gone"]    [Text] It is almost certain that ministers who are members  of New Democracy, one of the founding parties of the Democratic  Movement of Serbia [DEPOS], will be sitting in the new republic  government along with the representatives of the Socialist Party  of Serbia [SPS], the largest party in the parliament.    Dusan Mihajlovic, the leader of New Democracy, does not wish  for now to go into details. "Parliamentary life is a process,  not an act; it is a skill, an interest, and reality and not a  moral contest," he says at the beginning of the interview.    Mihajlovic is, by his own definition, a "lawyer from  Valjevo,  on temporary work in Belgrade, and before that a scout and an  explorer." He is remembered as a vice president of the Executive  Council of Serbia (in 1990), as a politician who chaired the  first roundtable of the government and the opposition in Serbia.    New Democracy, until a recent separation of the delegate  club  of DEPOS, participated in the political life of Serbia, one  could say, from the shadows. Today it is one of the parties that  spurs certain controversies.    [Rupar] What is the place of New Democracy on the political  scene of Serbia? How do you comment on the comment that the  party was founded by DEPOS and on the rumors that what is  involved is a branch of the SPS?    [Mihajlovic] New Democracy is one of the first registered  political parties in Serbia. DEPOS did not give it birth, as it  did to some other parties, but New Democracy is one of four  equal founders of DEPOS.    The rumors that it is a branch of the SPS are spread by  precisely those who would themselves like to fall into the arms  of the SPS. We have our own political program whose essence is  local self-management and regionalism, surpassing conventional  politics, and seeking the so-called third path. In general, we  believe that without private ownership there is no true  democracy. Until then, political life will be full of beautiful  but empty talk, a lot of demagogy and struggling for power. This  is why one could rather say that it is the SPS that is coming  close to the views of New Democracy.    [Rupar] What does that concretely mean?    FMihajlovic] In a concrete situation, New Democracy  implements its belief in the need for national and political  compromise. It is more important for all of us to have a better  life than to listen to malicious comments of idlers who like to  judge everyone on everything except themselves and their acts.  We are not accusing those leaders who talked with the president  of the republic and who want a government of national unity. On  the contrary, we believe that this is the only correct road.    [Rupar] Under what conditions would New Democracy accept  participation in the government; would you personally assume  some of the functions?    [Mihajlovic] New Democracy believes that the time of  one-party rule, whether by the SPS or the opposition, is gone  forever. We have to get used to coalition. The offer of the  president of the republic to form a government of national unity  with the program formulated by Mr. Avramovic is in accordance  with the program of New Democracy and its real interests.    The electoral result makes both the government and the  opposition obligated to the agreement on the division of power  and responsibility for the fate of its people. No trivial  partisan or personal excuses can be a justification for fleeing  from the responsibility to our voters. When are we going to be  patriots if not now?    As concerns my participation in the government, it is known  that I have already been a vice president. That means that I am  over that ambition, as well as over the phase of a desire for  power. New Democracy is not a party contending for power, and I  am happy that there are many better and smarter people than I  who will carry this out in a better and more successful way.    [Ruper] How do you assess relations within the opposition?  What is it that prevents the establishment of a strong  parliamentary democracy in Serbia?    [Mihajlovic] We are still in the puberty phase in the  development of democracy and parliamentarism. The government  successfully controls the opposition. The majority of parties  have not freed themselves of dissident habits, they know what  they are against but not what they are for. Also, many do not  understand the essence of politics, politics as a democratic  struggle for power, and are not ready to accept the  responsibility which comes along with participation in the  parliament and the government.    [Ruper] What are your relations with the Socialists?    [Mihajlovic] They did not exist until the last negotiations  in the parliament, although I am, of course, a personal friend  of many people who, otherwise, are members of the SPS.  Otherwise, I think that nobody wants to share power, and neither  does the SPS. Power is shared only if one has to. And the  present situation is good for both democracy and the people.    [Ruper] What is your political prognosis?    [Mihajlovic] I would not be involved in politics if I were  not an optimist. I believe in peace, in the return to the  international community, privatization, successful people. I  will support successful forming of the government of national  unity and the resolving of the problems that have accumulated.  Are we going to succeed this time? This does not depend only on  me. Blackmail and reducing problems to a personal level are not  allowed. What would the government achieve if I were the only  leader, and there were no others. It is a poor country that has  only one leader.</p>

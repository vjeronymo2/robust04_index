			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 8 (AFP) -- Russia wants to link its  joining the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] to joining the G-7  group of industrial nations, presidency spokesman Viacheslav  Kostikov said.    "If we are invited into the political and military  partnership, it would be logical to make an approach in the  economic sphere," he told reporters. "Russia would like to join  the G-7. Why not link the two problems," he added.</p>

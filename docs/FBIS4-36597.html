			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 10 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  has stated that the Jewish settlements in the occupied  Palestinian territories and the Jerusalem issue are the most  critical problems confronting the Middle East peace process.  Regarding the settlements, he said everything depends on how  the Israelis and the Palestinians handle this issue, which is  more difficult and complicated now than it used to be when the  Camp David Accords were signed. As to Jerusalem, the president  emphasized its special status among the adherents of Islam,  Christianity, and Judaism all of whom attach a sacred character  to the city.    These remarks came in an interview conducted by the  well-known television commentator Dan Rather and broadcast by  CBS Television early today.    In response to a question, President Mubarak said that  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat wishes to go to Jericho but  is delaying the trip until the funds he promised the  Palestinians become available because it will be difficult for  him to go there "empty-handed."    President Mubarak emphatically denied any prospect of  Egypt's  becoming "another Iran." He declared: "Egypt cannot turn into  an Iran or any other country. It is an ancient country with  very deep roots and a 7,000-year old civilization."    He added: "We are able to confront terrorist acts in this  country."    Concerning the greatest current threat to the peace  operation, President Mubarak said: "The main obstacle is the  settlements and how the Palestinians and Israelis handle this  issue."    Asked if that is the primary problem, President Mubarak  said:  "Yes. I remember that there were 48 small settlements when the  Camp David Accords were signed. Now there are 180 settlements  and this makes the problem much more difficult and complicated  than ever before. Also, there is the Jerusalem issue which is a  sacred place for Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews."    On whether he doubts Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat  will  go to Jericho this month, his excellency replied: "I recently  heard that he is ready to go but is postponing the trip until  the aid funds become available. I believe he wishes to go but  if he arrives there empty-handed, it will be a very difficult  matter for his people to accept."    Asked if Yasir 'Arafat will able to govern after a life of  armed struggle, President Mubarak said: "Let's be realistic.  'Arafat is facing tremendous difficulties but he is the best  man for this mission now. I know him very well."    In answer to a question about whether Yasir 'Arafat can do  what Nelson Mandela did in South Africa, namely forgive,  President Mubarak said: "I believe that 'Arafat is willing to  forgive. They can unite and cooperate for the good of the  people."    On whether he thinks it is time to reduce the economic  sanctions on Iraq, although President Saddam Husayn is still in  power, President Mubarak remarked: "It is a problem. We  sympathize with the suffering Iraqi nation but not with Saddam  Husayn himself."    In answer to a question on whether he favors selling Iraqi  oil on the international market at this time, his excellency  said: "If it is for the people's good and if the revenue from  such sales can be controlled and used to bring prosperity to the  people, then I agree."    Asked if Iran poses a major threat to regional peace and  security, President Mubarak said: "The Iranians are dead set  against the peace process."    Regarding the possibility that Egypt might turn into another  Iran, President Mubarak said: "Egypt will never be another Iran  or any other country. Egypt is a country with a long history  and a 7,000-year civilization. We are quite able to confront  terrorist acts in this country."</p>

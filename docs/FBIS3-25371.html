			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Here is a statement by the chief of general staff  of the Zairian Armed Forces rejecting a statement by the  Sudanese People's Liberation Army [SPLA] on Zaire's involvement  in the Sudanese conflict. In a document that has just been  handed to the news desk of La Voix du Zaire, General Eluki Monga  Awundu says that Zairian territory does not serve and will not  serve as a base for the incursion of foreign troops to settle an  internal problem that does not concern Zaire. The problems  between the SPLA and the Sudanese Armed Forces are purely  internal to the Sudanese people, the document added. It  concluded: The Zairian Armed Forces do not intend to support  either of the two forces and urge the Sudanese to settle their  problems like brothers.</p>

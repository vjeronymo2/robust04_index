			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.L.: "Kolodziejczyk Is Like a Raindrop"] </F>   [Text] "We do not really like the concept proposed by NATO,  which stresses the precedence of Poland's economic integration  with the West and envisions the road via the West European Union  and only then rapprochement with NATO as the first step. We  recently talked about this openly in Brussels," we were told by  National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who along with  Aleksander Luczak, deputy prime minister and national education  minister, signed at the National Education Ministry [MEN]  yesterday an agreement on interministerial cooperation.    According to Kolodziejczyk, military integration with  Western  Europe must take place simultaneously with economic integration,  and it should be even more rapid. The minister said that he is  determined to force this stand and be as consistent as "a  raindrop that is persistently eroding a hole in a rock." The  Atlantic Cooperation Council should give some thought to the  most recent proposals by Russian Defense Minister Grachev  concerning the extension of CSCE activities; however, work on  such concepts should not be a mechanism blocking the processes  of integration of some countries with proven systems in the West  European security.    National Defense Committee [KOK] Secretary Jerzy Milewski,  who took part in the meeting in MEN, said yesterday that most  probably next week KOK would hold a session, which was announced  at the last meeting of the government. One of the issues to be  discussed at the session is, among other topics, the  controversial issue of the position of the head of the General  Staff. The national defense minister is of the opinion that  even in a short transition period -- for a year or two -- the  issue should be regulated, before it is finally decided in the  Constitution. This view is shared by Milewski. "Today the  situation is still unsteady; everything depends on the current  opinion of the president or the members of the government," he  claims.    According to the first deputy minister of national defense,  on the basis of the Small Constitution it is not possible to  take any radical steps aimed at clearing any doubts concerning  the issue of subordinating the General Staff head. Therefore, a  compensatory balance will be unavoidable. "The minister bears  constitutional responsibility for the ministry that he is in  charge of, including the Army, and these prerogatives cannot be  changed for the time being. Political agreement between the  Belveder and the coalition concerning the inviolability of the  Small Constitution is in force," says Milewski. "The president  is also responsible for the Armed Forces because he is the  commander in chief. The fact that the president appoints the  General Staff head after consulting the minister -- not at his  request -- leads us to conclude that the legislator wanted to  guarantee the president `direct transmission' [as published] to  the Armed Forces, not merely as general supervision through the  minister." Milewski believes that during a calm, rational  debate, after the "issue is positioned" properly, it will be  possible to reconcile all the stands, and satisfy the needs of  both the Belvedere and the government. Political conclusions  might be included, for example, in an interim law on the office  of the minister of national defense and the office of the head  of the General Staff.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The National Council decided unanimously at  today's three-hour meeting that discussions on the  confidence-building measures have been terminated.    In a statement after the National Council meeting,  Government  Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the decision was made due to  the lack of political will by the Turkish side, which has been  ascertained by the UN secretary general. The spokesman also  noted that the National Council examined options that the Greek  Cypriot side should support, and added that these options will  be finalized at a National Council meeting scheduled for 0900  tomorrow.

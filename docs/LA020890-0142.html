			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BRUISING BATTLE A TURNING POINT IN SOVIET HISTORY  </P> <P> In the Kremlin battles that shape the future of the Soviet Union and much of  the world around it, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has prevailed once again in his  unrelenting determination to bring about political and economic reform.  </P> <P> At a time when his domestic popularity had declined sharply and his political  grip seemed to have slipped to the point where rumors of his resignation were  credible, the Soviet president led the Communist Party on Wednesday into giving  up its long monopoly on political power.  </P> <P> Confronted with a deepening political, economic and social crisis in the  country and the belief of many that his reforms are largely responsible,  Gorbachev persuaded the party's policy-making and largely conservative Central  Committee that perestroika must be broadened and accelerated, not curtailed or  slowed.  </P> <P> After three days of debate, the 250-member committee voted to accept  Gorbachev's new platform for the party, at least as a basis for discussion at  the party congress planned for early summer, and only one person -- populist  Boris N. Yeltsin, who thought it not radical enough -- voted against it.  </P> <P> Although the full extent of that victory will not be clear until the platform  is published, Gorbachev's supporters within the leadership were already  speaking of the party's decision to share power as a turning point in Soviet  history.  </P> <P> "This was a step of exceptional magnitude in our party's history, a landmark,"  Alexander N. Yakovlev, one of Gorbachev's closest supporters in the party's  ruling Politburo, said, asserting that in importance the adoption of the new  party platform exceeds all the reforms undertaken in the past five years.  </P> <P> But the debate was bruising.  </P> <P> Gorbachev was attacked by conservatives for ideological errors, by local party  leaders for mismanagement, by nominal supporters for attempting to do too much  and go too fast and by one old and embittered Byelorussian politician for  overweening political and personal ambitions.  </P> <P> "Our discussion was not just a series of friendly embraces," Yakovlev told  journalists at the end of the meeting. "There was not a paragraph in the  platform on which we did not have a debate or a discussion or an argument.  There were heated and emotional debates, and sometimes it moved beyond the  limits of a polite and friendly discussion.  </P> <P> "There are people who still very closely associate themselves with old-time  methods, old-time customs and who very highly evaluate the stability and  comfort of days past. Then there are people who welcome the changes and support  them, and there are also people who are less patient, who are eager to see more  rapid changes and who tend to take more radical attitudes.  </P> <P> "The task of a politician in any country is to take those attitudes and strive  for a consensus," Yakovlev continued. "Otherwise, he would not live up to his  role as a political leader because we cannot just brush some of the opinions  aside and turn a deaf ear to others. This is not the way things are worked out  in a democratic society."  </P> <P> In anticipation of just such a prolonged and sharp debate, the Central  Committee meeting had been scheduled to last two days, rather than the normal  one. Instead, it ran three, still finishing three hours later than planned  Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> The conservatives forced changes in the platform -- Yakovlev called them  "minor" but acknowledged the rewriting had continued to 4 a.m. two days in a  row -- but they could not defeat it.  </P> <P> "There was no alternative, absolutely none," eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov,  who attended the meeting as an observer, said as he left the Kremlin on  Wednesday evening. "Gorbachev let them say what they wanted, but it was really,  as you Americans say, their last hurrah. Even as they spoke, they knew they had  no alternative."  </P> <P> But few, even among Gorbachev's liberal supporters, appeared to understand the  logic for move -- his carefully weighed political bet that the party's image  would be enhanced if it stood ready to take on all comers in the political  arena, that the power it has held for so long was corrupting it and that only  through offering to give it up did the party have a hope of retaining it.  </P> <P> The conservatives, anticipating Gorbachev's move to free the party from such  political responsibility, had begun their attacks on him within the Central  Committee in December, according to two senior party officials. They reached a  level during this plenary meeting that had not been heard since Nikita S.  Khrushchev was ousted in 1964.  </P> <P> The criticism, according to accounts published in the party newspaper Pravda,  came from across much of the Soviet political spectrum: from conservatives who  thought he was going too far, from radicals who accused him of timidity in not  moving faster, even from liberals who, like others, have been dismayed by the  failure of perestroika to resolve the country's problems.  </P> <P> The old-line conservatives, traditional in their orthodoxy, said plainly that  they could not accept many of the basic concepts in the reforms -- the party's  decision to give up its "leading role" in the government and society, the  inclusion of privately owned enterprises in the mixed economy, the readiness to  let the country's constituent republics go their own way, the reduction of the  country's military might through unilateral moves, the setbacks suffered by  socialism in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Others, regional and local party officials, who clearly fear loss of their  power -- even their jobs -- under the new system, focused on the need to  restore order and discipline amid the chaos created, they contended, by early  reforms. Those reforms were poorly conceived and haphazardly executed, they  charged.  </P> <P> Many of these officials will probably not survive the forthcoming government  and party elections, and Gorbachev spoke several times of the need to "renew"  the Central Committee and the Politburo at the party congress, which is planned  for June or early July.  </P> <P> For Gorbachev, the question remains, as it has after each of these political  battles in recent years, of what he will do with his enhanced authority, with  the broadened reforms. He has repeatedly sought and obtained greater powers to  push through even more sweeping reforms only to find new obstacles that must be  cleared.  </P> <P> The paradox of his leadership has, as a result, become his ability to win such  showdowns in the Kremlin but his inability to reap those victories in the  factories, on the farms and in the troubled provinces.  </P> <P> "After this, I do not think that he can continue to blame the conservatives for  compromising his program," a Soviet political commentator remarked Wednesday  evening. "He has what he asked for, and now he must make it work."  </P></p>

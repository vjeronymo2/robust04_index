			<p>CSO     [Text] According to Fernando Gonzalez, the  undersecretary of fisheries, the productive sectors, especially  those of the banana and fishing industries, should cooperate to  repair the damage to the environment and the pollution of the  Gulf of Guayaquil.    Guayaquil Staff--Fernando Gonzalez, undersecretary of  fisheries, emphasized that the productive sectors devoted to  banana growing and catching marine resources are responsible for  polluting the Gulf of Guayaquil and damaging the country's  ecosystem.    The fisheries undersecretary remarked: "We have been  irresponsible in using these resources," and called upon those  involved in these activities to participate intensively in  ecosystem rehabilitation programs.    He added that Taura syndrome, a disease that seriously harms  shrimp production, and the pollution of the gulf are due largely  to the use of chemical products.    The shrimp fishermen have held banana producers responsible  for Taura syndrome and for the pollution of the Gulf of  Guayaquil, owing to the indiscriminate, excessive use of  pesticides in the battle against the black sigatoka fungus.    In Fernando Gonzalez's opinion, all this has created a  conflict that should be resolved immediately, through the use of  suitable methods and consensus.    When the national government learned that two major sectors  of the Ecuadoran economy were at stake, it ordered the ministers  of agriculture and industries to work jointly to reconcile these  industries. The aim is to prevent either of them from being  harmed, and also from damaging the ecosystem.    Gonzalez noted that the National Banana Program has devised  regulations for the use of pesticides, adopting proposals from  the National Chamber of Aquaculture to avoid damage to the  ecosystem.    Fernando Gonzalez indicated that the problem is global. The  estuaries associated with the Guayas Basin have been used by  many industries for a long time, and this has caused congestion  in the ecosystem.    Since August 1992, the National Institute of Fisheries has  been monitoring (investigating) the Gulf of Guayaquil and Guayas  Basin, by establishing 12 stations around various shrimp  production companies. He said that, within the next few days,  the institute will submit the reports received on the  investigations.    Undersecretary Gonzalez also cited the series of  prohibitions  and bans issued in the insular Galapagos Province.    He noted that President Sixto Duran Ballen had sent a  commission comprised of the national defense, agriculture, and  tourism ministers, to determine the real problems besetting one  of that province's leading economic activities, namely, fishing.    He gave a reminder that there have been prohibitions in  Galapagos that have not adhered to legal specifications called  for in the Ecuadoran juridical system, nor to technical  specifications with which they should have been prepared.    The prohibitions were issued because it seemed fitting to  certain authorities or parties concerned, but without any  technical criterion, much less a scientific criterion.    He added that the Ministerial Commission will determine the  means for resolving this situation, making it possible to  prevent the depredation of marine resources.    Gonzalez commented: "In principle, any resource is  susceptible to exploitation so long as it is done with a view  toward sustained use. However, continental business firms must  be prevented from going to Galapagos and hurting the interests  of the Galapagos nonindustrial fleet, consisting of small  insular fishermen."    "The continental companies went to the archipelago,  plundered  the crawfish and sea cucumber, and were replaced later by  others."    He added: "To avoid this series of violations against the  marine resources, it is planned to create a Sub-Directorate of  Fisheries, with jurisdiction in Galapagos. The 56 forest wardens  on the islands will be given the responsibility for being  converted into 56 fishing inspectors."</p>

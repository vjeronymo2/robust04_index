			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bai Hua (4101 2901): "Mao Zedong Inherits </F> Monarchical Dictatorial Tradition"]    [Text] Another lonely century. With countless centuries  behind it, one more century means hardly anything to China. For  a generation or two, however, a century covers its entire  life-span.    Eighteen ninety-three. Year 19 of the reign of Emperor  Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. At 21, Guangxu had nominally taken  over the reins of government for 4 years after coming of age. It  was a time when everybody, from the emperor to his ministers and  subjects, was committed to strengthening China.    In September, the Shanghai Mechanical Textile Factory, which  produced 600 bolts of cloth every day, was burned down. Li  Hongzhang [2621 7703 4545] petitioned for its rebuilding. Cheng  Xuanhuai [4141 1357 2037] was instructed to go to Shanghai. In  Hubei, Zhang Zhidong [1728 0037 3159] set up a  self-strengthening academy offering instruction in four  disciplines: foreign languages, mathematics, natural science,  and commerce. Lenin, 23, left Samara for St. Petersburg.  Tchaikovsky, the Russian musician, died, leaving mankind a  stream of beautiful music that would never run dry. In Britain,  textile workers and coal miners went on strike one after  another. In Spain, anarchists set off bombs in the two cities of  Santander and Barcelona, probably the first acts of terrorism.  An economic crisis erupted in the United States. To finance the  construction of warships for use in military actions against  China, the Japanese emperor issued an imperial edict cutting the  salaries of civilian officials by 10 percent and dismissing  3,000 bureaucrats, thus saving 1.7 million Japanese yen.  <H5>  Mao Zedong Born Into a Troubled World </H5>   Mao Zedong was born in a tiny mountain village on 26  December, a time when China was plagued by domestic strife and  foreign invasion. The following year China suffered a disastrous  defeat at sea in the Sino-Japanese War. This convinced Sun  Yat-sen, the pioneer of democracy, that China must reform across  the board if it was to strengthen itself. So he set up  Xingzhonghui in Honolulu. Those were troubled times all over the  world. The great turmoil wrought on by the desire for survival,  for development, energized human thinking like never before.  Because of Lenin's passionate actions in Russia, Marxism became  a worldwide movement. Mao Zedong was born at the right time.  Although his successes and failures belong in the past, they  still help shape China today.  <H5>  Adopting Marxist-Leninist Theory of Class Struggle </H5>   A century ago, both China's national sovereignty and  imperial  power were in the hands of a weak and incompetent ruler. This  made a profound impact on young Mao Zedong, rural-born but  lettered. Every Chinese peasant dreamed about a mansion fit for  a king, even the Forbidden City with all its splendor.    Mao Zedong was no exception. He had read all the classics,  inheriting lock, stock, and barrel that part of Chinese culture  in which he had an interest. Since China was then an isolated  empire, Mao Zedong had no knowledge of any foreign language,  which prevented him from absorbing much of the fruit of human  thinking outside China. He benefited the most from the theory of  class differentiation as presented in popular Marxist-Leninist  pamphlets and made it absolute. During the age of land  revolution, this spiritual fruit miraculously turned into a  material force capable of mobilizing the peasants.    After the PRC was founded, the class struggle theory, having  been made absolute, went international. As a result, China at  peace remained in isolation for years even as one domestic  struggle followed another on the home front. What should be  affirmed is this: Mao Zedong took a firm and hard-line position  in safeguarding national sovereignty even if it meant isolating  China and falling out and subsequently clashing with the Soviet  Union after Khrushchev came into power.    From ancient books and historical texts Mao Zedong later got  to learn even more about the experiences of emperors in  successive dynasties in subjugating their subjects. He never  shied away from acting imperial in matters of both style and  substance, adopting the way of might as well as the kingly way.  As they said, "The style of Emperor Wen and Emperor Wu was to be  strict and liberal in turns." From the Yanan rectification  movement of the 1940's to the anti-rightist struggle, Mao Zedong  copied the best that literary inquisition in one dynasty after  dynasty had to offer. Through confession movements effected by  compulsion, Mao Zedong sought to eradicate unspoken criticism.  Tragically, the overwhelming majority of intellectuals did not  set out to slander Mao Zedong out of malice. Instead, they were  persecuted for speaking their minds. Some were even motivated by  a desire to curry favor with him.  <H5>  Mainland Intellectuals Trapped in Historical Vicious Circle </H5>   Mao Zedong's attack on intellectuals was indeed a huge  success. Only years later did people realize that he simply  would not let you have a voice. The only thing he would let you  do was to listen with respectful attention, not even repeat his  words. In the anti-rightist movement, some people were attacked  as rightists precisely because they repeated some of Mao  Zedong's words as yet unpublished at the time.    By the time the Cultural Revolution broke out, people no  longer knew what to believe. On the other hand, they dared not  omit a single word. Any documents co-signed by the CPC Central  Committee, the central military commission, the CPC Cultural  Revolutionary Committee, and the State Council might become  wrongly transmitted imperial edicts overnight. Mao Zedong's  closest comrades-in-arms might end up as conspirators the next  day. All the masses in every faction in the civil war during the  Cultural Revolution were blind followers who repeated every  single one of Mao Zedong's words a thousand times. Many of the  ways, voluntary and compulsory, in which these people pledged  their loyalty to Mao Zedong reminded us of the scenes that took  place under a corrupt monarchy. But Mao Zedong had no qualms at  all, which goes to show that not even he could break the vicious  circle in Chinese history (The hopes of the Chinese people rose  and fell with dynastic succession). If nothing else he admired  monarchical authority in spite of himself. In his old age he  genuinely believed his words were the golden truth.    After his death, Mao Zedong was roundly criticized by many  people for his personal conduct. As he himself had said, there  is no perfect human being, just as there is no perfect gold. In  all fairness, Mao Zedong was largely free from corruption. He  was a diligent thinker, determined, courageous, and hardy and  frugal in his personal habits. He was a precocious military  commander who took war as his instructor, a propagandist and  agitator who had a profound understanding of Chinese peasants  and enjoyed their strong support. In the pre-1949 war years, he  had a knack for spotting talented people and putting them in the  right positions. Moreover, he was a charming poet and lover.    Certainly many emperors who founded or engineered the  resurgence of a dynasty also possessed these qualities. In 500  B.C., King Goujian of Yue was defeated in battle and lost his  kingdom. Enduring humiliation in order to carry out an important  mission, he even refused to "eat any grain not grown by himself  and wear any clothes not woven by his queen." What happened in  the end? After conquering the Kingdom of Wu, he sentenced Wen  Zhong to death and sent Fan Li into exile. Goujian went down the  same road that all other kings and emperors had gone down  before. In its entirety Mao Zedong's legacy is worth far less  than the ill-gotten gains of some village chief in China today.  His inheritance consists mainly of the royalties on his writings.  <H5>  Paying a Hefty Price for Personality Cult </H5>   My screenplay "Bitter Love" came under attack in 1981. I was  particularly taken to task for a minor scene in which the  leading character, then a child, asked the elder of a temple,  "How come Buddha's face is black?" The elder replied, "His face  has been blackened by the incense burned by the worshippers."    There is no denying the truth I am referring to: The  cause-and-effect relationship between the worshipped and the  worshipper in Chinese history. The Chinese paid a steep price  for Mao Zedong's personality cult. Years of political struggle  retarded production growth for long periods of time. The Great  Leap Forward caused a mass famine. The disillusionment resulting  from the Cultural Revolution caused a nervous breakdown among  the entire population. In the end Mao Zedong's face was  blackened by the incense burned by hundreds of millions of  worshippers. Then came the Tiananmen incident during the  Qingming Festival in 1976. Only then did Mao Zedong see his own  blackened face in tens of thousands of eyes. The man, who had  been spiritually tough and physically strong, never recovered  from this episode.    Chinese intellectuals in the late 1940's firmly believed  that  the Chinese nation would henceforth be strong and the nation  would prosper and live in peace. They also believed that all  past, present, and future successes should be attributed to Mao  Zedong Thought, that Mao Zedong Thought was invincible, and that  it was the beacon for the people of China and even the whole  world. In short, Mao Zedong was perceived as an omnipotent god.  <H5>  Please Open the Door of One's Mind </H5>   Most Chinese intellectuals gave up the right to independent  thinking of their own accord. Many scholars regressed into  juvenile or infantile thinking. Because of their intellectual  sloppiness, they became either wolf-like or sheep-like.  Intellectuals were completely stripped of their independent  personality. In addition, a succession of political movements  objectively drove home the grim fact that other than Mao Zedong,  it was harmful and downright dangerous for anybody else to even  think. No matter how senior their positions, however solid their  credentials, they would all come to grief (Real-life examples  include Liu Shaoqi [0491 1421 1142] and Peng Dehuai [1756 1795  2037]).    There was a time when people of the Mao Zedong era  congratulated themselves on the existence of Mao Zedong. Later  they rejoiced over his passing from the scene. No leader,  however great, can guarantee a nation's stable sustained  development. What is needed is a political system that entrusts  hope, democracy, and freedom to the people and where the people  can effectively supervise and replace public servants, including  the No. 1 public servant.    Another century. With countless centuries behind it, one  more  century, one less century does not mean anything to China. For a  generation or two, however, a century covers its entire  life-span.    Today, at long last, China has changed its course and headed  toward the world. China must shed its isolation, poverty, and  degeneration. But it must never again long for the birth of  another great helmsman. For starters, everybody must unlock the  door to his thinking, something that requires courage and  strength because for too long he has been held prisoner  ideologically. Then every door in China must be opened to let in  fresh air. One door, however, must not be opened, namely the  heavy door leading to the imperial throne.    (Bai Hua is a Shanghai writer.

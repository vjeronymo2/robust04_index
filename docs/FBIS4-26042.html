			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan: "State Opens The Door for More Foreign Law </F> Offices"]    [Text] The number of foreign law firms allowed to open  offices in China will be more than doubled within the next two  years, a Ministry of Justice official said yesterday.    Pending approval of the State Council, up to 100 foreign law  firms will be allowed to set up branches in the country, up from  the present 41, according to Du Guoxing, deputy director of the  lawyers' administration department with the ministry.    Foreign law firms will also be allowed to open in more  coastal cities and provincial capitals than just the current  five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and  Haikou, Du noted.    Du made the announcement at a seminar yesterday on China's  first Foreign Trade Law, which takes effect July 1.    The seminar was co-sponsored by the International Business  newspaper and the APC Law Firm, both based in Beijing.    Attending the seminar were more than 20 law experts,  managers  and officials, including senior officials from the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.    Due to China's rapid economic growth and rising business  opportunities, more foreign law firms have applied for  permission to enter the potentially huge Chinese market.    So far, about 80 foreign law firms have applied with the  Ministry of Justice to open offices in the mainland. They must  also register with the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce.    The country first allowed foreign law firms to set up  branches in the mainland on an experimental basis in July 1992.    Experience has shown that the experiment is a success, said  Du, adding that the overseas law firms play an active role in  helping more foreign investors enter the Chinese market,  promoting Sino-foreign cooperation and training Chinese lawyers.    An Australian law firm office, for instance, helped  introduce  nearly 30 foreign investment projects to China in just one year.    Meanwhile, China will also encourage more Chinese law firms  to open offices abroad. At present, there are only two Chinese  law firms that have opened offices abroad, Du said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Germany Will Supply Equipment as Aid </F> to the Rivne Nuclear Power Station"]    [Text] By the end of 1995, the Rivne Nuclear Power Station  will receive equipment worth 21 million German marks from  Germany. This was agreed upon during a meeting at the nuclear  facility between representatives of the Society for the Safety  of Nuclear Reactors and of the German firms "Siemens," "ABB,"  and "Lloyd."    Following the interstate agreement, the German side will  provide equipment for the periodic inspection of metals and  diagnostics, telecommunications equipment, and fire-proof  materials. This will make it possible to modernize the  functioning power unit with its output of 1 million  kilowatt/hours. Assembly operations will be carried out by  Rivne nuclear specialists with the help of specialists from  various German companies assigned by the Society for the Safety  of Nuclear Reactors, taking into account their experience in  organizing and implementing measures to increase nuclear safety.</p>

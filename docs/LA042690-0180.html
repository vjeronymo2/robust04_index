			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH &amp; FITNESS;  </P> <P> ATTAINING THE BODY BEAUTIFUL;  </P> <P> MARKET GROWS FOR FOODS AU NATUREL;  </P> <P> MORE GROCERS CATER TO PEOPLE SEEKING PESTICIDE-FREE PRODUCE, CRUELTY-FREE MEAT  </P> <P> "We call ourselves social carnivores," says Donna Knoy of Mission Viejo as she  stands among the displays of organic produce at The Natural Grocer in Laguna  Niguel.  </P> <P> "My husband still likes red meat occasionally, but most of the time we eat  primarily vegetables, grains, nuts, fruits," she says of her family of four,  which includes a 4-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son.  </P> <P> "I would much rather have vegetables than meat. It takes 13 pounds of grain to  make one pound of meat and I'm ethically against that," she says.  </P> <P> She admits that some of the organic produce costs more than commercial produce,  but she thinks it's worth it because it's grown without pesticides.  </P> <P> Knoy isn't alone.  </P> <P> A lot of other people in Orange County are worried about what most Americans  are eating. They are worried about the thousands of pesticides and chemicals  that are used on vegetables, fruits and grains. They are worried about how far  removed from its natural state much of our diet has become.  </P> <P> They are worried about our planet and how we can continue to feed its  burgeoning population. And they are worried about what some perceive as cruelty  to animals in our food chain.  </P> <P> These concerns have created a growing demand for food that is as close as  possible to its natural state. And this demand has given birth to a new kind of  grocery store in Orange County.  </P> <P> The Natural Grocer as well as Mother's Market and Kitchen in Costa Mesa and  Huntington Beach are among a number of grocery stores in Southern California  that specialize in organic and non-processed foods, with a heavy emphasis on  vegetarian diets. In Los Angeles County, for example, Mrs. Gooch's Natural  Foods has seven stores.  </P> <P> Many health food stores carry some organic foods, and even a few supermarkets,  including Pavilions and Mayfair markets, carry a small amount of organic  produce. But The Natural Grocer, Mother's Market and Mrs. Gooch's represent a  whole new idea -- a full-service grocery store devoted to a lifestyle that  centers on healthy eating.  </P> <P> Mother's was started 13 years ago so that shoppers would have "access to  high-quality whole foods without having to go to the old-style mom and pop  health food stores, which were primarily vitamin shops," says Steven Markell,  vice president of operations for the market.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach store opened five years ago. Each location includes a  restaurant, a health food delicatessen, a large selection of health-related  books and a cosmetic counter.  </P> <P> "When we started, the store was one-quarter the size that it currently is,"  Markell says of the 11,000-square-foot Costa Mesa store. "The fact of our  success demonstrates an increased concern and awareness on the part of our  Orange County community of the importance of whole, clean foods."  </P> <P> By whole, clean foods, Markell means organic fruits and vegetables grown  without chemicals and pesticides, and minimally processed and packaged foods  that lack additives such as preservatives and artificial flavors and colors,  that are low in fat and salt, that have little or no sugar, and are minimally  processed.  </P> <P> The Natural Grocer opened in August to serve the needs of South County health  food enthusiasts, according to store manager Vickie Stern.  </P> <P> "We're more like a natural foods grocery store" than a health food store, Stern  says. "We're a full-service grocery store. We not only have all our natural  foods you would find in a health food store, but we've got a very large produce  department, which most health food stores don't have. We have a beautiful  cosmetic counter. . . . We have a jewelry and crystal gallery and we have a  full-service deli and bakery with a lot of gourmet vegetarian items."  </P> <P> The Natural Grocer carries no meat because it is a completely vegetarian store,  according to Stern. Mother's Market, however, carries "free-range" chickens and  turkeys -- poultry allowed to roam free rather than being raised in cages.  </P> <P> Markell says these items are offered because "there is a demand for it and we  try to be as conscientious as we can." He points out, however, that this  particular poultry is selected because it is grown without hormones and other  growth stimulants.  </P> <P> "We're a cruelty-free store," Stern says. "It just means there's no harm  inflicted on any animals . . . to create any of the products in our store."  </P> <P> In view of the cases of veggie burgers and tofu pups (made from a soybean-based  product), the large bins of bulk foods and baby food made from organic  vegetables may seem a bit odd to the unschooled, but shoppers at these markets  find the bins invaluable.  </P> <P> "I would like to feed my family as few artificial chemicals as I can," Susan  Rousset of Newport Beach said while shopping at Mother's. "I just prefer that  and also, I like to support the farmers that do want to maintain the earth as  best they can."  </P> <P> Rousset is experimenting with a macrobiotic diet -- whole grains, beans,  vegetables and moderate amounts of seafood and fruit. But she still cooks meat  occasionally for her six children, ranging in age from 4 to 16. She says,  however, that they are mostly vegetarians too.  </P> <P> This varied approach to vegetarianism is not unusual. There are several schools  of thought, according to Markell. There are lacto-ovo vegetarians, who eat  dairy products, eggs, grains, fruits, legumes and vegetables. Then there are  those who will eat all of those items except eggs or all of those items except  dairy products.  </P> <P> Then there are vegans, who eat only plant source foods.  </P> <P> And there are people who are not fully vegetarians yet, but want to eat in a  more healthy manner, according to Markell.  </P> <P> But is vegetarianism really a healthy way to eat?  </P> <P> "There's nothing wrong with vegetarianism," says Grant Gwinup, M.D., a  professor of endocrinology and metabolism at UCI Medical Center. "The only  studies available suggest that vegetarians live longer than non-vegetarians . .  . but it's hard to know how other factors contribute to that increased  longevity."  </P> <P> The main thing vegetarians need to worry about, he says, is the lack of vitamin  B-12 and iron. Vegetables don't contain B-12, he says, and women run the risk  of getting too little iron when not eating meat. But this does not mean  vegetarians should automatically take vitamins and iron supplements, he says.  As for the iron, he says that can be solved by using an iron Dutch oven when  cooking vegetable casseroles.  </P> <P> Gwinup says it's a good idea for vegetarians to have their blood checked once a  year to watch for any anemias that might result from these deficiencies.  </P> <P> He says that while vegetarians frequently claim perfect health, "there's no  magic in it. There's no evidence that it has medicinal properties or protective  properties." Yet, vegetarians interviewed while they were shopping at Mother's  and The Natural Grocer say they absolutely have never felt better.  </P> <P> Chef Julie Faust, who supervises the delicatessen at The Natural Grocer, says  she talks to a lot of newcomers to vegetarianism as well as people who are  gradually changing the way they eat. She says the clientele in the Laguna  Niguel store is different from that of most health food stores she has worked  in.  </P> <P> "It's very yuppie. The people here are just learning how to do things without  meat," she says. That's why she calls the fare in her delicatessen "a yup-scale  version of health food. . . . They go for the lasagna, the pizza, the spinach  pies," because it's at least familiar, she says.  </P> <P> Her goal is to provide the same taste and flavor found in gourmet restaurants,  but without the fat and meat. This means low-fat pizza and dishes like Santa Fe  Lasagna, which has noodles, black beans, chopped chilies and peppers, corn,  spicy salsa and either jalapeno cheese or creamy cilantro tofu.  </P> <P> While the delicatessens in the stores do a thriving business, the produce areas  are also popular. Yet, the produce signs may also seem a bit odd to the  newcomer. Each item is clearly labeled either organic, transitional or  commercial.  </P> <P> To be classified as organic, fruits and vegetables are grown in accordance with  the California Health and Safety Code, Section 26569.11, according to Jaime  Arteaga assistant information officer of the California Department of Health  Services.  </P> <P> This means perennial crops and their soil must be free of synthetically  compounded fertilizers, growth regulators and pesticides for a year before the  appearance of buds on the crop and throughout the entire growing season. Annual  and two-year crops and their soil must be free of the same substances for 12  months before seed planting and throughout the growing and harvest season.  </P> <P> Transitional produce is currently being grown without pesticides, but in soil  that has not been free of chemicals long enough to qualify as organic.  Commercial produce is what you find in most grocery stores. Mother's and The  Natural Grocer carry some commercial produce to offer a wider variety of items,  because sometimes the selection of organic produce is too limited.  </P> <P> Gwinup says, however, that there are really no such things as organic or  natural foods. "What it should be is pesticide-free or pesticide-low. . . . And  even that's very dicey because if you go some place that sells so-called  pesticide-free food and you analyze it for pesticides, it's going to have some.  There's nothing in the world that doesn't have a speck of pesticide."  </P> <P> He says that even pesticide-free fields sometimes suffer from over-spray from a  neighboring farm using pesticides, because the chemicals can be carried in the  wind.  </P> <P> "With today's level of technical ability to analyze ingredients of foods, we  can get parts per billion, parts per trillion," Markell agrees.  </P> <P> But, he says, that's missing the point. He says that "toxic load" is the real  concern. "The whole thing is not about being chemical-free in our lives, but  reducing our exposure every little bit we can."  </P> <P> Markell says one argument goes that pesticides have never been proven to be  harmful, but that it's also true that they've never been proven to be safe. "So  what's true is it's a crap shoot and we really don't know what the long-term  cumulative effects are."  </P> <P> But, he says, we do know that cancer, birth defects and other health problems  may be increasing in the population as a whole. "And the question is why?" he  says. "The answer is complicated, but includes many factors of which this issue  is one."  </P></p>

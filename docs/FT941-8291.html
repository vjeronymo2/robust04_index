			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / South-west regroups forces after military blow: A look at three counties' efforts to diversify their defence-dominated economies Next month staff will move into a wisteria-clad regency building in Chippenham, Wiltshire, as part of one initiative to tackle the biggest challenge facing the south-west's economy - diversification away from defence. The south-west has been identified by the Department of Trade and Industry as having the highest defence dependency in the country. Within that region Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Avon are seen as highly vulnerable to cuts in defence industries and military services. The three counties have more than 70 military bases and Ministry of Defence civilian centres, 45 large defence manufacturers and hundreds of suppliers. Defence-related employment is put at 110,000 people or more than 11 per cent of the working population. But in Wiltshire alone, 11 military bases are closing or running down in the next few years. Faced with this pay-off from the peace dividend, the three counties formed a unique collaboration last year to bid jointly for European Konver funds, which are intended to aid areas suffering from the rundown in defence spending. The bid quoted forecasts that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in the three counties by the year 2000. In December the south-west was awarded the largest single tranche of the funds, Pounds 2.5m of the total Pounds 15.5m UK allocation. Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire won the biggest share in the south-west with a grant of Pounds 1.3m. Mr Richard Brown, chief executive of the Western Development Partnership, an economic forum involved in the bid, says: 'We got the money because we had a strategy, but also because of the partnership approach.' The Konver money, which has to be matched locally, is now starting to be allocated to specific projects. Among these is the Chippenham regency building, in which a business development centre is being set up with Pounds 100,000 of European funding over two years. The centre's partners include the county council, which helped to buy the building, Wiltshire Training and Enterprise Council, and Workout, a charity which advises redundant MoD staff. In addition to training and consultancy services the centre will provide help in the take-up of new technology. Mr Norman Hayes, of Great Western Enterprise, one of the partners, says it will work closely with Chippenham Technical College and in particular aims to support companies employing fewer than 150 people. 'We want them to have the advantage of every possible resource to adapt their products to meet market demand as they swing away from defence,' he says. Other Konver projects in the three counties include feasibility studies for the reuse of redundant military bases and a business-networking scheme. One of the most significant projects, which won a grant of Pounds 240,000, is for a technology and innovation management team, co-ordinated by Western Development Partnership. Its aim is to develop a flow of technology between industry and higher-education institutions. It will offer advice on new product development and marketing and refer small and medium-size companies to colleges or other institutions for help with, for example, product testing. A team of three counsellors will tour companies, providing free advice for up to a day. One idea is to provide technology and innovation vouchers up to a value of Pounds 600. Awarded at the discretion of the counsellors, companies will be able to exchange the vouchers at colleges or research centres to meet half the cost of specialist work and services. The Konver funding is the first time the three counties have benefited from any government or European-funded initiatives for economic diversification. But, compared with the scale of the task in adapting labour skills and encouraging companies to innovate, there is a belief that Konver is only skimming the surface. 'The amount of money which has been won for this region is welcome but inadequate,' says Ms Linda Skinner, director of the Centre for Innovation and Industry at the University of the West of England in Bristol. 'We will be pressing hard for more resources to flow. 'Our research shows that, at present, many businesses are not aware that they are defence-dependent, particularly where they are second and third level in a supply chain.' Mr Adrian Kendry, of the university's research unit in defence economics, says: 'One senses that the Konver programme is being used by the British government as the lowest common denominator in getting involved in any serious restructuring. While the Konver programme is laudable, it fails to address the magnitude of what is required.'</p>

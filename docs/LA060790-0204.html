			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> INCREASE SLATED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ONLY  </P> <P> Costa Mesa would spend far more on police and fire services in the coming year  under the proposed 1990-91 budget.  </P> <P> The proposed budget, presented to the City Council by City Manager Allan L.  Roeder on Monday night, would add $1.1 million over the current budget for  public safety -- the only area of city government slated for an increase -- and  decrease transportation funding by $15.4 million.  </P> <P> Police and fire protection represents nearly half the total expenditures for  the city in the proposed budget.  </P> <P> Roeder asked the council to consider hiring two additional police officers to  enhance the city's two-member driving-under-the-influence team, which averages  1,200 arrests annually. In addition, he asked that two police aides be hired to  help with crime scene investigations and report-taking. Roeder said the added  personnel would free up officers for more police functions.  </P> <P> He also proposed maintaining the Police Department's educational program, DARE  America (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), in Costa Mesa schools.  </P> <P> In addition, the budget calls for $1.7 million to build the Sakioka Fire  Station by January, 1992. That amount, however, does not include the costs for  equipment or personnel, which will be funded after the station is built.  </P> <P> Overall, the $62.3-million budget is 13% lower than the 1989-90 budget.  Although revenue from sales and property taxes is expected to increase $3.1  million, total revenue is down largely because of a 36.7% decrease in interest  earned on time deposits, which Roeder blamed on lower cash balances for the  year.  </P> <P> A major reason for the drop in transportation funding is that last year's  budget included $4.2 million in capital improvement projects funded by Measure  C. The measure, passed in 1987, allowed the city to override the Gann limit on  government spending and use the funds for street improvements. Those funds will  run out June 30.  </P> <P> The retail sales tax and bed tax remain the city's major revenue source,  representing 45.3% of the total revenues, or $29.2 million.  </P> <P> The council will review the budget at a study session at 1 p.m. Monday in the  fifth-floor conference room at City Hall.  </P> <P> The public will be able to comment on the budget before the council votes on  it, at its regularly scheduled meeting June 18.

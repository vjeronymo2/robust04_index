			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHENEY GLOSSES OVER DISPARITY ON GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today played down an apparent disparity between  his assessment of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances of  implementing reforms and the opinion held by President Bush.  </P> <P> "The President and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly chuckled at what  has developed by way of press commentary on views that we have expressed. We do  not perceive a significant difference in terms of our views of the situation  with respect to the Soviet Union," Cheney told the Senate Armed Services  Committee.  </P> <P> The defense secretary, who has been on the job for less than two months,  created a stir last week when he predicted that Gorbachev would fail at  instituting reforms in the Soviet Union and would be replaced by a hard-liner.  </P> <P> He also said the United States should not take any unilateral steps, such as  removing some of the U.S. troops stationed in Europe, in response to the Soviet  changes.  </P> <P> Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White House Chief of Staff John  H. Sununu quickly offered more hopeful assessments about Gorbachev's efforts.  </P> <P> The defense secretary conceded today that he "responded previously the other  day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view . . . somewhat  pessimistic concerning Mr. Gorbachev's prospect for achieving his reforms."  </P></p>

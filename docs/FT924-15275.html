			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / EC to seek pacts with ex-Soviet republics THE European Community should negotiate broad trade agreements with the former Soviet republics, EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday. It will begin with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, is to visit Brussels later this year to discuss bilateral trade. During the ministers' meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, Germany proposed a future free trade area embracing the EC and Russia. Although a long-range proposal, it met stiff opposition from Portugal and France. It reflects Bonn's fears about instability in eastern Europe and its greater sense of obligation towards helping countries on its eastern border compared to other EC members. Foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary, the Czech federation and Slovakia yesterday presented a formal request to begin EC membership negotiations by 1996, with a view to entering the Community by the end of the century. The so-called Visegrad trio submitted their proposal during the first official meeting with EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg. The EC response was non-committal. It has signed association agreements with the three states as a step to future membership but the emphasis is much more on political co-operation than on full membership of the EC with all the commensurate economic benefits. Although the Twelve are publicly committed to helping these former communist countries they have been slow in offering trade concessions.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Letter: Settle for regular warnings Sir, Joe Rogaly's comments on Mrs Thatcher's Newsweek article ('Free to speak their minds', April 24) are characteristically balanced. Few enough have acknowledged the right of the undefeated contestant of three general elections to comment widely and perhaps uncomfortably on matters which she still regards as of concern. She will, anyway] Here is how she must see it: in 1979, the country was on its face in the gutter, partly a comic spectacle but principally a dire warning to other nations. She changed all that. Some people have not enjoyed the change, which does not greatly matter since the changes are for good. But, inevitably, she will for ever fear the undoing of her work in some vital respect. This simple view which I dare attribute to her has enough of the truth in it to command a good measure of respect. So we may as well settle to sharp, regular warnings against what she will perceive as backsliding. We enjoy the benefit of her revolution and must be content to live with the tyranny of her memory.

In  China, where the telecommunications network infrastructure is  underdeveloped, the demand for mobile communications is  expanding very rapidly as means of communication supplementing  the telephone networks. Given the situation, the companies are  eager to start producing the cellular phones in joint-venture  projects as early as this year. European and U.S. companies are  already operating in China's cellular phone market, with the  U.S. firm Motorola holding 60 percent of the market. As for  Japan, its biggest cellular phone manufacturer, the Matsushita  Communication Industrial Company, is getting ready to start up  its local production in the spring. With the four other  Japanese companies following, intense competition is likely to  flare up among Japanese and U.S. companies.    NEC plans to set up a joint-venture company in China during  the first half of this year and to begin production by the fall.  As a production base, Wuhan is considered to be most desirable.  The initial scale of production by the company is to be 10,000  sets a month.    Fujitsu wants to begin producing its cellular phones within  this year at Nanjing Fujitsu (in Nanjing), which is a joint  venture company set up in 1992 to produce optical communications  systems. It has not decided on the scale of its production, but  once demand expands, Fujitsu says it "will think about setting  up a new joint venture company."    Hitachi and Oki Electric Industrial are now holding talks  [with China] with the intention of producing locally their  cellular phones. While they have yet to negotiate on details,  they are likely to be able to set up new companies and start  producing within this year. Oki Electric Industrial probably  will set up its production base in Shanghai.    The number of China's cellular phones is said to have been  less than 1 million at the end of 1992. But China is a country  where less than 2 percent of people have ordinary phones.  Therefore, the demand for mobile communications systems like  cellular phones and pagers is growing rapidly. The total market  for the systems was half a million sets in 1993, and it is  expected to increase to nearly 1 million sets in 1994.    The number of subscribers to cellular phones in Japan is  about 2 million at present. An officer of a major  communications equipment manufacturer said, "The potential  demand in Japan cannot come even close to that of China." Thus,  that Japanese industry's venture into China is likely to  increase.    As far as pagers -- which are becoming as popular as the  cellular phones are -- are concerned, the Matsushita  Communication Industrial Co. is now engaged in local production  at its joint venture company set up in Beijing in June 1992. In  addition, NEC and the Casio Computer Co. are set to begin  production at their joint venture companies soon.</p>

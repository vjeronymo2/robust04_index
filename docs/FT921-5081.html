			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Kmart improves 13.6% to Dollars 859m KMART, one the largest US retailers, yesterday reported a 13.6 per cent improvement in after-tax profits to Dollars 859m in the 12 months to January 29. The advance was scored on sales up by 7.8 per cent during the year at Dollars 34.6bn. However, on a same-store basis the increase was far more modest - 3.7 per cent rise. At the operating profit level, Kmart posted an 11.7 per cent increase at Dollars 1.64bn. During the final quarter of the year, Kmart's progress was slightly ahead of that for the year overall. Sales were up 8.3 per cent at Dollars 10.6bn; pre-tax profits rose 20.2 per cent to Dollars 725m; and net profits increased 19.2 per cent to Dollars 479m. Yesterday, Kmart shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 . Mr Joseph Antonini, Kmart chief executive, acknowledged that the 'weak economic environment adversely affected sales of electronics and other big-ticket categories'. But he said better profitability in the Kmart fashion division and some strong sales and earnings gains in the specialist store operations had produced the improvement. He added that there were 'early signs that the economic environment is strengthening'. The company, he said, plans to complete 450 to 500 projects  -a mixture of new stores and refurbishments - in the current 12 months. In the past year, it completed 474, opening 55 new full-sized Kmart stores. Kmart operates over 4,000 retail outlets in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada, and takes in the Pay Less Drug Store chain, PACE warehouse clubs, Waldenbooks, and a number of other specialty chains.</p>

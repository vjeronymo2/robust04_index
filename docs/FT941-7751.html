			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline pays Pounds 23m for coach operator Badgerline yesterday announced its largest acquisition and the first since it came to the market last November. The bus company is paying Pounds 23m for PMT Group, the Staffordshire-based coach operator. Badgerline, which has operations in the Midlands, south Wales and the south of England, has grown rapidly through acquisition since a Pounds 3m management buy-out from the National Bus Company in 1986. The deal marks its first move into the Staffordshire and Cheshire area. It came to the market last year at 115p with a market value of Pounds 99.3m. The shares closed up 5p at 124p yesterday. Badgerline is paying Pounds 7m in cash, Pounds 8m in loan notes and Pounds 8m in shares for PMT. Debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds will rise to 168 per cent on a pro forma basis. However, net assets were expected to be some Pounds 2.7m higher than the pro forma figures and gearing was expected to be closer to 150 per cent after the acquisition. Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said he expected the acquisition to be earnings enhancing in the current year. PMT made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 26m for the year to December 31. Pro forma net assets were Pounds 3.3m. Mr Mike Moors, former chairman of PMT, will hold 5.4 per cent of the enlarged group. Mr Smallwood will remain the largest shareholder with 6.6 per cent.</p>

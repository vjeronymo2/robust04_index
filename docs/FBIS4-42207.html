			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veerle Janssens and Jean-Pierre Schoukens: </F> "Ministers Put an End to Brabant -- Trade Unions Have Mixed  Feelings About Division of Property"]    [Text] The minister-presidents and some other ministers  from just about all of Belgium's many governments sealed the  partition of the province of Brabant yesterday with the  signature of the cooperation agreement. In July last year, the  day after the approval of the St. Michael's Agreement,  negotiations started on dividing the 5,031 staff, the buildings,  works of art, other possessions, and debts. The inheritors are  the new provinces of Flemish and Walloon Brabant, the federal  government, the Brussels Region, and the three Brussels  Community Committees. The agreement was only fully completed  last week.    Louis Tobback, the federal government's home affairs  minister, said the agreement was in time to be ready by 1  January 1995, as planned. Tobback said yesterday he was pleased  that, despite the sometimes hard negotiations, things never came  down to a trial of strength.    The Home Affairs Ministry said that even the trade unions,  which recently mobilized staff for the maintenance of their  language bonus and favorable pension scheme, supported the  agreement. Yesterday Paul Scherens [Catholic Union of Civil  Servants] strongly denied the claim.    The trade unions remain vigilant. "The cabinet has assured  us that a law will be passed to ensure that the pensions never  fall below the level which would have applied had the province  continued to exist. First we want to see this law passed. If  it does not come through then we will mobilize again and we will  also once again raise our demands about maintaining the language  bonus," Scherens warned.    This language bonus will eventually be abolished, according  to the cooperation agreement.    The trade unions lost a court case in which they tried to  demand negotiations (and not just consultations) about the  partition's social consequences for staff. The judge said the  demand was well-founded but could not be received because it was  "premature." Another case in the Council of State is ongoing.  The trade unions continue to find it outrageous that as yet  workers have been given virtually no information about their  transfer.    Now it is a question of waiting for two new governors to be  appointed. It is they who are to monitor the implementation of  the cooperation agreement. A bill now put before the senate  makes it possible for the King to appoint the governors of  Flemish and Walloon Brabant after the signature of the  cooperation agreement. Tobback said Parliament could approve the  law before the summer break.    Tobback also indicated that the federal state will pay for  the construction of two provincial buildings and the  accommodation of the adminstration. However, this does not  apply to the official residences of the two provincial  governors. They will be required to live in their provinces but  not in the provincial capital.  <H5>  Uncertainty </H5>   Delegate Jan Anthoons had mixed feelings about the  partitioning of Brabant province's property and especially about  the birth of the new Flemish Brabant province and the  consequences for staff.    The agreement maintains the favorable benefits of the  present  personnel conditions. After the New Year no one will earn less  than now. But the big uncertainty remains where staff will be  located. So far no one has received even one line of information  about his or her possible prospects.    "The agreement is good for staff remuneration, but  nevertheless there is a threat of personal dramas for some  staff," Anthoons said. For example, the province's partition  means the end of the Medical Social Institute (MSI) in Brussels.  The MSI will not go into Brussels' hands, as has happened with  other provincial institutions in Brussels. The new province  will have to relocate these workers, but this does not seem so  self-evident.    Financially the agreement is unfavorable for the new Flemish  Brabant province. "The new Flemish Brabant province must take  over 190 staff too many," Anthoons said. "The present unitary  province employs more Dutch-speakers than French-speakers, who  had greater difficulties with the language examinations. The  new Flemish Brabant province has a surplus in staff because the  reasonable distributive formula per language was applied  separately, rather than to the staff as a whole. The budget  will come under heavy pressure from the wage bill,  accommodation, and working costs. Figures from the accounting  department show that the division of the Flemish Brabant budget  produces a 0.5 billion Belgian francs bonus, but the surplus  staff numbers reduce this to some tens of millions of francs.  This situation is burdening the new province's room to  maneuver."</p>

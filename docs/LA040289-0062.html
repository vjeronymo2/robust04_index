			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: ANOTHER BIG SPENDER LEAVES THE FOLD  </P> <P> Your son opens the envelope and his first credit card falls out. Is it his  first taste of maturity? Or his last meal before execution?  </P> <P> Suddenly, small moments from the past invade the present like a pesky gnat that  won't go away. You remember the first time he emptied out his piggy bank and  tried to buy a $30 wagon with $1.57. But he was a naive child then. Not to  worry.  </P> <P> Later, for no reason, you recall when he bought a $60 sweater for a girl he met  in a line to see "Kiss of the Spider Woman," whom he dated for two weeks. If he  didn't eat lunch or put gas in the car for three months, he could afford it.  But he was only an impulsive teen-ager then. Not to worry.  </P> <P> Then you remember how he borrowed $40 for a concert ticket from you in 1984 and  still hasn't paid you back. It's time to worry!  </P> <P> It's all your fault. You piffled away all those years telling him not to talk  with food in his mouth and never to sit on a public toilet seat, but you didn't  teach him about money. He thinks all you have to do is insert a bank card in a  slot in a brick building and it drools 10s and 20s into a little tray.  </P> <P> Hey, he'll be all right. He's older now. Once he sits down and reads all the  small print about interest rates, and checks the charges against the slips he's  going to file in his desk each month, and keeps tabs on how much he's spending  by keeping a little notebook in his billfold, he'll . . . end up in jail.  That's what he's going to do.  </P> <P> Remember his first checkbook? He thought it was a scratch pad for phone  messages and shopping lists. When he wasn't ripping out one to wrap his gum in,  he was scribbling out a check for something minor. He once was clocked at  writing 23 checks in one week under $2.  </P> <P> What are you worried about? The credit card will be different. He has only one  little piece of plastic to keep track of. . . . Wait a minute. What if he gets  more than one credit card!? No one has just one credit card. His name and  address are already in a worldwide computer system to alert everyone on this  planet that another "big spender" is in tow.  </P> <P> A picture begins to form. He'll charge, charge, charge until all he is paying  is interest. He'll get a second job to keep up with his time payments. He won't  be able to afford his car. Without a car, he won't get dates. Without a date,  he won't get married. Without marriage, you'll never be a grandmother. Why is  he ruining your life!?  </P> <P> As he prepares to leave the house, sanity returns. There is no reason in the  world why he can't change into a responsible human being who is committed to  being accountable for his own actions. Maybe he isn't the flake you thought he  was.  </P> <P> As the motor of his car turns over, you see the credit card on top of the  toaster. Should you keep the card and sleep at night? Or should you run out and  give it to him?  </P> <P> What do you mean, give you a minute to think!?  </P></p>

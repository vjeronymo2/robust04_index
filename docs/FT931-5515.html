			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / BP strikes biggest UK oil find for five years THE largest UK oil discovery for five years was announced yesterday by British Petroleum. It is likely to open up exploration in an important new area, west of the Shetland Isles. The discovery of 250m to 500m barrels of oil, a quarter of the size of the Brent field which is the largest in the North Sea, comes as the traditional oil sector is reaching maturity. The industry estimates that development costs for the still unnamed field could reach Pounds 2bn. Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, said: 'The discovery has the potential to open up a significant new play in the West of Shetlands province, although there is substantial further work to be done to evaluate the size of this potential.' North Sea oil operators are struggling to make a profit against rising costs, low oil prices and smaller oil discoveries. 'This is just the sort of shot in the arm the North Sea industry needs right now,' said Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at NatWest Securities. The field's development could cost twice as much as an oil discovery in the rest of the North Sea because of site conditions. These are among the harshest in the world, with bad weather, lack of infrastructure and water twice as deep, at 447 metres, as the deepest discovery in the North Sea. BP's new find is significant because the company believes it can be developed relatively quickly. The Clair field, 120km away, was the first to be discovered west of Shetland 20 years ago, but was never developed because the oil is heavy and the geology of the field complex. BP is working with seven other large oil companies to exploit oil from Clair using recent advances in technology. The DTI is keen to encourage companies to explore for oil in this area. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister said: 'There are excellent strategic reasons for capitalising on this early work in the Faroe-Shetland basin. It is a new area with great potential for major oil reserves.' London stocks, Page 36</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Yeltsin to discuss Estonia pullout President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday agreed to meet President Lennart Meri of Estonia in an effort to solve their dispute over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonian soil. But Mr Yeltsin said flatly, after talks with US President Bill Clinton following his meeting with the Group of Seven leaders in Naples, that Russian troops would not be out of Estonia by the deadline of August 31 that Russia itself had set. This rebuff drew a grimace from Mr Clinton but was only one of a series of spirited but cordial disagreements between the two presidents at a joint press conference after their meeting. The presence of Russian troops in the Baltic republics nearly three years after they broke free of the Soviet Union is one of the most contentious issues between the US and Russia and is seen in the Baltics as a critical signal of whether Russia has turned its back on its Soviet imperial past. Mr Clinton, who met Mr Meri last week, said he believed agreement on a withdrawal by August 31 could be reached. Mr Yeltsin criticised the Estonian government for 'very crude violations of human rights toward the Russian population, and especially military pensioners'. Mr Yeltsin, relishing his new status as a full participant in the political discussions of the Group, also attacked the US for discriminating against Russian exports and urged it to follow the example of the European Union, which has agreed to lift its trade barriers. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Clinton set a goal of agreeing on a successor organisation to Cocom, the organisation that used to regulate miltarily sensitive exports to the Soviet bloc, by the time they meet in their next summit in Washington on September 27-28. US officials welcomed Mr Yeltsin's promise to try to limit Russian exports to terrorist countries, which has been one of the issues blocking agreement on the Cocom successor. The US has offered Dollars 2m to help clean up a nuclear facility in Estonia, and will also provide vouchers worth Dollars 25,000 apiece to help Russian officers find housing.</p>

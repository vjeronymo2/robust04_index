			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- President Yeltsin's visit to  Ukraine is not on his immediate agenda, presidential press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov says in a statement forwarded to  ITAR-TASS today.    The statement says: "The mass media has reported with  references to diplomatic sources that considered at present `is  the possibility of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Ukraine' and that `the problem of the Black Sea Navy could be  discussed at a possible meeting between the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents'."    In connection with this, Kostikov explained that "Boris  Yeltsin regards the situation in quite another sequence.  Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine is not on the president's immediate  agenda. Yeltsin believes it is first necessary to resolve the  Black Sea Navy problem proceeding from the fundamental agreement  on separate naval bases. After this problem is settled and a  political climate of trust and dependability is created, it is  necessary to draw up a full-scale treaty, which is to open up  prospects for the Russian president's visit to Kiev," says the  statement of the presidential press secretary.</p>

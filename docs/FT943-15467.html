			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Japan seeks European pressure on N Korea Japan yesterday signalled that it wants the European members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to become more involved in pressuring North Korea to abandon suspected plans to make nuclear weapons. A senior Japanese foreign ministry official said Japan wanted the Europeans to show as much interest in the North Korean crisis as Japan shows over the problems of the former Yugoslavia. His comments came as North Korea and the US began talks in Geneva aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute. A spokesman for Pyongyang said the initial meeting was 'productive,' though the talks are expected to last several weeks. The Japanese official pointed out that a Japanese national, Mr Yasushi Akashi, is the UNPROFOR chief of mission in former Yugoslavia. In addition, Japan has allocated Dollars 210m (Pounds 136m) to UNPROFOR, disbursed about Dollars 96m in humanitarian assistance to the region and pledged Dollars 13m for the rehabilitation of Sarajevo. Outside the United Nations Security Council, the handling of the North Korean crisis has so far been a matter for the US, Japan and South Korea. Speaking shortly before the start of this year's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, the official said Japan wanted European members of G7 to join in sending a 'solid message' to North Korea. This would help the talks between the US and North Korea in Geneva and the proposed summit between North and South Korea on July 25, he said. This year's summit in Naples is again highlighting the importance that the Japanese accord the G7. While other member countries have toyed in the past with the idea of abandoning the yearly summits, Japan yesterday made clear that it wants to strengthen co-ordination among the G7 countries. Unlike the European countries which are linked through the European Union and Japan's six G7 partners, which are members of Nato, Japan has no comparable foreign policy ties other than the G7. It indicated yesterday that it would like to build on the current policy co-operation to strengthen the links between the Atlantic and Pacific communities of nations. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime minister, yesterday reassured Japan's G7 partners that its foreign policy would not change following the establishment of a three party socialist-led coalition government.</p>

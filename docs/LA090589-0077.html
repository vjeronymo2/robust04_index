			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> VIEWERS GIVE $42 MILLION  </P> <P> Jerry Lewis coaxed a record $42,209,727 out of viewers of his annual Labor Day  Telethon, with muscular dystrophy victims appealing for an end to the disease  that kills children and devastates families. The final pledge figure surpassed  the 1988 record of $41,132,113. A parade of corporate sponsors donated an  additional $36,228,846 during the 21 1/2-hour event that ended Monday  afternoon. The telethons have raised $526,524,210 for the New York City-based  Muscular Dystrophy Assn. since Lewis, the association's national chairman,  began the event in 1966. Corporate contributions, which have amounted to  hundreds of millions of dollars, are not included in the telethon totals. More  than 50 top-name entertainers were featured on this year's show, which was  based in Las Vegas.  </P></p>

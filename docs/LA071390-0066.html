			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS ASSAIL DELTA WATER DIVERSION PLAN  </P> <P> California environmentalists complained Thursday that a plan by the Deukmejian  Administration to capture more water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta  would spell disaster for the estuaries it feeds and the fish and wildlife that  inhabit them.  </P> <P> The environmentalists said a draft proposal by the Department of Water  Resources for water development in the South Delta was actually the first step  "in an overall plan to divert more water from Northern to Southern California."  </P> <P> "This is a renewal of an effort by the Deukmejian Administration to divert  water through a facility that became popularly known as 'Duke's ditch' when he  was attempting to get it passed by the Legislature several years ago. . . . The  approach now is to authorize it piece by piece," said Gerald Meral, executive  director of the Planning and Conservation League.  </P> <P> Meral said the suggestions in the new plan, combined with other proposals the  agency is expected to release soon, would ultimately allow delta exports to be  increased by 1.2 million acre-feet a year. The additional water would be  shipped south, he said, by way of the State Water Project to agricultural  interests and urban areas.  </P> <P> The State Water Project sells water to the Metropolitan Water District, which  then resells it to customers in Southern California including the City of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that the proposal would permit more water to be exported,  state officials disputed Meral's contention that it would be as much as 1.2  million acre-feet. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre  with one foot of water.  </P> <P> "I don't think the projects we're talking about here in the next 10 years add  up to that 1.2 million," said Fred Bachman, supervising engineer for the water  resources department and an author of the proposal. If the initial proposal is  adopted, he said it would permit additional diversions of about 66,000  acre-feet.  </P> <P> Bachman conceded that state water officials have made a political decision to  attack water problems on a step-by-step basis rather than put forward one grand  proposal. "You just can't get support for these big massive projects," he said.  </P> <P> Bachman said officials believe that by shifting their major pumping to the  winter they can take more water and help alleviate fish problems at the same  time. In the winter, he said, there is more water in the delta and fewer young  fish that might be killed by the pumping action.  </P> <P> But environmentalists insisted that any additional diversions, no matter what  time of year, would further damage the already threatened wetlands and  fisheries.  </P> <P> The plan "would be a disaster for the bay and more than likely sound a death  knell for many . . . fisheries," said Barry Nelson, executive director of the  Save San Francisco Bay Assn.  </P></p>

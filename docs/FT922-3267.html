			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Cadbury: divisions over ownership and accountability (3) Sir, Sir Owen Green and Sir Ronald Grierson (Letters, June 10) have rejected the Cadbury report, but it is inevitably a curate's egg and corporate governance a compromise. Sir Owen describes 'ownership' of companies as 'novel, untested and inappropriate'. But the basis of capitalism is a working system of ownership rights, or we are nothing. Such privileges carry a positive ethic of duties towards caring - eg, monitoring progress, voting on resolutions. It is because institutional investors neglect these duties that calls for non-executive directors are made. Sir Owen is dead right on non-executive directors. The concept has an oxymoronic ring, like 'lady mud-wrestlers'. But he cannot imply that executive directors need no outside checks. Recent salary and share option abuse, corporate over-stretch and collapse, all cry out for active shareholder monitoring. Sir Ronald knocks 'the absurdities of the Cadbury report', yet there are nuggets in its veins that merit thought. Edmond Jackson, Chenies, Butlers Dene Road, Woldingham, Surrey CR3 7HH</p>

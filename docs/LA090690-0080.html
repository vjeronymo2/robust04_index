			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SUMMER IN THE PITS;  </P> <P> FOSSILS: EACH YEAR AT HANCOCK PARK, VOLUNTEERS DIG UP MORE CLUES ABOUT LIFE ON  PREHISTORIC EARTH.  </P> <P> The stirring sounds of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" filled the air as the  fossil-hunters climbed one last time out of Pit 91, the nation's only regularly  excavated tar pit.  </P> <P> Every summer since 1984 volunteers have pulled Ice Age fossils from the bowels  of Hancock Park. As chief excavator Eric Scott explained, it's traditional to  end each successful season by playing the music associated with Indiana Jones,  the movie hero who makes the hot, tedious work of excavation look glamorous. A  wrap party with pizza and beer is also planned.  </P> <P> The haul from this summer's dig, which ended Sunday, was 552 specimens,  including thefossilized bones of long-extinct saber-toothed cats, dire wolves  and Ice Age condors, caught in the gooey asphalt that has been trapping animals  for at least 40,000 years.  </P> <P> That was considerably fewer than last season's total of 746 animal and plant  specimens, Scott said. But it included an unusually large number of big bones.  </P> <P> On Sunday, volunteer Gary Takeuchi, a geology student at Cal State Los Angeles,  removed the season's prize, a finely preserved dire wolf skull. Its worn teeth  indicated an animal that had managed to beat the ancient odds and survive until  old age. "Spectacular," Scott called the find.  </P> <P> Originally excavated almost a century ago, the tar pits constitute one of the  richest caches of Ice Age fossils in the world. Preserved by the asphalt that  ensnared them, 550 species of plants and animals have been recovered from more  than 100 sites in the Hancock Park area.  </P> <P> The summer dig has been an annual event since it began in 1984 to coincide with  the Olympics. A $6,000 budget only allows for a nine-week dig. Summer is the  preferred time, Scott explained, because the asphalt softens in the heat and  more volunteers are available.  </P> <P> According to Christopher A. Shaw, who coordinates the summer dig for the George  C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, one reason Pit 91 was reopened in 1969  was to redress the bias of early paleontologists toward large remains, called  macrofossils.  </P> <P> Of the more than 1 million specimens removed from the tar pits by early  excavators, less than 1% were of plants or animals smaller than a rabbit, Shaw  said. Unlike the pits' first excavators, today's scientists treasure insect  parts and other microfossils. These small remains often reveal more about the  ancient environment than large finds do, in part because small creatures tend  to stay closer to home than large ones.  </P> <P> Although fossilized pollen may be a boon to science, it typically doesn't get  the adrenaline pumping like coming upon a mastodon bone.  </P> <P> "We were taking out saber-toothed cat bones that were bigger than the bones in  my body," said Scott, 28. "It was a thrill."  </P> <P> Wearing rubber boots, hard hats and their grubbiest clothes, the first pair of  18 volunteers began digging July 5, 13 feet down in a 28-by-28-foot pit  redolent of asphalt. A tarp protected them from the sun but allowed the public  a clear view from the observation station at ground level. As each fossil was  painstakingly removed, some with dental picks, Scott made careful field notes,  including a record of exactly how each specimen was positioned when found. The  note-taking isn't sexy but it's crucial, he indicated. The excavator has to  preserve information, such as a bone's orientation, that the dig itself  destroys, preserving data to answer questions that may not have been asked yet.  </P> <P> Sabertooth bones were especially plentiful this year, Scott said. Evidence of  four different individuals was uncovered, including one whose water-worn bones  suggest that the animal may have died somewhere else and been swept to the site  by an ancient stream.  </P> <P> The saber-toothed cat, whose skull appears on T-shirts that only volunteer  excavators are allowed to buy and wear, has been extinct for 10,000 years and  is especially interesting because nothing quite like it now exists.  </P> <P> Scott said this summer's finds included four sabertooth atlases, the top  vertebra of the neck. The boomerang shape of the neck bones bolsters the theory  that the ferocious sabertooth had a much more powerfully muscled neck than such  contemporaries as the North American lion, whose atlas was smaller and more  compact.  </P> <P> Information about the 552 newly found specimens will end up in the Page  Museum's growing data base on Pit 91, Scott said.  </P> <P> Data on 48,000 specimens already taken from Pit 91 are now being computerized.  The project will give scientists instant access to information that, in the  past, was sometimes buried again in the museum's files.  </P></p>

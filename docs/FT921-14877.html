			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: No problem Sir, Observer ('Spring fever', January 8) quotes disparagingly the French definition of sexual harassment. It seems, however, that the French know more about female psychology than Observer does. Why should there be any problem for the victim in telling a 'hierarchical equal or inferior' (forcefully) to lay off? The French state secretary for women's rights is correct in assuming that the victim is only a victim when the harasser is her senior. Giovanni Grego, Via Luigi Masi 1, Rome</p>

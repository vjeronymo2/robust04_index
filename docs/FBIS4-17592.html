			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- "Ukrainians have undertaken  a series of measures against the Russian personnel of the Black  Sea Fleet which are impossible to call friendly or  constructive", ITAR-TASS was told in the Black Sea Fleet press  centre on Monday.    The fleet representative reported that, in particular, one  of  the Ukrainian naval groups, stationed on Cape Khersones, held  military exercises in which a Russian regiment was considered as  the "potential enemy".    After the end of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in  Sevastopol  on dividing the Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian military leaders have  increased their pressure on Russian personnel under their  command to take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine, the  representative said. They are using not only blackmail and  threats, but lures of promotions in the Ukrainian Navy and a  respectable increase in pay.    The Russian Black Sea Fleet press centre thinks that the  Ukrainian naval officers are acting against the official  position of the Ukrainian Government, which has often repeated  its commitment to a civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet  problem.</p>

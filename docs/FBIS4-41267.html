			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, [no dateline as received] -- On 22 June  the SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA newspaper published an appeal by Viktor  Semenov, the chairman of the town council on the deployment in  the town "without prior warning and in the absence of any need  of Ukrainian National Guard battalions." "Every sober- minded  person understands, states the appeal, that the deployment of  subunits of Ukraine's National Guard on the eve of presidential  elections, the election of the chairman and deputies of oblast  and rayon councils, and an opinion poll of citizens on the  status of Sevastopol at a time when the talks with the Russian  Federation on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet are entering a  decisive phase, is a previously planned political act aimed at  frightening the residents of Sevastopol.    A protest by Ukraine's deputy procurator general against the  holding of the opinion poll among the town's residents, which  was recently received by the town council, also serves to  confirm such a conclusion.    Semenov considers that a decision by the town council to  demand that the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council,  and Ukraine's defense minister review the decision to deploy  Ukrainian national guard battalions in the town, that they  return them to their former place of deployment as soon as  possible, and also that Ukraine's procurator general withdraws  the protest by his deputy are legitimate.</p>

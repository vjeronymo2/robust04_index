			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Ministry stops Hosokawa in his economic tracks: Japanese PM shelves stimulus plan The complexities of coalition politics, a new experience for Japan, have plunged the government's economic policies into apparent confusion. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is in a tight spot. Over the past week he has been forced to delay plans for political reform - on which he has staked his own survival - to make way for action on the economy, only to run into a new blockage. This one is the result of a dispute between the powerful Finance Ministry and the Social Democratic party, the biggest member of his seven-party coalition, as a result of which Mr Hosokawa has been forced to delay the latest round of measures to stimulate the economy. Mr Hosokawa told a parliamentary panel yesterday that the government was planning no special economic stimulus, contrary to his own indications last week that the government was planning new pump-priming measures. The plan last week was partly in response to a collapse in share prices on another set of grim economic statistics and suspicions that the government was not prepared to do any more to stimulate the economy. The market slid again yesterday when it heard that the plan was off for the time being. 'Because of the extraordinary difficulty in trying to boost the economy, the government's power base has been steadily eroded by the Finance Ministry,' explains Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. 'Mr Hosokawa may keep going for up to a year, but his room for manoeuvre is increasingly limited.' The possibility of an economic package, which would have been the fourth this year, was first raised at a meeting last Tuesday between Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, and Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, who holds the portfolio at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to discuss how to respond to the market slide and the latest economic figures. Miti is understood to have called the meeting, under pressure from an anxious business community. Options included a long-debated income tax cut, relaxation of rules on land and housing sales and moves to revive the stock market. Two days later, a gathering between Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and a close ally of Mr Hosokawa, and the policy-makers from coalition parties agreed to launch a package along these lines early this week. The official explanation for shelving the plan is that the government first needs parliamentary agreement on a Y708bn (Pounds 4.5bn) supplementary budget, needed to finance the previous economic package launched in September. Further stimulus measures could be included in next year's budget, due to be published in the final week of this month, said Mr Takemura yesterday. All this suggests that the four-month-old government's inexperience is a factor in the hiatus. On top of this, it ran into bad luck when a former cabinet minister, Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, responsible for the defence agency, brought parliament to a halt for a valuable day by suggesting the constitution be revised to allow Japanese troops to play a larger United Nations role. That inconvenient sideshow cost Mr Nakanishi his job. Yet there remains an unresolved dispute between the socialists and the Finance Ministry over government funding. The finance bureaucrats can only accept an income tax cut on condition that the loss of government revenue will be covered by a rise in consumption tax. On their side they have the influential coalition partner, the Japan Renewal party. The socialists cannot accept a rise in sales tax, on the grounds that it would hit their electoral heartland, lower-income voters. So the socialists propose deficit bonds instead, anathema to the Finance Ministry at a time when it risks an explosion of public debt, according to a report last week on Japan by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Hosokawa stands in the middle and has sensibly kept his public pronouncements free of detail on this subject. Most analysts believe that given time, the coalition partners will be able to strike a compromise on tax. They have after all, got close to agreeing on a gradual opening of the rice market, a perennially touchy issue. This matter, on which the coalition is just as divided as on tax, has been handled with surprisingly little fuss, perhaps helped by Japanese rice farmers' relative compliance. 'I am sure we will get some form of package. But first Mr Hosokawa has to balance the interests of the Finance Ministry, which he cannot afford to offend, against those of the stock market,' says Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. The embattled Mr Hosokawa might take a little comfort from the thought that despite the challenges on every side, nobody wants to bring him down yet. For his popularity continues to increase - and no mainstream party would gain from killing a government devoted to political reform.</p>

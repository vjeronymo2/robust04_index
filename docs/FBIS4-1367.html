			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Aldo Ajello, special Unomoz </F> representative, in Maputo on 22 April]    [Excerpts] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello said in  Maputo yesterday that the training of 15,000 soldiers out of the  30,000 who will be part of the future FADM [Mozambique Defense  Armed Forces] is facing logistical problems. In his usual  Friday's conference with the press, the Unomoz [UN Operations in  Mozambique] chief said that this situation is due to shortages  of accommodation for the 15,000 personnel who do not have  training programs.    Until now, the training program has been established for 15  infantry battalions in a total of 12,000 soldiers besides the  navy personnel, special forces, the logistical unit, as well as  officers and generals who are attending leadership training  courses.    The concern is to find installations to accommodate the  remaining 15,000 troops of the future army in the anti-aircraft,  engineering, communications, and air force artillery departments.    The Unomoz chief asked, "where are we going to place these  men?", and said he is "concerned" about the slowness with which  the government is confining its soldiers, and Renamo's  [Mozambique National Resistance] slow demobilization of its  guerrillas.    He said, "Concerning the infantry battalions, we will begin  their first training cycle with 5,000 soldiers, but there are  army camps in the country which need to be extensively  renovated". [passage omitted]    Aldo Ajello revealed that Lieutenant General Tobias Dhai,  the  government's representative in the CCFADM [Joint Commission for  the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces], has  undertaken to hand over the first list of army camps available  for the training of the future single army troops.    He also said that the two main parties of the Mozambican  peace process have undertaken to deliver a list of Mozambican  instructors who will be responsible for the training of the  personnel. The possibility of involving Mozambican instructors  in the training of the FADM had already been mentioned by Labor  Minister Teodato Hunguana, who is the government's second in  command in the CSC [Supervision and Control Commission]. On the  occasion, Hunguana was reacting to a proposal forwarded by  Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama to President of the Republic  Joaquim Chissano, on the possibility of Zimbabwean instructors  coming to train the Mozambican single army.    The new proposals come as a result of the significant delays  in beginning with the training of the infantry battalions, which  is now scheduled for 25 April, with an official ceremony planned  for 27 April.

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWMEN FROM THE OTHER SAN MARINO HIT TARGET: AMITY  </P> <P> The keepers of the crossbow came from afar and descended on this community. But  they came to make friends, not war.  </P> <P> More than 60 experts on the medieval crossbow arrived late Wednesday from the  Republic of San Marino, a 23-square-mile, landlocked nation surrounded by  Italy, to spend five days in the town that is its namesake.  </P> <P> The main reason for their first official visit to the United States is to  appear in Monday's Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena.  </P> <P> But, while staying as guests at local residences, they are also spreading tales  of their traditions, which are enjoying a renaissance among crossbow  enthusiasts in their country.  </P> <P> At ceremonies at City Hall on Thursday, Amedeo Venerucci, vice president of the  Republic of San Marino's crossbow federation, proudly showed the  standing-room-only audience a single crossbow.  </P> <P> More than 50 pounds in weight and handmade of steel and wood, it was an  accurate replica of the medieval weapon used by the likes of William Tell. Its  walnut stock was carved with a fantasy figure: a boar's head attached to the  scaly body and tail of a dragon. The feathered arrow looked, as one city worker  put it, "like it could go through three people in a row. Whooosh!"  </P> <P> During the Middle Ages, Venerucci said, the crossbowmen of San Marino deterred  potential invaders from attacking the tiny but mountainous republic. As a  14-year-old in 1956, inspired by such lore, he joined 100 other youngsters and  two adults in an effort to revive long-dead traditions -- for demonstration  only.  </P> <P> Onlookers in the packed council chambers Thursday included Tournament of Roses  President Don Fedde of San Marino, who wore a crossbow lapel pin. After the  ceremonies, Venerucci and others toured the city police station and viewed an  assortment of shotguns.  </P> <P> "This is the realization of a dream come true," Venerucci said. "We have  performed all over Europe. But since the Rose Parade is known worldwide, we now  will be known around the world."  </P> <P> Venerucci, 47, a financial consultant, said the trip is significant for other  reasons. Many members of the group are blue-collar workers who otherwise never  would have had an opportunity to visit America, much less be treated like  royalty by residents of this decidedly non-blue-collar town.  </P> <P> Said local enthusiast Howard Topp, who has visited the republic as part of an  official delegation: "It's medieval pageantry, medieval fellowship that goes  with it. It's not like your typical football game or basketball game. It's  cultural and it's historic."  </P> <P> About three years ago, former Mayor Lynn Reitnouer and his wife, Winnie,  started trying to arrange the Rose Parade appearance. But the crossbow group  didn't meet Tournament of Roses criteria. "They weren't a float, a marching  band or an equestrian unit," Reitnouer said.  </P> <P> But, after some help from Fedde, the parade's Variance Committee gave its  approval. The European group will march, nine crossbows in hand, with the  International House of Pancakes float, which depicts an armored knight on  horseback.  </P> <P> And at 1:30 p.m. today at San Marino High School, the elaborately costumed  crossbowmen will stage a free public demonstration.  </P> <P> "The shooting is incredible," said San Marino resident Kenneth Veronda, who on  behalf of the city has made three trips to the republic and witnessed  competitions there. "I've seen them split one arrow on top of another."  </P></p>

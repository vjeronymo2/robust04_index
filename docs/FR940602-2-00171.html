			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c. Allow the current term permit to expire under its own terms and if the holder is entitled to additional time to satisfy the 10-year notification period, issue a new term permit for the remaining period. Clearly specify any limited tenure by including the following statement in the permit: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``This permit will expire on (insert date) and a new permit will not be issued.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Issue term or annual permits for additional periods as needed to allow continuation of occupancy until conversion to the alternate public use is ready to begin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Before the Forest Supervisor issues a decision to convert a lot to an alternative public use, submit the proposed decision, supporting documentation and summary of public comments, to the Regional Forester for review for adequacy of the documentation and analysis. If analysis and documentation are inadequate to support the proposed decision or there is some other deficiency in the proposed decision, the Regional Forester shall instruct the Forest Supervisor to remedy the deficiencies and reconsider the proposed decision prior to making the final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. As with any resource allocation made in a Forest plan, the Forest Supervisor may reconsider a decision to continue or convert recreation residence lots to an alternative public use at any time new or changed conditions merit such reconsideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. In the event a recreation residence is destroyed or substantially damaged by a catastrophic event such as a flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement, conduct and document an environmental analysis to determine whether improvements on the lot can be safely occupied in the future under Federal and State law before issuing a permit to rebuild or terminating the permit. Normally, an analysis should be completed within 6 months of such an event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allow rebuilding if the lot can be occupied safely and the use remains consistent with the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. If the need for an alternative public use at the same location has been established prior to the catastrophic event, do not allow rebuilding if the improvements are more than 50 percent destroyed. If rebuilding is not authorized, in-lieu lots may be offered as provided by FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6 and FSH 2709.11, section 41.23c. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. At the time permits are issued, advise holders that the terms of the permit require that they notify the Forest Service if they intend to sell their improvements and that they must provide a copy of the permit to a prospective purchaser before finalizing a sale. Whenever possible, the authorized officer should advise a prospective purchaser of the terms and conditions of the permit before a sale is final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Do not stay a fee increase pending completion of an appeal of the fee under the administrative appeal regulations. Make any adjustments resulting from the administrative review through credit, refund, or supplemental billing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. During the term of a permit, terminate or revoke the use only in accordance with regulations at 36 CFR 251.60 and the terms and conditions of the permit (FSM 2347.1, para. 5). Except for revocation for noncompliance of terms of the permit, the Forest Supervisor shall submit proposed revocations, with supporting documentation and a summary of the public comments, to the Regional Forester for review prior to the Forest Supervisor's issuance of a decision. If analysis and documentation are inadequate to support the proposed decision or there is some other deficiency in the proposed decision, the Regional Forester shall instruct the Forest Supervisor to remedy the deficiencies and reconsider the proposed revocation prior to making the final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2721.23b_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Insofar as practicable, notify a new or prospective owner of the requirement to make application for the authorization to use existing improvements in accordance with 36 CFR 251.54. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2721.23c_Permit Preparation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use the Term Special Use Permit for Recreation Residence (Form FS 2700&hyph;5a, FSH 2709.11, ch. 50), to authorize recreation residences, except as specified in paragraph 2 of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Use the Special Use Permit (Form FS&hyph;2700&hyph;4) when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Conversion of the lot to a alternative public use is authorized, the conversion will be delayed, and a minimum term of continued use cannot be predicted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Continuance of the recreation residence use is conditioned on the owner complying with specific Forest Service requirements before a term permit is issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The improvements are managed by a third party pending settlement of an estate, bankruptcy proceedings, or other legal action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Yearlong occupancy is authorized by the Forest Supervisor, at which time the improvement ceases to be a recreation residence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In either permit, identify all authorized improvements associated with recreation residence use. Do not authorize use of more than the statutory maximum of 5 acres under a term permit. Authorize community or association-owned improvements, such as water systems, by a separate special use permit (Form FS&hyph;2700&hyph;4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2721.23d_Fee Determination. (FSH 2709.11, ch. 30.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use fair market value as determined by appraisal in determining the base annual rental fees for recreation residence lots. Redetermine the base fee at 20-year intervals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Adjust the fee annually by the annual (second quarter to second quarter) change in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD&hyph;GNP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Use professional appraisal standards in appraising recreation residence lots for fee determination purposes (FSH 2709.11.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Where practicable, contract with private fee appraisers to perform the appraisal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Require appraisers to coordinate the assignment closely with affected holders by seeking advice, cooperation, and information from the holders and local holder associations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Retain only qualified appraisers. To the extent practicable, use those appraisers most knowledgeable of market conditions within the local area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Before accepting any appraisal, conduct a full review of the appraisal to ensure the instructions have been followed and the assigned values are supported properly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

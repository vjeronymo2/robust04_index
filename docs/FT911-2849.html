			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin soars 8.9% on favourable forecast MOST BOURSES ended the week on an easier note, as trading slowed ahead of the May Day holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS saw frantic buying of Michelin, the tyre manufacturer, following a favourable recommendation from a leading domestic broker. Trading in the shares was temporarily suspended to restore order. Otherwise the market was soft, as the CAC 40 index fell 2.34 to 1,774.67, down 0.9 per cent on the week, in modest turnover of FFr1.5bn. Michelin soared FFr7.50 or 8.9 per cent to FFr91.60 with an exceptional 1.6m shares traded after Cheuvreux de Virieu, the stockbroking arm of Banque Indosuez, issued bullish forecasts about the company. The tyremaker is expected to keep its investment level at FFr3bn for several years and does not plan any rights issue in the near future. Michelin also has plans for an 'ecological' tyre. However, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez continued to fall after its disappointing 1990 results this week. The shares fell FFr22 or 3.7 per cent to FFr568 with 174,460 shares exchanged, the day's second most active issue. Alcatel fell FFr3 to FFr573 in spite of news of a Singaporean order worth SDollars 433m (Dollars 244m). Total, the oil company, fell back FFr14 to FFr745 after its rise earlier in the week. L'Oreal, also stronger earlier in the week, fell FFr8 to FFr550. Paribas lost FFr1.50 to FFr437. After the market closed, its Belgian holding company Cobepa said it is to sell its entire stake in Paribas for BFr4.3bn or FFr515 per share. FRANKFURT congratulated itself as it closed the week as Europe's best performing market. It needed only modest gains to achieve this, with the FAZ index 1.2 per cent better over five days, and the DAX up by 1.5 per cent; but on Monday, with the DAX down 1.7 per cent after the CDU's weekend election losses, it was not expecting this conclusion. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, said yesterday that more and more foreign brokers, particularly those in the UK, had become more positive on Germany. In addition, he observed, the D-Mark had recovered against the dollar after a slump on Monday and Tuesday. Volume eased from DM7.8bn to DM6.8bn. After a period of sector rotation, yesterday's gains were more individual. In banks, Dresdner rose DM6 to DM370 after a major buy recommendation from Morgan Stanley, which also increased its weighting for the market in general this week. In carmakers, BMW dropped by DM10 to DM568 as Volkswagen rose DM4.90 to DM376. Capel favour Volkswagen as a mass producer for export markets; BMW is seeing profit-taking after a notable rally. Elsewhere, Viag rose DM5.30 to DM366.80 in contrast with other shares in the energy sector; there was a suspicion that, with a rights issue in the pipeline, the shares might be getting friendly support. MILAN returned from its Liberation holiday in a glum mood. Forced selling ahead of the April 30 settlement day and Olivetti's decision to omit an ordinary dividend, announced after the close on Wednesday, weighed on share values. The Comit index fell 6.28 or 1.1 per cent to 582.94, down 3.3 per cent on the week, in thin volume. Olivetti fell as low as L3,630 before closing officially at L3,705, down L64 or 1.7 per cent. Similar dividend concerns depressed Fiat, which fell L106 or 2 per cent to L5,245. Generali, the insurer which rose sharply the previous week, continued its decline, closing L340 lower at L37,160. Companies linked to the Mondadori publishing group bucked the weak trend on hopes that the battle for control of Mondadori will be resolved soon. L'Espresso, the magazine, added L600 to L19,600 and Cartiere di Ascoli, the holding company, rose L255 to L4,055. ZURICH ended with the Credit Suisse index down 3.1 on the day and 1.1 per cent week at 551.1. CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, recovered from dividend cut and rights issue rumours after news of improved first quarter results, the shares closing SFr40 higher at SFr2,070. OSLO closed higher, and a cut in the Central Bank's overnight lending rate after the close could boost prices on Monday. The all-share index rose 1.35 to 476.36 in turnover of NKr217m. Norsk Hydro, strong on Thursday after its first quarter results, fell back NKr5 to NKr185. MADRID was led lower by the construction sector. The general index ended down 2.39 at 276.83, down 2 per cent on the week, in thin volume of Pta12bn. ISTANBUL hit a three-month low, the market index closing 96.5 or 2.3 per cent lower on the day, and 7.9 per cent down on the week at 4,037.85, on pessimism about the economic outlook.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Apr 26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1121.12  1121.56  1119.64  1119.10  1119.82  1117.85  1116.10  1115.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High   1122.01     Day's Low   1115.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 25      Apr 24     Apr 23     Apr 22     Apr 19 1122.55     1119.18    1122.04    1112.13    1122.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

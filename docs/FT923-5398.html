			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (5): Where they trade it - Leipzig IF THE people of Leipzig have one thing in mind when they look towards the future, it is that they want to recreate the glories of the past. For many centuries the city was an important trade, manufacturing and cultural centre: Leipzig's role as a trade centre dates from 1165, when it was granted the right to hold markets; its university was founded in 1409; Johann Sebastian Bach was cantor of its Thomas Church for 27 years; Richard Wagner was born in the city. Before the war, Leipzig was as important an industrial centre as the Ruhr. More recently, its 1989 mass demonstrations helped provide the momentum which led first to the fall of the Berlin Wall eventually to reunification. The old town centre did not suffer as much as Dresden during the last war and so Leipzig is one of the more attractive cities of east Germany. A drab communist past is rapidly being swept away as new vitality enters the city. With branches of 60 banks established in the city, Leipzig is now rivalling Dusseldorf as the second most important financial centre in Germany after Frankfurt. Marketing, advertising agencies and public relations companies are choosing Leipzig as a base in the new Lander. Shops and restaurants abound in a way that would have been inconceivable a year ago. But the transition to a market economy has brought its trials. Not everyone has been lucky enough to have found a job as a banker, builder or waiter. Unemployment is high in Leipzig. At the end of June the figure stood at just over 10 per cent (although this is less than the near 13 per cent figure for Saxony as a whole). Although unemployment in Leipzig is gradually coming down, Mr Claus Von der Decken, a Potsdam-born engineer who worked in the west before returning to Leipzig to run the local branch of the Treuhand, says the general business climate is less favourable than it was last year. 'The chief difficulty is that wages have gone up faster than productivity,' he complains, 'and wages are much cheaper across the border in Czechoslovakia and Poland.' For Hannes Buss, who has just exchanged a comfortable post in Augsburg for that of head of Leipzig's business promotion bureau (Amt fur Wirtschaftsforderung), the main task for the coming year is to 'go on the offensive' in order to attract industrial investors. He regrets that for all Leipzig's attractions as a business centre, it has failed to draw investment from west German car manufacturers or printing machinery companies. 'The potential is there, the workforce is well-educated and adaptable, and the infrastructure will soon be fully in place.' Investment tends to be in the service sector. An ambitious example is that of SachsenLB, the newly created regional bank serving the government of Saxony and savings banks. The bank, which will also pursue commercial business, is to employ 250 people by 1994-95, a five-fold expansion from the present headcount. Its shareholders, which include the Sudwest LB (the Stuttgart-based Landesbank for South-West Germany), are investing a total of DM500m. On a larger scale are plans to invest DM1.2bn in new premises for the old trade fair. Its former role as a bridge between the communist world and the west has vanished and it is now concentrating on hosting fairs in three areas: the environment, transport and industrial technology.</p>

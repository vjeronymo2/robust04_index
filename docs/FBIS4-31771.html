			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/6/1994 -- The weekly TINERAMA  published in its Friday issue a facsimile of an engagement paper  for cooperation with Securitate signed by Ladislau Tokes, better  known by the public opinion under the name of Laszlo Tokes.    Bishop Tokes, who -- the weekly says -- had chosen by  himself  the cover name of Laszlo Kolozsvari, was committing himself: "To  cooperate with the state security organs of the Interior  Ministry in order to provide information concerning the  concepts, behaviour and actions of the persons with whom I get  in contact and which (information) have specific importance. At  the same time, I will supply information regarding the behaviour  and actions of other countries' citizens who are visiting the  country and who, under that coverage, are operating activities  hostile to our country."    TINERAMA journalist Ioan Itu who signs the article claims  the  document was made available to him a long time ago by a former  securitate officer. The journalist motivates his silence until  now:    "We kept discretion on this issue because of a very simple  reason: We were aware of the existence of a receipt signed by  Laszlo Tokes in October 1989 for the sum of 20,000 lei -- which  he has never denied -- receipt given to an officer of the  Hungarian Intelligence Service, so that, at least for us, it is  not very clear the role he played then, nor the service whose  orders he was following: the Romanian or the Hungarian."</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANAMA CANAL REOPENED FOR DAYTIME TRAFFIC  </P> <P> The Panama Canal, closed Wednesday for the first time in its 75-year history  for reasons other than natural causes after U.S. troops invaded Panama, was  reopened today to limited daylight traffic only, the Panama Canal Commission  said.  </P> <P> A dozen or more vessels are expected to pass through the strategic  Atlantic-Pacific waterway today, the commission said in a statement.  </P> <P> Normal 24-hour passage of ships through the canal is expected by the weekend.  </P> <P> "The commission temporarily suspended service at 1 a.m. on Wednesday due to  concern for the safety of vessels and canal employees in the area during U.S.  military activities in the area," the commission said.  </P> <P> President Bush ordered thousands of U.S. troops into Panama early Wednesday,  forcing Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to flee into hiding.  </P> <P> The commission said: "Initially service will be limited to daylight hours with  a dozen or more vessels scheduled to pass through the waterway on Thursday," it  added.  </P> <P> "But it is anticipated that the canal will return to normal 24-hour operations  by the weekend," it said.  </P></p>

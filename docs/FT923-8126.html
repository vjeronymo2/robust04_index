			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ghost buster dispels shadows of the past - Bunzl and the man brought in to restore the group's flagging fortunes THE GHOSTS still walk at Bunzl, but less often, says Mr Tony Habgood, the chief executive brought in to exorcise the paper and packaging company's chequered past. 'They don't parade around every night any more, perhaps just once a year,' he says. Dispelling the shadows of the past has been the first and most difficult task since Mr Habgood, a former management consultant and briefly chief executive of textile group Tootal, arrived a year ago. 'The degree of internal mistrust was very high. Many were hostile to the centre,' he says, with some business managers maintaining only minimal communication with the Slough-based headquarters. The hostility felt by managers of the more successful parts of the group was the result of a frantic Pounds 600m acquisition spree spanning some 10 years. At one stage, between 1985 and 1989, Bunzl made an acquisition on average every two weeks. Many of the new companies proved less than successful and even included 'some outright disasters', says Mr Habgood. For example, Bunzl built Italy's fifth-largest fine paper merchanting business by buying 15 family-run companies in rapid succession. 'In retrospect, Bunzl did not appear to have done adequate due diligence on some of the companies,' says Mr Habgood. Italian losses soon began to bleed the parent dry. After a year of closures and rationalisation, the Italian business is now breaking even. Meanwhile, the City grew increasingly disillusioned with Bunzl's record of declining profits. Between 1988 and 1991, pre-tax profits plunged from Pounds 93.3m to Pounds 32m. The share price followed a similar pattern, declining from a peak 186p to 82p in the same period. Some of the mistrust within the company has been eliminated by the disposal programme, which was initiated by Bunzl's former management. About 20 different operations have been sold or closed down in the past year, leaving five divisions: the main plastic and paper disposables business, which accounts for 50 per cent of profits, cigarette filters, fine paper, building materials and plastic product manufacturing. However, exorcising mistrust is a more difficult task in the City, where many analysts still nurse scepticism. Mr Tim Rothwell, of BZW, gives Mr Habgood credit for his management changes and 'clean slate approach'. Gross provisions of Pounds 27m were taken last year to cover the costs of restructuring. Yet Mr Rothwell raises questions about the fundamental value of the businesses which Bunzl retains. 'The problem with Bunzl is that it has a lot of cash cows, some dogs, and one or two problem children. I do not see that it has any stars,' he says. Mr Rothwell questions whether Bunzl's main paper and plastics distribution business would qualify for a star rating these days. Distribution grew rapidly in the 1980s through the efficiencies achieved by combining a series of small companies. Yet Mr Rothwell claims the market is now mature. Furthermore, he says, Bunzl faces increasing challenges from bigger distribution players such as Kraft and the rapid growth of warehouse discount clubs in the US. Warehouse clubs, which according to recent statistics will grow in the US at the rate of 25 per cent per annum for the next five years, are increasingly 'taking business away from catering and paper products distributors,' says Mr Rothwell. 'This business is going nowhere easily.' Others in the City are more inclined to give Mr Habgood the benefit of the doubt. According to many in the pro-Bunzl lobby, the 1980s acquisition frenzy meant financial and operational controls in many businesses were neglected. Now, they say, there are opportunities for these businesses to rebuild margins even without economic recovery. For example, it is estimated that restructuring of the US building materials business will result in a 66 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 3m this year, barring sharp dollar movements. Plastics, likewise, should regain some of last year's 28 per cent profits decline following the closure of three factories, two warehouses and a 10 per cent reduction in the workforce. Filters, although linked to a mature cigarette market, will benefit from Bunzl's forte in speciality products, ie charcoal filters. Ms Francesca Raleigh, of Credit Lyonnais Laing, predicts that the past year of cost-cutting, disposals and closures could easily leave Bunzl with pre-tax profits of Pounds 46m for the 12 months to December 31, compared with Pounds 32m last time. Forecast earnings of 6.6p give a prospective p/e of 13.3 times on last night's closing price of 87p. Since the shares have begun to rally from a six-month low in recent days, there could be more to come in advance of the interims in September, say analysts. Meanwhile, Mr Jonathan Helliwell, of James Capel, says Mr Habgood has successfully taken the company through the crucial first stage of recovery. 'They have done the fire-fighting,' he says, ' . . . but it is not enough.' Investors are now calling for an indication on the strategy for Bunzl's future: which businesses are likely to continue under the 'core operations' banner and which will provide the real growth? Until those questions are answered, he suggests, longer-term investors are unlikely to find much excitement in Bunzl's shares. Mr Habgood, for his part, says he is just beginning to lift his eyes from the road three feet in front of him. The strategic question will have to wait until individual businesses, such as builders' merchanting, are performing to expectations. That is unlikely to happen if 'the company spends its entire time speculating on which part is going to be up for sale next,' Mr Habgood says. Meanwhile, Bunzl will shore up its existing operations with small opportunistic purchases, such as the two announced earlier this year in paper distribution. But, being by nature a quiet man, Mr Habgood intends to keep the noise down. He has no intention of waking ghosts which he has worked hard to put to rest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Yemeni Presidential Council of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] The regime in Sanaa is attempting to use some of  the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to mislead them  and exploit the effects of previous differences, as well as to  plant strife in their ranks. This is a matter cherished by the  leaders of the Sanaa regime. All this is done to make it  possible for the regime in Sanaa to use them in its aggression  against their areas and people, and consequently deepen the  wounds of the sons of the same area, the same tribe, and the  same family.    The Sanaa regime does not care about any ideals or religion  in order to reach its objectives. Will the misled ones accept  that the honor of their women be violated in their areas, their  dignity trampled upon, and their possessions looted, as happened  in some areas? Did the misled ones not think about how they  were treated before the crisis? The leaders of the regime in  Sanaa are not above causing strife between tribes and  personalities in the areas surrounding Sanaa. Money and weapons  have been provided so that a brother can kill his brother, and  plant strife between the tribes to dominate them all, instead of  planting love and affection among the sons of the same people,  and spending resources on construction and the establishment of  services. All this is known to the sons of the Yemeni people in  the north, and this will always be with them until they get rid  of the leaders of this domineering regime.    Everybody knows that the leaders of the Sanaa regime have  established their regime based on domination, discrimination,  and arrogance. They look at others as subservient to them, not  as honorable people. Today they consider their aggression  against the Democratic Republic of Yemen as a matter of  occupation and domination, not as a matter of unity, as they  claim.    We wish to confirm to all the sons of our people, and  particularly those who have been misled from the sons of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, that the regime of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen is becoming more firmly established every day.  We were the ones who advocated unity, but on the basis of  equality, justice, democracy, and national unity. In this we  adhere to the basis of the pledge and accord document, and not  to the basis of accepting control, domination, imposition,  corruption, discrimination in citizenship, and the buying of  people. We aim, God willing, to establish a state of discipline  and law and order, a state of equality and justice, and a state  of stability and prosperity.    When a regime is established in Sanaa on a similar basis, we  will unite with it. Our hearts are open and our hands extended  to the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to work  together under a new regime, in which there will be no  domination by one group over another. We shall build together  and live together a stable and secure life. This is impossible  with a regime such as the current one in Sanaa.    It is on the basis of the foregoing that we appeal to the  misled ones, and to all those compelled to take part in the  aggression against their people and their country, to listen to  reason and to be aware that their fate and future are linked to  the fate of their people and areas. The domineering regime in  Sanaa will not always be there for them, but will use them for  its domineering objectives and later will expel and humiliate  them, as is its habit. However, first it will involve them in  the killing of their people and brothers. There will be nothing  for them except the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which keeps  its arms open for all its honorable and patriotic sons to take  part in its construction and development, and enjoy its  blessings.

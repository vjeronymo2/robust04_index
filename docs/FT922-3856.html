			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Mali president sworn in History professor Mr Alpha Oumar Konare was sworn in yesterday as Mali's first democratically-elected president and immediately told the people of the poor West African country not to expect miracles, Reuter reports from Bamako. The ceremony, punctuated by wild applause from 3,000 guests, was held in the same Palace of Culture where Mr Konare's ousted predecessor, Gen Moussa Traore, is on trial for 'blood crimes.' Mr Konare, aged 46, easily won last April's elections although only 20 per cent of Mali's voters bothered to turn out for the country's first free presidential poll since independence from France in 1960.</p>

The group appealed to King Husayn not to yield to  pressure by launching a campaign against it.    A statement by an official FRC spokesman said: We appeal to  His Majesty King Husayn and the Jordanian administration to  fully investigate events and facts and to consider the dangers  of any compliance with Western pressure, regardless of their  nature.    The FRC statement denied any connection with the killing of  Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah and said: We were  surprised that the al-Ma'ayitah case was attributed to our  movement. The statement added that dozens of leading and  well-known cadres were arrested in campaigns launched last  month, but that these arrests will not drag the FRC into  antagonizing Jordan.    The official spokesman added: Proceeding from our movement's  awareness of the ghastliness of what is afflicting the nation  today and our awareness of possible future disasters, and in  order to avoid making mistakes, we would like to emphasize that  we refuse to be implicated. We also stress our commitment to  our policy and refer to our endurance of sacrifices, pains, and  difficulties with strength and nobility.    The group denied that anti-government actions were taken by  those recently arrested. It said most of those who were  arrested had previously served long prison terms in Jordan  despite the fact that their activities were conducted with the  knowledge of the Jordanian authorities.</p>

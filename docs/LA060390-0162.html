			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DYKSTRA IS EXCEPTION TO HIS RULE  </P> <P> Len Dykstra says there is no way anyone is ever going to hit .400 again, but  the Phillies' center fielder had three more hits Saturday night to increase his  batting average to .405 as Philadelphia defeated the New York Mets, 5-4, at  Philadelphia to end a five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Dykstra has hit in 15 consecutive games, the longest streak in the National  League this season.  </P> <P> "No one is going to do that (bat .400) in today's game," Dykstra said. "With  all the good pitching, good relief pitching and traveling, it just won't ever  happen again.  </P> <P> "One thing, though, it's a great feeling to step in the box and know I'm going  to hit the ball hard," Dykstra said. "I've just been trying to get on base and  I'm in a real good groove."  </P> <P> Dykstra insists he gets no special thrill in beating his former team.  </P> <P> "It's nothing real special, but it's nice to beat them," he said. "We've got to  play them 16 more times, so the main thing is to establish that we can play  with them."  </P> <P> Phillie starter Ken Howell (6-3) gave up three runs, struck out seven and  walked three in seven innings. Roger McDowell relieved Howell after a walk to  Darryl Strawberry to open the eighth, and recorded his National League-leading  13th save.  </P> <P> Met starter Dwight Gooden (3-5) gave up four runs and nine hits in six innings,  walking three and striking out two.  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, Houston 4 -- Mike Kingery's run-scoring single, his second of  the game and National League career, with two outs in the bottom of the 10th  inning won it for the Giants at San Francisco.  </P> <P> Kingery, who played last season in Seattle, also had an RBI single as the  Giants overcame a 3-0 deficit in a three-run ninth.  </P> <P> The Astros had taken the lead in the top of the inning on Franklin Stubbs'  run-scoring double off Steve Bedrosian (2-3) before the Giants rallied against  Danny Darwin (1-1).  </P> <P> Kevin Mitchell started the 10th with a walk and took third on Terry Kennedy's  one-out single. Robby Thompson lofted a bunt over first baseman Stubbs' head,  scoring Mitchell to tie the game. Pitcher Scott Garrelts pinch ran for Kennedy  at second base and scored on Kingery's hit to center.  </P> <P> San Diego 9, Atlanta 0 -- Ed Whitson pitched his fourth complete game and  second shutout, and Tony Gwynn and Roberto Alomar led a 14-hit Padre attack at  San Diego.  </P> <P> Gwynn had three hits, including two doubles and three RBIs. Alomar scored four  times for San Diego and got three hits, including his second homer.  </P> <P> Whitson (5-3) pitched a five-hitter to tie Mike Morgan of the Dodgers for most  complete games in the National League. The Braves only had one runner reach  second base.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Montreal 3 -- R.J. Reynolds tied the score in the eighth inning,  then doubled home Jay Bell to win it in the 10th at Pittsburgh as the Pirates  ended the Expos' four-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Chicago 7, St. Louis 6 -- The Cubs' Dwight Smith hit a sacrifice fly in the  ninth inning to score Shawon Dunston at St. Louis in a battle to escape last  place.  </P></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Roche Financial announcements from Roche have been a cause for celebration for so long that yesterday's disappointing half-year sales figures came as something of a shock. Sales growth in pharmaceuticals slowed dramatically in the second quarter, underlining the point that Roche is not immune to the pressures afflicting its peers. After yesterday's 5 per cent slide, the non-voting shares stand 20 per cent below the peak reached in early February. On the surface, Roche looks in danger of losing the magic ingredient which made it the world's most highly valued drugs company. Yet pharmaceutical sales growth of 9 per cent for the first half as a whole is well above the industry average. If that rate can be sustained  - which seems perfectly possible given the one-off problems encountered in the second quarter - Roche will still deserve a premium rating. Its position in essential hospital drugs affords some protection against the price competition causing havoc elsewhere. A group straddling over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and diagnostics is also hedged against tougher regulation in prescription drugs. These long-term arguments in Roche's favour do not preclude a further period of weakness for the shares. Financial income, which accounted for around a third of last year's profits, will be more difficult to achieve in falling bond and equity markets. Although good on paper, the Dollars 5bn acquisition of US drug company Syntex, announced in May, must prove its worth. Even at yesterday's closing price, Roche stands at a heady premium to other drug company shares. The market may still be asking too much.</p>

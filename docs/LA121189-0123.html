			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> OCC CHORALE MIXES THE SERIOUS AND THE SEASONAL  </P> <P> The Orange Coast College Chorale holiday program brought good tidings to all  who had pondered the choir's fate now that founder Richard Raub has  relinquished the podium. Saturday night at Robert B. Moore Theatre on the OCC  campus, with conductor Ted Reid manning the helm, the chorale offered a  balanced mixture of the serious and the seasonal.  </P> <P> The Orange Coast Chorale is a community-based group. Yet Raub never pandered to  amateur status, preferring to challenge his ensemble with such major works as  Bach's B-minor Mass and Verdi's Requiem. Reid indicated his intent to continue  tackling masterworks by programming Bach's Magnificat in D as the centerpiece  Saturday evening.  </P> <P> Like most community choirs, the OC Chorale has rough edges, particularly an  eagerness to sing out even when dynamic restraint might be more effective. The  Magnificat, especially, suffered from this (the one time Reid successfully  insisted on a soft entrance, for "Suscepit Israel," the sopranos stumbled in  thin and ragged).  </P> <P> Failure to shape phrases or to etch softly subtle lines impeded communication  of dark moods such as those required by the "Magnificat anima mea" and the  "Suscepit Israel" choruses. But fresh-faced fervor conveyed much of the spirit  of other sections. The "Fecit potentiam" and the final strains of the "Gloria  Patri" glistened with joyful energy.  </P> <P> Moreover, Reid elicited two qualities that set his choir apart from other  non-professional groups: a consistent blending of tone among the sections, and  clear, coordinated enunciation. Besides conveying text easily, refined  placement of consonants permitted sudden, perfectly unified cut-offs, such as  that which followed the florid imitation of the chorus "Fecit potentiam."  </P> <P> As in previous years, professional soloists -- in this case, soprano Laura  Fries, mezzo soprano Elizabeth Saunders, tenor Dale Tracy, and baritone Ralph  Cato -- and free-lance instrumentalists teamed forces with the chorus. In the  Magnificat, none of the vocal soloists emerged as rising stars, though Tracy's  securely sustained line and even tone drew a sense of pathos from "Et  misericordia," his duet with Saunders.  </P> <P> The second half of the program was devoted to traditional Christmas pieces,  arrangements of Christmas songs, and the now-common audience sing-along. Faced  with less technically demanding works, the choir did manage soft legato lines,  especially in Robert Young's "There Is No Rose" and the closing "Amen" of Ralph  Vaughan Williams' "Fantasia on Christmas Carols." In the latter, Cato provided  a rich, commanding solo.  </P></p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Indian state faces temple ruling THE Indian Supreme Court will decide today whether the Uttar Pradesh state government has violated a court order by beginning construction of a Hindu temple on the disputed site at Ayodhya, northern India. The Supreme Court had ordered the state government to explain the nature of a concrete platform being built on the disputed site in defiance of the Allahabad High Court, which issued an order banning all construction. The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) claims in an affidavit to be submitted to the Supreme Court that the platform is not a permanent structure, and will only be used as a 'public amenity' for pilgrims visiting the shrine. Angry opposition members yesterday accused the government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, of pandering to the 'communal designs' of the BJP. Mr Vishwanath Pratap Singh, former prime minister and leader of the Janata Dal, said the BJP was wilfully violating the constitution and the rule of law, 'while a crippled centre looked on'. The temple issue has exacerbated communal tensions between Hindus and Moslems and sparked incidents in other states. The Press Trust of India said four people were killed in the southern state of Kerala and two in the western state of Maharashtra. In Ayodhya, hundreds of Hindu supporters of the BJP poured into the temple complex yesterday to participate symbolically in the temple building.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / The Week In Luxembourg (European Court): British estate agents - a place in the Spanish sun European Community countries must recognise the professional qualifications of estate agents from other member states if they are 'equivalent' to those of their own profession, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg ruled last week. In an important judgment providing useful guidelines for members of other regulated professions and businesses wanting to set up in other member states, the ECJ said in the absence of any EC directive on the mutual recognition of qualifications, EEC treaty rules on establishment required Community countries to determine whether qualifications obtained by an estate agent in one member state were equivalent to those required in the host country. Failure to take account of estate agents' qualifications, when they applied to establish in another EC state, would infringe their treaty rights, the Court said. If qualifications are equivalent, estate agents must be recognised as such in the host country. If not, they may only be requested to prove that they have those qualifications required by the host country which are additional to those already obtained in their own country. The case concerned the prosecution by the official Spanish Estate Agents Association of an estate agency run by a British estate agent in Spain. Mr Stephen Newman, a qualified British estate agent and member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, had applied in 1989 for admission to the association but had not received an official response. He was charged, together with Spanish colleagues, with breaches of the Spanish rules governing estate agents.

Turnover charges and value added tax A claim by an Italian lawyer for repayment of a supplementary charge paid by him on the basis of his annual fee income to the Italian lawyers' national pension body on the grounds that it amounted to a tax on turnover precluded by the EC's Sixth value added tax directive, was rejected by the ECJ. The Court ruled that the sixth vat directive permits taxes, duties and charges other than vat if they do not have the characteristics of a turnover tax. The Italian supplementary charge lacked three essential features of a turnover tax: it was not a general tax; it was not always calculated purely as a proportion of professional fees; and it was charged only at one stage of the provision of services, when the client was invoiced, rather than on value added. The case has wider significance for other business sectors subject to taxes which might be challenged as incompatible with the sixth vat directive. Bozzi v Cassa Nazionale di Previdenza ed Assistenza a favore degli avvocata e dei 'procuratori legali', Case C-347/90, ECJ, 6CH, 7 May 1992. The Court also offered further clarification on the operation of the EC sixth vat directive's rule requiring any private benefit from a business to be subject to vat. In the case of a Dutch builder who purchased land for his own private use and then built himself a house on the land as part of his business activity, the court said only the value of the house and not the land was subject to vat. This interpretation was consistent with the purpose of the rule being to remove any inequality of treatment. An ordinary consumer who paid a third party to build a house on his land would pay vat only on the price paid for the house and not the land. De Jong v Staatssecretaris van Financien, Case C-20/91, 3CH 6 May 1992. UK licences allowed to discriminate against UK fishermen The ECJ ruled in the context of EC fishing regulations that Community states are not precluded from imposing conditions in fishing licences granted to their own fishermen which do not apply to fishermen from other Community countries. In a case involving a breach of the British licence conditions by the masters of two British fishing vessels, the Court confirmed that the prohibition in the Rome treaty against discrimination on grounds of nationality does not apply where a member state chooses to discriminate against its own nationals, even if it puts them at a commercial disadvantage. EC law is not concerned with disparities of treatment or distortions arising from measures applied by one Community state which are stricter than those applied in the same sphere by others. The question arose in criminal proceedings brought against the two masters by the Procurator Fiscal at Elgin for failing to report by radio their intention to cross from one controlled fishing area to another. No similar obligation applies to vessels flagged and registered in other EC states. The Court added that the UK's failure to notify such a national control measure to the European Commission in Brussels and to other Community countries did not affect its validity as the notification was required for information purposes only. Procurator Fiscal, Elgin v Wood and Cowie, Joined Cases C-251/90 and C-252/90, ECJ 6CH 7 May 1992. Other decisions In other decisions the Court rejected direct actions brought by two Spanish fishing companies. They were claiming the annulment of, and damages caused by, Commission decisions refusing to approve the award of incentive payments for fishing trials in the south-west Atlantic under the EC rules dealing with improvement and adaptation of fishing structures. In areas where the Commission had a broad discretion, the applicants' legitimate expectations were not infringed as it was predictable that the Commission would at some point decide that there was no longer any need for fishing trials in a particular zone.

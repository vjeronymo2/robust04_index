			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Wheat war fuels Gatt dissent THE ESCALATING wheat export subsidies war between the US and the European Community was condemned yesterday by trading partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Mr David Hawes, Australia's Gatt ambassador, said President George Bush's recent announcement of an expanded subsidy programme would further squeeze the markets available to 'fair-trading' wheat exporters. These attacks on the US and the EC during the morning session of the Gatt's ruling council provided an inauspicious setting for potentially acrimonious exchanges expected later over the EC's refusal to bow to US demands for binding arbitration on their longstanding oilseeds dispute. Following two Gatt panel rulings in its favour, the US wants independent arbitrators to settle the sum of the damages. It has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs for what it claims is Dollars 1bn in losses suffered by US oilseeds producers due to market barriers in the EC. The EC has offered compensation of Dollars 400m. Both the oilseeds dispute and the tit-for-tat escalation of wheat dumping could derail last ditch efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation and plunge the US, the EC and their trading partners into trade war. Australia's call for urgent consultations to limit damage from the US-EC conflict was backed by other rich and poor farm exporting nations in Gatt's governing council. There were also renewed demands for an early completion of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would cut export and farm subsidies. Wheat export subsidies are one of the main outstanding issues blocking a deal between the US and EC on farm trade reform which is needed to restart the Uruguay Round negotiations. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the US was pushing for a Uruguay Round deal but, in its absence, could not allow the EC to go on squeezing US world market share. Earlier, at a briefing, Mr Yerxa said the US share of the Dollars 20bn a year world wheat market had fallen from 40 per cent to 30 per cent over the past 10 years while the EC share had risen from 15 to 22 per cent.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Disaster' for jobs if Thorp not opened Sir, The decision allowing Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant to go ahead is imminent, as you reported ('Thorp plant to be given go-ahead', December 14). If it is announced today it will fall by coincidence the day before the latest unemployment figures are available. The two subjects are critically intertwined, and at the GMB we are concerned to protect our members' jobs and the environment within which they work and live. The consequences for thousands of jobs should Thorp not be commissioned are frightening in the current economic climate. For Sellafield and west Cumbria it will be a disaster. The plant would support 2,100 full-time jobs, with the additional knock-on effect likely to be the creation of a further 1,000 new jobs. Thorp is a vital part of British Nuclear Fuel's work at Sellafield and is crucial to the future of the 8,000 jobs on site. We hope the government will announce that Thorp can finally go ahead. The decision to commission would come after the most vigorous and comprehensive examination of all the issues, not the least of which is safety and the environmental effects. At every stage of the Thorp project, from conception and design to construction and commission, the regulatory authorities have scrutinised and endorsed the companies' activities. BNFL is at the cutting edge of new technology, winning jobs and vital currency for Britain. If the government's claim to support British companies is to be believed then Thorp must go ahead. The GMB is convinced that all the evidence shows a positive decision on Thorp is the right one. It would put BNFL on a sound footing and give the nuclear industry a welcome vote of confidence.

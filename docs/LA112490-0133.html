			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON GETS OFF TO SUBDUED START;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: SUNNY WEATHER IN ORANGE COUNTY KEEPS EARLY CROWDS DOWN, BUT PARKING  LOTS FILL UP LATER.  </P> <P> Consumers crowded America's retailers on Friday, the start of the traditional  Christmas shopping season, but the holiday spirit -- and gift buying -- was  tempered by the specter of a national recession.  </P> <P> "People didn't whip out their credit cards," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of  the Retail Marketing Report newsletter, after surveying shops and malls in the  New York area. "Mostly," he added, "they were just looking."  </P> <P> In Orange County and elsewhere in Southern California, the shopping season got  off to a slow start Friday morning at many malls where crowds were sparse,  lines relatively short and parking abundant. Some retailers blamed the warm,  sunny weather for keeping people outdoors, and noted that business picked up at  many shopping centers later in the day. Many consumers said it was hard to get  into a shopping mood.  </P> <P> "People are talking about cutbacks. There are too many crises," said Edward  Johnson, a Pasadena resident who was looking to cut his holiday spending bill  in half from last year by bargain hunting at the Glendale Galleria. "It just  seems like it's not the time to go shopping."  </P> <P> Along with growing concerns about the U.S. economy, the annual  day-after-Thanksgiving outpouring of shoppers comes in a year that has  witnessed a string of big retailing bankruptcies. To avoid big losses and  profit declines posted over the past 12 months, many merchants have cut costs  by firing thousands of workers and trimming inventories.  </P> <P> Retailers also have tried to attract customers with a blizzard of special  sales, price markdowns and other promotional gimmicks, but those tactics  appeared, at best, only moderately successful on Friday.  </P> <P> The subdued Christmas shopping mood of many consumers dovetailed with reports  that consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level since the 1981  recession, largely because of the weakening economy and the Persian Gulf  crisis. A survey released Friday by Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates, a leading  market research firm, shows that consumers have continued to grow more cautious  this month.  </P> <P> In its monthly survey of 450 households across the nation, the firm found that  46% of those polled plan to spend less than they did a year ago on holiday  gifts, versus 25% spending more. A year ago, heading into what proved to be a  very weak Christmas for retailers, 36% said they planned to spend less and 33%  predicted that they would spend more.  </P> <P> At the Brea Mall, the day started with just a small knot of shoppers at the  entrance to the Nordstrom store, instead of the crowds of past years.  </P> <P> "I thought there would be more (shoppers) down here," said Anita Rule of  Anaheim, who had come to shop with her sister, Rachel Moreno.  </P> <P> And the vast parking lots at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa were half empty  when the day began, but were nearly full with cars by mid-afternoon. "It's  slow," said Chris Castille, Brookstone store manager.  </P> <P> Jim Henwood, general manager of South Coast Plaza, said he was a little worried  about the earlier small crowds but was mindful of how Southern Californians  appreciate a beautiful day and expected -- rightly, as it turned out -- that  shoppers would show up in droves in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "I think we are doing better than anticipated," Henwood said. "We enjoyed a  very relaxing start today, with the weather outside. It was ideal."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa police dispatched extra officers to the mall to control traffic. By  Friday evening, motorists were lined up on the San Diego Freeway, waiting to  get off on the Bristol Street exit to the mall.  </P> <P> "Traffic is pretty heavy out there," Officer Mike Cohen said. "There's about a  half-hour delay getting off the freeway and another half-hour delay to get out  of the parking lot. And parking's a whole other story."  </P> <P> Cohen said extra officers will be assigned to monitor traffic around the mall  until Christmas.  </P> <P> Westminster police assigned an officer just for parking lot duty at Westminster  Mall and also put officers on the rooftop to watch for prospective car thieves.  By early evening, the lot was "very packed," and traffic on the streets around  the mall was "heavy," Lt. Larry Woessner said.  </P> <P> Other malls in Santa Ana and Newport Beach, however, escaped without traffic  major tie-ups, police said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police had not planned any special measures around MainPlace/Santa  Ana, where traffic was reported as moderate.  </P> <P> Newport Beach police reported "very light" traffic around Fashion Island in the  morning, a condition that did not change much by late afternoon.  </P> <P> Shoppers and retailers in San Diego were also in a relatively upbeat mood. Dane  Lowe of Poway, shopping at Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego, said she did not  view the economy as "a real big problem. . . . If everyone buys into it being  bad, then it will go down the tubes. It's a state of mind. If you want it to be  bad, it will be."  </P> <P> At the Fashion Valley shopping center north of San Diego, business was brisk  throughout the day. Most merchants and shoppers said that sales and good buys  were plentiful.  </P> <P> "We've been very busy. It's much better than last year," said Carol Ball, a  fragrance counter manager at Robinson's department store. "Business has been  down slightly (during the past several months), but we've been doing very well  today."  </P> <P> The morning shopping crowd at Century City Shopping Center and Marketplace was  also sparse as Sylvia Morren, co-owner of Fil a Fil, arranged merchandise in  the empty men's and women's shirt shop. "It was very slow last week, and we do  not feel at all that it is the biggest shopping day of the year."  </P> <P> Discount stores appeared to be doing a brisk business. The parking lots of a  Target and nearby Pic 'N' Save in Pacoima were packed, in sharp contrast to a  very quiet Sherman Oaks Galleria on Friday morning.  </P> <P> Connie Carbajal, walking out of the Target store, said, "We're just being more  careful" this year. "Usually we just kind of freely buy, but not this year,"  she said.  </P> <P> Industry experts note that it is far too early to tell whether this will be the  nation's fourth weak Christmas season in a row. Holiday business generally  accounts for 50% or more of many big retailers' profits, so gloomy predictions  have aroused deep concerns.  </P> <P> In downtown Chicago, observers said the crowds seemed thinner than a year ago  and that shoppers were carrying fewer packages.  </P> <P> Cathy Baugh, a Salvation Army worker collecting Christmas donations on upscale  North Michigan Avenue, said that last holiday season many shoppers "actually  gave bills, but this year it's just spare change."  </P> <P> In northwest Atlanta's Cumberland Mall, shoppers lined up to buy Reebok  sneakers at discounts of up to 34% at a Rich's department store.  </P> <P> One shopper, Alma Hart, said she bought $300 worth of sneakers. "A big sale  like this helps," she said. Across the mall at a Macy's store, the shoe  discounts were not as deep and the customer traffic was slower.  </P> <P> In downtown San Francisco, early morning promotions at the Emporium department  store on Market Street lured a horde of bargain hunters. Katy Sullivan, who  came in from Fresno to get a jump on Christmas shopping, said the store seemed  to be more crowded than in previous years, and the sale prices were much better  than in the past.  </P> <P> "Instead of 30% off, it's more like 40% this year," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> In New York, already hit hard by Wall Street layoffs, major department stores  appeared much less crowded than last year.  </P> <P> "It was supposed to be a busy day, but it wasn't," said a saleswoman in the  small-appliance department at Bloomingdale's.  </P> <P> Among the best-selling items was one of the least expensive: a slim,  lightweight telephone, the Swisstel, selling for $19.95.  </P> <P> At Northline Mall in Houston, a city that has been buoyed by recent increases  in crude oil prices, shoppers seemed to be doing more looking than buying.  Despite national surveys showing concern about the economy, many people  expressed no worries about their circumstances.  </P> <P> Gregory Rodriguez, a 33-year-old heavy-equipment operator for the city of  Houston, said the Persian Gulf crisis "seems so far away, and I am not  personally involved."  </P> <P> He is going ahead with plans to buy his 9-year-old son a video game. "Santa  will bring it," Rodriguez said. "Our Christmas this year will be the same as  last year. Nothing has happened to make us cut back."  </P> <P> The mood was even more upbeat among shoppers at upscale Bellevue Square, in the  economically strong Seattle area.  </P> <P> "I have more money than I've ever had" for presents, said shopper Janet  Knudsen. Still, Knudsen said, "It's perceived that everyone else is spending  less this year, so I've scaled back, too."  </P> <P> With more and more shoppers in recent years waiting until the final week before  Christmas to buy their gifts, the early days of the season play a less  important role. Some retailers have also expressed hope that the early arrival  of Thanksgiving this year, providing a longer shopping season, could boost  business. They say that resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis would raise  consumer confidence.  </P> <P> "Christmas is Christmas," explained Kris Leddin, a homemaker from Davenport,  Iowa, who was shopping at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. "You  still have to buy for everybody, you can't leave anybody out, so you still have  to spend."  </P> <P> Stuart Silverstein reported from Chicago and Jesus Sanchez reported from Los  Angeles.

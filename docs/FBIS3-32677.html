The widow, who appeared on television for the  first time since her husband's death, said the family's economic  situation is precarious and has become even more difficult  without Crescencio Diaz' support.    Blanca Molina de Diaz and her three children, two of whom  are  permanently disabled by disease, no longer have the financial  and moral support of the head of the family, Diaz, who was  murdered while working as a bodyguard for U.S. Major Mike Lopez.  This crime has left a mark of deep uncertainty on the survivors.    [Begin Molina recording] My husband supported my three  children and me. Now we have been left with no support. Who  will help us? We have no one to ask for help. My husband was  our only support. [end recording]    Molina has appealed to the U.S. Embassy for help.    [Begin recording] [Molina] I have received nothing except a  bouquet of flowers and condolences.    [Reporter] Will you request the Embassy's assistance?    [Molina] Yes. [end recording]    There is no law that could force the U.S. Embassy to  compensate the survivors because Diaz worked for a private  enterprise under contract with the embassy. The murdered man's  brother has said that aid for this home, which has been  virtually decapitated, is urgent.    [Begin recording] Two of the children are disabled. One of  them suffers from mental disorders, and the other is crippled.  [end recording]    The only assistance the family could get is from the Social  Security Fund, which provides a very small amount to the widow  for her minor children. No one knows for how long that aid will  last.</p>

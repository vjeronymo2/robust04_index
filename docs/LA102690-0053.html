			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATOR GUILTY OF SELLING VOTE IN FBI STING  </P> <P> A jury Thursday convicted a state lawmaker of selling his vote on parimutuel  betting for $4,300, ending the first trial stemming from an FBI undercover  sting labeled Operation Lost Trust.  </P> <P> The sting so far has resulted in indictments charging 10 legislators with  bribery.  </P> <P> Four have resigned and pleaded guilty. One of the 10 lawmakers pleaded guilty  to drug charges earlier this month, as did a lobbyist.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court jury convicted state Rep. Luther Taylor, 40, a Democrat  from Columbia, on all six counts against him of violating the Hobbs Act, a  federal anti-bribery law. An indictment accused him of accepting five separate  bribes and of conspiring to solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of  a parimutuel betting bill.  </P> <P> Taylor voted for the bill in committee during the last legislative session. The  bill never made it to the state House or Senate.  </P> <P> The conviction carries a maximum penalty of 120 years in prison and a  $1.5-million fine. No sentencing date was set.  </P> <P> Videotapes and lobbyist Ron Cobb dominated the prosecution's case. Cobb, a  former Democratic House member who had become a lobbyist, testified that he  worked under cover for the FBI after getting caught trying to buy cocaine from  federal agents.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Police are alerting motorists parking in the Old Town area that a rash of car  burglaries has hit the tourist spot since the beginning of the year, Police  Department spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> More than 300 car burglaries have been reported by motorists, mostly tourists,  in the Old Town area since Jan. 1, he said.  </P> <P> Witnesses have told police that the thieves watch people leave their cars, then  smash the car windows to take valuables inside, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "The reason tourists are hit in many cases is because they're in town for just  a weekend or the holiday, and then they return home and cannot return to San  Diego to testify," he said.  </P> <P> Robinson said anyone who has information on the series of thefts is asked to  call Detective Emmitt Henderson at 236-7310.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Carlos Fazio] </F>   [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A method used by the  United States over and over again is to make use accustomed to  de facto situations. A typical and current example is the  "Strong Roads 94" operation throughout Latin America. Using the  excuse of building schools and rural roads, the Pentagon is  filling the region with soldiers. The goal is to get our people  accustomed to the U.S. military presence in the area in order to  transform local armies into police forces under Washington's  centralized command.    A subject that was once in vogue had the same fate: human  rights. During the James Carter administration (1977-1981), the  United States started to use the human rights issue as a foreign  policy instrument. It did this by using a large-scale apparatus  of propaganda and reiterations. Since then and every year, the  occupant of the Oval Office, acting as a self-imposed judge,  jury, and executioner, drafts reports on the observance of such  principles in the world, issues "certifications," and punishes  transgressors by withholding economic or military aid.    This policy, however, has a weak side. In all cases, the  human rights arena exists abroad. That is, they do not apply to  the United States. That is the getting-accustomed  [acostumbramiento] part.    Given that the reality differs from the situation reported  by  the hypocritical media, which is subordinate to the "rumor  mills" of the State Department and Pentagon, issues like human  rights have become real boomerangs that have hurt the apostles  of the White House.    This is so because men such as Noam Chomsky, inside the  empire, and Gregorio Selser, in Latin America, for years, have  denounced the double standard of this scrutinizing and  horrifying policy that locates the bad, the ugly, and the dirty  living abroad and describes them as outlaws who deserve to be  condemned.    This comes to light because the Autonomous University of  Sinoloa, in Mexico, is presenting a reedited book by Selser (who  passed away) entitled The Violation of Human Rights in the  United States [La Violacion de los Derechos Humanos en Estados  Unidos].    The first edition, which mysteriously vanished, dates back  to  1989. It is, however, completely valid today.    Many 1989 human rights violators have intensified their  actions in the United States today.    Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, Moral Majority, Unification  Church, Aryan White Resistance, among others, which were  denounced by Selser in his book, continue to show no mercy to  Blacks, Hispanics, and American Jews.    Police violence against minorities, which was brought to the  fore in 1991 with the Rodney King case -- a colored man who was  brutally beaten by four white policemen -- was repeated in the  case of Lorenzo Colston, a black man who was shot in the butt on  29 September 1993 with a Magnum 357 by a white policeman, who  was just acquitted. Paradoxically, Colston could be sentenced to  28 years in prison for attacking this policeman.    Selser's work summarizes the lengthy chain of  discrimination,  persecution, hostility against minorities, and ethnic conflicts  -- now they are in vogue in Chiapas, the Venezuelan Perija  mountain range, the Ecuadoran high plateau, and the Brazilian  Amazon region -- like those of the Mohawk Indians in the Sain  Regis-Akewasasne Reserve along both sides of the U.S.-Canadian  border.    There is no doubt that if Don Gregorio were alive today, he  would be reporting on Washington's flagrant violation of Article  14 of the Human Rights Declaration that reads: "In case of  persecution, every person has the right to request asylum and  enjoy it in any country." The Haitians, for example, are locked  up in a prison of terror by a U.S. blockade under the UN  umbrella. Even the "boat people" who manage to escape the island  are detained on the high seas by U.S. marines and turned back to  the Raoul Cedras regime.    This policy of summary interdiction and repatriation is not  only racist but also exposes the cynicism of Washington's  so-called "humanitarian policy."    The participation of expert John Saxe Fernandez in the  presentation of Selser's book, besides being a homage deserved  by the master, will give us a closer look at this situation. In  recent times, a favorite target of this situation have been  Mexicans who aspire to work in the mecca of capitalism. Walls,  ditches, and sensors are part of the new humanitarian methods  used by border patrols against those trying to win freedom.</p>

The most important idea propounded in the work is to  continue  to deepen the work of establishing the monolithic ideological  system of the party and make the unity and cohesion of the party  and the revolutionary ranks more unbreakable.    In the work, the dear leader expounded that to establish the  monolithic ideological system of the party is a fundamental  principle of building a working-class party and a permanent work  which all the party organisations should always regard as its  cardinal task. And he laid down questions of principle arising  in further deepening the work of establishing the monolithic  ideological system of the party.    He also indicated tasks and ways of closely rallying all the  party members, cadres and working people around the party and  the leader by intensifying the work with the people and stressed  the need to strengthen party leadership over socialist economic  construction.    The work emphatically urges all the officials to learn from  the great leader's work method, which requires them to go down  to the lower units constantly and share sweets and bitters with  the masses, and thoroughly apply it to practice.    Recalling that the validity and vitality of the idea, theory  and policies laid down in the work have been fully proved in the  revolutionary practice in the past, the author of the article  says:    The work of establishing the monolithic ideological system  of  the party has been further deepened, the fighting capacity and  leading role of the party have increased remarkably and the  singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks with the  illustrious leader at the centre has been consolidated further  still in keeping with the requirements of the developing  revolution in which the modelling of the whole society on the  chuche idea has developed to a new, higher stage.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Merseyside postal workers mobilise for strike ballot BRITAIN'S postal service faces the possibility of further disruption in spite of yesterday's settlement of a two-week dispute by Royal Mail staff in Cardiff. A strike ballot of 1,100 postal workers on Merseyside is being prepared to protest against a threat by local management to reduce full-time delivery jobs as part of a plan to cut costs by 5 per cent. The Union of Communication Workers fears the loss of a quarter of the full-time jobs at Merseyside's 32 postal delivery offices if the Royal Mail introduces part-time staff to make second deliveries. The ballot is the latest sign of unrest among staff as the Royal Mail presses ahead with its quality of service scheme designed to increase efficiency in the face of rising competition. In Cardiff, in a ballot organised by the UCW, the staff voted by 556 to 154 to end their industrial action. More than 1m letters were held up by the strike and the Royal Mail warned it may take a week to clear the backlog. The Royal Mail said last night it was 'premature' to discuss the plan for Merseyside, although consultations were going on with the UCW. However, Mr John Ireland, a local UCW official, warned: 'If talks fail we will go for a strike ballot.' An internal Royal Mail management document obtained by the union reveals details of the Liverpool 'delivery plan' which are to be discussed in staff briefings this month for implementation in September. The document says Liverpool has low levels of productivity and jobs can be safeguarded only by raising productivity. The plan aims to align working hours and the number of workers more closely and calls for early starts to ensure the maximum amount of mail is delivered on time on first delivery. At present, it says, 85 per cent of the postal traffic is available for first delivery and this workload is handled by 60 per cent of the delivery hours. The remaining 15 per cent of the workload is taken out on a second delivery that uses 40 per cent of the working hours available.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 88 (578); </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] At the session of the new Ukrainian parliament  opening on Wednesday President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to  submit a document describing the reasons for the postponement of  presidential and local elections scheduled for 26 June.    Earlier the head of state told the press that the powers of  the new president should be clearly defined. He spoke for  harmonizing the laws on presidency and local government.    "If the president in Kiev is going to have the powers of the  head of the Executive Branch of power and territories are going  to be governed by parliamentary structures, the president will  have no power over the provinces," Kravchuk believes. He  accounted his decision to run for presidency to the wish to turn  down accusations from the opposition that Kravchuk is afraid of  elections. IF Note: The collection of signatures in support of  contenders for presidency ended on 6 May. According to  preliminary reports, the necessary number of signatures (100,000  in all the 27 electoral districts and at least 1500 in 18) were  collected for Kravchuk, the former prime minister Leonid Kuchma,  the former speaker of parliament Ivan Plyushch, the Minister of  Education Petro Talanchuk and the leader of the Socialist Party  Aleksandr Moroz.    Already 120 members of the new parliament have expressed  readiness to support Kravchuk in his attempt to postpone  presidential elections. Approximately the same number of  left-wing MP's is going to vote against the postponement.  Experts believe that the approximate balance of forces might  block a decision on the matter. In this case the resolution of  the old parliament setting the date of the elections for 26 June  will remain in force.    Meanwhile, some experts do not rule out the possibility that  the subject of presidential elections is not going to be raised  at the first sessions of the new parliament at all as it will  focus on procedure questions.    On Tuesday the working group for the agenda drafted the  procedure of beginning the session. A member of the group Yuriy  Sherenin said the parliament should first elect the presidium  and secretariat of the session, the accounting and credentials  commissions. After that the coverage of the session is going to  be discussed as well as a draft resolution on parliamentary  groups and factions. After the adoption of this resolution an  interval should be announced for several days to form groups and  factions and to register them.</p>

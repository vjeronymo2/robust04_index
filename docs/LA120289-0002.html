			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Down the street from LAX, overlooking the 405 Freeway, stands a billboard  hawking a new BMW automobile. The ad reads: "Own the San Diego Frwy. For Just  $25,105."  </P> <P> The billboard stands at the border of Inglewood, where virtually half of the  households, according to one reliable study, earn less than $25,000 a year.  </P> <P> Over the decades, moviegoers have been lured to theaters by all sorts of  gimmicks and free gifts, including dishes, 3-D glasses, vomit bags and  scratch-and-sniff "Odorama" cards. William Castle, the self-styled king of  exploitation horror films, insured spectators of the 1957 film "Macabre" with  Lloyds of London for $1,000 against death by fright. And in Castle's  "Homicidal," an announcement burst onto the screen after 100 minutes stating  that anyone too scared to view the final 120 seconds could leave and have their  money refunded.  </P> <P> Comes now "Phantom of the Mall," a shocker film at which spectators are being  offered optional blood pressure tests before entering the theater. Those  registering a reading of 195/125 will be turned away, the ads for Friday's  opening say.  </P> <P> According to a hypertension expert contacted by The Times, anyone with a blood  pressure reading of 195/125 should not be watching "The Sound of Music," let  alone "Phantom of the Mall." They should be seeing their doctor.  </P> <P> Normal blood pressure for a 40-year-old adult is 140/90, said Dr. Ka Kit Hui,  an associate professor of medicine at UCLA. Without proper medical care, people  with a 195/125 reading are prone to heart and kidney problems.  </P> <P> Speaking of horror films, only "Exorcist" buffs will understand the irony of  Linda Blair's upcoming appearance this morning at a Superbowl of Chili Cook-Off  in Sylmar.  </P> <P> For 16 years, Marquesa Di Lara Anna Ma. Schott Fonz Abrew De Carrascosa, more  commonly referred to in certain circles as the mysterious "Lady in Black," was  buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.  </P> <P> That's several miles and one Griffith Park away from Hollywood Memorial Park  Cemetery. The latter is the burial site of Rudolph Valentino, whose crypt the  "Lady in Black" visited with some regularity.  </P> <P> On Friday, Estrellita Del Regil reburied her mother's remains at Hollywood  Memorial.  </P> <P> The new grave, she said, is "about 100 yards and across the lake" from  Valentino.  </P></p>

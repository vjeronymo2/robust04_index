			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Support for Albania, Moldova, </F> Bulgaria"]    [Excerpt] The European Commission (EC) has earmarked  financial aid for Albania, Moldova, and Bulgaria. This was  decided at a meeting of the group of 24 rich countries to  discuss macroeconomic aid to Central and East Europe.    The EC proposes to make ECU35 million available to Albania.  This EU [European Union] loan is to support the country's  balance of payments and covers about one half of the financing  deficit incurred during the first year of implementing the  reform and stabilization program.    Over recent years, Albania has already received a loan of  ECU70 million from the European Union. The EC is, however,  insisting that this East European country should normalize its  relations with commercial credit institutions so that the  financing of private trade and direct foreign investments can  quickly begin.    Moldova is to receive a long-term loan of ECU45 million from  the EC. The Twelve agreed back in December on the principle of  granting assistance to this former Soviet republic. The loan  covers one third of the Moldovan financing deficit for 1994.    The support for the Bulgarian balance of payments is to be  increased to ECU150 million, following the green light from the  EU Council. An increase in support for the Romanian balance of  payments is also likely, according to EU Commissioner Henning  Christophersen. This European assistance comes on top of  financial aid from the IMF and the World Bank for the economic  reform program in Romania and Bulgaria. [passage omitted]</p>

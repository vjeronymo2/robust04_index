			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman for </F> the Democratic Left Alliance, by Maria Bninska at the Radio ESKA  studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of ESKA" program -- live]    [Text] [Bninska] Good morning to you.    [Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too.    [Bninska] Yesterday's talks ended quite late at night -- in  any event, we, journalists, did not leave the hotel at Parkowa  Street until after 2300. Did you, the participants of the  talks, have any further talks after that?    [Siemiatkowski] Yes, we did, but it was a purely social kind  of meeting.    [Bninska] But was anything more decided during that social  meeting than what we managed to find out?    [Siemiatkowski] No, especially given that the meeting  practically included only members of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD]. It was a meeting whose practical purpose was to  recap what happened in recent days and also to think what the  next moves should be, but this time they will be made by SLD.    [Bninska] Today's newspapers report that the conflict  between SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has been  overcome. Has it really been overcome, or is it just a  temporary calm and another story will break soon?    [Siemiatkowski] I mean, I would like to make a subtle  protest here against using the term conflict between SLD and  PSL. We do not hide the fact that it was indeed a case of a  crisis in mutual relations between the coalition partners, but  this crisis was not caused by [word indistinct] issues, I mean  by personal issues -- that is the way it looked in the  beginning. It was in essence a grievance of the SLD part of the  coalition against the part represented by the prime minister,  over some irregularities in the functioning of the Council of  Ministers. Everything that was caused by Mr. Kawalec's  dismissal was a catalyst for some negative phenomena which took  place in the functioning of the Council of Ministers.    [Bninska] Aleksander Kwasniewski used stronger terms when  talking about that -- he said Prime Minister Pawlak fails to  observe the coalition agreement.    [Siemiatkowski] In this particular case -- and also in some  others which we also made public -- it was a case of  nonobservance of some binding provisions on the part of Mr.  Waldemar Pawlak -- these provisions boiled down to the need to  consult the deputy prime ministers concerned and in the presence  of the chairmen of the fractions, over the most important  strategic and political decisions, including personnel  decisions. In the case of Mr. Kawalec -- and also in other  cases, for instance appointing local governors [wojewodowie] --  this particular provision of the coalition agreement was not  observed and that is why it was necessary to have another  discussion.    [Bninska] Yesterday's communique -- which is quite laconic  -- says that the coalition agreement continues to be binding and  that both sides will observe it. What kinds of guarantees did  you [SLD activists] receive that Prime Minister Pawlak will  observe particularly that provision, when you look ahead a  month, two, or three months down the road?    [Siemiatkowski] The communique is not so laconic at all. It  contains two very important issues -- it first of all confirms  that there is a will on both sides to keep the PSL-SLD coalition  in existence ....    [Bninska, interrupting] And what is more, it is to continue  for as long as four years.    [Siemiatkowski] Yes, for four years, so practically  speaking all the speculations have been cut off at this point --  I mean the speculations which emerged in the meantime,  concerning a possible reversal of alliances. Some have even  expressed their willingness to participate in such alliances --  let me remind you of the funny case of Mr. Krol or Mr. Moczulski  [of the Confederation for an Independent Poland] among others,  who have even called a news conference, and felt they were  almost inside the coalition, but then it turned out nobody  invited them there in the first place. That is the first issue,  and the other issue which SLD felt very strongly about, is that  PSL -- through those who signed the communique, including the  prime minister himself -- accepts the principle of a unanimous  support of the budget draft which had been presented by the  government. That is because we felt at one point -- this was  our feeling at the time -- that there is a government of Mr.  Waldemar Pawlak and a budget by Minister Borowski. We took the  position from the very beginning that it is a budget of Waldemar  Pawlak's government. The budget was designed according to some  criteria which allow for a chance for economic growth and for  maintaining positive economic trends.    [Bninska] So my understanding is that there will be no more  cases such as what happened during a session by a Sejm  commission where a minister for this government -- I mean the  foreign economic cooperation minister, Mr. Leslaw Podkanski who  is at the same time a Sejm deputy -- demanded another trillion  zlotys for something, and when asked by Mr. Marek Borowski  whether he made the demand as a minister or as a Sejm deputy, he  said: This time, I am doing this as a Sejm deputy.    [Siemiatkowski] There will be no cases like this. We should  not have events like the prime minister's speech at the Zeran  automobile factory where he distanced himself from some price  rises -- this made it look as if the rises were just Minister  Borowski's responsibility and as if they had not been agreed  upon by the entire Council of Ministers -- I mean the price  rises with regard to energy carriers. We should not have very  many other examples of such incidents which basically undermined  the coherency of the cabinet's economic policies.    [Bninska] All right, the communique also states that the  posts of both deputy prime minister and the finance minister,  will remain within SLD's range of powers. There are rumors that  perhaps it will not be just one person occupying the two posts,  like it was in the case of Minister Borowski. The first  question is: Who will be the finance minister? The second  question is: Who will be the deputy prime minister?    [Siemiatkowski] Of course, I have not been authorized to  give names at this stage. There are many candidates. The issue  requires very deep deliberation on SLD's part. The person to  occupy the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister --  I think this is what you mean ....    [Bninska, interrupting] So this will be just one person who  will be in charge of both posts?    [Siemiatkowski] Of course, because only the kind of  positioning of the finance minister which also places him as the  chairman of the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee,  creates an opportunity for him to conduct a coherent economic  policy and to influence measures taken by the individual  ministers responsible for the economy. I am returning here to  the conditions set by Minister Borowski before the prime  minister at one point -- where there was a statement [word  indistinct] that if the deputy prime minister for economic  affairs is to be efficient, then his powers should be clearly  defined and he also must enjoy autonomy in what he does. We  will return to that condition in our talks with PSL.    [Bninska] These conditions were not approved. What will  happen to them next?    [Siemiatkowski] These were not conditions, these were  postulates for improving the activity of the Council of  Ministers ....    [Bninska, interrupting] But the prime minister refused to  agree to them.    [Siemiatkowski] I think that yesterday's talks -- and also  subsequent talks ahead of us, this time we will discuss a  specific person who will take up the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister -- will force both us and PSL to  initiate talks again on the topic of improving the Council of  Ministers' functioning, on defining the finance minister's  powers in a clear manner, and also on increasing discipline in  the course of statements and activities undertaken by the  individual ministers who on many occasions -- you [addressing  Bninska] cited an example yourself -- kind of torpedoed the  finance minister's measures.    [Bninska] Will the person who will take up both posts be  very closely associated with SLD? Or will he be just a  well-wisher?    [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, Minister Borowski  established such high standards through his skills and  competence, that it will be very hard for us to find a person  who would meet the criteria which are also required for someone  to fulfill the post of finance minister [word indistinct]    [Bninska, interrupting] So there is just one Borowski within  SLD?    [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, for a few years now we  have gotten used to Mr. Marek Borowski being the person  responsible for economic policies within SLD -- and before that,  in the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, when we were  still in the opposition when he was charged with the concept of  opposition economic policies -- we associated our plans and  ideas with him, and in a word -- most of us were attached to him  but as we all know, life does not tolerate a vacuum and there  are no irreplaceable people. In this situation, we must find  someone who will be able to continue in a competent manner with  the policies initiated by Mr. Marek Borowski. That person also  has to be able to implement the policy in close contact with Mr.  Marek Borowski, especially since he will also be co-responsible  as a Sejm deputy and he will have an impact on the government's  economic policies since he is coming back to the [Sejm] Budget  Commission where he will work.    [Bninska] You came to a compromise with PSL yesterday. If  my understanding is correct, a compromise is based on giving  something up in return for gaining something else. What did SLD  have to give up?    [Siemiatkowski] I think we achieved a great deal by forcing  the prime minister and also our coalition partners from PSL to  think through the situation that emerged, we forced them to  discuss again the terms of the coalition agreement, and we also  forced them to publicly confirm that there is no alternative to  the PSL-SLD coalition.    [Bninska] But you must have given up something.    [Siemiatkowski] We gave up Marek Borowski. That is a high  price to pay.    [Bninska] Did you also give up demands for a resignation by  the chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] Michal  Strak?    [Siemiatkowski] We have never made this kind of postulate.  The only postulate we did make was to have a reorganization of  work done by URM, and we also expressed criticism with regard to  URM's personnel policies, in particular with regard to the  government's territorial administration [words indistinct]    [Bninska] And what did the prime minister give up during  yesterday's talks? After all, he also must have given up  something.    [Siemiatkowski] I think he gave up the kinds of statements  which were made even during the television newscast the day  before yesterday -- I mean the kinds of statements were he  distanced himself from Minister Borowski's economic policies  which were also supported by SLD -- that was an economic policy  based on the concept of development, but one which also took the  economic realities into account and which does not create a  danger of Poland slipping into economic rowdiness, a return of  inflation, or announcing slogans which are very nice to hear but  which are economically meaningless.    [Bninska] And what did SLD gain?    [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] What we gained was a  confirmation of the will for the SLD-PSL coalition to exist. It  seems that is ....    [Bninska, interrupting] And what did PSL gain?    [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] Nobody needed the conflict, and  we made that clear to our PSL colleagues and partners. It was a  game with a negative balance -- nobody gained and everybody  lost. We all lost in the eyes of part of the public opinion  which at one point had a right to ask the question of whether  the coalition agreement and the election promises are really  being implemented in a responsible manner, and also whether the  significant portion of our society did the right thing by voting  PSL and SLD on 19 September. We wanted to make that clear to our  partners, as well -- namely that the real stakes in the game are  much higher: Public trust, the country's fate, and the fact  that somebody had put faith in us and we must act accordingly.  In that context, individual ambitions by parties or people are  a secondary issue. I think we were probably successful in  conveying that to our PSL colleagues and to the prime minister  during yesterday's talks.    [Bninska] Has President Lech Walesa finally signed Deputy  Prime Minister Borowski's resignation?    [Siemiatkowski] He affirmed during yesterday's newscast that  he had signed it.    [Bninska] During the same newscast, the president also said  that the time has come for the parliament to deal with enacting  legislation and that the time has come for presidential rules.  What does SLD say to that?    [Siemiatkowski] The president's involvement in the last  stage of the coalition crisis only proves that nobody gained  anything from the crisis, and if there was anybody who could  gain, it was the president who immediately used the opportunity  to have his contribution and to point to the crisis in the  mutual relations within the coalition and also to imperfect  constitutional provisions, and in that regard he discussed again  his concept of a strong presidency. That is just proof that our  crisis was being watched very closely. We also made it clear to  our coalition partners that among our mutual obligations toward  the voters, there is an obligation to speak in favor of a  constitutional authority based on a cabinet-parliamentary  system. It would be hard for anyone of us to explain that we  are in favor of presidential rules. I think the president  unnecessarily made a hurried gesture in the sense of making  statements that could in a way strengthen his position.    [Bninska] But the president has disliked this government  from the beginning, and he did not even try to hide it. Most of  all, he has disliked SLD. Is SLD afraid that the president  could vigorously try to create presidential rules even before  his term is over?    [Siemiatkowski] The president is a very skillful politician,  and so he is applying the very old principle of: Divide and  rule. He points to some parts of the coalition as better than  others. The most important thing is that we do not let him  divide us, I mean PSL and SLD. I can see no possibility of any  special increase in presidential powers before his term is over.  He is in power based on the Small Constitution and until the  constitution proper is enacted, all in all his powers are  limited since he has to share his powers with the executive  branch -- that is with the government -- and also with the  legislative branch, that is the parliament. There is a system  of different forces in effect which mutually control one  another, and I think the system proves its validity during  crisis situations which erupt now and then. The president has  always won when he was an umpire, but in this case he wanted to  go beyond the role and be a party, in a way. Becoming a party  to conflicts has always been bad for the presidential post.    [Bninska] You said PSL and SLD cannot allow having anyone  create divisions between them. What about divisions within both  of them? As recently as the day before yesterday, the prime  minister quote, played, unquote, this whole conflict, with the  aim -- among others -- of creating a split within SLD and having  the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] sever its  connections with SLD.    [Siemiatkowski] An attempt like this was indeed undertaken.  We also mentioned that issue to the prime minister during  yesterday's talks and I think ....    [Bninska, interrupting] And what did he say?    [Siemiatkowski] An official statement signed by OPZZ Deputy  Chairman Martyniuk was a lot of food for thought for the prime  minister -- Martyniuk in a way distanced himself from  assessments which were contained in the prime minister's  television appearance. Martyniuk informed that OPZZ is not a  group which would be interested in creating political  destabilization in the country and that the trade union -- while  understanding the supreme interests -- is willing to support the  budget, and that is also a very important statement which means  that you just cannot make irresponsible statements like this [by  Pawlak] and play games with social moods and with moods of  various interest groups.    [Bninska] What are the guarantees of yesterday's  agreement's observance in practice? Apart from the joint  communique, SLD continues to be practically deprived of an  impact on what happens in URM, which means no impact on the  day-to-day decisionmaking by the government. There are no SLD  men in URM so you have no guarantees that the prime minister  will observe the agreement. What did he tell SLD?    [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in favor of a  thesis which says that politics conducted without the right  principles, must backfire sooner or later. One of the  principles in politics is keeping promises and obligations. Our  view is that the signatures themselves which were placed under  the communique must be proof enough of the goodwill by those who  signed the communique. Those who placed these signatures must  also be aware that the signature means something more than just  the ink.    [Bninska] But at the very beginning of the conflict SLD  expressed very harsh views on the prime minister and on the  whole case. Day by day, the tone of the statements became less  radical, until yesterday's shake-hands by Aleksander Kwasniewski  and Waldemar Pawlak. How did you calculate this? Why was  decreasing the tensions worth it for you?    [Siemiatkowski] It was not a calculation. All we did was to  come to a conclusion at some point that we will no longer make  the conflict more radical.    [Bninska] Why is that?    [Siemiatkowski] Because of the supreme interest in leading  to a stabilization of Poland's political situation -- we were  successful in achieving that, thanks to the establishment of the  majority coalition which has such a huge support in the Sejm.  The coalition has very important tasks before it, namely to  solve problems resulting from the necessity of continuing with  the reforms of our economy and of making permanent the  democratic processes which are occurring in Poland, or which  have been occurring for four years now. That is the supreme  issue, and all the other issues are secondary. That is why we  were even willing to give up our own ambitions, if we could only  gain [words indistinct]    [Bninska, interrupting] If you could only remain in the  governing coalition?    [Siemiatkowski] No, remaining in the governing coalition at  any cost was not the issue. The issue was about being in a  coalition which has the chances to implement a policy which is  in accordance with the interests of those people who voted for  SLD. I can assure you that if there comes a time when we reach  the calculated conclusion that SLD's continued presence in any  kind of association with the authorities, or in a coalition, is  not in accordance with the interests of those who had voted for  us and with the interests of the entire society -- in that case  we will not insist on keeping the posts which our colleagues  currently occupy. And if we come to the conclusion that we can  do more for our voters while being in the opposition, then we  will switch to the opposition. But as of today, our view is  that there is both a chance and a real possibility of  implementing our election program while being in a governing  coalition. Only when you are in power, do you have  implementation instruments necessary for implementing an  election program.    [Bninska] Thank you very much for the conversation.    [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Parker prepares to write a new chapter: The image the pen maker is trying to maintain as it looks for a buyer A return to basics has swung Parker, the now British-based pen maker, from loss to profit and put it on the lookout for a buyer with Pounds 300m to spare. The movement from the loss-making days of the mid-1980s appears complete. But it has been a chequered path since the Dollars 100m management buy-out staged by Mr Jacques Margry, Parker's chairman, and his fellow executives in 1986. In 1987 and 1988 Parker twice aborted flotation plans. In 1988 it was the target of a failed friendly takeover offer of Pounds 180m by Pentland Industries, a British group that had made a fortune with a stake in the Reebok sports shoe business. Parker said at the time of its June 1988 flotation that the plan was abandoned because of stock market pessimism. Image has been vital for the pen maker. Back in the 1960s, there could hardly have been a finer symbol of meritocratic reward for a child who passed the 11-plus exam than to be given a rolled-gold Parker 61 fountain pen. Mr George Parker, a Wisconsin teacher who founded the company in 1888, would have been proud; academy and commerce linked through a symbol not simply of status, but also of quality. Through most of its history, Parker has maintained strongly defined branding, focused on quality and steering clear of cheap disposability. That brand image created loyalty. But loyalty is a fragile emotion in business; it needs nursing. In the early 1980s, Parker tried to propel itself into the mass disposable pen market, while keeping its up-market image for other products. Parker came unstuck. Enter Mr Margry. His answer, apparently successful, has been to turn back the clock and return to the core brand value of quality. A marketing specialist, he has been with the company for 42 years. A former group area manager covering Europe, Mr Margry has throughout tried to hold to a consistent marketing line: 'Our strategy had always been to position Parker at the top of the market, not as a designer product, but as a high-quality product which cost more but delivered more.' Mr Margry's strategy was not always followed. In 1976, Parker started a wide-front marketing battle, with a price war against one big competitor, Shaeffer, at the top end of the market, and a foray into the disposable pen business, taking on the Japanese with a ballpoint called Itala. It was, for Mr Margry, a classic brand-confusing error. 'By going down-market we confused the customer; the consumer no longer knew what Parker stood for. We were all over the place, dissipating the advertising.' The Parker Pen Company decided to sell off its writing instruments division in 1985, following a series of losses which Mr Margry attributes di-rectly to the marketing changes. Following the January 1986 buy-out, Mr Margry and his team brought Parker back into profit; 1987 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.3m, compared with a Pounds 300,000 loss in the previous year, on turnover up from Pounds 115m to Pounds 128.7m. The years since 1987 have seen steady growth; operating profit has increased an average 16.3 per cent annually, while sales have yearly grown an average 7.3 per cent. Mr Margry has no doubt that returning Parker to its traditional marketing policy - which he sums up as 'not trying to chase every rabbit in the field'  -has been the main factor behind its recent steady growth. Parker spends 80 per cent of its advertising budget promoting top-range pens; the other 20 per cent is for discretionary use by local managers. Sales this year will be about Pounds 180m worldwide, says Mr Margry, out of a total international market worth some Pounds 2.1bn annually at retail prices. In the UK, Parker claims a dominating 53 per cent of the writing instrument market, while Mont Blanc has 6 per cent, Waterman 5 per cent, Shaeffer 7 per cent and Cross 6 per cent. The marketing policy devised by Mr Margry has meant avoiding two extremes; neither down-market into cheap disposables, nor following Mont Blanc (part of the Dunhill group) up-market into the fountain pen as a designer accessory. 'I think to market yourself as something to be purchased as a status symbol is dangerous in the long term. Everyone who has made a perfume or a dress wants to make pens; these are temporary markets,' says Mr Margry. Mont Blanc would disagree. Mr Kevin Boltman, Mont Blanc's UK marketing manager, says the company's advertising is deliberately designed to encourage purchasers 'to think they are buying an aesthetic quality, a luxury item, not just a pen'. To that end, Mont Blanc, whose factory is based in Hamburg, 'has a limited distribution policy, to protect the brand as a sort of Mercedes-Benz of pens'. But for many, the top brand in pens is still Parker. Mr Gerry Grimstone, a director of the merchant bank Schroder, has the task of steering it home to a new buyer. He says Parker is looking for a buyer that will appreciate 'the strengths of the global brand, of its international distribution network and the continual product development which Parker performs. That is actually unlikely to mean someone from the pen world'. Mr Margry is looking for a buyer that values a quality brand, one that has the royal warranties of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. Mr Grimstone is talking to some 50 potential customers. He is confident a deal will soon be signed; no doubt both sides will be using a top-of-the-range Pounds 3,000, 18-carat gold Parker Premier Presidential.</p>

In Karnataka, the Dunkel Draft Text (DDT) was being debated  and aggressively opposed even as awareness of this important  issue was just beginning to grow in other parts of the country.  As early as March 1992, nearly 700 scientists from the Indian  Institute of Science, Bangalore, India's premier research  institution, signed a letter addressed to the Prime Minister,  expressing their opposition to the DDT which they felt would  compromise India's self-reliance in science and technology.    The credit for highlighting the impact a Dunkel Draft-based  agreement would have on Indian agriculture--from the question of  seed/gene patenting and the rights of cultivators, to the likely  effects of multinationals' entry into the crucial food  sector--goes to the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRSS), a  farmers' organisation led by M.D. Nanjundaswamy. KRSS members  carried out a daring attack on the Bangalore office of Cargill  India Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S. multinational Cargill Inc.,  in January 1993, followed by another attack on the Cargill  factory in Bellary. These may have drawn a great deal of media  flak for their "adventurism," but these actions were primarily  responsible for opening the Dunkel debate to the public and  indeed forcing the Government--which till then had chosen to  conceal the import of the GATT negotiations--to come clean and  explain its negotiating stance to a large and concerned  constituency.    "It is a total surrender of the country's sovereignty by the  Government of India at a time when the issue was under debate in  Parliament, and also under examination by the Standing Committee  on Agriculture headed by Nitish Kumar, which has not yet  submitted its recommendations. The Government never bothered to  refer the matter to the State legislatures though many subjects  covered by the Dunkel Draft come under the State List, such as  agriculture," says Nanjundaswamy, who dismisses the Government's  claims of having gained concessions, particularly in the textile  sector, as empty talk. "The so-called concessions are all at the  level of oral assurances. There is nothing committed to in black  and white--including in textiles," he says. He is equally  dismissive of the Government's promises of protecting the  farmers' right to retain seeds. "The accused must prove his  innocence, under the reversal of the burden of proof. The farmer  will have to prove that he has used his own seed, and not the  patented seed."    The KRSS has filed a writ petition in the Karnataka High  Court questioning the constitutional validity of the Union  Government's action in signing the Draft Final Treaty of GATT  which, it says, affects the basic federal structure of the  Constitution and damages the citizens' fundamental rights. It  has pleaded for a writ of mandamus to the Union Government  directing it: 1. to get the consent of the State legislatures  before signing the final treaty; 2. to hold a referendum before  signing the final treaty; and 3. to make a comprehensive  statement concerning the contents of the final treaty. It has  also sought a similar writ of mandamus to be issued to the  President to exercise his power under Article 143 of the  Constitution (to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for its  opinion).    Nanjundaswamy, who attended an anti-Dunkel meeting of  representatives of farmers, ecologists and consumer groups in  Geneva on December 4, says, "Our stand is that India should  remain a member of GATT, but should have demanded drastic  amendments in the agreement. India had the opportunity to build  up a Third World lobby that would have given us stronger  bargaining power."    This is a view shared by others. "My charge against the  Government is that there was no attempt to take the lead in  organising Third World countries to take a harder bargaining  position," says H.D. Deve Gowda, Janata Dal MP and a member of  the parliamentary committee headed by I.K. Gujral set up to  examine the Dunkel Draft. "At one stage two years ago, the  Government actually issued instructions to its negotiators in  the talks not to mobilise the support of other countries. They  can't mortgage our independence like this. After all, we are a  nation of 90 crore people, and can't be bullied by Clinton."    Referring to an article by former Foreign Secretary Muchkund  Dubey, S. Chatterji, a scientist at the Indian Institute of  Astrophysics, Bangalore, says: "In his article Dubey makes clear  how suggestions that India call a meeting of non-aligned  countries to forge common ground on the Dunkel issue was met  with hostility from the Government. To me, the question of  whether or not we should have signed it is hypothetical. We  never tried to find an alternative. We could have stood firm on  the question of intellectual property rights and could have got  the support of countries like Argentina and Brazil. They cannot  impose a so-called uniform multilateral trading order, when the  global world order is not uniform."    There is widespread concern about GATT's adverse impact on  different sectors of the economy--agriculture, textiles,  services, and a large, uncharted area where intellectual  property rights will unfairly restrict growth--but most persons  admit to not being clear about the exact ramifications of the  various clauses in the text. Most of the scientists whom  FRONTLINE spoke to, for example, while careful not to overreact  on an issue which they all claimed they did not know enough  about, expressed their reservations about the scope of the  agreement, particularly its implications for the future of  Indian science and technology. D. Balasubramaniam, Director of  the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, drew  attention to the lack of "public documentation" and the  Government's failure to ascertain public opinion on such an  important issue. But his main concern is about India's  self-reliance in the field of science and technology. "Are we  closing our gates to ourselves?" This is really what is worrying  me. Any nation for its well-being must be self-reliant. This  doesn't mean that it must be self-sufficient in everything,  although self-sufficiency is a good goal for important areas,  like food. People seem to forget that technology moves fast, it  leaps across boundaries. To restrict technological growth is to  impose an economic burden on an otherwise radiating field. We in  India are concerned about health care, the use of genes,  particularly gene therapy. Patents can restrict our access to  technology. Any nation's long term goal in scientific research  is that it will lead to a greater amount of awareness and  prosperity. In an economic crisis, 'luxuries' such as science,  education and health are hit first. Under GATT it may become  easier and/or more cost effective to import products from  outside. But this will certainly lead to the scientific and  technological aspects of Indian economic development taking a  back seat."    The problem is not merely the use of patents as an  instrument  of unfair leverage. The prohibitive costs of international  patents will also deter even those individuals/research  establishments that may wish to get into the business of  patenting, according to H. Sharad Chandra, Professor, Department  of Molecular and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science.  "Knowledge of patents in India is woefully lacking," he  observed. "It has never really been a part of our  culture--remember the great Mughal artists who would not even  sign their creations. An American patent costs around Rs. 20  lakh--out of the question for the ordinary scientist. And one in  a hundred patents may be accepted. Take the Indian Institute of  Science. We as an institution may not be able to spend on more  than two such patents a year. With this reality staring us in  the face, if the Government wants us to get more competitive, it  must provide professional investment/patent advice. My feeling  is that, in the short run, the GATT agreement will make the rich  richer and the poor poorer."    With the monopoly status a patent confers on its holder,  plus  the opening up of markets, we will be "moving backwards,"  according to A.V. Rama Rao, Director, Indian Institute of  Chemical Technology, Hyderabad. "Once you open up, the  Government has no control. Multinationals have huge marketing  capabilities. All right, we have signed because all nations have  done so. But the Government must consider what safeguards it can  give local producers. We have both manpower and technical  capabilities."    It is in the area of health that the new intellectual  property regime will perhaps make the most palpable impact. Drug  prices are predicted to rise steeply. "Yesterday was the saddest  day in my life," Dr. Y.K. Hameid, managing director of Cipla, an  Indian owned pharmaceutical company, told FRONTLINE. "By  accepting the TRIPS part of the Dunkel Draft, we have  compromised on two crucial areas of the country's  well-being--food and health. What we have done is to put  ourselves at the mercy of multinationals. The impact on drug  prices will be felt in the next five to 10 years. Ultimately our  companies will be forced to sell out." Cipla is the fourth  largest pharmaceutical company in India, with an expected  turnover of Rs. 250 crore in 1994. It exports bulk drugs and  formulations to Europe, America and other countries.    "Articles 27 and 28 of the Dunkel Text will allow the patent  holder both to produce and import. MNCs prefer to import rather  than produce locally, and they do not allow their local units to  export to overseas markets. What guarantees have we obtained  against such practices?" asks B.K. Chandrashekhar, Professor,  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, and co-editor of the  book, The Dunkel Draft: Design for Disaster  (Navakarnataka Publications, Bangalore).    The contradictory statements made by the Government and its  attempt to obfuscate an already confusing document, which, as  Balasubrananiam says, "binds our national endeavours not in  terms of global trade but in terms of global restrictions," has  been criticised sharply. Chandrashekhar says: "First Pranab  Mukherjee says farmers' interests will be protected. The next  minute he says farmers must pay a one-time royalty for seeds. It  is not clear whether exchange of seeds will be a part of the  sui generis form of protection for seeds as required  by GATT. And what are the actual provisions in the sui  generis system that will be offered as an alternative to  patents?"    But, despite the pessimism the GATT agreement has generated,  there is the stated confidence that a nation of India's size and  capabilities cannot be browbeaten. As one commentator observed,  "After all, the GATT agreement is not the Indian Constitution,  and if its implementability becomes a serious problem, there  will be a demand for changes in the agreement by political and  economic forces in the country."</p>

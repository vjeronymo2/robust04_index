			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Starozhitskaya of UNIAN specially for </F> IZVESTIYA, under "Events and Comments" rubric: "Ukrainian  President Flies Off to United States Offended at His  Compatriots"]    [Text] Kiev -- In his last appearance on television before  his visit to the United States, Leonid Kravchuk clearly  explained to the electorate the reasons why he has decided not  to participate in the presidential elections scheduled for 26  June.    From what he said, because of the great probability of a  second or even third round of parliamentary elections and the  unformed state of the government, even if he does participate in  the elections, anarchy is inevitable. "I have been driven into  a corner: I have either to throw everything away and enter the  elections, or display responsibility and not take this step," he  said. "There is also another moral aspect. Like all of us, at  school and after school I studied the lives of other presidents,  but I have never come across such sordid, uncultured, and overt  campaign of persecution of a head of state as many people both  inside and outside parliament, as well as in the Ukrainian mass  media, are taking the liberty of conducting. It is a historic  phenomenon for such a boorish attitude toward the first  president to become established in the consciousness of  generations: In human terms I cannot and do not want to  understand it."    The first wave of impartial comments about the president's  step -- from "Has Kravchuk Gotten Cold Feet?" to "The Main Thing  Is Getting Out at the Right Time" (I cite the republic press  headlines) -- has already poured forth. Socialist Party chief  Aleksandr Moroz deemed Kravchuk's decision politically correct  -- inasmuch as, according to him, the president has practically  no chance of success at the elections. Rukh leader Vyacheslav  Chornovil has described Kravchuk's step as a tactical one aimed  at disrupting the presidential elections for the sake of  prolonging his own powers.    "I don't know why the president's nerve has failed him: Even  if he was not thinking of running, he should have announced this  a month or two before the elections, and not now, on the eve of  his trip to the United States. How will he speak with Clinton?"  -- the question posed by Democratic Party chief Vladimir  Yavorivskiy remains rhetorical at the moment.    However, the possibility of an imminent change of head of  state was not envisaged during preparations for Kravchuk's 3-7  March visit to the United States. At an advance meeting with  the Ukrainian diaspora, Bill Clinton said that the program of  the visit should be put together in such a way as to promote the  strengthening of Kravchuk's prestige at home to the maximum  degree.    "Whereas before the United States was only interested in the  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, now it is also  interested in full-scale cooperation and aid in the face of the  economic crisis," Anton Buteyko, the Ukrainian president's  adviser on international questions, said. Therefore, the main  aim of the present visit is specifically to move relations  between our countries to a new level and to sign agreements on  investment, trade, and economic relations, cooperation in the  sphere of conversion and space research, and on a specific  mechanism for granting disarmament assistance. Ukraine and the  United States can and should develop their ties independently of  relations with Russia.    However desirable it may be not to depend on these  relations,  such attention to Ukraine on the part of a Bill Clinton who just  two months ago did not want to visit Kiev can be explained by  the good intentions of obtaining a strong, peaceful, and  obedient Ukraine as a counterbalance to the unstable and  unpredictable Russia -- especially after the amnesty and the  hijacking of the U.S. initiative in settling the Bosnian  conflict.    As for the Ukrainian president, the problem of the Treaty on  the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which remains unsigned  by Ukraine, will inevitably arise during his visit to the United  States -- the last session of the present parliament is already  over, while the new elections are being called into question, as  Kravchuk has already convinced us. Perhaps the only thing that  remains for the president to do in the United States is to  declare himself the guarantor of the implementation of earlier  promises -- inasmuch as during the above-described period of  autocracy in Ukraine (roughly April-June) it will be possible  both to sign the treaty and start the removal of weapons in  accordance with the agreed plan for reducing offensive  armaments. Then it will be possible not to renounce  participation in the presidential elections -- the voice of Bill  Clinton, who has taken the Ukrainian citizens' fancy, will be  able to decide their outcome. Particularly since the reciprocal  sympathy of the U.S. president is backed up in material terms:  The most significant result of Kravchuk's visit will be credits  and payments to Ukraine by the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

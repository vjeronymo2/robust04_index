Qiu Fading, a native of Wujin County, east China's Jiangsu  Province, became the first trader of stocks at the Lhasa Stock  Trading Center. Qiu was said to have traded in 1,000 shares  listed by a local firm of Nanjing, provincial capital of Jiangsu.    The main trading hall, covering a floor space of more than  260 sq m, has been equipped with several terminals. A large  electronic indicator keeps rolling, telling share-traders  trading situations sent forth through satellite communications  from the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.    Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment Corporation,  said the opening of the securities exchange in Tibet has gained  the full support of Shanghai and Shenzhen.    According to him, his company is now the 381st member of the  Shanghai Securities Exchange, which has donated a full set of  equipment to the Tibetan exchange and helped in its installation.    The Tibetan stock trading counter will also be the first in  the country to have two-way communications links with the  Shenzhen Securities Exchange.    The operation of the securities exchange on the "roof of the  world" symbolizes the formation of a unified stock market in 30  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of the  mainland, said Lu Guoyuan, general supervisor of business at the  Shanghai Securities Exchange. Lu made a special appearance to  congratulate on the operation of the Lhasa Securities Exchange.

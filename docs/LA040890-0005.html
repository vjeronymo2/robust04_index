			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: START THE PRESSES!  </P> <P> The presses were rolling again at the Herald-Examiner in recent days, but it  was just background for director Bobby Roth, who's shooting a bloody and  climactic sequence for "Rainbow Drive," an action-suspense yarn for  ITC/Showtime. The film -- inspired by the drug murders that involved the late  porn star John Holmes -- wraps this weekend, as star Peter Weller, playing a  stubborn detective, tracks down the chief villains to the bowels of the  venerable newspaper building that closed with the demise of the Her-Ex last  year.  </P> <P> The climactic sequence, Roth says, began dramatically on the rooftop, ending  with "a pretty exciting death scene in which one of the main characters is  thrown into the (rolling) presses."  </P> <P> The movie, based on a novel by Roderick Thorpe, was originally to conclude in a  subway, with the Her-Ex used for squad-room scenes. But Roth says "the scope of  the presses was so impressive" that the script was rewritten to accommodate  them. A newspaper publisher now figures heavily in the plot.  </P> <P> The second floor Her-Ex editorial rooms remain a bit eery, says producer John  Veitch.  </P> <P> "It looks like everyone left all of a sudden, as if all activity suddenly  halted, with letters, books and what-have-you still scattered around."  </P> <P> Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

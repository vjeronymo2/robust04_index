			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Clal group's income almost doubled THE CLAL group, Israel's biggest publicly-traded industrial group, almost doubled net profits in 1991 to Shk81.6m (Dollars 35.8m) from Shk42m the year before, mainly due to a big surge in profits in its core holding, Clal Industries. Consolidated sales in the sprawling group, which encompasses electronics, textiles, construction and insurance among its interests, rose to Shk2.5bn from Shk2.36bn. Return on capital rose to 9.5 per cent from 5 per cent. Strong performances by Clal electronics subsidiaries, which include Scitex and ECI Telecom, two of Israel's fastest-growing companies, played a large part in the increased profitability. There were also benefits from Israel's immigration-fuelled construction boom and the associated acceleration in infrastructure building. The 75 per cent-owned Clal Industries, which includes the electronics companies, had a net profit of Shk146m, against Shk53m in 1990. At the group level, one-time revenues of Shk44m from the sale of shares in Scitex, ECI Telecom and Electra were offset by Shk47m costs incurred in the reorganisation of Clal's real estate business and some of its high-tech activities.</p>

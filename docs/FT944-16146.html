			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAN signals fundraising MAN, the engineering and commercial vehicles group, yesterday signalled its intention of raising its capital by DM300m (Dollars 193.5m) over the next five years. The company said its supervisory board had given management permission to seek shareholders' approval for a rights issue any time up until 1999. However, it was unable to say when the company would raise its nominal capital or what the money would be spent on. The Munich-based group has been badly hit by Germany's worst recession since the second world war. Profits fell 30 per cent last year to DM160m, but the company insisted it was now reaping the benefits of far-reaching restructuring over the past two years. Group sales rose 2 per cent to DM3.32 in the first quarter of this year, which began on July 1, while orders rose 25 per cent to DM4.7bn. Foreign orders rose 28 per cent to DM3bn while domestic orders, which lagged exports last year, picked up 21 per cent to DM1.7bn. The improvement in sales was attributed to better performances in the commercial vehicles and engineering divisions, which together make up just over 80 per cent of group turnover. However, the company said it hoped to boost sales further with its new Roland sheet fed printing presses, and the new range of trucks including the L2000 and the F2000 models. MAN is the second biggest German truck manufacturer after Mercedes-Benz. The company has predicted that truck sales in Germany are expected to fall until the end of this year and will pick up in 1995 as the German economy recovers. Like other German companies, MAN is finding it difficult to improve its market share because of high labour costs in Germany. The company has said it will try to keep its truck and bus production in Germany, but there are rumours that it may transfer at least some of it to a Turkish company in which it holds a stake.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: REDEFINING 'DRESSING FOR SUCCESS'  </P> <P> Kathy Taggares sold virtually everything she owned to raise enough cash to buy  a wholesale food business. Looking back, she says it sometimes takes more guts  than money to pull off an acquisition.  </P> <P> Nearly two years ago, she approached the giant Marriott Corp. with an offer to  buy Bob's Kitchens, the Marriott subsidiary that was making salad dressings for  Bob's Big Boy restaurants.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure Marriott knew how minimal my resources were and I wasn't about to  tell them," recalled Taggares. "But I figured, they can throw me out. What else  could they do?"  </P> <P> Instead of throwing her out, Marriott agreed to sell her the company, accepting  a combination of cash, a collateralized loan and the payment of the balance  through future product royalties.  </P> <P> "I basically bought a $6-million company with $200,000 in cash," said Taggares,  who sold her life insurance policy, her condominium and all her jewelry to  raise the money.  </P> <P> Taggares, 36, has worked in the food-processing industry most of her adult  life. Two years ago, she decided she was ready to own her own company. She  started asking everyone she knew in the food business for leads and found  herself looking at companies ranging from a trout farm to a peanut factory.  </P> <P> Through a business broker, she learned that Marriott was planning to get out of  the food-processing business by selling Bob's Kitchens. In June, 1987, she  bought the Glendale-based company and changed the name to K. T.'s Kitchens --  using her initials. K. T.'s, which has the exclusive right to make all the  Bob's Big Boy salad dressings for the Marriott-owned Big Boy restaurants, also  sells the dressings to other restaurants and grocery stores.  </P> <P> Marriott, which has 223 Bob's restaurants primarily on the East and West  Coasts, is in the process of converting them to Allie's, a more trendy,  family-style restaurant, according to a Marriott spokesman. He said he could  not comment on the sale of Bob's Kitchens or the arrangement under which  Taggares provides salad dressings for the restaurants.  </P> <P> Taggares said she is not worried about the loss of the familiar Big Boy  restaurants because her marketing research has shown that the people who eat at  Bob's restaurants are not the same ones who buy Bob's salad dressings.  </P> <P> "I think our primary user grew up with Bob's and now they don't necessarily  frequent the restaurants, but they have this wonderful memory of dipping their  French fries in Bob's bleu cheese dressing," said Taggares.  </P> <P> About 20% of the dressing she makes is sold to Bob's and other restaurant  chains and food service outlets. The remaining 80% is sold at the retail level  and available in virtually every supermarket, big and small, in Southern  California. Taggares said she is not sure whether the Allie's restaurants will  be buying her dressings in the future.  </P> <P> The dressing is sold under the Big Boy label in stores and sold to restaurants  and others under the Chef's Award brand. Retailing for about $2.49 for a  16-ounce jar, Bob's dressing is aimed at the high end of the salad dressing  market. It is costly, she said, because it contains only natural ingredients  and features imported cheeses from France.  </P> <P> Most days, K. T.'s Kitchens manufactures 10,000 gallons of Bob's salad  dressings, filling 150 jars a minute on a modern conveyor belt system. The  company, which employs about 60, is divided into two parts: One side of the  factory makes the salad dressings, the other makes refrigerated pizzas.  </P> <P> Using the first year's profits from her salad dressing business, Taggares  purchased a Monterey Park pizza crust company and moved it into her factory. To  maximize her investment, she decided to make the entire pizza and not just the  crust. The pizza is packed under the Poni and K. T.'s brands.  </P> <P> Taggares, whose lean frame belies a diet consisting mainly of corn chips dipped  in Bob's ranch dressing and her own pizza, said the pizza business is growing  much faster than the salad dressing business. This year, salad dressing sales  will be about $10 million and pizza sales about $4 million. Last year, K. T.'s  posted $8 million in total sales.  </P> <P> When she bought Bob's Kitchens, Taggares said she faced a major obstacle. The  primarily male, Latino workers had a difficult time adjusting to two new female  bosses after being supervised by white male, middle managers from Marriott.  </P> <P> There are no middle-level managers at K. T.'s. The company is run by Taggares  and her general manager, Joan Paris, a longtime friend and colleague who has  worked with Taggares at various food companies for the past 12 years.  </P> <P> The two women said they finally won their employees' respect by proving that  they really knew everything about the food-processing business.  </P> <P> "I've done every single one of these jobs," said Taggares, who frequently fills  in on the production line when her workers are absent.  </P> <P> Taggares, who grew up in the tiny, potato-growing town of Othello, Wash., has  sold potatoes and french fries and worked as the general manager of a  food-processing company.  </P> <P> As a teen-ager, she studied dance in New York and still looks and dresses like  a dancer. After working for several large food companies, she was anxious to  own her own business and live in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I like being the boss, and I thrive on chaos and commotion," said Taggares,  who usually works 10 to 12 hours a day.  </P> <P> She said her greatest frustration is dealing with the constant mechanical and  refrigerator breakdowns that plague any food-processing factory. The breakdowns  add to the pressure of meeting tight deadlines because she makes everything to  order for customers.  </P> <P> Despite the daily aggravations, Taggares said she is looking for new products  and acquisitions, with an eye toward items sold in the refrigerated section of  the grocery store.  </P> <P> "I make a lot of cold calls to business owners," said Taggares. "Some are  terribly flattered and others think we are trying to buy one of their  children."  </P> <P> Providing insight and tools for the small business owner is the goal of a  half-day seminar sponsored by the California World Trade Commission's Export  Finance Office and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. The session, scheduled  next Tuesday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., features three speakers: L. Fargo  Wells, director of the California Export Finance Office; Benjamin Pelter,  author of "How to Prepare a Solid Business Plan," and Edmond Freiermuth, a  business consultant specializing in helping troubled companies.  </P> <P> The session costs $40 and includes copies of Freiermuth's books. It will be  held at the Chamber of Commerce, 404 S. Bixel St., Los Angeles. For  reservations, send checks to Pelter &amp; Associates, 8500 Wilshire Blvd.,  Suite 815, Beverly Hills, Ca. 90211.  </P> <P> Registered investment adviser Libby Agran will discuss "Everything You Wanted  to Know About Money But Were Afraid to Ask," at a National Assn. of Women  Business Owners seminar on Tuesday. The dinner meeting begins with cocktails at  6 p.m. at the Petroleum Club in the Los Angeles Hilton, 930 Wilshire Blvd., Los  Angeles. The cost is $25 for pre-registered association members, $27 for  pre-registered non-members and $30 at the door. For information call: (213)  623-9977.  </P> <P> The April 30 deadline is approaching for nominations for the 1989 Entrepreneur  of the Year awards sponsored by Inc. magazine and Arthur Young International.  The program seeks to recognize successful business people from the greater Los  Angeles area. For information or applications, call (213) 551-7822.  </P></p>

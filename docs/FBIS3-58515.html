			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Sparaco: "Airbus: A Year Fraught With </F> Every Danger"]    [Text] Last year, the three major airliner manufacturers  [Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas] faced one business  difficulty after another. Together, they sold fewer than 300  aircraft and suffered some 400 cancellations. This gives a very  real illustration of the scale of the crisis currently affecting  the airlines industry.    Overcapacity is continuing to wreak havoc, although there  are  signs that it has peaked. In 1993, regular international  passenger traffic increased by 7 percent, and freight traffic by  8 percent, which is very encouraging. But the company tills are  empty and it will be a long time before they are firmly back on  their feet.    Also, paradoxically, fuel is at present "too cheap." This  means that the new generation of aircraft -- which are  particularly fuel efficient -- have lost much of their appeal.  The manufacturers are thus failing to obtain their just rewards.    About a 1,000 airliners are presently grounded, waiting  patiently for better days to come in impressive parking lots in  the California desert.    In fact, about 500 of them will never leave the ground  again:  apart from the fact that their owners have simply disappeared  (Pan Am, Eastern, and others), they are technically and  economically outdated. But there remain the other 500 more  recent aircraft -- some virtually new -- which sooner or later  are destined to find themselves back on the runways of major  airports.    This surplus represents 12 months of production for Boeing,  McDonnel Douglas, and Airbus Industrie. Which means that these  "big three" are going to have to wait an extra year following  any real recovery before being able to benefit from increased  contracts.    In the meantime, the manufacturers are having to make the  best of a bad situation. Boeing has sharply cut its production  and is gradually shedding almost 28,000 jobs. McDonnel Douglas  is taking a similar course of action but does have the benefit  of the wealth and diversity of military orders.    Airbus Industrie, on the other hand, is developing in a much  more original context. The European consortium has, for the  time being, succeeded in stabilizing production, despite a  disastrous balance sheet at the end of 1993.    With 38 new orders and 69 cancellations, the group ended the  year with a seriously negative net deficit. But in 1994 it will  nevertheless be delivering 134 aircraft, just two less [than in  1992.] Moreover, 138 deliveries are scheduled for 1995 and 154  for 1996.    This favorable situation is linked to the fact that the  range  of European models has been widened, providing access to new  markets. This is true of both the A330 and A340 jumbo jets and  the A321, a 180-seater which is in direct competition with the  Boeing 757.  <H5>  A Turning Point </H5>   On 31 December, 667 planes were recorded in the Airbus  Industrie order book. Since then, the A340 orders from Air  Canada and the A319 orders from Air Inter have come in. This  explains the confidence in the future.    Nevertheless, many of the aircraft now on order will not be  supplied until the end of the decade. And, in order to maintain  the present rate of activity, Airbus Industrie must quickly win  further orders.    Seen in this way, 1994 looks to be a year fraught with  problems. Either the recession will cause further cancellations  or the net balance will return to positive figures. In the  latter eventuality, may they rejoice in Toulouse.    But in the former eventuality, there will be every reason  for  the greatest concern. The verdict will be out in 11 and  one-half months.</p>

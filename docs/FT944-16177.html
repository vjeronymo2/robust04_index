			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: RJB may launch public offer - Pounds 1bn cost of British Coal business will partly be met by share issue RJB Mining is likely to use bank debt to fund more than half the total Pounds 1bn cost of taking over British Coal's English mining assets. That could leave more than Pounds 400m to be raised from a share issue, which is expected to include a public offer for sale. RJB, which the government declared on Wednesday was its preferred bidder for British Coal's three English regions, was financially one the strongest of the contenders. However, following the temporary suspension of its shares ahead of the announcement, it has a market value of less than Pounds 160m. Even so, it persuaded NM Rothschild, the government's advisers, that it would be able to raise the Pounds 1bn. The nature of the British Coal business should mean that reasonably cheap bank debt will not be too hard to find, while RJB has a strong shareholder base to support a large equity issue. RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, would not comment on the details of the proposed financing but it is thought likely that over half the funding will be provided by bank debt arranged by Barclays Mining Finance. 'Banks are falling over themselves to lend at the moment and the cash flow profile of the British Coal business should make it quite an attractive proposition. RJB has already shown it can turn around former British Coal pits quite quickly,' said one analyst. Although it is unclear what asset value the British Coal pits would be given in the enlarged group's books, it is likely to start life highly geared. However, the British Coal businesses come with supply contracts with the electricity generators lasting until March 1998. Assuming that RJB can keep costs under control, this should guarantee at least three years of strong cash flow, which could be used to pay down a large part of the bank debt. RJB is thought to have offered the government about Pounds 900m for the British Coal assets and will need to raise at least another Pounds 100m to fund working capital and pay the transaction expenses. Somewhat less than half the total cost is expected to be met by a share issue. When RJB came to the market in June last year there was a poor response from the public, with most of the shares going to institutional investors. But it has since performed well and subsequent share placings have given it a solid investor base. Its leading shareholders include Mercury Asset Management, Prolific, Norwich Union, Scottish Widows, Henderson and Abbey Life. Institutions will have acquired the shares in the knowledge that a successful British Coal bid would require a substantial equity issue and Rothschild will have satisfied itself that the existing investors would support one. It is likely to include an offer for sale, which would allow RJB to bring in new institutional investors and give former British Coal employees and the public the opportunity to buy shares. Given British Coal's record, the issue will take some marketing; with the government hoping to have everything wrapped up by Christmas, the timetable is tight.</p>

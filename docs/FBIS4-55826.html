			<p>BFN     [Text] Tonight, on the second anniversary of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina's United Nations membership,  Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV welcomes Haris Silajdzic, prime  minister of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. He talks to Enes  Musabasic. In this program we have selected the prime  minister's views on UN efforts to put an end to the aggression  against Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] We have demanded that the United  Nations follow the rules laid down in the UN Charter. Namely,  it should help. There are [word indistinct] rules in this world  that should be complied with. Unfortunately, not only have the  United Nations and the UN Security Council in particular, and  the five permanent members which for all practical purposes  formulate its policies, failed to help us but they have made  things worse for us. Although the international community says  it does not want to intervene it has already intervened by  imposing an arms embargo. Hence, having said that the United  Nations is doing its job today, it is in fact saying that it is  redressing to a certain degree the historic mistake it had made  regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina--there is no such precedent.    There is no precedent, as far as I know, there has been no  repeat of the systematic violations of the UN Charter, such as  in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, when we ask  the international community to help us we want it to do what it  should have done a long time ago. Because of these mistakes,  the arms embargo above all, this intervention in helping the  aggressor should come to an end. We have lost 200,000 people as  a result of these mistakes. We have a ruined country and the  kind of situation you all know too well. Hence, when we demand  that the international community do something we are not begging  for charity, but are demanding just a little bit of what belongs  to us. Nothing can make up for the lost lives and the  sufferings we have experienced over these two years. [end  recording]    [Musabasic] The very same international community has over a  long period of time come up with a number of peace proposals,  mainly based on an ethnic division of our country.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] Europe has found solutions  appropriate to its own nature, this has to be understood.  Europe consists of national states, not of multicultural,  multiethnic societies such as ours. Europe is not  cosmopolitan--Europe only tolerates minorities. They are  applying their own model to Bosnia.    Europe says it wants to become like Bosnia, but at the same  time, it allows the model of what it strives to become to be  destroyed before its eyes. These are the dilemmas Europe is  facing. As I said, Europe is looking for a solution in  Bosnia--a solution that would be Europe-like and not a solution  that we see as a good one. For this reason, the division into  ethnic groups--although it is quite clear and we have always  stressed that Bosnia is live tissue and cutting it along ethnic  lines that have never clearly existed--means war, means  bloodshed. It is live tissue, which has to bleed when cut along  imaginary ethnic lines.    Despite this, we have up till now failed to persuade Europe  that this is the case, except for the act of the creation of the  [Bosniak-Croat] federation, which to a certain extent makes a  significant contribution toward the solution of the question of  the restoration of Bosnia.

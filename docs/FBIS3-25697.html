			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Democracy To Depend on Multiparty Political Center --  Hermann  Giliomee writes in an article on page 16 of Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 25 February that "the entire transition to  democracy in South Africa turns on the construction and defence  of a new multiparty political centre." The attempt to lure  parties of the Freedom Alliance (FA) into the constituional  process "represents the first serious effort by the ANC [African  National Congress] and the NP [National Party] to defend this  centre. That this defence is unlikely to succeed in its  immediate objective -- to get the alliance into the elections --  does not mean that a form of accommodation with the alliance  over the longer term can be ruled out." Giliomee believes we  have seen since December "a spirited and concentrated effort by  disparate forces to broaden the centre and make the future  democracy more viable."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Criticism of ANC's Concessions Timing -- Billy Paddock  writes  in a page-10 article in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on  25 February that "there is a view among some ANC stategists that  the organisation may have committed a grievous error by  footdragging late last year instead of offering at that early  stage the concessions placed on the table in the past week."  "It is true that the recent package of concessions does not  fully meet the alliance's requirements. In particular, it falls  far short of Inkatha's demand for a federal dispensation. But  it goes a long way towards meeting the compromise package  contained in the December 19 document which was worked out  between government and the alliance. Had the concessions come  then -- rather than a firm rejection from the ANC -- this could  have created space for constructive negotiation, further  compromise and a possible settlement, the argument goes."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Elections Never `Absolutely Free and Fair' -- "Clearly, the  ballot will never be absolutely free and fair. The question is  whether the disruption can be limited enough for the Independent  Electoral Commission and the international observer missions to  get away with a ruling that these elections are sufficiently  free and fair to pass muster," notes a page-16 editorial in  Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 25  February-3  March. "It is becoming increasingly obvious that in significant  areas of Natal/kwaZulu polling will be difficult and probably  impossible. It is extraordinary that there is so little visible  action to stop rightwing training of Inkatha impis [warriors]  and to break the power of the kwaZulu Police to take sides."  The editorial also looks at the disruption of NP electioneering  in the Cape, saying it should "also be addressed urgently by  African National Congress leaders." "Free and fair elections --  like fair cricket umpiring -- are not going to come easy."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   PAC's Commitment to Democracy `Fragile' -- Johannesburg  BEELD  in Afrikaans on 22 February says in a page-10 editorial: "The  threat by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] that it will return  to the armed struggle if it does not get its way with the  redistribution of land indicates that this party's commitment to  democracy and the ballot is very fragile. It was a precondition  for the PAC's participation in the election that it renounce  violence. Now it appears that the party is setting laughable  demands expecting to realize them through the use of violence.  Other parties which are participating in the election and are  prepared to accept the outcome unconditionally will have to  decide whether they wish to compete at the polls on such an  unequal basis with a party which refuses to play by the rules of  the game." "The PAC's manifesto in which laughable promises are  made such as that all private land transactions will be  abolished when land is returned to 'the people' underlines the  fact that this party does not have the faintest idea of the  demands of a modern society."    Alliance Leaders Incapable of Playing Role -- "Another  chapter in the dynamic process in South Africa is approaching  completion and still the leaders of the FA hesitate, apparently  incapable of themselves playing a role in it," says a page-14  editorial in Johannesburg BEELD of 23 February. "The  Negotiating Council has now made it even easier for the FA  leaders to enter the process with even more concessions than the  government and the ANC had been prepared to make. Virtually all  of the remaining objections of the alliance have now been  removed." "If the FA leaders are undecided, powerless,  hesitant, or stubborn, their followers need not also be left  behind by history. There is a way they can become part of the  dynamic process, and that is to vote in the election for a  different party which can represent their interests."    Sarajevo Holds Lesson for RSA -- A second editorial on page  14 of BEELD says: "From the rubble and tears of Sarajevo, where  people allowed political intolerance to degenerate into a  campaign of ethnic cleansing, a dazed resident warns  despairingly that no one can help them unless they help  themselves. Therein lies a profound lesson for South Africa  with its comlex ethnic make-up. Not even the intervention of  the United Nations can end the slaughter in Bosnia." "South  African politicians and others who use war talk to bedevil  efforts at a settlement should realize before it is too late  that in the final analysis no one will be able to help us here.  We must help ourselves. One political commentator has already  warned that the ethnic cleansing which we see in Bosnia has  already started here in South Africa."</p>

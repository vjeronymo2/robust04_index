			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: Three studies in contrast - Fiction THE HIGH FLYER by Nicholas Shakespeare Harvill Pounds 14.99, 382 pages POMPEY by Jonathan Meades Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 472 pages SNOWSTOP by Alan Sillitoe HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 263 pages MANY points of contact between this trio of novels - one cool and controlled, another exploding with energy and invention, the third merely going through the motions. The High Flyer offers the elegant craftsmanship, even if it is finally an unsatisfying novel, a story of the diplomatic life which sometimes exudes a Graham Greene-like melancholy. The cover illustration - a detail of a late Renaissance Icarus in freefall - provides the perfect resonance; Shakespeare's high flyer is a career diplomat, Thomas Wavery, seemingly bound for ambassadorial success until he is overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of an extra-marital affair. The expected posting to the Lisbon embassy fails to materialise, his marriage disintegrates and Wavery finds himself dispatched as consul to the Spanish enclave of Abyla on the North African coast, there to serve out his time in overseeing the completion of a road tunnel across the Gibraltar Straits. As Wavery is gradually absorbed into life in the colony, the events that conspired to his fall from grace are revealed; vignettes of local life are counterpointed sharply against the finally hopeless tale of his love for Catherine. But Shakespeare's carefully plotted narrative really lacks the energy to make these parallel tracks converge; in the end the beautifully textured patchwork of images of life in this disconnected fragment of Europe merely provides a colourful wrapping to what develops into a terminal tragedy for Wavery. Energy is one quality certainly not lacking in Jonathan Meades' sprawling baroque novel, which parades erudition, obsession and pure prurience on an all too generous canvas. Pompey's central character - hero is certainly not the mot juste - is one Guy Vallender, and the interlaced tales of his exploits and the fruits of his loins are spread across four post-war decades and countless vividly portrayed settings. At the centre of this litany of decay and degradation is the city of the title; Pompey, Portsmouth, is the central metaphor of attraction for its excursions, irresistibly draws all the characters to their fates, disposes of its victims. One admires the virtuosity, the creative nerve that has enabled Meades boldly to go where few writers would dare. There are many laughs, but not much love in the book and not much to love, save maybe the fondness for verbal arcana - what, one wonders without a dictionary, is a 'spelaean' navel? - and the verve of someone prepared to present this baleful vision of the contemporary world exactly as he registers it. Which, in his own utterly different way, is precisely what Alan Sillitoe continues to do. The England he mapped out more than 30 years ago in his first massively successful fictions continues to provide his raw material, though the territory has sometimes become gentrified in the process. The latest transect is provided by a country house hotel which collects a motley assortment of flaky humanity stranded for the night by a blizzard. In thoroughly melodramatic fashion the enforced encounters provide an assortment of catharses, none of them very credible. Sillitoe sets up the clockwork, and just lets it unwind; the reader quickly ceases to care who does what to whom, and the author gives no indication that he cares either.</p>

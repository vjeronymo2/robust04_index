			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1(a), (b), (c): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that unproven features and capabilities should not delay payments for the Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Unproven features and capabilities are listed as separate Projects in Article I, section 1, with separate time frames for delivery and installation of features and capabilities that cannot be provided at the time of Completion of the Project. If separate schedules are not part of the Contract, delays in delivery would cause delays in payments for the entire Project. This encourages a Bidder's disclosures as required in Article V, section 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1(e): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that the subsection should be reworded to require the Owner to pay the Bidder for each central office if the subsection is not struck out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA agrees with this comment. The language in Section 1(e) has been changed to require the Owner to strike out this section if the partial closeout procedure is not to be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that this section references a ``Waiver and Release of Liens,'' a ``Certificate of Contractor'' and a ``Certificate of Contractor and Indemnity Agreement'' but these documents were not made public at the time, consequently, they reserve their right to comment after they are issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The documents referred to by the commenter are existing and have not been revised. If any changes are made to the aforementioned documents they will be published as a Proposed Rule and comments will be requested at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Article IV, Particular Undertakings of the Bidder <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1(b): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters remarked that this Section is unfair to the Bidder. They feel that the Bidder should only be responsible for damages caused by the Bidder and that the Borrower is in a much better position to protect its site, and guard against fire, flood and theft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Bidder is required by law to have insurance from commencement to completion of the Contract. The Bidder also has charge and control of all work, equipment, materials and software to be done or used therein. Therefore, REA feels the Bidder is in a better position during this time period to protect itself against risk of loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that commercial insurance is unnecessary. Specifically, the coverage limits required are within the ``deductible'' for large companies. Thus the risk is self retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Insurance requirements for contractors are set forth in 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, Insurance for Contractors, Engineers and Architects. Generally, this regulation is intended to set minimum coverage requirements for companies of all sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 5: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that the 525 Contract should be modified to include a Uniform Software Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA agrees. A Uniform Software License was drafted and published for comments on May 20, 1993, at 58 FR 29363, and was published as a final rule on April 14, 1994, at 59 FR 17675. The final rule will be an addendum to any 525 or 545 Contract that requires a license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that some guarantees may not be transferable or assignable by the Bidder and this Section should be subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer or assignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Article IV, section 6 has been revised to allow for restrictions on transfer of warranties. However, regardless of restrictions upon transfer or assignment, the warranty coverage defined in Article II, section 7, is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

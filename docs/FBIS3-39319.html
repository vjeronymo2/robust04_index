			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F> Francois-Henri de Virieu, Alain Duhamel, Albert du Roy, and  Jean-Marie Colombani; from the "Hour of Truth" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [de Virieu] [passage omitted] My first question  is on the tragedy of Sarajevo. It is clear that the Serbs are  very reluctant to hand their heavy guns over to the United  Nations. Does this mean that, if they do not hasten the  handover of heavy artillery, we will decide to bomb them when  the ultimatum expires next Monday [21 February]?    [Balladur] [passage omitted] We have made multiple efforts  to  bring the parties to negotiate among Serbs, Croats, and Muslims  to find an agreement and a territorial settlement. Until now,  we have not succeeded. France is the country with the most  soldiers in Bosnia, the most UN soldiers. It is out of the  question for us to carry on delivering humanitarian aid if the  fighting is to continue for another five, 10, or 15 years. The  presence of our soldiers would become totally meaningless. We  therefore had to spell out to our partners that we had a duty to  make one last effort for peace, and for the different parties in  conflict to come to some agreement. For 10 months -- I found  this file in the state that it was in, and I am not making any  judgement on that -- for 10 months, we have been making efforts  to get the international community interested in this affair.  At the Copenhagen summit, everyone said they would send extra  troops, and only France did so, and a month later I wrote to all  our partners to ask them what they were up to; and let's not  talk about the setting up of safe havens.    Now, we have succeeded in mobilizing the international  community to ask the belligerents -- I think this is the right  term to describe them -- first of all to withdraw their heavy  weapons, and, second, to reach a definitive territorial  settlement so that we can finish with this war once and for all.  The European Community, and in particular the North Atlantic  alliance accepted -- following the proposals put forward by  France and the United States....    [de Virieu, interrupting] By France in particular.    [Balladur] By France in particular at the beginning, but the  United States rallied to our proposals. We have a deadline of  seven days ahead of us for all the heavy weaponry to be  withdrawn or grouped together. When this deadline expires, we  shall see what the situation is....    [de Virieu, interrupting] We -- in other words who?    [Balladur] We, the members of the Atlantic Alliance....    [de Virieu, interrupting] And the United Nations.    [Balladur] And the United Nations, and the countries that  are  most present on the ground in Bosnia, which, I think, have more  to say on the subject than others -- which means France, above  all. If, as I hope, and I cannot envisage the opposite, the  warring parties return to the negotiating table, agree to talk,  withdraw their arms as we have demanded, then there is a hope.  If they do not, then it goes without saying that what was  threatened will have to be carried out.    [de Virieu] This means that the ultimatum will not be  extended by a single day?    [Balladur] It will not be extended by a single day, but I  will be particularly attentive, as I have been for the last 10  months -- together with Defense Minister Francois Leotard -- I  will be particularly attentive to the position of our soldiers,  who are carrying out a humanitarian mission, certainly, but one  which is nevertheless extremely dangerous. We must take every  precaution to face every possible outcome....    [de Virieu, interrupting] Does this mean that we would  withdraw our troops if there were to be air strikes?    [Balladur] I am not saying that. We must take all necessary  measures for their safety. This is the reason why Francois  Leotard went to Sarajevo on Friday.    [de Virieu] Prime Minister, will we be the only ones to  leave our nationals, our diplomatic mission in particular, in  the former Yugoslavia? I see that the Americans, the Germans,  the Dutch are studying evacuation measures. What about us?    [Balladur] We will probably not be the only ones to stay.  [passage omitted]    [de Virieu] Last month France agreed to a 50 percent  devaluation of the CFA franc, that is the currency used in 14  former French colonies in Africa. The decision had been  requested by the World Bank for a long time. Isn't it a heavy  responsibility to accept this devaluation which will make things  worse in Africa? Was it necessary to make such a large  devaluation?    [Balladur] No, Mr. de Virieu, this will not make things  worse  in Africa. Things had got worse in the last ten years or so  precisely because the CFA franc was overvalued and this had  prevented investment. This decision was taken by African  countries, but naturally, let us not be hypocritical, at  France's instigation, let us be clear, because it seemed to us  to be the best solution to help the development of these  countries.    [de Virieu] It will enable them to export more cheaply.    [Balladur] It will enable them to export more.    [de Virieu] Indeed, but they export very little.    [Balladur] No, some of them export....    [de Virieu, interrupting] they are importing much more than  they are exporting. So their imports will be more expensive.    [Balladur] Imports will be more expensive, but for many of  them exporting oil, raw materials or food products this should  normally bring in additional resources, especially for farmers.    [de Virieu] Is this failure of African economies you are  describing also the failure of France's African policy?    [Balladur] I do not believe so, I do not believe so at all.  One thing is perfectly clear, France has not only interests in,  but also a moral obligation towards African countries. It  colonized them, it brought them a great deal, particularly in  the infrastructure and training spheres. Thirty years of  decolonization have gone by, the first 20 went smoothly, the  last 10 less so since the world's economy changed and since the  infrastructure of these countries was no longer adapted to the  changes in the world economy. France will increase its aid to  African countries, it managed to obtain a ten-fold increase in  their aid to Africa from the IMF and World Bank. This is  confirmation that there is no question of abandoning Africa, on  the contrary, it will help it return to the path of progress.    [de Virieu] Jean-Marie Colombani.    [Colombani] Good evening Prime Minister.    [Balladur] Good evening.    [de Virieu] Before getting into purely internal issues I  would simply like to make two short incursions into the news.  You will soon visit China, it is the last large communist  country, it is a country which requires exit visas from foreign  nationals....    [Balladur, interrupting] I hope I will get one.    [de Virieu] I hope so too. Does France need to follow in the  steps of the last remaining large communist country? Are we not  becoming a very restrictive country in that respect and this in  the name of the fight against illegal immigration? Are we not  going too far?    [Balladur] We are combating terrorism, not illegal  immigration. We should bear something in mind, when we say that  we should control the arrival of foreigners in France and combat  illegal immigration we are not morally [word indistinct], in any  case, some are telling us that. But when we are saying that  someone should not leave -- not without authorization -- without  having previously told us so that we know where he is going and  that we know for sure that he really left, we are also being  told that this is improper. You know, let us bear in mind what  we are doing, we are living in a world where terrorism is  spreading in an extraordinary manner and we are close to  countries which are often terrorist in habits and interests and  it is perfectly normal -- and I fully support the interior  minister, Mr. Pasqua, for having so decided -- it is quite  normal we should take all the necessary steps to combat  terrorism. As far as the comparison on this issue with communist  China is concerned I repeat that a visa is one thing and to  inform is another one.    [Colombani] Concerning this issue again, exit visas are also  required from Palestinians, this news is made public when Alain  Juppe is visiting Israel and when visa are no more required from  Israeli nationals. Is this a trademark of a balanced policy  towards this region of the world where the two parties are  making peace?    [Balladur] Listen, I believe that this problem concerning  Palestinians will be solved very quickly because for them, like  for nationals of other countries, the issue is -- I repeat this  -- not to prevent them leaving but to ask them to let us know  when they are leaving. I believe that Mr. Juppe himself said in  Israel that he found both issues perfectly compatible. [passage  omitted]    [Colombani] You are operating within the framework of  cohabitation. Is this second cohabitation closer to your ideal  model than was the first one?    [Balladur] Mr. Colombani, cohabitation is hardly an ideal  model. It is a situation born of two contradictory elections,  presidential and parliamentary. From that moment, the leaders  have a duty to ensure that the country does not suffer from  their coexistence. How can you imagine, especially when we have  6,000 soldiers in Bosnia, who are in a dangerous situation,  imagine if we were to squabble at the head of the state. It  would be quite unacceptable. In these circumstances, as far as  I am concerned, I am doing everything to ensure that things work  out as well as possible. The French people have chosen new  policies. I have the mandate to carry them out, the  Constitution gives the government the means to implement them; I  am using these means, while respecting the prerogatives of the  president, and everything is perfectly simple and clear.    [Colombani] Very well, but that is your side of the story.  When the president calls you to draw up a new social contract,  or when he warns you of deep-seated revolt, do you think that he  is overstepping his role, or do you expect this kind of  behavior? Does it annoy you, does it lead to tension, or is it  just the day-to-day routine of cohabitation?    [Balladur] I think that there is no need to exaggerate the  significance of this. There is no secret: Mr. Mitterrand is a  socialist, and I am not -- he said so himself. In these  circumstances, our views of a certain number of problems are not  the same. We are nevertheless both committed to serving our  country as best we can, especially in international and military  affairs, as is the case at present. I express my point of view,  I carry out the policies which the French people have chosen.  The government has the support of a large majority in the  assembly. I cannot expect everyone to shut up. I have nothing  to add on this subject. [passage omitted]    [Colombani] Let's talk about the presidential elections.  You imposed a law of silence on your ministers, you requested  silence from your party. Does this mean that on 2 January 1995,  let's say, everyone will be freed from this constraint?    [Balladur] [passage omitted] The French people are not on  the  edge of their seats waiting to see who will be the next  president. Let me assure you that the question does not haunt  their sleep and their every thought....    [Colombani, interrupting] It depends who you're talking  about.    [Balladur] But I wasn't talking about you. [passage omitted]    [de Virieu] Can we return to the draft bill on military  programs, because I said just now that Jean-Marie Colombani  would be speaking to you about it, and evidently the subject  does not inspire him; so, anyway, the day after tomorrow there  is a cabinet meeting on defense, which is going to examine --  from what I have read in LE MONDE, which is a good  paper....[pauses] In any case you are going to be examining the  white paper, it does not matter so much when. This white paper  has been drafted to examine the new military threat in the world  and its conclusions are going to be used by Mr. Leotard to draft  a military programs bill. I saw that there is some question of  France changing its military doctrine to agree to be more fully  involved in NATO where its peacekeeping operations are  concerned. Is this true or not?    [Balladur] No, this is not what it is about, not at all. In  the white paper which Francois Leotard is preparing, and in the  military programs bill, it is anticipated that in specific  cases, and by the decision each time of the president and the  prime minister, the defense minister and the chief of staff of  the Armed Forces may take part in this or that meeting, but in  response to the needs of the situation each time and not  automatically, or as a general rule. That is the first point.    The second point: As for knowing whether or not France will  take part in operations within the framework of NATO, it has  already done so, to a certain extent -- during the Gulf war.  That was not within the framework of NATO, but by using NATO's  means -- we are playing on words a little here. Moreover, the  French-German corps, which, it is anticipated, may....[pauses]  which is at the disposal of the Western European Union, but may  also be used by NATO, is also a means of making things more  flexible, but, basically, France's position must remain as it  was defined in 1966: it is a member of the Alliance....    [de Virieu, interrupting] By General de Gaulle.    [Balladur] By General de Gaulle, and maintained by his  successors, his three successors. France is a member of the  alliance, it takes part in a certain number of activities within  this alliance, but it is not integrated into the alliance's  command, and we must be very careful to preserve our autonomy,  even our independence in this matter, and furthermore we have  been able to see in the Bosnia affair precisely how much the  fact that we are autonomous gives us greater weight in the eyes  of others.    [de Virieu] Thank you, Prime Minister. That was "The Hour of  Truth" with Mr. Edouard Balladur. [passage omitted]</p>

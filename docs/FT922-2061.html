			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bramalea seeks to restructure its debt BRAMALEA, the embattled North American real estate developer, has suspended dividends and asked its banks to restructure its CDollars 4.8bn (USDollars 4.03bn) debt. It also warned that it might write down the value of its land holdings and other assets. The company, part of the resources and financial services empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, has financial problems which are at least as severe as those of Olympia &amp; York, the property developer which sought protection from its creditors last month. Bramalea has been given a more sympathetic hearing by creditors than O&amp;Y because of a perceived willingness to share more information with outsiders, as well as Bramalea's sustained efforts to raise cash through asset sales. Bramalea yesterday reported a net loss of CDollars 18.6m, or 22 cents a share, for the six months to April 30, against CDollars 3.8m profit, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Operations drained CDollars 6.9m from cash-flow, against a positive contribution of CDollars 29.4m last year. Interest payments totalled CDollars 105.3m. Its shares climbed 15 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday to CDollars 1.20, but they remain far below their 1988 peak of CDollars 28.75. The biggest millstone around Bramalea's neck is the undeveloped land in California and southern Ontario which it bought during the last boom. Mr Marvin Marshall, chief executive, said the asset disposal programme begun last year was taking place 'at a slower pace than originally anticipated'. The company has so far raised CDollars 358m and expects to generate CDollars 2bn by 1997 to reduce its debt. He added that a new business plan was being prepared. It will include new lines of credit to meet working capital requirements and the extension of maturity dates on existing debt. The main lenders are understood to be Canadian, US and Japanese banks. In contrast with family-owned O&amp;Y, Bramalea has been able to call on its controlling shareholder for support. Trizec, the Calgary-based developer with a 67 per cent stake in Bramalea, recently took up the lion's share of a rights issue, boosting Bramalea's equity base to CDollars 935m on April 30 from CDollars 884m last October. Trizec and Bramalea's combined debt of CDollars 14bn exceeds O&amp;Y's total debt.</p>

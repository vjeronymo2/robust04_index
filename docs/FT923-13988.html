			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): The potato makes a new kind of chip An unusual use has been found for the humble potato. Using natural vegetable starch found in potatoes, the London-based AI Packagings group has launched what is believed to be the first 100 per cent biodegradable and water soluble, free flow, light-weight cushioning material. 'Renature' which is flexible, hollow and looks like expanded polystyrene chips, provides all-round packaging protection for goods in transit. The new material has a high resistance to moisture, yet dissolves quickly when in direct contact with water. A1 Packagings: UK, 071 987 6361.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / First lady may seek husband's job Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's apparently smooth progress towards re-election has encountered an unexpected obstacle - his wife. Ms Susana Higuchi, who prefers not to use her husband's surname, has moved out of the presidential palace, having formally complained to the attorney-general that legislation prohibiting the president's close relatives from running for office is unconstitutional. Pressed to say whether she intends to run as a presidential or congressional candidate in next April's election, she replied: 'I am thinking about it.' However, she will need to make up her mind by October, the deadline for nominations. Ms Higuchi, like Mr Fujimori a second-generation Japanese Peruvian and a qualified engineer, argues that the 1993 constitution permits all Peruvians except members of the armed forces to stand for public office. Ms Higuchi's intention, she says, is to demonstrate 'very pragmatically' to Mr Fujimori, 'that there exists no channel for a citizen to demand enforcement of his constitutional rights'. Ms Higuchi seems to be correct. Her legal action was rejected by the attorney-general on the grounds there is no entity in Peru empowered to pronounce on constitutional issues. That is because her husband dissolved the previous constitutional guarantees tribunal during his April 1992 'self-coup', in which he seized emergency powers, and it has yet to be replaced. In recent weeks Ms Higuchi has publicly criticised her husband's 'authoritarianism' and 'blindness to the suffering and poverty' of the majority of the population. This weekend, in two television interviews, she made her 'differences of ideas' even more explicit. 'The achievements (of this administration) are all in works of infrastructure,' she said. 'The human factor has been neglected.' While Peruvians wait for Mr Fujimori to confirm he will run again, and for former UN secretary-general Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar to announce a probable candidacy, all eyes are on Ms Higuchi. While her husband was a university professor and, later, rector, she ran a successful civil engineering business and brought up four children. Most observers expected her to play a prominent role once her husband was elected president. But she never progressed beyond the traditional role of First Lady - for example, fundraising for needy children. She has made clear she does not wish to continue with this role. Although there have been rumours of matrimonial difficulties before, the first big rupture with her husband came in March 1992, when Ms Higuchi publicly accused her in-laws of trafficking in aid donations from abroad. Her accusations were never closely investigated.</p>

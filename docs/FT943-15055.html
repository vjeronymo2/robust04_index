			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Inner city pupils see benefit in education Inner-city teenagers feel positive about their education, but a third feel they have been discriminated against, according to a report published today by the Policy Studies Institute. The survey, of 3,000 children of school-leaving age in east and south London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester found that staying-on rates in education were above the national average. About 80 per cent were still in full-time education, compared with the national average of 68 per cent. Only 5 per cent were in full-time employment. School was generally regarded as useful and only 3.3 per cent admitted to playing truant for 'weeks at a time'. But a third felt they had been treated unfairly because of colour, sex, religion or where they lived. There were wide disparities between ethnic groups. Black and Caribbean pupils were most likely to truant, achieved the fewest GCSEs and were less likely than Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis or Chinese to stay on at school. Whites made up the lowest proportion staying on - 72 per cent. Changing Lives 1. Catherine Shaw, BEBC Distribution, PO Box 1496, Poole, Dorset, BH12 3YD. Pounds 5.95.</p>

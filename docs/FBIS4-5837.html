			<p>BFN     [Text] Trang Governor David Wichaidit has discussed the  spread of terrorism in his province and Phatthalung Province.  He said the government's intelligence is more broad and  detailed than the media's. For this reason, Trang Province has  stepped up precautions and measures to deal with the possibility  of terrorism.    Regarding a report that the prime minister's home might be  the target of a bomb attack, Trang provincial officials will try  to ensure security in all areas, although there is not enough  manpower to cover every area around the clock. The province can  only increase precautionary measures in likely target areas.  The people can be confident that the province is doing its best  to maintain security through constant coordination with the  Fourth Army Region.    Asked if he reported this information to the prime minister,  the Trang governor said the prime minister did not pay attention  only to Trang Province, but to the entire country. The prime  minister did not ask anything specific. The province did not  make any specific report to the prime minister because it  regards this as taking normal security precautions. Asked if  the situation might worsen, the Trang governor said he could not  comment on other provinces, but he is confident that his  province will not be affected much by the reported possibility  of terrorist activities. This is because his province has had  relevant intelligence reports for some time and has been  constantly vigilant. He said no special police unit has been  sent to protect the prime minister's residence because such a  measure could frighten passers by. He also does not believe  such a measure would be the correct security method. He gave  assurances, however, that there are both secret and overt  security plans as well as ad hoc security center in his province  that he would rather not reveal to the public.    Meanwhile, Police Colonel Phitsanu Bunyarat, deputy  commander  of the Railway Police, noted the security measures for trains  operating on southern routes. He said the police department has  made plans with the units concerned -- the military; the border  patrol police; and the governors of Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and  Narathiwat -- to prevent train sabotage. More railway policemen  have been assigned to trains, particularly the Bangkok-Sungai  Kolok train and the Sungei Kolok-Bangkok train, while they  travel along the dangerous section between Hat Yai and Sungei  Kolok. Four policemen have been added to these trains in  addition to the previous four. They will be equipped with  modern arms and communications equipment. This should be  sufficient to protect passengers. Capable policemen have been  chosen especially for this purpose.    Phitsanu said several units have been assigned  responsibility  for overseeing the safety of sections of railroad track. There  is a problem with inefficient intelligence collection, however,  caused by religious and language issues. Officials do not have  enough experience with these issues.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYDAY FOR AN ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT  </P> <P> As controversy over government support of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's  homoerotic photography dies down, art world business goes on as usual.  Christie's New York this week announced plans to auction Mapplethorpe's  collection of art and furniture, valued at more than $3 million. Proceeds of  the Oct. 31 sale will go to the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation to benefit AIDS  research and to photography collections at major museums.  </P> <P> The photographer, who died in November of AIDS at 42, established the  foundation over a year ago and put about $500,000 into it before his death,  according to attorney Michael Stout, executor of the estate. At his death,  Mapplethorpe left the bulk of his estate to the foundation. Assets of the  foundation could total $5 million to $25 million, depending on proceeds of the  auction and how Mapplethorpe's photographs are marketed by his studio, Stout  said.  </P> <P> Christie's auction of about 530 objects -- divided into 193 lots -- will not  include any of Mapplethorpe's photographic work. Among pieces to be sold are  contemporary artworks, Impressionist and modern paintings, 19th-Century and Old  Master drawings, prints, sculpture, decorative arts, furniture and photographs  by other artists.  </P> <P> Nine of the most expensive items -- including four works by Andy Warhol (valued  from $30,000 to $1 million), a Tony Smith sculpture ($100,000 to $150,000), a  small still life by Belgian Expressionist James Ensor ($300,000 to $400,000)  and a landscape by French intimist Edouard Vuillard ($200,000 to $300,000) --  will be sold separately in November sales of contemporary and modern art. (All  estimates are preliminary and may be adjusted before the sale, according to  Christie's officials.)  </P> <P> The Mapplethorpe foundation and auction is patterned after "the Warhol model,"  Stout said, though less money is involved. Warhol's hoard of 10,000 objects  brought $25.3 million in a 10-day sale last year at Sotheby's. Auction  proceeds, several pieces of real estate and some of the late artist's work went  to the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts benefiting nonprofit  organizations that are involved with exhibitions, art education, historic  preservation and urban planning. The foundation this year made 58 grants  totaling nearly $2 million.  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe was a far more selective collector than Warhol, but he had strong  acquisitive instincts. Confessing an addiction to collecting in a recent House  and Garden interview, Mapplethorpe said, "I'm doing my best not to do what Andy  did. For every great thing, he had 10 pieces of junk. I just don't have room in  my life for all that." While Warhol stored his collection in stacks of boxes  that eventually filled all but two rooms of his six-story townhouse on the  Upper East Side, most of Mapplethorpe's collection is displayed in his  3,500-square-foot loft and studio at 35 W. 23rd St., above a discount office  furniture store.  </P> <P> The loft is a clean-lined, white-walled space artfully crammed with treasures  and equipped with a photographic studio. Raw-boned Arts and Crafts furniture by  Gustav Stickley mingles with high-tech coffee tables designed by Mapplethorpe,  a Biedermeier mirrored shelf, one of George Nelson's black marshmallow chairs  from the '50s and delicate burr-wood desks attributed to Gio Ponti.  </P> <P> A rainbow of solid-color Italian glass bottles and vases fills a long eye-level  shelf above a deck of cabinets. Scandinavian ceramics cluster near one side of  the fireplace, while neoclassical statues sit on the hearth. Walls of a den  area are almost completely covered with such objects as tribal masks, a  crucifix, a cross-shaped mirror and small artworks ranging from a Brice Marden  abstraction to 19th-Century drawings of animals and assorted images of male  nudes.  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe acquired most of the objects to be auctioned during the '70s and  '80s in New York, according to Dmitri Levas, his photography stylist and  collecting partner. "Robert liked to find things that had already been found by  stores. He didn't like to go to flea markets," Levas said.  </P> <P> "I'm a hunter myself. I would do the scouting. But he loved to collect. If I  brought him a Polaroid (of a prospective purchase), he would really perk up,"  Levas said.  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe's first major collection consisted of photographs, which in 1982  he sold at Sotheby's for $98,203. Around the same time, Sam Wagstaff,  Mapplethorpe's companion who died of AIDS in 1987, built a highly regarded  photography collection, which he sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1984 for  an undisclosed amount, reportedly about $5 million.  </P> <P> Several of the most valuable pieces in the sale were gifts or bequests from  Wagstaff. Stout declined to state the total amount of Mapplethorpe's  inheritance from Wagstaff but said he got "several million dollars," much of it  in art. The most expensive contemporary piece in the auction, Warhol's  silk-screen on canvas, "Little Race Riot," formerly belonged to Wagstaff. The  four-panel work, currently in Warhol's retrospective exhibition, is valued at  $700,000 to $1 million. The Ensor and Vuillard paintings were also inherited  from Wagstaff.  </P> <P> Many of the contemporary artworks came from trades with artists, according to  Tina Summerlin, Mapplethorpe's former studio manager. Among these are portraits  of Mapplethorpe by Warhol (valued at $80,000 to $120,000), David Hockney  ($50,000 to $75,000), Francesco Clemente ($10,000 to $15,000) and Don Bachardy  ($1,000 to $1,500).  </P> <P> When Levas met Mapplethorpe, in 1980, the photographer already had his Arts and  Crafts furniture and was beginning to buy glass. "The '50s were known for  pretty wild shapes, but Robert went more for beautifully made, pure forms in  the '50s glass and ceramics he collected," Levas said. "He was basically a  Minimalist who loved things that were simple in form and color, and he went at  it in an obsessive way."  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe also liked art that has "a strong masculine quality," Levas noted.  That quality is evident in dozens of drawings, photographs and prints and in  the neoclassical sculpture that Mapplethorpe bought and photographed during the  last year of his life.  </P> <P> "He had a keen eye for the history of photography and knew that classical busts  were often the subject of 19th-Century photographs," Levas said. But the  sculptures were also a matter of convenience for the artist when he became too  ill to schedule sittings for portraits or venture outside his studio, he said.  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe's foundation and studio offices may move into the loft on 23rd  Street, where he lived and shot all of his pictures since 1985. His former  business office and printing facility, at 24 Bond St., will probably be sold,  Stout said, but no decisions about the property have been made.  </P> <P> In the last months before his death, prices for Mapplethorpe's photographs  ranged from about $5,000 for prints to $20,000 for unique images. A current  show at BlumHelman Gallery in Santa Monica offers 24x20-inch prints from  editions of 10 for $10,000 and diptychs for $20,000. Mapplethorpe's auction  record is $16,500, set last April at Sotheby's.  </P> <P> The foundation will take a "quite conservative" approach to marketing  Mapplethorpe's work, the attorney said. The studio will only print negatives  that the photographer authorized and only in the small editions he intended.  The foundation will maintain an archive of Mapplethorpe's work and keep all  one-of-a-kind pictures that he had in his possession at his death. Images  produced in editions will be sold, at the rate of a few per year, by the Robert  Miller Gallery in Manhattan.  </P></p>

Mr. 'Arafat told a news  conference in Geneva that Israel had asked for six days to  review a weekend agreement reached with the Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres in the Swiss resort of Davos. He was  speaking shortly after giving a speech to the UN Human Rights  Commission, in which he said Palestinians still faced abuses in  the occupied territories. The PLO leader said he still hoped  the agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule could be  signed next week when he meets Mr. Peres in the Egyptian  capital, Cairo. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies approved an  electoral "minireform" that had been agreed upon by the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party  [PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], thus  changing the content of Article 77 of the Federal Code of  Institutions and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe) regarding the  employment of citizen advisers. The reform allows them to earn  income derived from the free practice of their professions,  bonuses, and author's and publications' royalties during the  time they occupy this post.    The reform was approved during talks among the PRI, PAN,  PRD,  and the Government Secretariat after journalist Miguel Angel  Granados Chapa asked the persons who participate in the  appointment process to define the nature of citizen advisers and  not to turn them into officials, but allow them to retain their  function in society," according to an explanation he publicly  gave last Saturday. [no beginning quotation mark as published]    The reform the Chamber of Deputies approved yesterday does  not alter, however, the single paragraph of the Cofife's Article  77 to which only two paragraphs are attached to detail four  exceptions allowing citizen advisers to earn some remuneration.  A differentiation in the income of the citizen advisers is  introduced this way, since only those who work or perform some  function for the federal government, states, municipalities, or  political parties or those who earn some remuneration from  individuals involving dependence or subordination must abandon  their jobs.    The citizen advisers' income that comes from the "free  practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' and  publications' royalties" will have another legal status. This  creates the opportunity for them to perform another remunerated  activity within the conditions established by the "minireform"  in tandem with their post in the Federal Electoral Institute  (IFE) General Council.    Two of the six IFE General Council civilian advisers  maintain  a labor relationship with an institution. This case applies to  National Autonomous University of Mexico staff members Jose  Woldenberg, professor of the Policital Sciences Faculty, and  Ricardo Pozas, director of the Social Research Institute.    Granados Chapa, in turn, is the editor of a magazine; Ortiz  Pinchetti [no first name as published] and Santiago Creel have  their law offices; and Fernando Zertuche performs editorial work.    According to the explanations given to justify this  initiative, the goal of this addition is to guarantee "a greater  independence and impartiality" on the part of the citizen  advisers.    The initiative was submitted almost at the end of the  session, and in view of the great urgency to have it approved  yesterday so that next Friday the citizen advisers can be sworn  in legally, the PRI, PAN, and PRD blocs agreed to forgo the  congressional ritual, and, based on Articles 59 and 60 of the  internal regulations, waived the drafting of the respective  report, the first and second readings of the report, the debate,  and any future possibility of proposing changes.    With this agreement by the PRI, PAN, and PRD, this  "minireform," which in effect constitutes the fourth electoral  reform of this six-year period, did not take more than 10  minutes of the lawmakers' time and joined the list of  initiatives approved at full speed by the PRI legislators, whom  the PAN and most of the PRD deputies not only did not criticize  but rather supported.    There were, however, seven abstentions among the PRD  legislators. The Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction  Party cast five votes against it, as opposed to the 269 in votes  in favor, by the automatic PRI-PAN-PRD majority. The initiative  approved yesterday also amends the Cofife's Article 77 and  subparagraph B of paragraph 5 of Article 74 so that they read as  follows:    Article 74, paragraphs five, subparagraph B: "From this  list,  the corresponding commission will draft an individual report  containing the slate of citizen advisers and alternates. The  Chamber of Deputies will elect the citizen advisers by a vote of  two thirds of the deputies present. The proposals by the  advisers will be voted on based on the procedure outlined by the  Internal Governing Rules for the General Congress of the United  States of Mexico on its chapter on voting."    Article 77: "During their mandate, the citizen advisers of  the General Council may not perform any function or job for the  Federation, states, municipalities, or political parties.  Neither may they accept a remunerated post or employment that  entails a dependence or subordination from individuals."    "The citizen advisers may earn income stemming from the free  practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' or  publications royalties so long as the independence,  impartiality, or equity that must govern the exercise of their  function is not undermined. They may hold unpaid jobs in  scientific, literary, or charity associations. "For any  clarification regarding the interpretation of this article, the  Federal Electoral Tribunal will be called."</p>

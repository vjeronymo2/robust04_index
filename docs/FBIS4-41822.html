			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan June 27 TASS -- "A separate meeting between  the Armenian and Azeri leaders would be senseless since the  comprehensive settlement of the Karabakh conflict can be reached  only by the three sides involved Armenia, Azerbaijan and  Nagorno-Karabakh," said Levon Zurabyan, the Armenian president's  aide and his acting press secretary. "If such a meeting takes  place, it should be attended by the Nagorno-Karabakh leader  Robert Kocharyan," the aide said.    The representative of the Armenian president positively  assessed the results of today's talks in Yerevan conducted by  the Russian president's special envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov. The  Armenian president's aide pointed out the importance of such  working meetings for the clarification of positions assumed by  the sides on the Karabakh settlement.</p>

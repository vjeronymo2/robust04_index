Its  potential applications are many, in the automobile industry as  well as avionics.    The guidance of vehicles, whether they be robots, rockets,  planes, missiles, or simply automobiles, has become a topic of  research of major interest to industrialists. Determination of  the vehicle's trajectory necessitates the use of an instrument  that measures speed of rotation, namely, the gyrometer. The  problem is to design and build a gyrometer that is at one and  the same time reliable, economical, small, and as easily  integrated into an automobile as any ordinary electronic  component. The CEA [Atomic Energy Commission]-LETI integrated  optics laboratory at Grenoble has been working on this problem  for the past several years, in cooperation with PSA and Sextant  Avionique. After having demonstrated the feasibility of  integrating such a component on a silicon substrate, they have  now received financing in the amount of 11 million French francs  [Fr] from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, under  the Technological Leap program, to develop the device and  prepare its industrialization.    "The use of optics for gyrometers is now very old," says  Patrick Mottier, head of this LETI laboratory. "It has been used  in the laser and fiber-optic gyrometers developed by firms such  as Thomson and Photonetics." But use of these very costly  devices (around Fr10,000 for the gyrometers used in some  Japanese cars) is essentially confined to rockets, submarines,  and satellites. With the advances being made in integrated  optics--enabling the production of conventional components  (lenses, mirrors, separators, etc) on a glass or silicon  substrate--the idea of developing an integrated optical  gyrometer has made way rapidly.  <H5>  Many Difficulties Need Surmounting </H5>   The principle of this device rests on what opticians call  the  Sagnac effect: A light guide, wound spirally, is fed at both  ends by one and the same light source, a laser diode. The  resulting two light beams circulating in opposite directions  produce interferences, and, as this light loop rotates, the  difference in level of interference is linked directly to the  speed of rotation. In fiber-optic gyrometers, the light guide  consists of an optical fiber several thousand meters long, wound  in a loop some 10 centimeters in diameter.    In the device developed by LETI, the optical fiber is  replaced by a light guide on silicon, 80 centimeters long and 3  centimeters in diameter. "To lower production costs and attain  components costing a few tens of French francs, we would like to  reduce the size of this loop," says Patrick Mottier. "But we are  limited by propagation loss along the ring." The principal  drawback of these integrated optical devices is in fact their  optical loss, which is 10,000 times that of fiber types. If the  circuit is too long, the signal is greatly attenuated and  becomes impossible to detect!  <H5>  Reducing Manufacturing Costs </H5>   While LETI has contributed its components-integration  skills,  PSA and Sextant have worked mainly on the signal processing. The  two firms do not by any means have the same philosophy in this  venture. "PSA approaches it as a potential user. Sextant, on the  other hand, wants to master the technology of producing these  optical circuits," says Patrick Mottier. Be that as it may, the  three partners, as of now, are bent on improving the prototype  they have developed. Their objectives: reduction of optical  losses, choice of a better source and the optimal frequency, and  above all, lowering of the eventual manufacturing cost. The  outlook: many long months of work!</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / IBM, Toshiba and Siemens in Dollars 1bn semiconductor deal INTERNATIONAL Business Machines of the US, Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of Germany are to develop advanced computer memory chips for the 21st century in a joint project worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m). The companies will develop 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chips, two generations ahead of the highest capacity 16 megabit chips available today. The international alliance reflects a broad trend throughout the semiconductor industry as costs of research, development and chip manufacturing rise. Separately, yesterday, Adva-nced Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, announced plans for a joint venture with Fujitsu of Japan to manufacture 'flash' memory chips, devices that may eventually replace disc drives in personal computers. The IBM, Toshiba, Siemens alliance is, however, the largest of its kind to date. It brings together three technology leaders that already have well-established relationships and raises the prospect of a broad reshaping of the Dollars 7bn global market for D-Rams, data storage devices that are used in all types of computer equipment. Japanese and South Korean manufacturers dominate at present. However, IBM , which manufactures chips primarily for use in its own computer products, is also believed by the industry to be one of the world's largest D-Ram producers and has recently announced moves to enter the merchant semiconductor market. Siemens, which is Europe's only high-volume D-Ram manufacturer, is not currently expected to expand its involvement in the memory chip market as a result of the agreement. The German group said its interest was twofold; development and manufacture of D-Rams and also future use of the technology needed for 256 megabit D-Ram production to fabricate other types of semiconductor chips. Siemens recently announced it had cancelled plans for a D-Ram plant to make 64 megabit D-Rams in Germany. Although the 256 megabit venture covers only research and development, an IBM executive said that joint manufacturing might follow. In contrast, the agreement between Japan's Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices of the US is geared towards joint manufacturing. The companies have agreed to set up a Dollars 700m joint venture in Japan to produce flash memory chips. Each company will purchase a small equity stake in the other. The deals announced yesterday are the most far-reaching in a series of cross-border semiconductor technology-sharing and development agreements drawn up in recent months. Mr WJ Sanders, chairman of AMD, said joining forces with Fujitsu would allow AMD to save development and investment costs and turn a potential competitor into a partner. Partners thank each other for the memory, Page 17</p>

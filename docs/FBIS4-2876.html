			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),  China's parliament, met with Pjeter Arbnori, president of the  Albanian people's parliament, here this afternoon.    Noting that contacts between the two countries have been on  the rise over the past few years, Qiao expressed the conviction  that Arbnori's China visit will promote the further development  of bilateral ties.    "We are willing to develop friendly ties with all other  countries, based on the principles of peaceful co-existence,"  Qiao said.    Arbnori said that China was and is a great nation which has  made special contributions to the progress of mankind.    Albania appreciates what China has achieved in the past few  years, Arbnori told his host.    Qiao said that China is still in the process of development,  with coastal areas developing faster. He added that it will  take great efforts of generations to bring about a fairly high  level of development in the country's central and western part.    During the meeting, Qiao expressed appreciation of Albania's  stance of "one China" and not developing official ties with  Taiwan.    After the meeting, Qiao hosted a banquet in Arbnori's honor.    Also in the afternoon, NPC Vice-Chairperson Lei Jieqiong  held  talks with the Albanian delegation.    Arbnori and his party arrived here earlier today as guests  of  the NPC standing committee. Apart from Beijing, they are  scheduled to visit Shenzhen in southern China.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Singapore takes modern message to China: Tony Walker and Andrew Gowers visit what Lee Kuan Yew hopes will be his lasting monument Singapore under the rule of Mr Lee Kwan Yew has drawn inspiration from ancient Chinese traditions of diligence and filial obedience: now the island state is in the process of giving back to modernising China some of the lessons it has learned in its transformation from British colony to modern regional centre of commerce and industry. In marshy land about 80 kilometres west of Shanghai, near the scenic town of Suzhou, work began this month on one of China's most ambitious projects - a USDollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn) Singapore-Suzhou industrial park designed to serve as a model for other such projects throughout the country. This 'super-development' zone, in which Singaporean institutions will be shareholders, will cover about 70 sq km, and in many respects will be a giant replica of Jurong, Singapore's largest industrial estate. Jurong houses some 2,000 companies and is regarded as one of the jewels in Singapore's industrial crown. Responsibility for guiding the project has been vested in Singapore-Suzhou Township Development (SSTD), which was incorporated in Singapore last September with authorised capital of Dollars 300m; SSTD is forming a joint venture with a consortium of Suzhou companies and the Chinese government to implement the project. Mr Zhao Da Sheng of the Singapore-industrial park's preparatory committee said, with the Chinese love of animal metaphors, that, while Shanghai might be the head of China's economic dragon, Suzhou and surrounding areas were the neck supporting the head. Mr Zhao has a point, one that has not escaped the Singapore authorities who have secured for themselves a substantial foothold in China's fastest-growing region in the Yangtze river delta. Singaporean companies and their international partners will certainly benefit from Singapore's involvement in the project. 'We believe,' Mr Zhao said, 'that Singapore's leaders are very good strategists.' Mr Lee Kuan Yew has himself taken a close interest in the project and was a co-signatory in Beijing in February this year of the government-to-government agreement pledging official backing. The Singaporean push into China is also a sign of strengthening bonds with overseas Chinese communities. It is doubtful that China, with its sensitivities about foreign concession areas dating from its pre-revolution experience, would have countenanced such an industrial park managed by 'foreigners' if they were not overseas Chinese. Japanese corporations, according to Mr Zhao, had asked if they could participate in the establishment of the industrial park, but had been politely told no. China, for its part, makes no secret of the fact that it is seeking to utilise Singaporean experience and know-how in its efforts to make best use of foreign investment. No less a figure than Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, said in 1992 of Singapore that 'we should tap their experience, and learn how to manage better than them'. Managers of the new park have certainly set themselves an ambitious task in their plans to transform paddy fields and a polluted lake into an estate that would include both light-industry facilities, retail malls, a financial district and residential complexes, not to mention at least one golf course. About Dollars 100m has been set aside for infrastructure costs of developing the first 2-sq-km stage of the project's Phase One of the three-phase project. The organisers plan initially to build 90,000 sq m of standard workshops and some 60,000 sq m of housing with shopping facilities. Mr Zhao said the early response from international business had been positive, and German companies in particular have been taking a close interest in the project. Among attractions for German companies engaged in the manufacture of vehicle components is that Volkswagen's main China assembly works is nearby. Interestingly, German companies had asked whether a section of the park could be set aside exclusively for their use. Mr Zhao indicated that, 'if the price was right', this proposal would be looked upon favourably. Light industries likely to find a home in the park include telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, electronics and environment protection equipment. Foreign retailers have also been told they are welcome, along with foreign banks. When the park is completed in 2006, its resident population is expected to number 600,000, but Mr Zhao insists that residential and industrial development will be balanced carefully. 'We don't want a situation like Shenzhen (the booming development zone adjacent to Hong Kong) where the population jumped from 100,000 to one million in a few years,' he said. Among Singapore institutions involved in planning and implementation are the Jurong Town Corporation, Housing and Development Board, Ministry of the Environment, Public Works Department, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Public Utilities Board. The 70-sq-km zone will offer much the same tax-breaks as the Economic and Technological Development Zones (ETDZ's) of China's coastal cities. These include tax-holidays and other concessions such as a 40 per cent tax rebate on profits reinvested within the township. Leases on property will be more expensive than other development zones, but lease periods will be long. For residential property, 70-year leases are being offered; for industry, 50 years; for commerce, 40 years. Singaporean participation among private-sector companies and government institutions reads like a who's who of Singapore's business. Among those involved include Keppel Corporation, the leader of the consortium, which is a Dollars 7bn company involved in ship repair, property, engineering and financial services. Others include property companies like Singapore Land and City Developments, and investment groups, among them Temasek Holdings, the Singapore government's investment holding company, and National Trades Union Congress Co-operatives, the investment arm of Singapore's largest labour organisation. Mr Lee Kuan Yew may not have returned physically to the land of his ancestors, but he is doing his best to ensure that a monument to his memory will survive long after he departs the scene.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rowland to retain Lonrho shares until price recovers Mr Tiny Rowland said yesterday that he would not be a seller of his remaining Lonrho shares until the market price reached between 250p and 350p. Following yesterday's results, the share price moved in the right direction for him, closing up 8p to 153p. 'Why should the shares not go back to the level of their pre-Maxwell days?', he asked. In the months after Mr Robert Maxwell died in November 1991, there was a sharp fall in the share prices of companies run by powerful entrepreneurs such as Mr Rowland. It was this plunge which allowed Lonrho's joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, to acquire an 18.8 per cent stake in the group at the beginning of last year for an average price of less than 100p a share. The important indicators of financial performance and balance sheet strength improved at the company in the year to September 30. The ratio of debt to equity fell from 57 per cent to 31 per cent. Net borrowings were Pounds 446m (down from Pounds 849m a year earlier, thanks largely to disposals), compared with net assets of Pounds 1.42bn. Because of the diluting effect of last year's rights issue, net assets per share were 138p, down from 158p. The company pointed out that its 45 per cent shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields is valued in its balance sheet at Pounds 89m, compared with a possible market value of more than Pounds 400m when Ashanti is floated later this year. Mr Bock said that Lonrho would not be selling any of its shares in the flotation. Over the past year, Mr Bock has reorganised Lonrho into four divisions: mining, agriculture, hotels and general trade. There was an improving profit performance from all of them. Mining pushed up pre-tax profits by 60 per cent to Pounds 40m on turnover of Pounds 335m (Pounds 313m); pre-tax profits from hotels rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 12m on Pounds 260m (Pounds 218m); general trade more than doubled its contribution from Pounds 5m to Pounds 11m on Pounds 196m (Pounds 174m); and there was a 50 per cent improvement in pre-tax earnings in the agricultural division to Pounds 12m. The group became even more dependent on Africa during the year. The continent generated Pounds 69m of the Pounds 79m of pre-tax profits from continuing operations against Pounds 44m a year earlier. Capital expenditure is on a sharply declining trend. It was Pounds 121m, down from Pounds 173m in 1992, and is forecast by the company at less than Pounds 100m in the current year. Mr Bock said that the company had eliminated most of its loss-making businesses. However, last year's pre-tax profits were depressed by the legal costs of the company's long running dispute with the Egyptian Fayed brothers - which was settled in October - over the Fayed's 1985 purchase of House of Fraser department stores. Lonrho's legal expenses were less than Pounds 5m in the year justended, all of it charged against the profits of continuing operations. In the current financial period, there is likely to be a charge of around Pounds 1.5m from payments to be made to four directors who are leaving the company.</p>

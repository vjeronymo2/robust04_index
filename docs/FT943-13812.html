			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: 100 not out, or are they? - The start of the Promenade concerts The BBC allowed itself one or two extravagances at the start of this year's season of Promenade concerts. Most noticeably, an array of banners high up in the roof of the Royal Albert Hall proclaims 'Proms 100' just in case anybody has missed the publicity campaign. In fact, there is a bit of a problem here, as people planning the celebrations for the millenium have already found. Should the Proms' centenary be said to fall this year, which is the 100th season, or next, which is 100 years since they started (at the Queen's Hall on 10 August 1895)? Doubtless reckoning that a Proms audience is more often than not in a celebratory mood, the management has decided to have it both ways, in 1994 looking back over 100 years of achievement and in 1995 putting the emphasis on the future through new music. The other notable extravagance was the opening concert. Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, for six soloists, double or treble choir and huge orchestra, is about as lavish a work as one could choose. Apparently, Henry Wood always wanted to schedule Gurrelieder at the Proms (I note in passing that the title 'Henry Wood Promenade Concerts' is gradually being usurped by 'BBC Proms") but the chance never came his way. When Gurrelieder was performed a few years ago it was played (very capably) by a huge youth orchestra, but for this occasion the BBC dug into its pockets and produced a fully professional performance. Given the importance of the Proms as a showcase for the BBC's own orchestras, it is timely that the most important of them - the BBC Symphony Orchestra - should be playing better now than at any point in the last 20 to 30 years. That is thanks to Andrew Davis, whose reign as Chief Conductor has seen a consistent improvement in the sharpness of the orchestra's playing. Even with a score as massive as Gurrelieder he made sure that every detail told, never allowing the music to degenerate into an overblown, post-Wagnerian wallow, as it can. The result had clarity and grandeur, the latter enhanced by the combined choirs of the BBC Singers, the BBC Symphony and Philharmonia Choruses. The soloists were a well-chosen group. Karita Mattila floated beautiful but rather wordless sounds as the ultra-romantic Tove. Ann Murray and Philip Langridge brought vivid characterisations to the Wood-Dove and Klaus the Fool. Unfortunately, I heard little of Neil Breeden's Waldemar, who was on the wrong side of the conductor from my seat. On an evening so heavy with history it was fitting that Hans Hotter, the eloquent Speaker, should be making his Proms debut at the age of 85. At the second Prom on Saturday history took over. The programme was a replica of that on 6 September 1900, a three-hour pot-pourri of light pieces which we would only expect to encounter these days as encores, if at all. If this is really what the Proms used to be like, they have changed beyond recognition. Who said we are at risk of over-popularising classical music in the 1990s? On that score the 1890s won hands down.</p>

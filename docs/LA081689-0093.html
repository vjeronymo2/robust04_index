			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKE-BELIEVE WAR IS EASIER ON MILITARY'S BUDGET;  </P> <P> LATEST TECHNOLOGY PUTS CLASSROOM-BOUND GIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION  </P> <P> There is little time to think. An enemy attack plane comes roaring across the  horizon from behind a distant hill.  </P> <P> A soldier in full combat gear raises a portable anti-aircraft missile launcher  to his shoulder, picks up the attacking jet and fires off a Stinger missile.  The action is fast -- it all happens in a matter of seconds. The  infrared-seeking missile locks on its target, and a hit is marked by an  exploding ball of fire.  </P> <P> The screen goes dark, the lights come on and there are cheers of  congratulations from fellow GIs who witnessed the action, which didn't take  place in the Fulda Gap region of West Germany, but in a classroom at a military  base in the United States.  </P> <P> The high cost of training military personnel and keeping their skills keen --  it costs about $60,000 to fire off a real Stinger missile -- is forcing the  Department of Defense to rely more on simulators -- make-believe war game  machines -- to keep its real-world budget under control.  </P> <P> The Stinger air defense training simulator, made by AAI Corp. in Cockeysville,  Md., is just one example of the military's growing use of computer-driven  training devices. Simulators are used for a wide variety of training, ranging  from teaching aerial combat maneuvers to instructing new recruits to shoot the  M-16 rifle.  </P> <P> While Pentagon officials can't seem to put their fingers on the exact amount  spent on simulators, they say it is a growth industry even at a time the  defense budget is tightening. An Army officer estimated that the military is  spending billions of dollars for the electronic equipment each year.  </P> <P> Mark Lawrence, a technology research analyst with the Prudential Bache  Securities office in Toronto, said expenditures for all simulation and training  programs are growing at a 21% annual rate. The total market, which was  estimated to be $2.49 billion in 1987, is expected to approach $6.23 billion in  three years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rounds Add Up  </P> <P> "We simulate more each year as the state of the art improves," said Maj.  Timothy McKeever of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Ft. Monroe, Va.  The driving force, he said, is economics.  </P> <P> Take the training of GIs to fire their rifles: McKeever said each bullet costs  about 17 cents. "That doesn't sound like much," he said, "but when you are  talking about a couple of hundred rounds a man and you have 200,000 trainees  passing through, it adds up."  </P> <P> To get more bull's-eyes for the dollar, the Army takes new recruits to the real  firing range and has them squeeze off about 10 rounds each. "From this we can  identify those that have got it -- those who have had some hunting skills when  they were young -- and those who don't.  </P> <P> "We take this latter group and have them work with the simulator, which is like  an M-16 built into a box." The simulator imitates the sound of the rifle as  well as its recoil. It can also pick up the flaws in the soldier's firing  procedure so they can be corrected by the instructor.  </P> <P> "Once they master the skills on the simulator, we take them back to the range  to fire live rounds," McKeever said.  </P> <P> The M-16 simulator is on the low side of the technology scale, according to  McKeever. "At the other end are complex simulators used to train tank crews" --  $16-million units made by Perceptronic Inc. and Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman Inc.  that fill entire buildings at Ft. Knox, Ky., and Ft. Rucker, Ala.  </P> <P> As many as 50 tank crews do battle at once, housed in boxes that replicate the  interior of the M-1 Abrams tank. The simulator reproduces the terrain, and when  a crew member looks out he sees what he would see on a battlefield.  </P> <P> When a tank goes up a hill, the box tilts accordingly. "Shooting" is  accomplished with beams of light, and a hit is marked by an explosion.  </P> <P> As if that were not enough, McKeever said, it is also possible to have the  "tanks" at Ft. Knox battle those at Ft. Rucker, via a satellite link between  the two simulator buildings.  </P> <P> The machines are expensive, but the Army compares them to the cost of tank  shells, which can cost several hundred dollars each, and the high price of  field maneuvers using the real thing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Civilians Bothered  </P> <P> Money is a major factor in the increased use of simulators, but it is not the  only factor, said Maj. Barry Bomier, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.  </P> <P> He said the civilian population in the United States and abroad is becoming  intolerant of artillery fire and having fighter jets buzz over their homes. He  said the number of places in the United States and in Europe where military  forces can engage in mock-war exercises are shrinking each year.  </P> <P> These and other factors spur development of quieter -- and cheaper --  alternatives. Companies in many areas are working on the problem.  </P> <P> In Maryland, after winning a contract to build a shipboard missile-launching  system for the Navy, the Martin Marietta Corp. plant at Middle River designed  and built a simulator to train crews in loading missiles into the launchers.  </P> <P> It is a large platform that duplicates the rolling motion of a ship at sea as  crew members use a crane to try to lower dummy missiles into the canister that  are used to store and eventually launch the weapons.  </P> <P> AAI is well known for its production of artillery shells, a lightweight tank,  smoke grenades and a lift trailer used to mount cruise missiles onto the wings  of B-52 bombers, but about 30% of its total sales of $273 million last year  came from producing simulation and training equipment, according to Stuart M.  Macht, AAI's president.  </P> <P> One simulator made at the company's Cockeysville complex is designed to allow  the crew of a Navy guided-missile frigate to "fight" a sea battle in  Mediterranean while docked at Baltimore's inner harbor.  </P> <P> In an advertisement to potential buyers, AAI promotes its pier-side trainer as  the "Great Pretender" and as an economical alternative to at-sea exercises.  </P> <P> The simulator is mounted in a tractor-trailer truck, "and we plug into the  ship's radar and electronic warfare sensors," said Lawrence J. Rytter, director  of training.  </P> <P> "As far as the crew members are concerned," he added, "it's the real thing.  There are airplanes, surface ships and submarines coming from all directions.  They think they are fighting a war" as they take the necessary evasive action  and go on the offense, including the "firing" of missiles at the attackers.  </P> <P> Rytter said the company has built eight units, which sell for about $10 million  each, for the Navy and one for the Australian government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helicopters Spared  </P> <P> AAI also makes simulators used in training crews of the B-52 bomber, A-10  attack plane and F-14 and F-16 fighters in the art of electronic warfare.  </P> <P> UNC Inc. in Annapolis, Md., also has a piece of the simulation business. Under  a $70-million contract starting the first of the year, UNC uses simulators for  the primary training of the Army's UH-1H helicopter pilots.  </P> <P> David L. Dragics, director of investor relations, noted that the simulator does  not need the maintenance required of the Army's fleet of helicopters each time  one spends an hour in flight.  </P> <P> "And if something goes wrong in the training," he added, "you don't lose an  expensive helicopter."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We just received the following announcement from  the Press Center of the Ministry of Defense:    On 23 June at 1040 [0740 GMT] the Air Force guard duty units  noted a violation of Bulgaria's airspace committed by 21 light  transportation aircraft flying from near the village of Radovets  in Turkey, in two directions: Burgas and Sofia.    The Air Force guard duty aircraft were immediately placed in  a state of readiness, which included the takeoff of fighters.  The aircraft that violated Bulgarian airspace were forced to  land at the airports of Saratovo and Sofia. A commission  appointed by the Air Force commander is investigating the  reasons the flight regulations were violated.</p>

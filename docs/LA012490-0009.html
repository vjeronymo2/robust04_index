			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE;  </P> <P> L.A.'S HOBOS ARE FORCED TO HIT THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF A NEW CLUBHOUSE  </P> <P> Santa Fe Bo and Capt. Cook did what comes naturally Tuesday night when the Hobo  Club shut its doors in Los Angeles for the last time. They hit the road.  </P> <P> The two tramps helped "decommission" their Westside meeting place and lead a  farewell hobo survival workshop for club members. Then they set out to find a  new home for the 3,000-member National Hobo Assn.  </P> <P> A developer plans to erect an office building on the site of the 45-year-old  Century City Tavern &amp; Restaurant, a small Santa Monica Boulevard eatery  that has served as the group's clubhouse for five years.  </P> <P> "We're looking for a new place in this area," said Santa Fe Bo, who started the  hobo association 13 years ago. "But we've been looking for a year," added Capt.  Cook, a director of the organization.  </P> <P> Tuesday's survival workshop was appropriate. Owners of other Westside  establishments haven't exactly lined up to turn their trendy places into a new  hobo headquarters.  </P> <P> But most of the estimated 600 association members in the Los Angeles area are  hardly scruffy transients who hop the rails for a free ride between handouts.  They feel right at home in the shadow of Century City high-rises that are 65  miles from the closest real "hobo jungle" -- near the Southern Pacific rail  yard in Colton in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> In real life, Santa Fe Bo is Bobb Hopkins, 41, an actor from Woodland Hills,  who said he got hooked on hoboing on an eight-day rail ride to Boston in 1976.  </P> <P> Capt. Cook is the road name of Garth Bishop, 50, a Los Angeles book publisher,  who said he first sneaked aboard a freight train as an Arkansas teen-ager.  </P> <P> Other dues-paying members of the association include doctors, lawyers and  corporate executives who have adopted such rail-riding monikers as Itchy Foot,  Middle Caboose Mark and Hopalong Chet.  </P> <P> The yuppie hobos say they like to change pace by occasionally climbing into  jeans and work shirts and venturing out to Colton to hop slow-moving freights.  </P> <P> Besides experiencing a genuinely American form of folklore, riding the rails  provides an unparalleled rush of excitement, according to the self-styled 'bos.  </P> <P> There's the danger of jumping aboard a moving train, the joy of watching the  scenery slide past an open boxcar door and the thrill of outsmarting railroad  police.  </P> <P> "You see how real people live," said Beverly Hills hobo Tudor Williams, 46, who  hitches a train ride whenever he can take time off from his job as private chef  for a Hollywood producer.  </P> <P> Williams, who is known to other hobos as Wandering Wills, cooked up 33 quarts  each of mulligan stew and hobo chili for Tuesday night's farewell.  </P> <P> The hobos bemoaned the loss of their meeting place as they stood in the stew  line.  </P> <P> "This is home sweet home to me," said Michael Followell, 30, a heavy-equipment  operator from Texas, who says he travels 10,000 miles a year on the rails.  </P> <P> Occasional hobo Mark Stevenson, 35, came straight from work as a commercial  banker. He took off his coat and tie as he entered.  </P> <P> "This is terrible," the West Adams district resident said. "We've got to find a  new location soon. I'm going to do my best to find that place."  </P> <P> Hobo survival tips shared with club members Tuesday night were for the 1990s,  not the '30s, when the Depression made tramps out of thousands of Americans who  rode the rails in search of better lives.  </P> <P> They included suggestions that bedrolls include current railroad maps and at  least two valid pieces of identification.  </P> <P> Restaurant owner Voja Vlatkovic, a 56-year-old former Olympic track star from  Yugoslavia, said he didn't know what a hobo was when club members first began  meeting at his place. The location was picked for meetings because both Hopkins  and Bishop lived nearby.  </P> <P> Vlatkovic said he will miss the hobos but, he confessed, "I travel by plane."  </P></p>

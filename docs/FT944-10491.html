			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Observer: Outposted The remarkable economic progress of Humberside, in the north of England, will be further confirmed today by the final granting of planning permission and funding for a Pounds 520m gas-fired power station at Grimsby. And last year the Humber estuary shifted more than 60m tonnes of cargo, knocking the Thames off its pedestal as the UK's biggest seaborne trading zone, and putting the Channel tunnel's projected 8m tonnes a year into perspective. So why choose London for the presentation, which is intended to promote business opportunities associated with a new offshore terminal? Humberside county council says about 100 people will turn up for today's beano at the Selfridges Hotel, and that far fewer would bother to travel north. Some confusion here, surely. Those who would travel north - it's hardly a time-zone change - would thus be establishing themselves as genuinely interested in the area. But how many at Selfridges will simply be taking a swift free lunch?</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 2 HURT IN SHOOTING AT WEST COVINA TRADE SCHOOL  </P> <P> A gunman shot three people in a West Covina vocational school Thursday, killing  one and critically wounding another before escaping in a car, police said.  </P> <P> Carolyn Vasquez, 36, a counselor at Northwest College, died of her wounds at  Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.  </P> <P> Robin Stanford, 27, of Rancho Cucamonga, also a counselor, was in critical  condition at the hospital after undergoing surgery, West Covina police said.  </P> <P> A 17-year-old male tutor was seriously wounded in the leg, investigators said.  His identity was not available.  </P> <P> Shortly after 5 p.m., the gunman walked into the school building at 2029 W.  Garvey Ave. and asked for a female student by name, said Police Lt. Clint  Collins. When told she was not there, he began firing with a handgun for no  apparent reason, fatally wounding Vasquez, and shooting Stanford in the  stomach, Collins said.  </P> <P> "He just opened fire on the people in front of him," Collins said.  </P> <P> As he left the building, the gunman turned and shot the tutor outside, the  lieutenant said.  </P> <P> Detectives said the man fired at least five shots.  </P> <P> "We don't have a speculative motive yet," Collins said.  </P> <P> However, investigators said they believe the assailant is the boyfriend of the  woman student he asked for.  </P> <P> Collins said detectives planned to go the suspected gunman's house Thursday  night.  </P> <P> After the shooting, the gunman ran to a car driven by another man, detectives  said. They described the vehicle as a 1980 or 1981 "shiny, beige Oldsmobile  with wire wheels."  </P> <P> Marsha First, administrator at the school, which offers training in  health-related fields, described Vasquez, who lived in West Covina, as "a  lovely, lovely person."  </P></p>

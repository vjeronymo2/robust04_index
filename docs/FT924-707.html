			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Aircraft orders Most industries would regard landing a Dollars 3.4bn order as a pleasant way to end the year. However for Airbus, yesterday's agreement with Singapore Airlines to supply 20 long-range jets can only be cold comfort. The market for new airliners has been softening all year and two weeks ago Northwest Airlines cancelled orders worth Dollars 3.5bn. Worldwide, more than 800 civil aircraft were delivered last year; the total may fall to 500 by 1994. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are all reducing output, but further cuts will be needed. By some estimates airlines are at present not using between 10 and 15 per cent of their capacity. The parlous finances of many carriers mean that more are likely to cancel orders. In addition, the status of some planned purchases by the Irish leasing group GPA - which alone accounts for 10 per cent of all aircraft currently on order - is uncertain. Besides, companies which have placed orders recently want delivery in the second half of the decade. Military business used to protect some manufacturers from such cyclical swings in the civil airliner market, but defence cuts are forcing aircraft makers and their suppliers to transfer as much business as possible into the civil area just as the market worsens. British Aerospace is one company caught in this down draught, yet its shares have recently been supported by a possible further large order from Saudi Arabia and a joint venture with Taiwan. Either may bail out the company in the short term, but the much-touted Airbus profits seem as far away as ever.</p>

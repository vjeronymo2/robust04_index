The request came in a  message that 'Arafat sent to Clinton.    The Palestinian news agency said today the message dealt  with  the difficulties blocking a Security Council resolution  denouncing the massacre and providing international protection  for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and their  holy places.    The message also dealt with Israeli maneuvers and lies aimed  at blocking the implementation of the Declaration of Principles  and the serious situation in the occupied land.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: India aims for sharp growth in exports India is planning to set a target of 24-25 per cent for export growth in the financial year which started last month, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister, said yesterday. Mr Mukherjee hoped exports would rise to Dollars 26bn-Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.4bn-Pounds 18.1bn), from Dollars 22.2bn in 1993-94, when they rose 20.4 per cent. The Commerce Ministry is looking to rapid increases to make up for the ground lost in the early 1990s when export growth was hit by a collapse in sales to the former Soviet Union, once India's biggest market. Also, economic reforms launched in 1991, which include incentives for exporters, have taken time to have effect. Even though exports are growing fast, Mr Mukherjee's target is ambitious. Finance Ministry projections suggest exports may in fact grow by about 15 per cent. Mr Mukherjee said he expected further growth from industries which were already contributing to exports - textiles, computer software, motor vehicle parts, engineering, agricultural goods, gems and jewellery and leather. He also forecast an import rise, after growth of only 6.8 per cent last year to Dollars 22.1bn. There was a sharp pick-up in March when imports were 62 per cent higher than in March 1993. Mr Mukherjee added that, with signs of industry recovering after three years of stagnation, imports could grow by 11-12 per cent in dollar terms. Imports of machinery and of industrial raw materials would cause much of the growth. He said the recent signing of the Uruguay Round accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would benefit India and other developing country exporters by opening markets in industrial nations.</p>

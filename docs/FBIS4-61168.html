			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 3 May, BNS -- The introduction of the  value-added tax in Lithuania 1 May was not as smooth as expected  by the government.    The 18-percent tax replaced the equal size general excise  tax, however apart from being applied to local products, the new  tax was also imposed on imports.    As soon as the new tax came into effect, the usual routine  was disrupted at Lithuanian customs offices. Not knowing how to  apply the new value-added tax law, customs officers simply  stopped all cargoes on the border. Vitalijus Girzonas, head of  the Lithuanian Customs Department, said lines of trucks have  become even longer at the Lazdijai crossing on the  Lithuanian-Polish border because a number of companies failed to  bring goods into the country before 1 May.    Ignorance of the value-added tax law created additional  problems for tax inspectors, who are unable to answer all  questions asked about the new tax.    Experts of the European Union's PHARE [Poland-Hungary Action  for Restructuring Economy] program came to Lithuania around a  month ago to help prepare for the introduction of the new tax.  PHARE experts provided a considerable amount of information  about the tax to the public, but the desired result was not  achieved.    Forecasts of the expected price-leap are quite controversial  and range from 3 to 20 percent. Drivers were first to  experience the new tax when gasoline prices jumped by as much as  25 percent in some gas stations.    The reaction of store owners varied. Prices did not change  at a majority of stores in Vilnius, although salespeople said  imported goods may become more expensive very soon. But nearly  all stores changed prices and were closed Monday in the second  biggest town of Kaunas. Virtually all store owners agree that  sales will drop.    Lithuanian industrialists said the value-added tax will  scare  away foreign investments, although the authors of the  value-added tax law contend that the tax will stimulate the  investment process.</p>

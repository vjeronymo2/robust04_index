			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PERU;  </P> <P> BODY OF AMERICAN REPORTER FOUND  </P> <P> A body found near a Peruvian jungle town has been tentatively identified as  that of a missing American journalist, Todd Smith. Smith, 28, a reporter for  Florida's Tampa Tribune newspaper, was last seen Friday as he left for the  airport outside Uchiza, 245 miles northeast of Lima. He had been researching  stories on drug traffickers and leftist rebels. Managing Editor Lawrence  McConnell said in Tampa that "we have confirmed . . . that the body has been  tentatively identified as that of Todd Smith." Uchiza is in the heart of the  coca-growing Upper Huallaga Valley, and both drug-trafficking gangs and Maoist  guerrillas operate in the region.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong economists  welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's  most favored nation (MFN) trade status for another year.    Xu Yongfu, a senior research fellow in the Hong Kong-Macao  regional office of the Bank of China, said the decision to renew  China's MFN trade status and delink human rights from trade  issues was a pragmatic and wise option.    He said that the decision dispelled fears over the Sino-U.S.  trade development and laid a foundation for the trade growth  between China and the United States and in the world trade as a  whole.    Edward Leung, chief economist of Hong Kong Trade Development  Council, said Clinton's announcement to delink human rights from  trade issues provided a basis for the smooth trade development  between the two countries and is conducive to China's reentry  into the GATT.    As a large number of Hong Kong manufacturers have opened  plants in southern China and shipped their products to the  United States, renewal of China's MFN trade status will make  owners of these plants at ease and help increase the volume of  re-export.    Benny Chiu, research manager of the China Service Ltd. of  the  Hong Hong Bank, said that Clinton's decision will benefit both  the United States, a major supplier of funds to China, and  China, a big market for U.S. investors.</p>

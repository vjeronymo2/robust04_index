			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / 'Penniless' Walker aide fined Pounds 25,000 Mr Wilfred Aquilina, former finance director of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, was led in distress from court yesterday after receiving a Pounds 25,000 fine and a suspended jail sentence on a charge of false accounting. Mr Aquilina, now a restaurateur who lives in south-west London, was convicted last month on a 10-1 majority verdict of one charge of false accounting after Mr George Walker, his former boss, was cleared of orchestrating a Pounds 19m fraud at Brent Walker. Mr Roy Amlot, his counsel, said Mr Aquilina was virtually penniless and asked Judge Geoffrey Rivlin to reconsider the fine and nine months' imprisonment imposed in default if the amount was not paid within six months. Mr Aquilina's wife, Janet, was called to the witness box and told the judge that if he insisted on imposing such a fine, their Pounds 280,000 family home - which she owns and which still has a large outstanding mortgage - would have to be sold. After further discussion, the judge agreed to stay the fine for 21 days. But he ordered a 'careful investigation' into Mr Aquilina's finances. He said the Crown accepted that Mr Aquilina's debts exceeded his assets by Pounds 100,000, but there was no doubt that in recent years he had made very substantial gifts to his wife in the form of the family home and cash. He added: 'I believe a fine of Pounds 25,000 is proper . . . and but for the things said to me today, the fine would have been a more substantial one and there would have been a costs order.' Judge Rivlin said yesterday that the prosecution had proved only a fraction of its original allegations against Mr Aquilina, but the offence of which he was convicted was a serious one. It was committed nearly four years ago when City accountants started investigating the removal of Pounds 4.5m from Brent Walker's coffers. Mr Aquilina, acting as a consultant to the group, having been ousted the previous year as finance director with a Pounds 500,000 golden handshake, was asked to help. The judge said he knowingly provided accountants with false information about the company's financial position.</p>

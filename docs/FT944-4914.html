			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Samsung's designs worry its rivals - Korea's other carmakers fear overcapacity Samsung yesterday formally applied for government approval to begin passenger car production by 1998 in a move that could prove risky for South Korea's second largest industrial group and the nation's car industry. Korea's four carmakers have called on the government to reject Samsung's plan, al-though that appears unlikely. The chief concern is that Samsung's entry will lead to overcapacity when the Korean car industry is planning to almost triple car production from 2.5m to 6m vehicles annually by the end of the decade, which would make Korea the world's fourth biggest car manufacturer. Each of Korea's big three car companies - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - wants to produce 2m vehicles, while Ssangyong has a modest goal of 150,000 cars. Samsung would add another 500,000 cars by 2002 and hopes to reach 1.5m. 'That is too many cars, given the slowdown in domestic sales, although exports are rising due to the weak Korean currency. The optimum figure for production is probably around 3.5m,' said Mr Chung Tae-seung, director of overseas sales for Kia Motors. The industry benefits from a highly-protected domestic market, although trade barriers are likely to be reduced in the next few years under pressure from the US and the EU. Carmakers have expressed worries that Samsung will recruit engineers from rivals, causing a bidding war that would lead to higher wages. Moreover, Korea's car components base is under strain by the growth in production. Samsung's technical alliance with Nissan of Japan may also set back efforts to promote automotive technological independence and increase imports of parts that would deepen Korea's Dollars 12bn trade deficit with Japan, according to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Although the government shared many of these doubts and tried to persuade Samsung to drop its plan, it finally approved the Dollars 5bn project after Samsung agreed to take measures to avoid disrupting the automotive industry. Samsung will hire engineers from the US and other foreign countries, while promising to invest in the growth of the domestic car components industry. It pledged to export 55 per cent of its output of 500,000 vehicles by 2002 to reduce the threat of harming domestic sales of the other carmakers. But rivals remain sceptical about Samsung's measures. 'Samsung has a history of breaking its promises. It promised, for example, not to enter the car industry several years ago when it gained government approval for truck production,' said a Hyundai Motor official. Samsung has long sought to enter the car industry to reduce its dependence on electronics by developing its heavy machinery business. It believes car production will deliver synergy benefits for its electronics operations since cars are increasingly relying on electronic components. Its automotive ambitions reflect the personal interest of Mr Lee Kun-hee, the Samsung chairman, who is an enthus-iastic collector of racing cars. Samsung has argued that its car project would benefit Korea since it would acquire advanced automotive technology from Nissan, which would help the country's export competitiveness. It said the programme would create jobs for Pusan, the home town and political base of President Kim Young-sam. Pusan has suffered job losses due to the decline of its textile and footwear industry. Analysts question whether Samsung should be devoting considerable financial resources to car production. This will divert money from its electronics business when it needs to spend vast sums on the development and production of advanced semiconductor chips and other costly programmes to strengthen its position as one of the world's leading electronics companies. However, Samsung said it would be able to help finance the car company through the sale of subsidiaries in the textile, food and retail industries. There are doubts whether Samsung can achieve success by emphasising car exports. 'No car company has survived by concentrating on exports, at least initially,' said Mr Kim Chul-su, the trade and industry minister, in a recent interview before he decided to endorse Samsung's bid. Samsung may succeed if it forces one or two competitors out of the car industry. Samsung made an apparent attempt last year to take over Kia, although it was blocked by the government. Some analysts speculate that Ford and Mazda, two of Kia's largest shareholders with a combined 18 per cent stake, may be willing to sell the company to Samsung to help improve the finances of troubled Mazda, in which Ford has a shareholding. The survival of the loss-making Daewoo and Ssangyong car companies may be threatened by Samsung.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond project exceeding expectations North America's first diamond mine will be bigger and have a longer life than earlier estimates indicated, according to the Australian-Canadian joint venture that is developing the deposit near Lac de Gras in Canada's Northwest Territories. BHP Minerals said that, based on the latest samples, the proposed development plan would be broadened from three to five diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes. The life of the project has been extended to 25 years. Production is due to start in the third quarter of 1997, assuming that regulatory approvals for the building of a mine are obtained within the next 12 months. The Canadian government set up a four-person environmental review panel earlier this month. The project, which is located in an ecologically sensitive area close to the Arctic Circle, is likely to come under close scrutiny from environmental and local aboriginal groups. According to BHP, initial production will be 9,000 tonnes of kimberlite a day, rising to 18,000 tonnes in the tenth year. The mine will be a combination of open-pit and underground operations. BHP said that last summer's exploration programme uncovered 13 new diamond-bearing pipes, bringing the total to 39. Further exploration is planned this winter, involving the extraction of 100-200 tonne samples from four or five pipes.</p>

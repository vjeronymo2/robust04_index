			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Incomprehensible Claim"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. policy on South Asia continues to change  constantly. Until recently, the U.S. Government had held a very  strong position against Pakistan on the nuclear nonproliferation  issue. Consequently, not only did U.S. economic and military  aid to Pakistan remain suspended for the last four years, the  delivery of planes for which Pakistan already paid $658 million  appeared to be impossible. For some time, there had been little  change in the U.S. stand. The United States then started  describing Kashmir as a disputed territory and exerted some  pressure on India on its nuclear program. An impression was  created that the United States was exerting the same kind of  pressure on both India and Pakistan, and identical pressure was  also being exerted on both of them on the missile program, too.    However, President Clinton has now sent a report to the U.S.  Congress in which a bizarre claim has been made that Pakistan  has been blackmailing India by saying that if the Kashmir issue  is not resolved, then not only will a war break out between the  two countries, it will be a nuclear war. In his report,  President Clinton has said that the impression created by  Pakistan that a durable peace cannot be established in South  Asia and that the region will face danger until the Kashmir  issue is resolved is also incorrect. Though President Clinton  has expressed an unrealistic and incomprehensible opinion in his  report, it is gratifying that 12 members of the U.S. Congress,  in a letter to President Clinton, have demanded that the Indian  prime minister, who is beginning a visit to the United States,  on 14 May be asked to stop human rights violations in Kashmir  and apprised that if India wants technical and economic  assistance from the United States, then the former should also  pursue the ethical principles that are very dear to the United  States. The letter added that India has been holding the 12.5  million people of occupied Kashmir under its domination against  their will and is trying to subjugate them with the help of  500,000 troops. The letter also asked the U.S. President to  play his role in securing a peaceful and durable solution to the  Kashmir dispute. We believe that the United States wields  considerable influence and is capable of playing an effective  role. If the United States plays a role in resolving this  dispute, then not only will it be contributing to paving the way  for a just world order, it will also be making several  generations of Kashmiris, Pakistanis, and Indians grateful to  the United States.    Apart from the aforesaid letter from the U.S. legislators,  grave concern was expressed by a number of Democratic and  Republican Congressmen over the Kashmir situation at a function  marking the release of a latest book on Kashmir by the eminent  U.S. writer, Professor William Baker. They also expressed  amazement over the United States and other developed nation for  their remaining silent spectators to the human rights violations  in Kashmir. With tearful eyes, Professor William Baker told the  gathering that he had no words to describe the awful scenes of  atrocities he witnessed during his visit to Kashmir. The views  expressed by prominent U.S. legislators and scholars indicate  that informed, influential, and powerful circles of the United  States are well aware of the situation in Kashmir.    Under such circumstances, President Clinton's allegation  against Pakistan that it is blackmailing India on the Kashmir  question and creating a wrong impression in the world that a  durable peace cannot be achieved in South Asia unless the  Kashmir issue is resolved reflects the incomprehensible logic of  the U.S. President. The head of the world's most powerful  country should not be so unfamiliar with the issues of an  important region and the nature of dangers it faces. It has  been America's age-old weakness and desire to drag India as  close to itself as possible. In the past, a sort of  justification was that the United States wanted to keep India  away from the Soviet Union, but no such compulsion exists now.  Therefore, the United States should keep in view the objective  realities while dealing with India.    On the eve of Narasimha Rao's visit, the Indian Government  has announced that its missile manufacture and testing will  continue according to schedule, and the entire program will be  completed by July. It is amazing is that despite such a  categorical announcement by India, the U.S. President is  alleging that Pakistan is raising the specter of a nuclear war.  It is imperative that the Government of Pakistan immediately  obtain the latest report of President Clinton and apprise the  U.S. Government of Pakistan's reaction after studying it.  President Leghari is scheduled to visit the United States, and  he will hold talks with U.S. authorities despite it being a  private visit. These talks will yield results only when  Pakistan's viewpoint is clearly explained to the U.S. side. The  Government of Pakistan should convey its reaction in  categorical terms to Washington on the U.S. President's latest  report.</p>

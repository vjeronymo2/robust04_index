			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: ATR commuter aircraft attract Dollars 100m of orders - Farnborough Air Show The Franco-Italian ATR consortium, Europe's leading manufacturer of turbo-prop commuter aircraft, yesterday announced new orders worth more than Dollars 100m for its ATR42 and ATR72 aircraft. The orders include two ATR72 aircraft, worth around Dollars 26m, from the rapidly expanding London-Gatwick based airliner Cityflier Express, a UK regional carrier operating under the British Airways name under a franchising agreement with BA. CSA, the Czech airline, also ordered two smaller ATR42 aircraft worth around Dollars 22m, while Avianova, an Alitalia subsidiary, placed firm orders for three ATR72 and options for an additional four aircraft, worth a total of around Dollars 90m. The ATR consortium, which is jointly owned by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, says the Italian orders confirmed the boom in regional air transport currently taking place in Italy. The UK Cityflier order is the first by a UK carrier for the 66-seat ATR72 aircraft. The two aircraft will be delivered in the livery of BA Express. Franchising is a growing trend in the European airline industry, with small regional niche carriers associating themselves with the marketing power and brand of large flag carriers to compete in the liberalised single European airline market. Cityflier, which already operates five smaller ATR42 aircraft, plans to use its new ATR72s on the London-Gatwick to Dublin routes as well as on its London-Gatwick routes to Dusseldorf, Jersey and Rotterdam. ATR officials also confirmed yesterday that the group was involved in talks to rationalise a European turbo-prop aircraft industry suffering from intense over capacity. Aerospatiale, the French ATR partner, has been in negotiations with British Aerospace over the possibility of creating a joint venture grouping ATR with BAe's jetstream turbo-prop operation. Aerospatiale also believes that ATR, which currently has a share of around 53 per cent of the world's turbo-prop market, could become the focus of a broad rationalisation of the European turbo-prop industry, grouping not only BAe's operations but eventually other European producers. Virgin Atlantic Airways is set to add two Airbus A340 long-range, wide-bodied aircraft to its fleet as part of its renewal and expansion programme.</p>

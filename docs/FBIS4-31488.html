"Romania is taking part in several UN programs for  international assistance in areas of conflict," the Romanian  minister added, reminding that participation of the Romanian  Army with a field hospital and a subunit to fight radioactive  contamination during the Gulf war.    "Moreover, the Partnership for Peace implies a series of  concrete offers from us in the field of infantry, artillery,  navy, and education, that is, those facilities put at the  disposal for joint action with other NATO partners. For  Romania, to ensure its security in an unstable area means the  possibility and compulsory condition to consolidate its market  economy, to expand commercial exchanges and constructive  diplomacy apt to ensure the Romanian people a European standard  of living, without threats of war, without embargoes that are so  damaging and enjoying full freedom of a democratic political  life. Democracy must not be only conquered, but also defended,"  the defense minister said.</p>

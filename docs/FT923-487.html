			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Move to hard core TRADING in European currencies this week will probably be dominated by the debate over whether a hard core of currencies can now be formed around the French franc and the D-Mark, writes James Blitz. By the end of last week, the Bundesbank and the Bank of France seemed close to winning their fight to avoid a devaluation of the French franc. Some dealers still believe that there could be renewed pressure on the franc if the Bundesbank does not cut interest rates again at its council meeting this week. But, by Friday night, the franc had touched FFr3.38 to the D-Mark, an important psychological break-through. The question now is whether France and Germany will forge a harder currency bloc composed of the D-Mark, the French franc, the Dutch Guilder and the Belgian franc. According to Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, the ERM system needs a credible realignment to survive the present crisis. 'The narrowness of the French 'Yes' vote has merely added to the markets' scepticism about the prospects for monetary union, thereby further exposing weaker currencies like the escudo the punt and the peseta,' he said. 'The absence of a realignment has also resulted in the French franc coming under intense pressure.' There could be an argument for conducting such a realignment now. If the D-Mark and the franc are seen to realign upwards against the weaker currencies in the system, the pressure may be taken off the French currency once-and-for-all. Such a move, however, could put new strains on the lira and sterling, which were recently suspended from the system.</p>

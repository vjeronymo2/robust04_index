			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA PLANS TO REZONE SITE BEING SOLD BY CHURCH GROUP;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE ZONING CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE PROFITS FOR THE  CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING COMPANY, FOCUS ON THE FAMILY. THE CHANGE WILL ALLOW FOR  HIGH-RISE CONSTRUCTION.  </P> <P> The City Council this week gave an early going-away present to Focus on the  Family, a conservative Christian broadcasting and publishing empire that plans  to leave Pomona for Colorado.  </P> <P> The council by a 5-0 vote Monday gave preliminary approval to the  organization's request to rezone its Pomona property for high-rise  construction, potentially increasing the sale price.  </P> <P> "They wish to maximize profits from the sale of their property," said Steve  Tarvin, the city's acting community development director.  </P> <P> The organization's move to Colorado will take place within two years of the  sale of its Pomona property, Focus on the Family officials said. Pomona will  lose 725 jobs.  </P> <P> The zone change would permit the construction of a building up to 10 stories,  instead of the current maximum of three stories, on five acres at 861 Corporate  Center Drive. The vacant lot lies between a pair of two-story buildings that  house Focus on the Family operations near the junction of the San Bernardino  Freeway, 57 Freeway and Corona Expressway.  </P> <P> Paul L. Hetrick, vice president of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit  organization that promotes Christian values through radio, films and  publications, said the Pomona property must be sold before Focus on the Family  can build a new headquarters in Colorado Springs.  </P> <P> Hetrick said the organization has not set a price on the Pomona property, which  consists of 13 acres and two large buildings. It also has not listed the  property with a broker. But the property is valued "in the $20-million range,"  he said.  </P> <P> It is not clear how much the zone change would increase the property's value,  Hetrick said. Partly, he said, it depends on whether potential buyers are  interested in high-rise construction or want the land for smaller buildings. In  any event, the change will increase the marketability of the property, he said.  </P> <P> Officials of Focus on the Family announced in June that they had outgrown their  facilities and had accepted an offer from a Colorado foundation for a  $4-million grant that was contingent upon moving the headquarters to Colorado.  </P> <P> If the organization, which has a budget of $65 million a year, had stayed in  Pomona, Hetrick said, it would have sought permission to build a high-rise  office building itself on the vacant lot.  </P> <P> The 13-acre property is part of a 43-acre office park in which four other lots  already are zoned for high-rise construction.  </P> <P> In giving preliminary approval to the zone change, council members said they  hope that a major employer will be attracted to the property.  </P> <P> The council is expected to make a final decision on the zoning matter at its  Dec. 17 meeting.  </P></p>

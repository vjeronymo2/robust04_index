			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion and Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that the rules of an exchange be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that permitting investors to designate an investment adviser to receive proxy and related issuer materials and vote their proxies removes impediments to a free and open market. As noted by the Exchange, investors have been requesting that investment advisers be authorized to receive issuer materials and vote proxies for the investor. Investors choosing an investment adviser arrangement may believe that they do not need to receive issuer information since the investment adviser and not the investor is making investment decisions on their behalf. The Commission acknowledges that investors might view the receipt of issuers materials and the ability to vote proxies as part of the investment adviser's obligations to manage customer accounts. Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges that some investors, in choosing to utilize the services of an investment adviser, are implying that they do not have the knowledge or inclination to review complicated issuer or proxy materials or to vote proxies. These investors, in particular, may be frustrated by being inundated with unwanted issuer materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that the proposed rule change will permit the investment adviser to make more expedient, informed investment decisions, thereby facilitating securities transactions in accordance with the Act. For these reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change appropriately gives investors the freedom to choose whether to receive proxy and related issuer materials and vote the proxies or to designate their investment adviser to perform these functions on their behalf. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6(b)(5) of the Act also provides that the rules of an exchange should protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. The Commission notes that the rule change continues to permit investors who wish to receive and vote proxies and receive other issuer materials to do so. The rule change affords beneficial owners the choice to delegate this authority when the beneficial owner has already granted discretion in his investment account to an investment adviser. Despite the flexibility provided by the rule, investors will continue to have the authority to rescind their designation of an investment adviser at any time. We note that prior to the effective date of such designation, member organizations must provide beneficial owners written notice of their right to rescind the designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also believes that amending Rule 575 to allow a member organization which is the investment manager for an ERISA Plan is consistent with the policies embodied in Section 6(b)(5) of the Act because the amendment would conform Amex Rule 575 to NYSE Rule 450 which permits a member organization, that is designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan, to vote the proxies in accordance with the its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. The amendment to Rule 575 should facilitate transactions in securities between Amex member firms that are dual members of the NYSE and Amex by adopting consistent proxy rules. The Commission notes that in voting proxies as a plan fiduciary, an investment manager must consider those factors which would affect the value of the plan's investment and is prohibited from subordinating the interests of participants and beneficiaries in their retirement income to unrelated objectives. In addition, the Commission believes that the Exchange's amendment should prevent potential conflicts between the Exchange rules and ERISA guidelines. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In an interpretive letter dated February 23, 1988, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (``PWBA'') of the United States Department of Labor (``Department'') set forth its view regarding proxy voting by fiduciaries of employee retirement plans subject to ERISA. In the interpretive letter, the Department stated that the fiduciary act of managing plan assets which are shares of corporate stock would include the voting of proxies appurtenant to those shares of stock. The Department stated its position that, with respect to the special issues presented by the facts of the particular inquiry set forth in the request for interpretation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , a proposal to change the state of incorporation of a corporation in which a plan owned shares, and a proposal to rescind ``poison pill'' arrangements), the decision as to how proxies should be voted are fiduciary acts of plan asset management. The Department concluded that, to the extent that the plan permits a named fiduciary to appoint an investment manager to manage, acquire and dispose of plan assets, and the named fiduciary has not expressly reserved the voting rights to itself, there would be an ERISA violation if, during the duration of such delegation, any person other than the investment manager were to make the decision how to vote any proxy with respect to shares owned by the plan. See Labor Department Letter on Proxy Voting By Plan Fiduciaries, dated February 23, 1988, BNA Pension Reporter, February 29, 1988, Vol. 15, p. 391. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Franglais law to be revised The French ministry of culture said yesterday it would ask parliament in the autumn to pass legislation to take account of the objections of the French constitutional court to the law protecting the French language. Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister who has championed the cause of linguistic protection, insisted yesterday in an interview in the daily Le Figaro that the court's ruling over the weekend was 'globally positive' because it recognised the government's right to impose French in certain areas of public life. But the constitutional court, he complained, threatened to make his law even more restrictive by giving it to judges to interpret without the help of an official glossary of French terms. The law, commonly known as the Loi Toubon, stipulated that foreign phrases could be accepted only if they had no French equivalent in this glossary. The court said codifying the language of private citizens in such a glossary infringed their freedom of expression. The culture ministry says it will clarify that the law applies only to public officials.</p>

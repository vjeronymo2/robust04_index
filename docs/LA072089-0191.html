			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICES SHOW JUNE RISE OF ONLY 0.2%;  </P> <P> 5-MONTH INFLATIONARY SURGE ABRUPTLY ENDS WITH SMALLEST INCREASE OF THE PAST 16  MONTHS  </P> <P> Consumer prices rose only 0.2% in June as a five-month surge in oil and food  prices came to an abrupt end, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> The June increase in the consumer price index was the smallest in 16 months and  was widely welcomed by financial markets and by economists who earlier this  year had feared that surging inflation had become endemic in the economy.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, stocks soared to their highest levels since the October, 1987,  crash, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 39.65 points to 2,584.41.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 0.3% Price Rises Seen  </P> <P> "Food and energy inflation is behind us and should be out of the picture the  rest of the year," said Donald Ratajczak, economic forecaster and inflation  specialist at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "Without food and energy,  we'll probably be in the 0.3%-a-month (increase) range the rest of the year."  </P> <P> Gasoline prices, which had jumped more than 20% during the first five months of  1989, fell 1% in June. Food prices, which had been accelerating at an annual  rate of almost 7% as a result of the drought, rose only 0.2% last month.  </P> <P> More significant, the "core" rate of consumer price inflation, which excludes  the volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%. That puts it on track toward an  annual rate of 4.5% this year, lower than the 1988 mark of 4.7% and well within  the yearly range of 3.8% to 4.8% that has prevailed since inflation was tamed  in 1982-83.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area, prices in June rose  0.3%. Higher shelter costs -- up 1.4% over the previous month -- were blamed  for most of the increase. Without the effects of those costs, the local area  index would have dropped 0.2% because of lower prices for apparel, gasoline,  food and beverages and personal care items. Medical care costs rose 0.7% in  June.  </P> <P> "We think inflation has been tamed for this year and maybe for this business  cycle," said Lynn Reaser of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "It now  appears that the main reason for the higher inflation we had was the surge in  oil and the strong rise in food prices. But non-food, non-energy is now showing  about the same rate as 1988."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consumers Reject High Prices  </P> <P> Consequently, she said, the Federal Reserve can conclude safely that its  campaign to restrict money and tighten interest rates, begun in March, 1988,  has not only slowed the economy but, more important to those who fear an  inflationary burst, "has begun to affect prices, too."  </P> <P> Accordingly, Reaser said, the Fed should be able to respond quickly with lower  rates and expanded money supply if the economy slumps too severely later this  year.  </P> <P> "The underlying rate of inflation has been around 4% pretty much since we  knocked it down there in '83, except for wiggles up or down caused by food and  energy," Ratajczak said. "So it really looks as though the Fed has succeeded in  making sure the oil prices and the drought effects on food did not get embedded  in the system this time. Consumers are not buying when prices get too high."  </P> <P> An important factor in the price moderation in June, he pointed out, was an  event that has occurred every summer in recent years: Buyers have revolted  against spring clothing price increases, which translates into steep discounts  in June or July.  </P> <P> In Wednesday's report, Labor Department statisticians estimated that clothing  prices in general fell 1.1% in June and that prices of women's clothing tumbled  2.2%. Before seasonal adjustment, which is intended to smooth out the steeper  zigzags in price movements, women's clothing prices dropped 3.9% and prices for  clothing generally fell 2.2%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Disinflation Showing Up'  </P> <P> "This report is very encouraging in that disinflation is showing up," said  Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., who only a few months ago was  warning that a pattern of 1970s-style stagflation was setting in. At that time,  Sinai expressed concern that, although the economy was cooling rapidly, higher  inflation appeared to have embedded itself in the system.  </P> <P> The June report "hints that the weaker economy may have a wider impact on  inflation more quickly than has been the case historically. It seems prices are  more sensitive these days to changes in the economy than may have been true in  the past and that businesses have been able to contain wage inflation more  quickly than before."  </P> <P> He added: "On one month's report, it's too early to get too optimistic about  inflation, but it's not too early to ask whether we may not be on track to  quicker moderation of inflation. If inflation could unwind to an annual rate of  4% off a weak economy or a shallow downturn, that would be a small price to  pay."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Soft Landing' Possible  </P> <P> In effect, Sinai suggested, the hoped-for "soft landing" may still be possible.  That is, the Fed may manage to slow the economy gently enough to tame inflation  without sending the country into a recession.  </P> <P> "It should be very satisfying to (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan, who has been  trying to balance growth to inflation in an era in which external things like  oil prices have mucked it up," Sinai said. "But now food and energy are out of  the index. The only question mark will be if wage costs put too high a floor  under price inflation."  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose in June to 124.1.  This means that a cross section of goods and services costing $100 during the  1982-84 base period cost $124.10 in June.  </P></p>

They said  that they were unaware of such an enterprise as it had never  come up before. On 9 June several employees of the joint  venture were caught redhanded trying to smuggle eight kg of  heroin, worth a million dollars, into Russia.    One of the sources suggested to ITAR-TASS that the venture  might be one of those which is sometimes created by DPRK  representatives in the Russian Federation without going through  Russian legal processes. Knowledge of such joint ventures is,  as a rule, confined to an extremely small circle of trusted  people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with President Guillermo Endara by TVN </F> News Director Luz Maria Noli in Panama City on 8 May -- live]    [Text] [Noli] We have President Guillermo Endara on the  telephone line. Go ahead, Mr. President.    [Endara] Thank you very much, Luz Maria. I am calling you to  report that I have just made a decision, along with the minister  of government and justice. I have decided that public workers  will be excused from duty tomorrow until 1230. I just signed a  decree stating that the public sector will not work tomorrow  morning until 1230. This will allow workers to participate in  the vote-counting process.    I also want to take this opportunity to ask the private  sector, particularly the National Council of Private Enterprise,  Panamanian Chamber of Construction, Chamber of Commerce,  Industrialists Association, and all Panamanian businessmen to  follow suit. We ask them to allow their workers to report for  duty tomorrow at 1230. Why? Because I think the people, in  addition to witnessing the voting, must witness the  vote-counting process. The vote-counting process must be  absolutely aboveboard, and I want the people to see how their  votes are counted.    What we are experiencing today in Panama is something we  have  not seen for years. This opportunity will not present itself  again for another five years. Therefore, I ask the private  sector to excuse their employees from duty until 1230 tomorrow.  It is worthwhile for the Panamanian people to see how their  votes are counted, and it will allow us to know for certain who  the real president of Panama is. I will relinquish power to  that future president of Panama regardless of who he may be, but  I want all the people to witness the vote-counting process.    I thank you very much, Luz Maria, for allowing me to inform  public workers of a decree issued excusing them from work until  1230 tomorrow. This will allow Panamanians to witness how their  votes are counted. They must go to their voting tables and see  how their votes are counted.    [Noli] Thank you, Mr. President, for choosing TVN to make  this announcement.</p>

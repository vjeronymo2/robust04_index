			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's economic data leave plenty of room for argument about what is actually happening to the economy. Manufacturing output in October was better than the market expected, retail trade in November, as measured by the Confederation of British Industry survey, worse. There is less room for uncertainty about November's producer price data. Input prices jumped a seasonally-adjusted 2.4 per cent, their largest monthly gain for 16 years. It is, of course, impossible to be sure how much devaluation effect is yet to be felt on input prices, but the pace of acceleration since August's 0.7 per cent fall clearly contradicts the claim that Black Wednesday would have minimal inflationary impact. How long it will take for producers to pass on the extra costs is equally uncertain. Margin pressure may be alleviated by lower unit labour costs, but industry's patience is likely to be thin. A slightly disturbing feature of yesterday's figures is the 0.6 per cent rise in output prices of food, drink and tobacco. It looks as though manufacturers are already preparing to pass on green pound devaluation costs before they are fully felt next year. Today's retail sales figures may shed more light on the real economy, especially since survey data have erred on the side of pessimism recently. It would be rash, though, to set too much store by the manufacturing output data. The monthly figures are erratic. Taking the last quarter as a whole, manufacturing output has fallen 0.2 per cent, which hardly constitutes a recovery. Indeed the nagging worry remains that incipient inflation may limit the government's ability to inject life into a disappointing recovery. That would do little for the equity market from the middle of 1993 when the authorities will also be issuing gilts hand over fist.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Cash flow squeeze tightens - Schemes may become more expensive for sponsors FOR A few years in the late 1980s it seemed to many companies that their pension schemes magically paid for themselves. But now it looks - especially after the March Budget moves on dividend taxation - as though schemes will become a lot more expensive for their corporate sponsors. This will be painful for the companies but just might bring benefits to fund managers who have often been starved of incoming money. The cash flow squeeze on the occupational pension fund sector intensified last year. According to the performance measurement specialists The WM Company, new money received last year amounted to only 1 per cent of initial market value, having steadily dropped from 12 per cent 10 years earlier, when schemes were often trying to make up accumulated deficits. Given that the average income return on pension funds in 1992 will have been of the order of 4 per cent, it is evident that the bulk of income is now being used to pay benefits. According to the latest annual survey by the National Association of Pension Funds of its member schemes, more than half the schemes reported that the employer was enjoying either a complete contribution holiday or a reduction from what would be regarded as normal contribution levels. In nearly all cases, however, the employees are continuing to contribute as usual. In a few extreme cases companies have actually negotiated a repayment of surpluses from their pension schemes. For instance, Courtaulds announced at the end of March that its scheme was 27 per cent overfunded, with a surplus of Pounds 189m. In a package deal with the trustees, benefits will be upgraded and Courtaulds will receive Pounds 50m in cash, after tax. Similar moves have been announced by Courtaulds' former subsidiary, the now-independent Courtaulds Textiles, and by Hoover. Government statistics show that new investments of occupational pension schemes amounted to Pounds 16bn in 1990, Pounds 8bn in 1991 and only about Pounds 4bn last year. Fortunately for the investment managers the existing funds have been rising in value quite fast so the total value of pension funds has been rising (reaching Pounds 370bn by the end of 1992, according to WM) even though new money has tailed off. Although investment managers have achieved high returns, this is not the main reason for the surpluses. Rather, the crucial factor has been the extraordinary buoyancy of British company dividends in the late 1980s (peaking at 18 per cent annual growth in 1989). Also, the substantial reductions in the workforces of many industrial companies earlier in the 1980s had the effect of reducing scheme liabilities. Actuarial valuations are usually based upon projected income streams rather than on market prices, and rising dividends transformed the calculations during the late 1980s. But dividend growth slowed in 1991 and came to a grinding halt in 1992. Because scheme liabilities, measured in terms ofearnings growth, will have continued to rise by 5 per cent or so, the surpluses will have been eroded slightly last year, quite apart from the impact of contribution holidays and repayments from the funds. What will happen to dividends this year? Well, most analysts believe that there will be a significant rise in company profits in 1993, perhaps of the order of 15-20 per cent, but on the other hand dividend cover is much less than it used to be. So dividends will rise only very slowly. The immediate topic of great interest, however, is the change in the advance corporation tax rules announced by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in March. In helping companies with a problem of surplus ACT that they cannot reclaim out of tax on their profits, he at the same time hit out at tax-exempt shareholders, notably pension funds. Instead of being able to claim back tax at the rate of 25 per cent on dividends, funds are now only entitled to a 20 per cent rebate. This means that whereas last year a Pounds 75 dividend could be grossed up to Pounds 100, this year it is worth only Pounds 93.75 to a pension fund. At a stroke, Mr Lamont therefore cut pension funds' gross dividend income by a proportion which works out at 6 1/4 per cent. The overall impact of this is still unclear. A very few companies have raised their dividends to compensate. Income from fixed interest securities such as the government's own gilt-edged bonds is unaffected. So although a simple calculation would suggest that the actuarial value of a pension fund's UK equity portfolio should be reduced by 6 1/4 per cent, the actuaries may make slightly more generous assumptions about dividend growth. Moreover, the 40 per cent of portfolios invested, on average, in other kinds of assets will not be affected. Realistically the overall effect could be to reduce valuations by about 3 to 4 per cent, and although in itself this is scarcely disastrous, it will bring forward the time at which full contributions must be resumed. This will bring a little more cash into portfolios, but fund managers may need to be wary of negative factors too. Might the tax breaks on pension schemes be further reduced as the government grapples with its huge fiscal deficits? If this goes too far companies might wonder whether they really need to support such large and expensive schemes. The recommendations of the Goode Committee on pension scheme law might also prove important. If it appears likely that surpluses will become the property of beneficiaries, companies will be extremely reluctant to fund their schemes generously. Underfunding could become the rule. That would, naturally, not be in the interests of the investment managers who are remunerated in proportion to the size of the portfolios. But the completion of the Goode Report has been put off until the end of September, and legislation is unlikely to follow at all quickly. For the time being the likelihood is that the cash flow into pension funds will slowly begin to recover in strength.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              ANNUAL CASH FLOW  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1983      1984      1985      1986      1987  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New money (%) of            12         9         8         7         5 initial market value  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1988      1989      1990      1991      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New money (%) of             5         5         3         3         1 initial market value  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The WM Co  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

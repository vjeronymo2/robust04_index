			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / BMW warns of 12% price rise THERE is little prospect of any significant recovery in the UK new car market next year, even if interest rates are cut quickly by another 1 or 2 percentage points, Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB) warned yesterday. Mr Purves predicted that total new car sales next year would reach only 1.6m, unchanged from 1991 and only 50,000 more than the industry expects this year. He also warned that BMW's UK prices would have to rise in about three months to compensate for the sharp fall in sterling against the D-Mark. BMW (GB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the German executive car maker, would have to increase prices by an average of 12 per cent to 14 per cent fully to compensate for sterling's 18 per cent fall since the start of the ERM crisis. Highly competitive conditions in the savagely depressed UK market meant actual increases would have to be considerably lower, Mr Purves told reporters. In some cases, cars would be produced to a lower specification if necessary to keep them below the Pounds 19,250 threshold, above which company car taxation for employees rises sharply. More than 70 per cent of BMW's UK sales are to business users. BMW's UK prices rose only a few weeks ago, by an average of 4.2 per cent , although the increases reflected higher specification on some models.</p>

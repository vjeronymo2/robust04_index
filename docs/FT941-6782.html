			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Hungary frees bond market Hungary is preparing the first domestic bond issue open to foreign investors to buy and trade freely, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The Budapest finance ministry has mandated GiroCredit, the Austrian bank, to manage the transaction, likely to be worth Ft15bn (Dollars 144m), and a date of March 28 has been pencilled in. Twin budget and current account deficits underly the decision to open the government bond market. The government has relied on selling Forint bonds to domestic investors and hard-currency bonds on international capital markets. Last year the National Bank of Hungary sold Dollars 4.5bn worth of bonds in dollars, D-Marks, Yen and other denominations. Now the government hopes to tap new sources of finance by allowing foreign funds to make a direct bet on Forint exchange and interest rates. But the finance ministry has had to overcome the NBH's aversion to an influx of foreign 'hot money' into government paper. The central bank fears movements in and out of the national currency would expose the Forint to exchange-rate speculation. East-central Europe has been flavour of the month among emerging markets funds. But the attractiveness of the forthcoming issue will depend on the Hungarian government's willingness to set a coupon sufficient to offset expectations that the Forint will depreciate by about 15 per cent this year. Several brokers who bid for the bond mandate said that the government was pricing too keenly for the foreign market. The impending issue is not the very first 'paprika bond.' One was offered in 1992 but it was divided into domestic and foreign tranches. Foreign investors, forbidden to trade with local holders and fearful of illiquidity, steered clear of the paper.</p>

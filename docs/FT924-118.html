			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses vary as holiday hiatus continues THERE was little news to drive continental markets higher in the countdown to the new year, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT flattened out in another thin session, the DAX index closing 2.38 lower at 1,542.23 and the more extreme share price variations making little sense in terms of news, rumour or fundamentals. Turnover rose to DM2.9bn from DM2.6bn. Carmakers, once again, raised eyebrows as BMW and Daimler rose by another DM3.80 to DM488.80, and DM2.50 to DM536.50 respectively. Their suppliers reflected the industry's prospects more accurately with Continental, the tyremaker, down DM5.30 to DM193.20 and Varta, the battery manufacturer, DM6 lower at DM269. Other notable gains included Viag, DM6.30 higher at DM339.80 and Thyssen, up DM2.80 at DM166, but Mr Thomas Nolten at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that some fund managers were still polishing up one or two prices for their year-end display. PARIS was boosted by arbitrage-related activity as domestic and foreign institutions continued to remain inactive due to the holiday period. The CAC-40 index closed at 1,870.28, up 12.75 and just below the day's best level of 1,874.20. Turnover remained modest at just under FFr2bn. There was little news on the corporate front, apart from the approval by shareholders of the industrial group, Matra, of the merger with the media company, Hachette. Hachette shareholders were to be asked to vote on the merger later in the day. Hachette jumped FFr3.50, or 4.2 per cent to FFr86.70 while Matra put on FFr4 to FFr194. The day's most active stock was SocGen which added FFr18 to FFr615. Pernod fell FFr9 or 2.4 per cent to FFr363. AMSTERDAM finished weaker but off the day's lows thanks to share prices reaching record levels in London. The CBS Tendency index closed at 106.5, down 0.6. KLM fell 80 cents to Fl 24.50 on fears of a European air fare war after Lufthansa's announcement that it will cut tariffs on some of its European flights from January 1. Daf dropped Fl 1.30 to Fl 8.90 after the company said that it will halve its working week for six weeks from next month. ZURICH consolidated, the SMI index easing 3.7 to 2,089.4. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the Swiss equity market is leading Europe comfortably in local currency terms and is the only European bourse with a sizeable gain in dollar terms. Swiss Volksbank continued to echo earlier takeover hopes with the shares up another SFr13 to SFr755. MILAN rose 2.4 per cent on hopes that the government was about announce a series of measures to boost investment in the stock market. The Comit index added 10.55 to 449.03 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L101.3bn. Credito Italiano, whose privatisation was announced in September, added L124 or 4.2 per cent to L3,059, while Banca Commerciale Italiana put on L160 or 3.5 per cent to L4,735. The insurance sector remained strong, with Generali gaining L550 to L29,000. MADRID featured a further fall in Santander, down Pta125 to Pta4,155, but the broad market regained its equilibrium. After a fall of over 1 per cent early in the session, the general index recovered to close only but 0.15 lower at 214.92. Acerinox and Asturiana de Zinc rose Pta110 to Pta6,340 and Pta25 to Pta1,795 after big block trades in each by Banesto on Monday. BRUSSELS saw another drop in Delhaize which took the Bel-20 index down by 4.81 to 1,128.18. Volume doubled from Monday's low level to BFr964m. Delhaize fell BFr46 or 3.4 per cent to BFr1,322 on continued worries about its US subsidiary Food Lion's expansion plans. STOCKHOLM was led lower by the pharmaceutical sector which ran into profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden general index ended 4.10 lower at 913.7 in thin turnover of SKr426m after SKr368m. Astra's B share eased SKr7 to SKr730 while the A share fell SKr7 to SKr740. VIENNA dipped in line with Frankfurt, the ATX index ending 3.43 lower at 749.43. The fibre producer, Lenzing, fell Sch28 or 4.3 per cent to Sch624, recovering from a session low of Sch611 after warning that it will cut its dividend for 1992. The paper maker, Leykam, shed Sch14 to Sch252. ATHENS continued to dissipate the recovery it had achieved in the month to mid-December. The Athens general index, which stood at 560.11 on November 18 and at 711.88 or 27 per cent better a month later, fell 17.30 to 659.89.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 29                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes**           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1084.35     1083.96     1084.01     1084.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1164.73     1163.78     1163.33     1164.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes**          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1084.18     1085.30     1086.13     1086.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1163.44     1163.91     1166.94     1167.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 24    Dec 23    Dec 22    Dec 21    Dec 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1078.93   1073.60   1072.92   1059.21   1050.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1160.29   1154.31   1157.60   1145.44   1136.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1086.70 ; 200 - 1167.91 Low/day: 100 - 1083.41  200 - 1161.41  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

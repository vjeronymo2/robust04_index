			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Euro-MPs reject a multi-speed Union The European Parliament yesterday rejected by an overwhelming majority the prospect of a multi-speed Europe, but said at the same time that if recalcitrant member states like the UK continued to block further EU integration they should be by-passed. In spite of the strong endorsement of a carefully drafted resolution, yesterday's debate highlighted the confusion and division inside the EU over the future shape and pace of integration. Yesterday's resolution was backed by the two large Socialist and Christian Democrat blocs. It addressed the ideas mooted this month by Germany's governing Christian Democrats and the French government, about a 'hard-core' of Germany, France and the Benelux countries moving faster towards economic, monetary and political integration, while their partners followed more slowly in their wake. MEPs from Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal expressed their countries' fear of exclusion, but still, in the main, backed northern MEPs' denunciation of blocking tactics by countries such as the UK. The parliament said: 'It would be inconceivable to exclude' member states ready and able to pursue integration with 'equal rights and duties'. But it warned that if a small minority of member states attempted to block all progress in 1996, ways would have to be found of allowing member states which want to pursue their efforts to achieve European integration to do so. The Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996, which will decide on the extent to which the Union must tighten its links in order to bring in new east and central European states, will still see governments in the driving seat. The resolution, alluding to recent UK government comments about a multi-speed EU, also denounced the British and Danish opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty as the root of 'dangerous speculation about an a la carte Europe', in which member states can dissociate themselves from policies they dislike.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM  </P> <P> As I read your report (Part A, Oct. 8) on the Bush Administration's go-ahead  for a $400-million loan to construct housing for Soviet Jews in Israel, I  looked up at the TV screen and watched Israeli troops gunning down fleeing  Palestinian youths and barring ambulance crews from picking up wounded  Palestinians.  </P> <P> Why is it the Israelis can shoot into civilian crowds, beat old people,  children, women, imprison men without due cause, blow up the homes of relatives  of suspected Palestinians -- in other words, trample on every right we hold  dear -- and our Congress continues to reward them with more aid? It is time  this aid be stopped.  </P> <P> PATRICIA McDONNELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

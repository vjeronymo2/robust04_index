			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank cuts rates The Bundesbank loves to tease. Certainly, the half a percentage point cut in the discount rate announced yesterday was surprising to many, at least as to timing. The first question this cut raises then is what it means. The second is whether the Bundesbank's monetary policy makes sense. One thing it shows is that the interest rate trend remains downwards. It also indicates that the rate of decline has slowed. Between early February 1993 and yesterday, the discount rate was cut by 3 percentage points. But the last cut prior to yesterday's was almost four months ago, on October 22 last year. This relatively lengthy delay is only one reason for believing the Bundesbank has become very cautious about the pace, and perhaps the extent, of easing. There are two others: first, the Lombard rate has been left at 6 3/4 per cent, so returning the spread between the two benchmark rates to 1 1/2 percentage points; second the repo rate has been left at 6 per cent, where it has been since December last year. Although the cut has given the Bundesbank room for manoeuvre, it suggests no great urgency in actually making cuts. But one benefit it gains by acting now is the ability to lower market rates of interest during any strike by the engineering workers, while avoiding publicity. The cut also demonstrates that the Bundesbank is not rigidly monetarist. With M3 growing at an annualised rate of 8.1 per cent, such a Bundesbank would have no case for easing. Aware of the problem, it argues that the monetary figures have been distorted by exceptional credit demand due to the increased taxes. Arguing away inconvenient M3 figures is no new experience for the Bundesbank. It has become an art form. At least since unification, there has been no sensible alternative. The divergence between the monetary numbers and virtually all other indicators has made that inescapable. The money numbers may be growing fast, but seasonally-adjusted consumer price inflation has fallen to an annual rate of 2 1/2 per cent over the past six months. This decline in inflation largely reflects the rapid decline in wage inflation. With industrial output in December 1993 still 11 per cent below its peak in February 1992 and showing virtually no sign of recovery, workers have little choice. Under the presidency of Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank may prove more 'pragmatic' and less 'monetarist' than under his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. But the difference from one president to the next is far more one of degree than of kind. The fundamental question, however, is whether the Bundesbank has been getting these pragmatic judgments right. With disinflationary pressures strong and the monetary stance, judged by the shape of the yield curve, no more than neutral, yesterday's cut underlines the caution of German monetary policy. Given what happened at the time of unification, that is understandable. But it looks excessive, nonetheless.</p>

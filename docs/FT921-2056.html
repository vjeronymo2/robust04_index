			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Portillo's gamble - Ballot Box Michael Portillo, the ambitious minister for local government, has stuck his neck out. While the polls suggest Labour has a fighting chance of making up ground in London, Portillo went on record yesterday forecasting that the Tories will add at least five seats in the capital to the 58 they hold. His list of likely Tory gains begins uncontroversially with Tooting: it is widely accepted that the process of gentri-fication in the constituency has given the party a chance of overturning Tom Cox's Labour majority of 1,441. It has even been whispered that Ken Livingstone might be vulnerable to attack in Brent East, where he has a majority of only 1,653. But Hammersmith, Newham South and Tottenham? Portillo's prognosis for Tottenham is that an 'unpopular' Bernie Grant, faces a stiff challenge from a 'candidate from the Greek community there with very good connections'. If Portillo is right about all of this, he really will be a man to watch. His majority in Enfield Southgate is over 18,000.</p>

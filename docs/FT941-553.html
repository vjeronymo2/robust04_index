			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Row over worker rights feared The US and developing countries were yesterday on a collision course over Washington's demand for worker rights to go on the agenda for world trade talks. After again failing to win support for their cause at a meeting of top trade negotiators in Geneva, US officials said they would continue to press the issue when ministers from more than 120 nations meet next month in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. This, many countries fear, could lead to a full-scale row at a meeting intended to underscore harmony and set the tone for increased global economic co-operation. The US wants wording in the draft ministerial declaration urging the new World Trade Organisation, which will succeed Gatt next year, to give 'early consideration' to the relationship between 'internationally recognised labour standards' and the world trading system. Barring a sudden change of heart before tomorrow, when negotiators meet formally to approve the Marrakesh documents, there will be no agreed declaration for endorsement by ministers. Washington is also blocking approval of a draft decision setting up a WTO preparatory committee unless the committee is empowered to discuss worker rights and other new issues. Speaking yesterday on behalf of the informal group of developing countries, Mr Luiz Felipe Lampreia, Brazil's Gatt ambassador, rejected the US move as 'not acceptable'. Labour standards were a matter for individual governments; attempts to link them to trade could result in protectionist measures which would jeopardise rather than enhance efforts to raise wages and social conditions. Even those sympathetic to the US cause have refused to back it over the ministerial declaration, preferring a less confrontational approach.</p>

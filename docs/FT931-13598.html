			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Latin Americans return to foreign debt markets LATIN American borrowers are starting to tap the international bond markets again after a spell out of favour late last year. While secondary market yields on Latin American bond issues have declined from their late-1992 peaks, investment bankers warn that many borrowers from this region will be forced to issue bonds at more generous yields than seen in early 1992, reflecting the tail-off in investor demand for Latin American bonds. Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state oil company, launched a five-year Dollars 125m Eurobond issue last week, the first big Latin American issue this year. The deal was well received by institutional funds and retail investors. Launched at a spread of 230 basis points over the five-year US Treasury yield, it is trading at a yield spread of 228 basis points, according to Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager. Pemex was able to borrow at tighter terms in the past, achieving a launch spread of 195 basis points over five-year Treasuries last year, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. However, yields on Latin American bond issues widened last autumn as investors realised that the international bond market was likely to be hit by an avalanche of Latin American deals. Pemex paper traded at a yield spread of 300 basis points over US Treasuries in the secondary market, according to dealers. CSFB, which was lead manager for a three-year 9 1/2 per cent bond due 1995 from Banco do Brazil, said the issue was launched at a spread of 395 basis points over US Treasuries, and is quoted at about 510-535 (offer-bid). The widening in spread reflects investor concern about the political situation in Brazil as well as the general awareness of the heavy borrowing needs of Brazilian names. Now that Pemex has tested investor appetite with a successful bond issue, investment bankers expect other Latin American borrowers to return to the market. Two other Mexican borrowers are expected to launch five-year deals - Hylsa, the steel company, and ICA, a construction group. One investment banker said that yield spreads of 550 basis points and 400 basis points respectively had been mentioned in the market, although no firm launch spreads have been announced. 'With new issues, the borrowers are going to have to accept higher launch spreads, even though there is bound to be resistance in the Mexican Finance Ministry,' said one investment banker. He said several companies needed to raise finance and therefore would be forced to return to the international capital markets, whether to launch bond, international equity or convertible bond issues. Two Argentine banks - Banco de Galicia and Banco de la Nacion - are expected to launch bond issues soon. Another potential borrower - Bancomer, one of the two large Mexican banks - was to launch a bond, with CSFB as lead manager, but announced earlier this week that the issue had been delayed. CSFB said it could not say why. However, some borrowers have stated that they were not prepared to return to the bond markets because of the less favourable conditions. The Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), would not seek fresh financing this year through bond placements on foreign markets since they were unlikely to be successful, according to a report from Reuters yesterday. PDVSA would place about Dollars 250m in bearer bonds on foreign markets, but only to pay off previous bond issues, a senior official said. 'We are looking for some new ideas, inspecting markets, but if prices stay the way they are now it would be very difficult for us to go to the Euromarket,' the official said.</p>

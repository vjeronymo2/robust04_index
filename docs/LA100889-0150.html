			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM CALIFORNIA THEY CAME, APPEALING TO A NATION TO ADDRESS HOMELESS CRISIS  </P> <P> They call doorways on opposite sides of Santa Ana's Civic Center their home,  but Pat Ford and Ruben Kronstedt were fighting more than City Hall Saturday as  they trudged through the streets -- they were challenging a nation.  </P> <P> Clutching sweaters and stroking windblown hair, the middle-aged men watched  intently, occasional grins obscured by their unshaven faces and tired eyes, as  impassioned chants rose around them.  </P> <P> Nearby, 24-year-old Stacy Brunnage, a kitchen volunteer from West Los Angeles,  chatted enthusiastically with friends and co-workers about her three-day exodus  to meet with congressional leaders and aides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Works the Crowd  </P> <P> Only steps away, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) stood perched near a California  banner that nearly stretched the width of the street. Working the crowd as only  a politician can, Bates remained distant, chatting amiably.  </P> <P> Ford, Kronstedt, Brunnage and Bates were among tens of thousands of Americans  from different walks of life and from different parts of the country who  gathered Saturday to call attention to common concerns: the crisis of  homelessness and the need for affordable housing.  </P> <P> It was a journey that many plan to make again.  </P> <P> "I didn't come here to get off the street," Ford said. "Anyone who thinks that  coming here and marching will get everyone off the street is just silly. We  will have to come back and do this again and again and again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A First Step'  </P> <P> "It's just a first step -- a beginning," observed Scott Mather, chairman of the  California Homeless Commission. The Orange County resident said the "Housing  Now!" march drew more than 1,000 participants from various activist groups in  California.  </P> <P> "I think this shows we have built a grass-roots group that believes housing --  affordable housing -- is a problem in our state," Mather said.  </P> <P> It is a problem, activists contend, that stretches beyond the visibly homeless  living in cardboard boxes.  </P> <P> "The stereotypical derelicts and winos are just the tip of the iceberg," said  Wynn Landowski, who heads the Westside Shelter Coalition in Santa Monica.  "Hopefully, this will help everyone notice it's not all people on the streets.  It's working people who can't afford rent, living in garages. It's people  living in cars who are too proud to admit they don't have a home. . . . It's  the hidden homeless.  </P> <P> "Hopefully for them," Landowski continued, "this is the second civil rights  movement."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Similar Sentiments  </P> <P> State and local officials expressed similar sentiments.  </P> <P> "Most people don't make the connection between the homeless and affordable  housing," said Ann Reiss Lane, president of the Los Angeles Board of Fire  Commissioners. "They contend that homelessness is a social problem, and housing  an economic one. I don't buy that."  </P> <P> Sylvia Easton, chairwoman of the Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, said the  federal government has long ignored the growing epidemic of homelessness.  </P> <P> "For all the talk lately about desecration of the flag being a disgrace . . .  the real desecration is all these people in the streets," said Easton, who as a  child experienced the hardships of the Great Depression. "Even in the  Depression, (homelessness) wasn't this bad. I resent bitterly how there can be  so much wealth and so much poverty."  </P> <P> The Rev. B. O. Everett, the oldest member of an entourage of homeless and  shelter volunteers from South-Central Los Angeles, agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comparison to Dog Shelters  </P> <P> "If this nation can build shelters to keep dogs off the street," Everett said,  "we ought to be able to get humans off the street."  </P> <P> Brunnage, the West Los Angeles kitchen volunteer who is employed as a  student-teacher, said homeless children are often the rule rather than the  exception.  </P> <P> "We're raising a generation of homeless," she said. "They come to school tired  and hungry . . . full of shame and embarrassment. Solutions to this are doable,  but there is that real 'not in my back yard' syndrome."  </P> <P> Rally participants pushed their way through the crowded streets to a temporary  stage constructed near the Capitol. There they heard words of hope and  encouragement from Hollywood stars and were entertained by the likes of  Jefferson Airplane, Tracy Chapman, Stevie Wonder and Los Lobos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Now, Little Optimism  </P> <P> But Ford and Kronstedt, who make their home at the Santa Ana Civic Center, were  not optimistic about quick improvements.  </P> <P> "I don't think a lot will get done until more homeless get involved with it,"  Kronstedt said. "But right now there's too much apathy and too much fear. That  will take time."  </P> <P> "Yeah," Ford said. Pointing to the Capitol building, he said: "It will take  time, but we're going to beat these people."  </P></p>

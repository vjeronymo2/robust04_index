			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["wff" report: "Commission Is Spreading Optimism"] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 12 May -- The Brussels Commission has  worked out unusually positive forecasts for the economic  development in the European Union (EU) for the discussions of  the foreign, finance, and economics ministers who will meet in  the Belgian capital next Monday [16 May]. For the first time in  years, one is optimistic again, Danish EU Commission Vice  President Henning Christophersen, who is responsible for  economic policy, said.    A good upswing is just around the corner, Christophersen  stated, pointing to his authority's forecasts, which are usually  more pessimistic than those of other international  organizations. Even if the predicted positive development does  not continue, Brussels sees good prospects that a considerable  number of member states will fulfill the most important  criterion of the Maastricht Treaty for entering the final state  of the Economic and Monetary Union in 1997- 98: current new  state debts of no more than 3 percent of GNP.    The EU economic forecast now proceeds from an EU-wide real  growth of 1.6 percent for this year and of 2.5 percent for 1995.  The upswing is primarily supported by exports and by  investments. Inflation continues to decline. Already in 1995  -- and thus one year earlier than recommended -- it could be 2-3  percent on average in the EU. Prospects on the labor market  remain somber, however. According to Christophersen, the  increase in the unemployment rate may come to a standstill  during the first half of 1995, but it will remain at the high  level of 11.75 percent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has denied his  government needs to be pressured into holding free and open  general elections on 20 March. During his usual Monday news  conference, Cristiani said he shared the Catholic Church's  criticism of the political parties' proposals which, so far,  have been vague and demagogic.    [Begin Cristiani recording] I agree with San Salvador  Archbishopric representatives who say the elections must be open  and free. I disagree with the alleged need for pressure. I  believe we all want the elections to be clean, free, honest and  crystal clear. If something is brewing that could hinder the  honesty of the elections, it should be disclosed, because I see  no need for any pressure whatsoever. [end recording]    According to Cristiani, the presence of 911 UN observers and  Supreme Electoral Tribunal delegates will guarantee the honesty  of the 20 March elections. He also described as unnecessary the  trip by a Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]  delegation to UN Headquarters to seek guarantees for the  fulfillment of the peace agreements.    [Begin Cristiani recording] I do not know what the FMLN is  going to do at the United Nations. Any time they have a problem  they have to go abroad to level complaints. We are all  Salvadorans, and there is no need to go abroad to level  complaints. The rescheduling the FMLN talks about is permanent.  [sentence as heard] We are trying to fulfill the agreements as  soon as possible, and to do so we must establish gradually dates  and deadlines. It is a permanent effort by Onusal [UN Observers  for El Salvador], the FMLN, and the government. [end recording]    Cristiani said among the delayed peace agreements are the  total deployment of the National Civilian Police, the  transference of lands, and the reformation of the judicial  system.</p>

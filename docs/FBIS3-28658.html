There have also been reports of several people  being taken to hospital as a result of violence relating to the  strike. The strike has been organized by the Vanuatu Council of  Trade Unions in support of public servants who have been on  strike for 10 weeks in a pay dispute with the government.    The news agency, PACNEWS, says all government offices in the  central capital, Port Vila, (Lugen Ville), and other government  centers have closed. Hospital outpatient departments were  closed except for emergencies and nearly all schools and fuel  stations in Port Vila and other centers were closed.  International flights in and out of Port Vila were disrupted  with one flight being canceled. The domestic airline, Van Air,  was also affected.    The vice president of the Trade Unions Council, Barton  Basiwe, said some government sympathizers had harassed strikers,  including incidents involving sticks and stands on trucks.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: ON THE BUDGET TRAIL IN LUXEMBOURG  </P> <P> Luxembourg is often overlooked as a destination. However, it's a country known  for its well-marked trails through lovely forests, and many of the trails are  linked by a network of budget accommodations.  </P> <P> Luxembourg, about the size of Rhode Island, is squeezed between France, West  Germany and Belgium. It became a grand duchy in 1354 and is Europe's last  independent duchy and the only one to become a member of the United Nations.  </P> <P> Luxembourg's youth hostel association maintains trails between its country  hostels, which are marked with white triangles. Distance between hostels is 9  to 18 miles. This year the duchy expects 12 youth hostels to be operating.  </P> <P> Individuals with International Youth Hostel Federation membership cards can  stay in dormitory accommodations in the hostels for 190 francs (about $5.40  U.S.) a night. Travelers under age 26 get a reduced rate of 170 francs.  </P> <P> Many youth hostels, including those in Luxembourg, will not let you use regular  sleeping bags on their mattresses. You must supply a sheet sleeping bag; they  will provide blankets. If you don't have a sheet sleeping bag with you, they  are available to rent for 80 francs.  </P> <P> If you don't want to hike alone, three guided trips organized by the youth  hostel association will be available next summer.  </P> <P> The eight-day trips will depart the city of Luxembourg on July 9, 16 and 23.  You will need hiking boots. The maximum size of each group is 25.  </P> <P> The price is 5,600 francs (about $173 U.S.), or 5,320 francs for those under  26. The price includes accommodations for seven nights, all meals, the services  of a guide, a topographical map, a guidebook and a youth hostel handbook,  museum entrance fees and some train transportation. You must make arrangements  to join by June 15.  </P> <P> If you prefer to travel on your own without a fixed route, you can buy a  package that includes everything in the trip except the guide. The advantage of  a do-it-yourself hiking package is that you don't have to worry about the cost  of food; all meals are included.  </P> <P> Arrangements are made for your first night's accommodation in Luxembourg, and  you choose your route from then on. You can start any day between March 1 and  Oct. 31, but must make arrangements a week in advance. The price is 4,650  francs, or 4,370 for those under 26.  </P> <P> To find out more about these programs or similar ones for cycling, horseback  riding and canoeing in Luxembourg, contact Centrale Des Auberges De Jeunesse  Luxembourgeoises at 18 Place d'Armes, B.P. 374, Luxembourg.  </P> <P> If you are traveling on a Eurailpass, you can use it to visit Luxembourg. If  you need to make transportation arrangements after you reach Luxembourg,  Voyages Soutour Tourisme de Jeunes is a travel agency geared to student-style  travelers.  </P> <P> You'll find it at 15 Place du Theatre, L-2010 Luxembourg. This is one of the  places where you can buy rail tickets for international routes; they're sold at  reduced rates to travelers under 26.  </P></p>

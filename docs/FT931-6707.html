			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Time limit on account I HAVE moved house four times since settling in Scarborough 20 years ago and have used the same pleasant, normally-efficient solicitor each time. But at the end of last year he told me apologetically that, because of an oversight, we had not been charged for our last house purchase in October 1987. We have more or less decided to pay without too much argument but would like to know if there any time limit on presenting a bill for services rendered? There is a time limit of six years from the date when the money first became due, after which the right to recover the money becomes statute-barred. As the fees will not have been due to the solicitor until the completion of your purchase, it would appear that he has realised his error just in time. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

We want to use experience gained in this field by Poland, a  country much more advanced in improving the legal system,  management and the utilization of natural resources, Yuriy  Kostenko said.    He added that the Ukrainian side is counting on Polish  experience in the creation of an environment monitoring system  and the prevention of the transfer of dangerous wastes.  "Ukraine, like Poland, has become the target place where  Western Europe and especially Germany dispose their wastes.''    Minister Zelichowski, at whose invitation Yuriy Kostenko  arrived in Poland, said that the cooperation with  Ukraine--started in 1990-- has been going smoothly.    Chief environment protection inspector Andrzej Walewski  reported that so far attempts at smuggling about 37 tons of  dangerous wastes from Germany to Ukraine have been foiled. The  Polish side has several times informed the Ukrainian side about  such attempts and about taking preventive measures.    He added that the Polish side has not allowed to transfer to  Poland about 30 tons of dangerous wastes from Ukraine.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / BMW plans workforce of 2,000 for US BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, is to hire 300 production workers in 1994 and 700 more in 1995 for its planned US car plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The company said the workforce of the manufacturing operation, its first plant in North America, would total more than 1,200 by late 1995 and would grow to 2,000 by the late 1990s. The first production workers will be recruited in January and most of those hired during 1994 will be sent for training to BMW plants in Germany. Mr Al Kinzer, president of BMW Manufacturing, said that the basic wage of a production worker at the Spartanburg plant would begin at Dollars 12 (Pounds 7.70) an hour and would rise to Dollars 16 an hour within 24 months. BMW would also pay a Dollars 100 attendance bonus for 'perfect on-time attendance' during each four-week period during the year as well as an annual company performance bonus. Gross wages for car workers are broadly comparable in Germany and in the US, but German carmakers are burdened with the highest total wage costs (gross wages plus social costs such as payroll tax) in the world motor industry. According to the German Auto Industry Federation (VDA), German carmakers have total wage costs of DM47 an hour (in December 1992), 37 per cent higher than in the US at DM34.4 an hour. Mr Kinzer said workers at the Spartanburg plant would have 10 vacation days and 13 paid company holidays. BMW said its German workers have 30 days' vacation and 13 public holidays. According to the VDA German car workers clock up only 1,483 hours a year, 27 per cent fewer than the 2,022 hours worked by a US car worker. BMW said the average gross pay for an assembly line worker at its German plants was DM24 or Dollars 15 an hour. The Dollars 400m plant was expected to begin production in the autumn of 1994 with output rising to 300 a day by end of 1996.</p>

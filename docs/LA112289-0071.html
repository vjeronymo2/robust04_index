			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY FUNDS BROWN FIELD STUDY  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Tuesday agreed to fund an $18,000 study by the  San Diego Assn. of Governments to determine whether Brown Field can be expanded  to handle takeoffs and landings of major airliners.  </P> <P> The 60-day study is expected to give the council a glimpse of whether a "dual  airport" concept, employing both Lindbergh and Brown fields for airline and  cargo traffic, is technologically feasible and merits further consideration.  </P> <P> Sandag will review a proposal for Brown drawn up by a private consultant to  expand the city-owned general aviation airport and build two runways on a  southwest-to-northeast axis.  </P> <P> Last week, the council lifted a year-old building moratorium on residential,  commercial and industrial development around Brown, virtually killing all  chances for a large binational airport on Otay Mesa along the Mexican border.  </P> <P> That move effectively leaves the dual airport solution and joint  civilian-military use of Miramar Naval Air Station as the only alternatives to  increasingly crowded Lindbergh Field. The Navy is adamantly opposed to the  second option.  </P> <P> In another action Tuesday, the council authorized City Manager John Lockwood to  begin negotiations to purchase land around the Brown Field airstrip that would  be needed to extend the runway.  </P></p>

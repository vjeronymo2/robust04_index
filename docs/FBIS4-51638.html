			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>   [Text] Washington, 22 Apr -- In an interview with a NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  [Charlene] Barshevsky, said, "There will be no change in U.S.  policy toward Japan despite a change of government in Japan" and  denied reports that the U.S. Government will soften its tough  trade stand on Japan. With regard to the question of resuming  the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, she stated:  "During his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor set some  conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks and Mr. Hata  told Mr. Kantor that he would study the conditions after  returning to Japan. We are waiting for answers from Tokyo." She  added, "If there are no answers from Japan, it would be  difficult to hold informal consultations with it to discuss ways  to resume the stalled framework talks." During the interview,  she also indicated that the U.S. Government will make a judgment  on whether Japan has honored the Japan-U.S. agreement on  government procurement in late April and work steadily to settle  the issue of individual sectors with Japan regardless of whether  the framework talks resume or not.    In the interview, she stressed that, in order for the  framework talks to be resumed, "Japan's measures for the  macroeconomic policy and the individual sectors are equally  important." As for the ratio of Japan's current account surplus  to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in the macroeconomic  policy, she said, "The U.S. Government has already asked the  Japanese Government to present not only a ratio for 1994, but a  medium-term ratio."    Commenting on the reports that the United States will soften  its tough trade stand on Japan following a change of government  in Japan, the U.S. trade official denied the reports, saying,  "They are wrong." Also commenting on the Hata-Kantor meeting,  she stated: "They failed to reach an agreement on how to  implement what both Japan and the United States agreed last July  and confirmed that the two countries are not in a situation to  hold informal consultations to discuss ways to reopen the  stalled framework talks."    In the interview, she disclosed for the first time that  "during his meeting with Mr. Kantor, Foreign Minister Hata told  Mr. Kantor that he will study the conditions offered by Mr.  Kantor for the resumption of the stalled framework talks after  returning to Tokyo," adding that "we are waiting for answers  from Tokyo." During his meeting with Foreign Minister Hata in  Morocco, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions  for resuming the stalled framework talks which included: 1)  macroeconomic policy that serves to cut Japan's huge trade  surplus; 2) expansion of Japan's imports; and 3) establishment  of an objective criteria to measure openness of the Japanese  market by individual sector.    During the interview, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  Barshevsky indicated that Japan needs to respond flexibly to all  the three conditions, and the United States places importance on  both the macroeconomic policy and the establishment of an  objective criteria as its conditions for resuming the stalled  framework talks. She stressed in the interview the importance of  the objective criteria and of preventing a misunderstanding from  spreading in Japan that the stalled framework talks can be  resumed only if Japan works out the macroeconomic policy,  taking into account Under Secretary of Treasure Summers' remark  that "the marcroeconomic policy is most effective in reducing  Japan's trade surplus."</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Israel lets Red Cross visit Palestinians ISRAEL yesterday made its first concession on the fate of 415 Palestinians expelled to south Lebanon, agreeing to allow two Red Cross officials to visit the encampment where the alleged Islamic fundamentalist militants have been stranded for three weeks in freezing conditions. The announcement came shortly before a senior UN envoy was due in Jerusalem to make a second attempt to persuade Israel to abide by Security Council Resolution 799 demanding that those expelled be allowed to return home. Premier Yitzhak Rabin was apparently trying to fend off international pressure over the expulsions by making a concession on humanitarian supplies to the 415. But there was no sign he was willing to back down on his refusal to allow the men to return. The International Committee of the Red Cross said two delegates would be allowed to travel by UN helicopter from Israeli-held territory to the encampment. But the visit would be only to assess conditions and would not include delivery of food or medicines. Lebanon has refused to allow the Palestinians to go deeper into the country or receive supplies, saying they were Israel's responsibility. Israel refuses to allow supplies through unless Lebanon does likewise. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak said they hoped the visit of Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, an adviser to Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, would lead to a breakthrough on the expulsions. Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, leader of the Palestinian negotiating team at the Washington peace talks, refused yesterday to return to the talks until those expelled were allowed home.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. Section 86.094&hyph;23 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), (c)(1) and (c)(2)(i), to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.094&hyph;23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Required data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For heavy-duty vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, evaporative emission deterioration factors for each evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system combination identified in accordance with &sect;86.091&hyph;21(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, a statement that the test procedure(s) used to derive the deterioration factors includes, but need not be limited to, a consideration of the ambient effects of ozone and temperature fluctuations and the service accumulation effects of vibration, time, vapor saturation and purge cycling. The deterioration factor test procedure shall be designed and conducted in accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the vehicles covered by a certificate issued under &sect;86.091&hyph;30 will meet the evaporative emission standards in &sect;86.091&hyph;10 and &sect;86.091&hyph;11 in actual use for the useful life of the engine. Furthermore, a statement that a description of the test procedure, as well as all data, analyses and evaluations, is available to the Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)(i) For heavy-duty vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 26,000 pounds and equipped with gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, a written statement to the Administrator certifying that the manufacturer's vehicles meet the standards of &sect;86.091&hyph;10 or &sect;86.091&hyph;11 (as applicable) as determined by the provisions of &sect;86.091&hyph;28. Furthermore, a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations and other documents, on which the above statement is based, are available to the Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 26,000 pounds and equipped with gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, a written statement to the Administrator certifying that the manufacturer's evaporative emission control systems are designed, using good engineering practice, to meet the standards of &sect;86.091&hyph;10 or &sect;86.091&hyph;11 (as applicable) as determined by the provisions of &sect;86.091&hyph;28. Furthermore, a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations and other documents, on which the above statement is based, are available to the Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Emission data, including in the case of methanol fuel, methanol, formaldehyde and organic material hydrocarbon equivalent, exhaust methane data in the case of vehicles meeting a non-methane hydrocarbon standard on such vehicles tested in accordance with applicable test procedures and in such numbers as specified. These data shall include zero-mile data, if generated, and emission data generated for certification as required under &sect;86.090&hyph;26(a)(3)(i) or &sect;86.090&hyph;26(a)(3)(ii). In lieu of providing emission data the Administrator may, on request of the manufacturer, allow the manufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous emission tests, development tests or other information) that the engine will conform with certain applicable emission standards of &sect;86.094&hyph;8 or &sect;86.094&hyph;9. Standards eligible for such manufacturer requests are those for idle CO emissions, smoke emissions, or particulate emissions from methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle certification vehicles, on evaporative emissions or refueling emissions from natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles (light-duty and heavy-duty), and those for particulate emissions from model year 1994 and later gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle certification vehicles that are not certified to the Tier 0 standards of &sect;86.094&hyph;9 (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), or &sect;86.094&hyph;8(a)(1)(i). Also eligible for such requests are standards for total hydrocarbon emissions from model year 1994 and later certification vehicles that are not certified to the Tier 0 standards of &sect;86.094&hyph;9 (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) or &sect;86.094&hyph;8(a)(1)(i). By separate request, including appropriate supporting test data, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator also waive the requirement to measure particulate emissions when conducting Selective Enforcement Audit testing of Otto-cycle vehicles, or the requirement to measure evaporative emissions when conducting Selective Enforcement Audit testing of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Emission data on such engines tested in accordance with applicable emission test procedures of this subpart and in such numbers as specified. These data shall include zero-hour data, if generated, and emission data generated for certification as required under &sect;86.090&hyph;26(c)(4). In lieu of providing emission data on idle CO emissions, smoke emissions or particulate emissions from methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel certification engines, or on CO emissions from petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, or methanol-fueled diesel certification engines the Administrator may, on request of the manufacturer, allow the manufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous emission tests, development tests or other information) that the engine will conform with the applicable emission standards of &sect;86.091&hyph;11, or &sect;86.094&hyph;11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Du Pont turns in Dollars 230m loss amid shake-up RESTRUCTURING and debt redemption charges caused a Dollars 230m fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, the leading US chemicals group. For the whole of 1992, Du Pont saw its underlying income before charges slump to Dollars 975m from Dollars 1.4bn in 1991. The company, however, suffered a full-year net loss of Dollars 3.9bn, or Dollars 5.85 per share, after recording Dollars 5.1bn of special charges related to changes in accounting standards concerning employee benefits and income taxes. Du Pont, which is engaged in a sweeping two-year reorganisation that involves asset sales, management changes and redundancies, said the full-year 1992 results included Dollars 463m of charges related to restructuring. This charge also took in cost reduction programmes and payments made in relation to the recall of Benlate, a fungicide. Full-year after-tax operating income - excluding the impact of accounting charges - was Dollars 326m for the chemicals division, up from Dollars 300m in 1991. The fibres division had Dollars 582m of such income, up from Dollars 561m in 1991. The polymers business earned Dollars 415m, up from Dollars 249m, and the Conoco petroleum business saw profits drop to Dollars 480m from Dollars 854m in 1991. Diversified businesses earned Dollars 241m against Dollars 197m in 1991. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 9.3bn, down from Dollars 10bn. Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 37.8bn, 2 per cent higher than 1991 after adjustments were made to reflect a new joint venture in coal. Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chairman, said business conditions in the US continued to be difficult during 1992. He said there was also a significant weakening in markets outside the US during the latter part of last year, particularly in Europe. Mr Woolard said that once accounting and other non-recurring charges were stripped out, earnings for the full year were nearly equal to 1991 levels, despite the poor operating environment. He added that significant gains in the polymers and diversified businesses helped to offset the downturn in petroleum earnings. Looking ahead, the Du Pont chairman said cost reduction and restructuring efforts - including recently announced plans to control employee health care expenses - were improving the company's global competitive position. He added that prospects in 1993 would depend largely on the rate of worldwide economic recovery and continued progress in cutting costs. On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price before the close was Dollars 46, down by Dollars  1/8 . Union Carbide, the Connecticut-based chemicals group, reported Dollars 17m of net income in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 63m in the same quarter of 1991. Net profits for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 107m, against a loss of Dollars 135m in 1991.</p>

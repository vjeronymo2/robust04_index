			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> BID AWARDED FOR SCALED-DOWN SCHOOL  </P> <P> A bid for construction of a scaled-down middle school in Fillmore was awarded  Tuesday night to Shirley Brothers, Pasadena contractor.  </P> <P> Construction is scheduled to begin Oct. 8.  </P> <P> After a staff recommendation, the Fillmore Unified School District board  accepted the lowest of eight bids to build a gymnasium and bleachers for  $3,295,000, about $5,000 less than the amount budgeted for the project.  </P> <P> A pavilion included in the design would cost an additional $170,000 if built by  Shirley Brothers.  </P> <P> The board voted to use interest from the $3.4-million middle school fund and  developer fees to allow the pavilion to be built at the same time as the  gymnasium.  </P> <P> The project should be completed within a year.  </P> <P> Funding is urgently needed for classrooms, library and offices that would  complete the middle school, according to district officials, who have said  crowding is severe and worsening in Fillmore's schools.  </P> <P> Last year, voters rejected an $8-million bond issue to build the entire school.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Shell confirms key role for Woodside Woodside, the publicly-quoted Australian oil and gas company, is to remain an important part of Shell's upstream operations in spite of recent changes in Woodside's ownership structure. Mr Ric Charlton, chairman and chief executive of Shell Australia, said yesterday that Shell had no intention of reducing its interest in Woodside, which gives Shell enlarged access to the North West Shelf, Australia's largest oil and gas project. Earlier this month, Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, severed its ties with Woodside by selling its remaining 10 per cent interest. This consisted of 4.5 per cent owned directly and half of an 11 per cent stake owned jointly with Shell. Shell also sold its half of that stake, rather than have to own it with a new partner. This reduced Shell's stake from 40 per cent to 34.27 per cent, prompting speculation that it was planning a gradual divestment. But Mr Charlton was enthusiastic about prospects for the North West Shelf project based around the liquefied natural gas plant at Karratha. Woodside is the operator of the project, in which Shell also has a one-sixth direct interest. Other acreage owned by Woodside off Australia's north-west coast provided opportunities for expansion of production of oil and liquid petroleum gas, and further capacity would come on stream over the next two years. Mr Charlton said Woodside had recently made a promising oil find in the Timor channel. Mr Charlton said Shell Australia's restructuring had left it more robust, and closer to its target of a 15 per cent return on capital employed. Last year, Shell Australia earned 9.3 per cent on capital, which Mr Charlton said was unsatisfactory. Since then, the company has floated off its metals interests in a new public company, Acacia, and cut its workforce by one-fifth. The resulting savings will help reduce gearing from 42 per cent in 1993 to 15-20 per cent by the end of this year. Shell has modernised Geelong, one of its two refineries in Australia, raising its already dominant share of the domestic gasoline market. The company's strong cash position will enable it to take advantage of purchase opportunities.</p>

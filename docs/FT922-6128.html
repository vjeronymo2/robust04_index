			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Deere remains pessimistic after weak second quarter DEERE &amp; Co, the US equipment maker, continued to struggle with a sluggish worldwide market for agricultural and construction machinery. For its second quarter, ended April 30, it reported net income of Dollars 44m, or 58 cents a share, sharply down from Dollars 73.1m, or 96 cents, in the same period last year. Worldwide sales and revenues decreased 3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.93bn. The operating results reflect lower production and sales volumes, partly because of the poor market and partly because of the company's efforts to reduce inventories. Buyer incentives remained high, given competition in the industry, and these promotions cut into margins. While the second-quarter results were an improvement on the net loss of Dollars 19.9m, or 26 cents a share, during the first quarter, Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, warned that the company's outlook this year for the equipment market was 'less positive'. Deere will thus reduce its production tonnage by 7 per cent this year compared with last year's levels. While farm and industrial equipment accounted for about 70 per cent of the company's second-quarter sales, lawn and grounds care equipment sales were the only bright spot, picking up by 21 per cent to Dollars 261m from Dollars 216m last year. Second-quarter results in Deere's other divisions fared better. Net income of its credit operations rose to Dollars 25.8m from Dollars 22.1m last year and net income from insurance and healthcare operations was Dollars 10.9m, up marginally from Dollars 10.4m a year ago. Worldwide net income in the first six months was Dollars 24.1m, or 32 cents a share, compared with net income of Dollars 30m, or 39 cents, last year. Net sales and revenues for the first six months were Dollars 3.31bn, down 2 per cent from Dollars 3.36bn.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Railing Jason Villagers of Little Chart Forstal in Kent - through which the Channel tunnel rail link is scheduled to run - have a secret weapon to help them fight the railwaymen. They've recruited actor David Jason, the irascible Pa Larkin in the TV version of HE Bates's bucolic novel, The Darling Buds of May, to their campaign. If he fails to stop the trains, then HE Bates's widow Madge, now in her 80s, will be pressed into service.</p>

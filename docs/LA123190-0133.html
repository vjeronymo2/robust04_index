			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: RULING IN BUCHWALD SUIT SHAKES STUDIO SYSTEM TO ROOTS  </P> <P> IN THE SUMMER of 1989, this column wrote that the columnist Art Buchwald was  going to sue Paramount for a share of profits from the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming  to America." As you know, Buchwald did, and recently Judge Harvey Schneider  ruled in Los Angeles that Paramount must pay Art and Alain Bernheim damages.  (This ruling shook the studio system to its dark roots and threatens a real  upheaval in Hollywood.)  </P> <P> Buchwald tells me that there will no doubt be appeals and more appeals after  the amount of money has been fixed. ("Coming to America" earned more than $300  million, based on a treatment Buchwald and Bernheim sold to Paramount.) "My  fear is that my grandchildren will see the money -- not me!" says Art. Added  the funny man: "The part I like best about the entire thing is that Paramount's  lawyers, from the beginning, have kept calling me a 'crybaby!' They said I  signed a contract and then cried after I didn't like the terms. Now they are  the ones who are crying the hardest. The Hollywood trade papers even announced  that Paramount had canceled its Christmas party this year because of the  judge's decision. Now that is carrying things too far. I am very upset if they  canceled Christmas."  </P> <P> THE OFFBEAT Gary Oldman has portrayed some unusual, creative real-life souls --  rocker Sid Vicious in the movie "Sid and Nancy" and the self-destructive gay  playwright Joe Orton in "Prick Up Your Ears." Now this hugely talented Briton  plans to assay another literary genius on the downhill slide. He will portray  the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in a film to be directed by David Drury. This  movie, which begins filming in January, co-stars Mrs. Gary Oldman -- actress  Uma Thurman. She'll be Caitlin Thomas, the wife of Dylan. Shooting takes place  both in New York City, where Thomas died of drink and poor medical attention  back in 1953, and in his hometown of Laugharne.  </P> <P> Happy New Year!  </P></p>

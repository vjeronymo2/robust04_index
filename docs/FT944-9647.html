			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Independent schools say exam tables omit 5% of pupils Independent schools yesterday claimed that government 'league tables' of academic performance to be published next week will omit at least 5 per cent of their pupils. They complained that rankings of the percentage of pupils passing five GCSE exams with a grade C or better (equivalent to an old O-level pass) would therefore be inaccurate. However, a few schools benefit. St Mary's, a girls' boarding school in Ascot, is credited with a pass rate of 117 per cent. The discrepancies were caused by the Department for Education's decision to publish only the results achieved by candidates whose 16th birthday fell during the academic year 1993/94. If pupils take them early, they are counted in the year they eventually reach the age of 16  - as happened at St Mary's. If they take them late, their results are never counted. The Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) said pass rates should instead be measured across a school's year groups, with 'over-age' candidates counted in the year when they attempted the exams. Isis found 61 schools with GCSE results that had been understated by 10 percentage points or more. Several prestigious boarding schools have a much lower pass rate under the government's assumptions than when all of the pupils attempting GCSE are taken into account. For example, only 86.5 per cent of Harrow School's 16-year-old pupils reached the five-GCSE figure, according to the government. When Isis measured this by year group, rather than age group, Harrow had a pass rate of 99.4 per cent - a discrepancy of 12.9 percentage points. Other well-known boarding schools whose GCSE pass rates were sharply understated included Gresham's (88 rather than 100 per cent), Haileybury (86.7 per cent rather than 98.9 per cent), Stowe (78.6 rather than 93.7 per cent), and Uppingham School (81.8 rather than 92.6 per cent). Isis said there were a 'variety of good reasons' why candidates took exams late: 'They may have moved schools at a crucial stage: they might be late developers; some may be only a matter of weeks, even days, outside the qualifying age range.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Destination Nowhere"] </F>   [Text] That the Air Corporation Act, 1953, setting up a  monopoly in airline services within the country has been  repealed is welcome in principle but doubts persist over the  Government's motives. The creation of Indian Airlines Ltd and  Air India Ltd has been hanging in the air since May 1992, when  the appropriate Bill was introduced in Parliament, but not  pursued. Now the deed is done by Ordinance, bypassing  Parliament, an entirely avoidable and thoroughly objectionable  procedure. The Government needs to be reminded that the  Ordinance-making power is reserved for special circumstances and  must be used with care. No reasons have been given but it is  quite clear that the urgency is only to collect some big money,  and quickly, to make up for the massive fiscal deficit the  Government has run up this year. If a proper debate had been  allowed in the passage of the Bill through Parliament, not only  would adverse inferences not been drawn but it would have  blundered the opposition to the Ordinance, now building up. It  would also have helped the Government to make up its mind on how  to go about the privatization and what to do with the proceeds.  The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry wants the  Government to set up a Ministry for Privatization to ensure a  well-structured policy on selection, degree and time frame for  the privatization plan. It is a mistake to assume that a proper  plan can only be made by a separate Ministry; a stronger  objection is that a Ministry once created tends to be permanent  and continues long after its need has passed. But the problem  clearly has to be tackled. No homework has been done, details of  the pricing policy are not known, and the mechanism for the sale  of equity unclear. The last time round the disinvestment of  public sector equity got mired in unsavoury allegations  featuring the Allahabad Bank and a set of brokers. The entire  business was severely criticized by the Public Accounts  Committee. A strategy of openness would be advisable now,  especially when the goings on in the financial sector are so  murky.    Essentially, privatization should result in efficient  management; it is not intended to be used to fund the continued  profligacy of an unrepentant Government. The National Renewal  Fund, which privatization was supposed to support, has gone  awry, while workers have had to accept retrenchment or continue  to remain in service without pay. There are another 47 public  sector units under the Board for Industrial and Financial  Reconstruction, which face a bleak future because nobody quite  knows the gameplan. The only thing that is clear is that there  is dash for cash before February 28. With vision so myopic, the  repeal of this Act may not mean any meaningful change in the  maharaja-style attitudes of the two airlines. Unless the nation  is vigilant, the exercise may only provide the wherewithal to  sustain the maharaja-style bureaucracy, while the airliners  continue to land in pools of deep red ink.</p>

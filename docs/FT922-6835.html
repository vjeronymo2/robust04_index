			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Patagonia/The Fastest Clock in the Universe - Theatre Telling your own history is an important way of showing that you have some pride in yourself. Patagonia, presented by the Welsh group Brith Gof, is less about that distant land than about the 153 Welsh settlers who sailed there in 1865 and whose descendants remain there, still speaking Welsh - mixed with Spanish and a little English - holding eisteddfodau, singing festivals and Welsh newspapers. Part documentary, part performance art, Patagonia does honour to both Wales and to pioneers. Its first parts remind me a lot of Martha Graham's greatest work, the 1944 Appalachian Spring. Like that, this shows the bare frame of a new homestead against an open sky, the two women and two men of the new community, their relationships and the religious practices they have brought with them. But Patagonia is not a dance work, and it celebrates to a considerable degree the way these Welsh Patagonians have kept the Welsh language alive. I have no Welsh, but hearing the musicality of this Welsh, whether in speech or in song, was one of the evening's pleasures. This work is about history, the development of a community through the generations and its commemoration of its past. We not only see and hear the rites and customs of these emigres, we hear detached commentary too. A narrator figure - who sits, with his back to us, at the front of the auditorium, using the front of the stage as his desk - and the four onstage performers tell isolated stories of specific families and their houses. We hear how 'She is the museum. Women always carry the history,' how even these Welsh became 'true conquistadors,' how 'In a land where nothing rots, history spreads itself,' and how one of these stories was told to (among others) Bruce Chatwin and became chapter 17 of his In Patagonia. All of this is affecting and stimulating, and the simple elegance of the staging is often marvellous. The four-part singing is excellent, the speaking has dignity, the main gestures have breadth and power. The use of sand on the floor provides a source of beautifully ambiguous symbolism - sand as locale, sand as time, sand as omnipresent intrusion. Best is the way that the staging frequently shows us two or more acts at the same time or in quick succession. There are, however, a few longueurs, even though the work lasts only 70 minutes. Certain inventories of local life become ponderous, and the slow-motion treatment of one dramatic episode manages to be both dull and obscure. But Patagonia, a frequently poetic work, won my immediate respect and interest. Brith Gof is a group new to me; I hope to encounter more of its work before long. It is the first offering in the excellent three-week Barclays New Stages season at the Royal Court, which presents some of Britain's leading work in performance art, new dance and/or music theatre. Philip Ridley's new play at the Hampstead Theatre until June 13 is short and sour, variably funny and intermittently gripping. In outline the scenario might suggest Joe Orton, but neither the writing nor the sentiments echo that cheerful subversive at all. Structurally, the play is much nearer to Pinter's Birthday Party - and not only because Ridley's centrepiece too is a sinister party. Here, the birthday is Cougar Glass's 'nineteenth': we gather he has had several of those already. He lives with his sugar-daddy 'Captain Tock', a cultivated, tragically balding antique dealer who likes clocks (Cougar hates them, and cultivates nothing but his quiff and his artifical tan). The parties are a device for luring beddable youths home; in due course the Captain will make an excuse and leave. The latest unknowing prey is Foxtrot Darling (Ridley's way with names is all his own), for whom Cougar has become a a big-brother substitute. Foxtrot arrives with not only a deeply unwelcome birthday gift, but his pregnant fiancee Sherbet Gravel too; they call each other 'Babe' indiscriminately. The Captain decides to remain, while Cougar leaves off his languid macho preening and goes into a long, silent seethe. Sherbet soon sizes up the situation all too well, and her bright chat turns again and again to reflections upon mortality. Eventually there is a ghastly eruption, staged for maximum theatrical impact by the director Matthew Lloyd. Jonathan Coy (I think that is his real name) plays the Captain with some delicacy, if slightly too much hair, and Con O'Neill (ditto) seethes well. The kids are expertly cartooned by Jude Law, the lamb to the slaughter, and clever Emma Amos. As tough old Cheetah Bee, the landlady of this semi-converted factory (picturesquely devised by Moggie Douglas), Elizabeth Bradley makes the most of her two appearances with Zimmer frame. They all give the play a grounding in a plausible East End reality which Ridley's text barely suggests, dreamily abstract as it often is. Curious exercise] If it bears a moral, it seems too obvious to mention; but perhaps there is a real-life Cougar out there somewhere, who is meant to be pilloried here.</p>

He said he had agreed  with the proposed reorganization of ministries, personnel  changes to the cabinet and the leadership of some ministries and  authorities in regions and in the capital    President Nazarbayev believes that "new, younger people  having a good idea of what business and economic reform are  about have joined the Cabinet". In particular, he emphasized  the appointment of 40-year-old Kozykorpesh Yesenberlin as  Chairman of the State Property Committee and 32-year-old  Galymzhan Zhakiyanov as head of the Semipalatinsk regional  administration.

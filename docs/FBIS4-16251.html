			<p>BFN     [Text] The agreement signed by Belarus and Russia on 12  April to unify the two states' monetary systems immediately  attracted great attention in the media. What is perhaps most  interesting, is the difference in interpretations of these  developments by various journalists. For example, Belarusian  mass media reported that the document was signed by all members  of the Belarusian delegation. According to Moscow reports, the  document was not signed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman  Stanislaw Bahdankevich. To clarify the situation and the stand  of the Belarusian National Bank, a BELINFORM reporter tried to  urgently contact Stanislaw Bahdankevich. This was not easy due  to the schedule of the chief Belarusian banker, and the  BELINFORM reporter failed to reach him. However, BELINFORM has  learned that Stanislaw Bahdankevich held an urgent meeting of  the Belarusian Bank Board during which members of the board  declared their support for the agreement, though the decision  came with difficulty. The situation of the phantom signature  was also clarified. Stanislaw Bahdankevich signed the agreement  on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems, but with reservations. The point is that clause No. 5  of the agreement, saying that all assets and liabilities of the  Belarusian National Bank should be transferred to the Russian  Central Bank, contradicts the Belarusian Constitution.    At 1330 today at the Belarusian National Press Center, Prime  Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich will hold a news conference on the  results of the visit by the Belarusian delegation to Moscow and  the signing of the monetary unification agreement.</p>

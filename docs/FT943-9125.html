			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Zaire's ministers 'paid Dollars 14,500 a month' Zaire's previous government paid its ministers salaries of Dollars 12,500 to Dollars 14,500 a month despite a financial crisis and grinding poverty, a report ordered by Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, the new prime minister, says. The salaries would be generous in a western country but in Zaire, where a government clerical worker earns 17,000 zaires (Dollars 12) a month and an ordinary soldier gets 5,000 zaires, they are stratospheric. The report, passed to Reuters and confirmed by ex-ministers, also says paymasters in the government of former prime minister, Mr Faustin Birindwa, actually drew between two and three times the authorised salaries from the Bank of Zaire and pocketed the difference before paying the cabinet. Mr Kengo, appointed in June to head a government of national unity, has promised to put an end to the corrupt practices that dogged past administrations and to halt Zaire's financial collapse. In Zaire, state office is traditionally viewed as an opportunity for amassing personal wealth, a fact President Mobutu Sese Seko has publicly acknowledged. According to the document, dated July 26 and compiled by a former member of Mr Birindwa's cabinet, deputy ministers were paid Dollars 12,500 a month, ministers Dollars 13,500 and deputy prime ministers Dollars 14,500. No figure is given for Birindwa. The payments were awarded at a time when Zaire was nursing foreign debts of Dollars 9.5bn and was shortly to have its voting rights at the International Monetary Fund suspended for non-payment of arrears. Local economists estimate the budget deficit for the first six months of 1994 at around Dollars 60m. Former members of Mr Birindwa's government confirmed the details given in the report on Thursday, but said that during its 14 months in office only nine pay cheques were delivered. They also revealed how the inner circle in charge of payments made further profits. Salaries were paid in zaires at an exchange rate chosen arbitrarily by Mr Birindwa, which was well below the market level, often halving the final dollar value.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Inefficiency pushes down Hungary's industrial output RECESSION in Hungary - and throughout eastern Europe - cut the country's industrial output by more than a fifth last year as big, inefficient enterprises suffered in the difficult switch to market economics, according to official data released yesterday, Reuter reports from Budapest. The Central Statistical Office found that enterprises with more than 50 workers produced 21.5 per cent less last year than in 1990, when output dropped 8.5 per cent. The sharp decline reflects the collapse of the communist trading bloc, Comecon, which once absorbed the bulk of Hungary's exports, and falling domestic demand. Many small companies have sprung up in the past year but their output has barely dented the overall slump that has pushed unemployment above 8.5 per cent. But exports were worth more than Dollars 10bn last year and the government says they could grow another 8-10 per cent this year as links with developed countries improve.</p>

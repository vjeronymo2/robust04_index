			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Johannes Ludewig, head of the department of </F> economic and financial policy in the chancellery, by Stefan  Baron and Friedrich Thelen; place and date not given: "There Is  No Alternative'"]    [Text] Johannes Ludewig is Helmut Kohl's most trusted  economic adviser. From 1967 to 1971 he studied economics in  Hamburg; in 1972 he was awarded a Master of Science degree by  Stanford University in California. Two years later he was  awarded his doctorate with the thesis: "Basic Structures for  Simulated Models of Whole Enterprises." He then aided FDP [Free  Democratic Party] economics ministers for eight years, until he  moved to the Chancellor's Office in 1983. Eight years later he  became head of the ministerial department of economic and  finance policy.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Ludewig, people used to believe the  SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] did not know how to  handle money; today they are said to have as much financial  competence as the government. What did you do wrong?    [Ludewig] The financial competence of an opposition leader  who cannot differentiate between gross and net is nothing to  write home about. And take a look at the economic situation in  the Saarland, which is governed by the chief economics  spokesperson for the opposition! Where is the competence there?    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When the CDU [Christian Democratic  Union]/FDP coalition took over government in 1982 it promised  the population a free-market renewal.    [Ludewig] Wait a minute! Railway reform, postal reform, the  law on genetic engineering, the law governing working hours,  health care reform--is that not something? By 1989 we had  reduced taxes by 50 billion marks [DM], had reduced the ratio of  public expenditure to GNP by almost 45 percent, and had created  three million new jobs.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] We are writing this in 1994.    [Ludewig] True. But in 1989 German unification created a  fundamentally different situation. We had to first create the  conditions under which private capital would flow to the east,  for example via a massive renewal of the infrastructure. Thus,  an associated temporary increase in the ratio of public  expenditure to GNP was unavoidable.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] The decisive issue in the Bundestag  elections in the fall will be the high rate of unemployment. And  in this area the Federal Government has not exactly covered  itself with glory. The result of 12 years of Kohl is 4 million  unemployed.    [Ludewig] That is unfair. Despite the current recession,  during which approximately a million jobs have been lost, at  this time we are registering a comparatively high rate of  employment. We have more jobs in Germany today than we did in  1989, before unification, and during the past four years we have  experienced an afflux of 4.5 million people. Late repatriates,  asylum-seekers, and refugees from what was formerly Yugoslavia.  We have to deal with this first.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So you are completely confident that the  unemployment rate will drop soon?    [Ludewig] The competitiveness of German industry has already  improved. So our chances of achieving an increase in employment,  as was the case during the eighties, are good. Perhaps not as  much in industry as in the services sector.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Even as the tax burden becomes more and  more oppressive?    [Ludewig] Wolfgang Schaeuble has already given the answer to  this in WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE: The total tax burden cannot be  increased.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Then where would you get the  approximately  DM40 billion it will cost to implement the Constitutional Court  ruling that states that lawmakers must make the minimum standard  of living tax free?    [Ludewig] Obviously that will not be easy. It will have to  be  financed gradually, following a reasonable timetable.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Many lawyers consider a graduated  settlement unconstitutional.    [Ludewig] I do not choose to comment on that at this time.  We  will present a plan in the summer, as announced.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] And that will be just another bit of  patchwork! This government, which took office with the promise  of a free-market renewal, has never mustered the courage to weed  out our tax jungle according to free-market criteria.    [Ludewig] First of all the government has taken action in  this area as well: Over the past four years it has reduced the  number of tax breaks and special tax regulations in the amount  of DM40 billion. But the fact remains: Tax simplification is a  task that is high on the political agenda.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] A few months ago the federal chancellor  announced a joint offensive. This has not been mentioned since  then.    [Ludewig] We are working on that. You will be hearing of it  soon.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If you again receive a majority of votes  you will again do nothing at all for quite some time. This  government did not awaken until a crisis arose, until the  possibility of its reelection began to be questioned.    [Ludewig] That is not entirely true, however you have raised  an important issue: What will happen when we emerge from the  recession, when we have positive growth rates, and when the  increase in unemployment levels off? Can we then return to  business as usual, can we then lean back again? That would be  fatal. We still have much to do. The list of jobs we have made  for ourselves, including the future business location program  and the 30-point program, has not yet been completed, and I am  doubtful as to whether we have actually come so far compared  with other countries that we can in good conscience march out to  greet the year 2000. Work on this agenda should continue,  consistently and with perseverance.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is a different government not the best  defense against business as usual?    [Ludewig] No one seriously believes that on important  strategic issues such as German unity or international  competetiveness there would have been, or is, any real  alternative to our policy. If the opposition itself can think of  nothing definitive, our policy cannot have been so misguided.</p>

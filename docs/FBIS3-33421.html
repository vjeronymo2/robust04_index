The employees, who have been staging partial  strikes for the past two weeks, requested Parlacen's mediation.    The Parlacen Information Office reported the commission  members are: Guatemalan Deputies Vinicio Cerezo, Eduardo Meyer,  and Manuel Conde and Marco Tulio Castillo, who is a Honduran and  president of the [Parlacen] labor, union, and social issues  commission.    Parlacen President Jose Francisco Guerrero, a Salvadoran,  met  with the government employees who had requested the mediation  and offered to talk to Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio.    The request for Parlacen's mediation, which the executive  still has not yet accepted, is another action taken by the  strikers to pressure the government into accepting their demands  for a 40-percent wage hike.    Approximately 30 leaders of the National Federation of State  Workers Unions (Fenasteg), which represents approximately  180,000 employees, remain in the government office waiting to  meet with De Leon Carpio, who is not at the Presidential Palace.  Fenasteg Secretary Armando Sanchez has said they will not  abandon the palace or allow personnel to enter or leave the  building until they get a positive response.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] On 27 May, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reports  on page 4 the following in its business section:    On the halt to delivery of goods from Thailand in the wake  of  the burning on the Cambodian side of the Poipet border market,  the paper says some goods from the market arrived in Phnom Penh  on 23 and 24 May. Recently, Cambodian and Thai provincial-level  delegations held talks on reopening the border pass, but they  were not able to arrive at a decision. Reopening the Poipet  market is vitally important because commodity prices in Phnom  Penh markets have gone up exorbitantly since it closed.    Concerning a new 10% tax on rents collected from houses  rented to foreigners or international organizations, the paper  quotes an official at a Phnom Penh tax office as saying the tax  will be implemented in early June. According to the municipal  tax office, the reason the Finance Ministry has imposed the tax  is, that collecting taxes on rent earned from renting houses to  foreigners, doing business, or working in Cambodia was extremely  difficult in the past as most landlords were unwilling to pay.    As for the planned exportation of Angkor beer, the daily  quotes Jame Fong, marketing manager of the Malaysian Cambrew  company producing and distributing Angkor beer, as saying that  next year the company will start exporting the beer to Japan,  other Asian countries, the United States, Australia, France, and  Great Britain.    Commenting on the currency exchange market in Phnom Penh,  the  paper says that since the announcement of the king's departure  on 18 May, the rate of the Cambodian currency has begun to swell  from 2,590 to 2,600 riels a dollar. Between 22 and 25 May, $1  could fetch as much as 2,645 riels. The precipitous decrease in  the value of the riel, it adds, is caused by the political  situation, which has become confused since a demonstration was  planned to disrupt the National Assembly and since fighting  erupted in various provinces.    On the expansion of Shell oil company operations, REAKSMEI  KAMPUCHEA says the firm has spent $6 million to rent and restore  a fuel depot in Sihanoukville. In the past few months, the  paper continues, Shell signed with Cambodian Airlines an  agreement on construction of a $3-million fuel depot at  Pochentong Airport for storing aviation fuel. Shell has also  been building service stations along all national routes.</p>

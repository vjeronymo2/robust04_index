			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Case for EC-wide cuts in tax Let us consider a dynamic economy, such as Japan 20-30 years ago, or some of the east Asian 'tigers' today, whose trend growth rate is not far from 10 per cent a year. For such countries a growth rate of 5 per cent represents recession and one of zero a slump. Although different numbers apply to the more sluggish European economies, the principles are the same. If the trend growth rate is about 3 per cent a year, then an achieved rate of, say, 1 1/2 per cent represents continued deterioration. The British Treasury made a great song and dance about the continued gradual rise in real gross domestic product shown by the Central Statistical Office's newly devised preliminary snapshot for the third quarter - an indicator which, with a heavy dose of political interpretation, took up most of last Friday's front page in the Evening Standard. Let us, however, assume that this estimate is not revised substantially in either direction. What it shows is that non-oil real GDP has been growing by about 1.8 per cent a year since the end of 1992. (The Treasury is entitled to exclude the highly volatile oil component to measure the underlying movement. But it must be held to this convention, even when it would suit it to take GDP including oil.) The main point, however, is that an annual growth rate of 1.8 per cent is well below most estimates of the trend growth of UK productive capacity. What has been happening can be described as an incomplete recovery, a weak recovery or even a worsening depression. The best term is the American 'growth recession'. What this means is that output is rising modestly, but employment is still falling and the degree of slack increasing. The same errors are being committed at a European level. The European Commission is forecasting a Community recovery with output rising by 1 per cent to 2 per cent in 1994. A similar prospect is held in store by a majority of the German economic forecasting institutes, with one strong dissentient. But even if the mainstream view is right, European unemployment will continue to increase, together with unused capacity; and the atmosphere of gloom, doom and protectionism will increase until growth recovers to the 3 per cent or so break-even point required before slack can be absorbed. Much of the fashionable talk about growth in itself not bringing more jobs simply reflects the fact that growth is insufficient, even bearing in mind the need to prevent inflation from breaking out again. Meanwhile, I could, if anyone were listening, help defuse a disagreement between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, and Mr Jaques Delors, the EC president. The latter would like more public infrastructure spending to create jobs. Mr Clarke replies that it is not governments' task to spend to create demand. But it is their task, chancellor, it is - interpreting 'governments' broadly to include central banks as well as finance ministers. Demand management has been discredited because it was conducted in the past without regard to inflation. But that is no excuse for throwing out the baby with the bath water. Policies to raise demand need not involve increased government spending or increasing the state's role in the economy. The basic Keynesian equations show that an increase in private spending is just as good as an increase in the government variety in promoting output and employment - Keynes's own prejudices about infrastructure notwithstanding. The one, narrow-minded and disgracefully protectionist argument for preferring the government variety is that a higher proportion of private spending 'leaks' into imports. But the whole virtue of a European-wide approach is that these leakages cancel each other out. What this is leading up to is that a European-wide tax cut would be as good from the demand stimulation point of view as Mr Delors' infrastructure spending; and it would be better from the point of view of supply-side incentives and the signals it would send out. Life, of course, is never that simple; and with so many countries suffering from structural deficits, a low-tax strategy could in some places - although I hope not everywhere - mean cancelling tax increases which might otherwise have been made. Ronald Reagan was right to suspect that higher taxes end up as higher government spending. Equity delusions The stock market has a reputation for forecasting 'five out of the last three recessions'. In other words it is worth taking into account, but it has a medium-term volatility which makes it an unreliable indicator on its own. The chart shows that the FT-A 500 Index suggested a 1988 slump instead of an inflationary boom, and - along with the Treasury and most mainstream forecasters - indicated a premature 'green shoots' recovery from the 1990 recession. Misleading, only to a lesser degree, has been the CBI optimism indicator, even allowing for the fact that, as Mr Doug McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research explains, about a half of the 30 percentage point deterioration in the past six months is seasonal. (Why cannot the CBI publish its data in seasonally adjusted form?) The least unreliable CBI indicator has been that of recorded (not expected) output and orders. True, this is not forward-looking. But it is a gain to have some clue to the present, which official statistics, because of irreducable lags, cannot provide. Another moral from the charts is that in spite of the notorious damage inflicted on services by the recent recession, manufacturing is still far more volatile than GDP as a whole. Meanwhile, a Cambridge academic, Cliff Pratten, has made a systematic study of the equity markets over many decades*. He discusses both the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and Keynes's view of a fragile conventional valuation in which professional investors are trying to guess what other investors are going to think. The moral of both views is the futility of hoping to outwit the market by studying long-term prospects for profits: in Keynes's view because it is futile and on the EMH because the information, such as it is, is 'already in the market'. Mr Pratten does say that some institutions have done better than the market for quite long periods, but he does not give us their names or assure us that they will continue to do so. While financial commentators tend to worry that equities are vulnerable after a rise such as the most recent one, academics like Mr Pratten find evidence that equities are under-valued in relation to the most plausible future movements of dividends, prices and interest rates. Since Mr Pratten went to press two years ago, equity markets have risen by nearly 20 per cent, of which about 12 per cent represents real appreciation  -hardly enough to dent his view. One reason why academics are more inclined to find under-valuation is that they see the boom of the 1980s in a longer perspective, and that boom still only took real share prices up to the level of the late 1930s. Meanwhile, I know that current equity prices, like market exchange rates, give a bad guide to future performance; but I also know that there is no one on whom I could rely to give a better estimate of the centre of the likely probability range. *The Stock Market, Cambridge, Pounds 27.95.</p>

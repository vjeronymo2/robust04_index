			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Turkey gives military carte blanche against Kurds: John Murray Brown explains the background to this week's battle against the Kurds which may have claimed 200 lives DEMOCRATIC reform in Turkey was always going to be difficult to administer while the Kurdish rebels pursued their campaign for a separate state. But after this week's fighting, Turkey's fragile coalition appears to have abandoned any hope of a political solution to the eight-year-old Kurdish conflict. Turkey's Kurdish civil war reached a new level of violence this week, with government claims that more than 150 guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) were killed in a clash with security forces at Semdinli near the border with Iraq. The deaths of government troops, guards and civilians brought the toll to over 200. Last week's resounding vote of confidence for the interior minister's handling of the crisis was probably decisive in the government's decision to mount what appears to be one of the largest military operations against the PKK. But with more than 1,700 people killed this year, a government response has been on the cards for some months. News of the military operation, coupled with the increasingly hawkish statements of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, have been almost universally welcomed at home. Nonetheless, the likely international criticism of the action will not make things easier for Turkey's allies. The UK, as current president of the European Community, has called for an 'enhanced relationship' between Brussels and Ankara. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, is scheduled to meet his Turkish counterpart, Mr Hikmet Cetin, in London during Mr Cetin's visit to London which starts on October 12. In a recent interview, Mr Hurd made clear that any improvement in ties would in part depend on the progress of reforms. All moves on reform for the Kurdish population have been frozen. After months of deliberation, the government is set upon excluding Kurdish areas from coming under the umbrella of proposed human rights legislation which goes before parliament later this month. The reforms envisage changes in the criminal procedure code in a bid to stamp out the widely condemned incidence of torture. The proposals are seen as a test of Turkey's commitment to western values. However, over the weekend, Mr Demirel warned that the 'security forces will be left with no authority if the same clauses are implemented in a region where the fight against terrorism is going on.' Despite their long advocacy of rights for the Kurds, Mr Demirel's social democrat partners are in no mood to question this analysis, preoccupied as they are with internal squabbles with the newly revived People's Republican party. Mr Demirel is even said to be considering legal action against Kurdish deputies sympathetic to the PKK. Such a move would be roundly condemned internationally, but would no doubt win broad support among Turks. Steps are underway to strip members of the Kurdish- backed People's Labour party (HEP) of their parliamentary immunity. The senior state prosecutor is bidding to bring them before the court on charges which carry the death penalty. All these measures will bolster the standing of Mr Demirel's True Path party in the forthcoming local elections scheduled for November 1. However, in municipalities contested in the south east, there is every prospect that the HEP will strengthen their position in the polls, a result which would further exacerbate the already tense relations between security forces and local officials. Mr Demirel's decision to give the military carte blanche in the fight against the PKK is a measure of how far the conflict has worsened. Approval has been given for the purchase of Black Hawk helicopters to improve the army's ability to respond to the increasing number of attacks on army frontier posts in the mountains along the borders with Iraq and Iran. Ever larger numbers of troops have also been deployed to the region. The danger however is that the increased hostilities could play into the rebels' hands. The often brutal counter insurgency tactics of the security forces has been a major factor in polarising opinion in a Kurdish community where the extremism of the PKK and its Marxist leader Apo Abdullah Ocalan should offer few natural attractions.</p>

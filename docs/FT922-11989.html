			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / O&amp;Y says it will run out of cash in May: Property developer seeks Pounds 100m loan to pay for next 90 days' work at Canary Wharf OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the world's largest property developer, will run out of cash at the beginning of May, according to information the group has supplied to its bankers. This deadline in O&amp;Y's battle to avoid filing for protection under bankruptcy procedures emerged yesterday, as the group began a two-day series of meetings with bankers in London, to persuade them to provide a new Pounds 100m loan to cover the costs for the next 90 days of work on the Canary Wharf office development in London's Docklands. A banker at the centre of negotiations with O&amp;Y warned yesterday that the group would find it difficult to obtain the new bank loans it requires. 'It is too early to say whether we will agree to put up the new money,' he said. 'There is no possibility of a decision today or tomorrow.' O&amp;Y had been hoping that banks would agree this week to provide it with Pounds 100m for Canary Wharf and a separate CDollars 100m (Pounds 47m) loan for Canadian expenses. Mr Steve Miller, the partner of investment bank James D Wolfensohn, who is in charge of O&amp;Y's bank negotiations, was in London yesterday talking to the leading lenders to the Canary Wharf project. A banker said the Pounds 100m required for Canary Wharf may not appear very large, but that sum was forecast to cover expenses only for the 90 days during which O&amp;Y hopes to complete its negotiations on a reorganisation of all its CDollars 14.3bn debt. Over the next two years, it needs Pounds 350m for Canary Wharf, described by the banker 'as a large sum of money'. O&amp;Y was yesterday also holding talks with Canadian banks in Toronto. One complication in its attempts to raise new money is that groups of banks are at loggerheads over which of them should provide the funds. Any new loans for Canary Wharf will come from the existing lenders to that project. But there are two groups of lenders - one 'club' of 10 international banks which has provided Pounds 500m and another group of four Canadian banks which have lent Pounds 450m. The club of 10, including Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Barclays of the UK and its rival Lloyds, is arguing that the four Canadians, which include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, should provide the lion's share of the money because the Canadians have inferior security and therefore have the most to lose if O&amp;Y were to collapse. However, the Canadian banks are also being asked to provide the new money for O&amp;Y's Canadian operations, putting a huge burden on them. O&amp;Y has many different credit lines for different purposes in the UK, the US and Canada. It has been trying to persuade its 100 banks to form 12 different negotiating groups. In a separate development, Trilon Financial Corporation, a financial services holding company, said yesterday that O&amp;Y has sold the bulk of its 9.5 per cent interest in the company to a pension fund. O&amp;Y is thought to have raised around CDollars 65m from the disposal.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Patten urged to adopt less abrasive style HONG KONG'S small group of independent legislators, whose votes will decide the outcome of Governor Chris Patten's proposals for more democracy in the colony, are dismayed at the breakdown in relations between Britain and China. Yesterday's statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry questioning the future of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, shocked local politicians. Mr Simon Ip, who represents the legal profession in a specially allocated seat on the Legislative Council, said China's tactics 'were aimed at rattling the Hong Kong people' so they would turn against Mr Patten's proposals. 'I have not heard an argument why it is that Mr Patten's proposals are not in accord with the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law,' he said. Professor Andrew Wong, an elected but independent legislator who served on Lord Wilson's Executive Council, said the people of Hong Kong felt intimidated by China's actions and feared an economic slump. 'I think the people are now willing to yield to China,' he said. 'But if China overplays its hand there could be a contrary reaction and the people may rally behind Mr Patten.' Mr Ip concurred. 'The longer China turns the screw the more likely it is that the people will bend, like it or not.' Both men urged Britain and China to return to the negotiating table, but said in the current circumstances the prospects of that happening were bleak. Neither politician, however, thought it would be a good idea for Mr Patten to back down. 'If Mr Patten withdraws he will be delivering the rule of Hong Kong to China,' said Prof Wong. 'He cannot do that.' Mr Ip said Hong Kong could just not 'capitulate'. But he urged the governor to change the way he presents his views. He said Mr Patten should adopt a softer attitude and 'give some indication that he is prepared to repair the damage' that has been caused. He said the 'word going round' was that China was not prepared to deal with Mr Patten. 'The question is whether they will be prepared to deal with Mr Major,' he said. Prof Wong said the governor should be less abrasive. 'They Chinese regard him as being arrogant,' he said. He said a possible way out of the difficulties would be if Legco could agree a compromise package on political reform.</p>

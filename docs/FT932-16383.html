			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / MMC to probe on-line text retrieval services market SIR Bryan Carsberg, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, has asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to examine the market for on-line text retrieval services. The Office of Fair Trading says FT Profile, owned by the Financial Times Group, has a monopoly share of the UK market for such services. On-line text retrieval services are typically provided by companies which store newspaper articles on business and financial subjects on their computer systems, delivering the information on request to a subscriber's personal computer. The OFT claims that Profile is the only database of its kind to be in a position to offer the full text of the Financial Times: 'Other historical on-line databases in this market in the UK have to compete without this important information source because of the FT's copyright licensing policy,' it says. The investigation could have significant implications for the interpretation of copyright law. It follows 15 months of talks between the OFT and FT Profile. Mr Fred Perkins, managing director of FT Information Services, said the FT would co-operate fully with the MMC. He argued, however, that the OFT had taken too narrow a view of the UK market for on-line services. It had restricted its analysis to the market for text retrieved from daily and Sunday newspapers, worth only some Pounds 25m in the UK. Competitors in the market included FT Profile, the tiny London-based company Maid Sys-tems and two large North American organisations, Dialog and Mead Data, both with revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars. Profile turns over Pounds 12m at present and is just profitable at the operational level after a 10-year struggle to break into the international market for full-text electronic information retrieval. It saw itself, Mr Perkins said, as part of the wider market for on-line business data, including companies such as Extel and Reuter, worth some Pounds 700m a year in the UK. He said the investigation raised fundamental questions about a publisher's ability to exploit its copyright material in all media and markets. It would be obviously unfair if a result of the investigation was to require the FT to make its text freely available to its competitors while being denied the right to publish electronically, for example, the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.

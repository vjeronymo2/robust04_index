			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz;  place not given -- live]    [Excerpts] [Gay] What will we be bringing to the talks  due to be resumed tomorrow?    [Beilin] Are you referring to the Hebron deployment?    [Gay] No, I mean in general.    [Beilin] Look, I think we are very, very close to a solution  to the issues of an international presence and of a token  Palestinian police in Hebron, as well as the whole issue of the  Gaza and Jericho agreement. I hope that tomorrow, or even by  tomorrow, we will be able to resolve the insignificant  differences on numbers between us and the Palestinians. We have  agreed on who they will report to but not on the numbers. We  will resume the talks on Gaza and Jericho with great intensity.  I agree with your reporters' assessments that there is a very  profound mutual interest in attending the talks and completing  them as soon as possible, and with the sides sharing such an  interest, I assume the talks can be completed and the  implementation of the agreement can begin.    [Gay] Before we address the details of the remaining open  issues, I would like to ask you about Yasir 'Arafat's distress.  Will Israel meet him half way in order to help him out of his  predicament, or at least to improve his position?    [Beilin] Helping 'Arafat or the PLO out of a predicament is  not part of our goal. We are interested in achieving an  agreement best suiting our national needs. In this sense,  exiting from Gaza is most definitely a supreme national priority  for us. By the way, I think the weakness of 'Arafat or the  organization he heads will end as soon as the agreement is  implemented, as soon as a serious Palestinian police is  deployed, as soon as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] leaves Gaza  and Jericho, when for the first time in Palestinian history,  they are able to show a tangible change, rather than just  slogans. When that happens, the domestic Palestinian condition  will also change. [passage omitted]    [Gay] Let us now address the details. We have forgotten the  two issues which preoccupied us before the Hebron massacre: the  size of Gaza and Jericho; the status of settlements and settler  security. Have we really forgotten these issues, or have they  perhaps been solved?    [Beilin] They may have been forgotten by some, but that does  not mean they no longer exist. The problems which preoccupied  us are still there, but we have to remember that most of the  main problems were resolved in the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in  Cairo. What it means is that there are no more outstanding  central, or rather substantive, problems, with the exception of  one or two which will have to be discussed. There are many  issues, particularly in the sphere of economics -- such as  currency and the customs system -- which require detailed  discussions, and that will definitely take time. There is a  technical difficulty which must not be overlooked: The sides  have yet to write the agreement they intend to sign, and it will  be probably one of the most voluminous agreements we have ever  seen, because while it does not deal with the permanent  arrangement, it addresses so many details that it cannot be  agreed on and written in a day. Its completion will require a  very intensive effort for several weeks.    [Raz] But, Deputy Minister Beilin, political sources in  Jerusalem have been saying with near-certainty that the  agreement will be completed by 12 April. Is it possible that we  are squeezing ourselves into such a tight timetable that we will  be forced to make concessions merely because of our desire to  wrap it up by then?    [Beilin] No, we will not make concessions on any substantive  or even technical matter. We will simply have to work more  intensely than we would have had there been no massacre, which  put everything off by a month. This means that physically, we  will have to work day and night in order to reach an agreement.  We will have to negotiate without pause. These are extremely  complex negotiations involving dozens of people. They will all  take place in Cairo, and they will have to be pursued until  everything is finalized.    [Raz] I have been told that the most complex part on the  agenda is the so-called legal chapter. Where will it lead? Are  we talking about legislative powers and the power to detain  people -- namely, things beyond autonomy?    [Beilin] No, no. Everything is definitely within the  parameters of autonomy. We have absolutely no intention to go  anywhere beyond the Oslo agreement and the jurisdiction of  autonomy. We must not forget, however, that in Oslo, we  discussed principles, and not how things would look on the  ground.    By the way, we are indeed close to an agreement; I do not  think that is the main problem. I think there are unresolved  economic issues -- mainly the problem of whether the territories  and Israel will belong to the same customs system; that will  have to be discussed at length. As I have said, there is still  no written agreement, and that will have to be done.    [Gay] I think you are leaving for Oman this week.    [Beilin] No, I will travel to Oman on 17 April. It will be  the first multilateral session in a Gulf state. This particular  session will address the water issue, and I will head our  delegation. [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1130 GMT on 28 March  carries a report by Dick Winter on an interview he conducted  with Beilin today. Winter points out that "Beilin, a member of  the dovish wing of the Labor party, says he opposes uprooting  the Jewish settlement in Hebron, adding that the status quo  should be preserved in the city for the next five years."]</p>

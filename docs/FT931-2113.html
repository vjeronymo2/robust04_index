			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Retirement home feud The US Supreme Court now has one lady aboard and may soon get another, but it remains a brotherhood at heart. And as in even in the most closely knit fraternities all is often not sweetness and harmony. Take Justice Byron White's announcement on Friday that he was resigning after 31 years. The instant suspicion was that he had pre-empted one or two other justices contemplating retirement so as to lay claim to the fine suite of offices in the existing Court building vacated by the death earlier this year of former Justice Thurgood Marshall. Retired justices are entitled to offices in the Court itself where four suites are reserved for this purpose. However Chief Justice William Rehnquist has been trying to persuade ex-justices to move down the road to the new Thurgood Marshall building in the revamped Union Station complex. The problem is that the three living former justices - Warren Burger, Lewis Powell and William Brennan - have refused to budge from their quarters. They say they were appointed for life to 'this building.' Chief Justice Rehnquist, a conservative, is thought to be particularly disturbed by the influence exerted by Brennan, 84, a powerful liberal intellectual, over Justice David Souter, appointed by President Bush to fly the conservative flag but proving to be distinctly moderate in many of his judgments. Justice White has said he would 'likely' move to the new quarters. But this is exactly what Brennan, who has a great sense of mischief, said he would do when the chief justice first mooted the idea and Messrs White and Brennan are great friends, though not ideological soulmates. If he does go, then it is a fair bet that Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, the liberal pair reckoned the next likely to retire, will not be so accommodating. Rehnquist may end up having to move to Union Station himself in order to distance himself from his liberal ex-brethren.</p>

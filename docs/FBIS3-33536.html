			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City (DPA) -- Mexico is an excellent toehold  for economic commitment in the whole of America. This was  stated by Tyll Necker, president of the Federal Association of  German Industry (BDI), on Friday during a German-Mexican  entrepreneurs' meeting before the Technogerma industrial fair,  which will begin in Mexico City on Monday. In the competition  of international investment locations, the country benefits from  its geographical situation and its membership in the North  American Free Trade Agreement, which was established with the  United States and Canada on 1 January 1994, he said.    Necker and FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) stressed the successes of Mexico's  economic policy in combating inflation, consolidating the  budget, and modernizing the economy. Technogerma is to put the  attractiveness of Mexico as a business location in its true  light, said Rexrodt, who had arrived in Mexico, the third leg of  his trip to America, on Thursday. However, in view of the  enormous trade balance deficit, Necker and Rexrodt called on  Mexican entrepreneurs to pay more attention to the European and  the German market. In 1992, German exports were valued at $2.8  billion (about 4.6 billion German marks), while imports from  Mexico only amounted to $600 million.    Mexican Commerce and Industry Minister Jaime Serra Puche  stressed that the establishment of NAFTA does not disadvantage  investors from third countries. On account of NAFTA and  Mexico's various agreements with other Latin American countries,  whoever produces in Mexico has access to the markets of more  countries than anywhere else in America, he said.</p>

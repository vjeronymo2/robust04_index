(``Nu Skin''), and certain of its distributors may have engaged in acts or practices which violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, as amended, including, but not limited to, false and unsubstantiated product claims and earnings representations for Nu Skin products and distributorships. As a result of its investigation, the FTC has alleged that Nu Skin, CJM, Inc., CST Management, Inc., and CK&amp;C, Inc., corporations; Clara McDermott, individually and as an officer and director of CJM, Inc.; Craig Tillotson, individually and as an officer and director or CST Management, Inc.; and Craig Bryson, individually and as an officer and director of CK&amp;C, Inc., (herein collectively referred to as ``respondents''), have made false and unsubstantiated representations in connection with the advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, and distribution of Nutriol Hair Fitness Preparation (``Nutriol''), Face Lift with Activator (``Face Lift''), and Celltrex and the recruitment of Nu Skin distributors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent discussions with the FTC, the respondents have agreed to a Consent Order (``Order'') with the FTC. The Order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission of violations of law by any of the respondents. Pursuant to the Order, the respondents have agreed not to make certain claims for the Nutriol, Face Lift, and Celltrex products or any substantially similar products or services. In addition, the respondents have agreed not to make certain claims for any other products or services unless they can substantiate those claims. The respondents have also agreed not to make certain claims about the past or potential earnings of their distributors. Finally, the respondents are obligated by the Order to discontinue dealing with any person who engages in the acts or practices prohibited by the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the Order prohibits the respondents from claiming that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Nutriol or any substantially similar product or service (a) can or will stop, prevent, cure, relieve, reverse or reduce hair loss; (b) can or will promote the growth of hair where hair has already been lost; or (c) is as effective as, or more effective than, the prescription drug Minoxidil in the treatment of hair loss; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Competent and reliable data show that Nutriol or any substantially similar product or service is effective in stopping hair loss and promoting hair growth; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Floated on a royal wave We Republicans for Charles are right. Most of the opinions expressed by the Prince of Wales are sound. As the founder and to date sole member of R4C, I can say that we agree with nearly every word he said in his self-promotional film on Wednesday night. Not about his private life. That is none of your business, or mine. The public life of the heir apparent is what concerns us. The charities he supports are admirable. Their beneficiaries are found in all sections of Britain's ethnically mixed population. Indeed, the Prince projected himself as the opposite of a nationalistic little Englander. He would have no place in the xenophobic wing of the Conservative party. The respect he showed for other faiths, including Catholicism, Judaism and Islam, is in tune with his affirmation that there is a spiritual dimension to life. He may or may not be a Tory, but he appears to be of the one-nation persuasion. He is right about the ugliness of much contemporary architecture. He is a Green, and a believer in civic virtue. Like many of us, he thinks that some form of national service, not necessarily military, should be re-introduced. This could be a winner. Rootless, jobless school leavers have to be found something constructive to do. Clearly, Charles is running for king. His theme is the return of quality to British life. Lovely platform; shame about the office. This is the point upon which Mr Jonathan Dimbleby failed to press the Prince. I am too kind. 'Failed to press' be blowed. The younger Dimbleby dodged the key question. He might have have put it softly thus: should the British monarchy be privatised, sir? Not abolished. There is no call for that. Turning the dynasty into the independent Palace Trust would suffice. As purchaser of head of state services the government could award a contract to this or that hereditary institution to become sole provider. There might be competitive tendering. Other European or more far-flung royal houses would be qualified to bid. The monopoly should be regulated, by Ofthrone. Lord St John of Fawsley would be an ideal choice for First Regulator. Don't mock. The arbitrary use of the royal prerogative by ministers and civil servants is no joke. It constitutes a fatal flaw at the centre of the British non-constitution. To put it right, the crown must be detached from the letterhead under which the executive does as it pleases. Let royalty be a living flag for all to salute, not a fig-leaf for an elective dictatorship. This is a serious constitutional proposal. Arguments for, against and around it will be found in Power and the Throne, a forthcoming book arising out of the debate on the monarchy organised by the Times and Charter 88 last year*. As Lady Williams, the former Shirley, puts it, 'the executive in Britain has something very close to absolute power; it hides behind the Crown as a way of hiding from us the extent of that power'. Let us list the areas in which such power is exercised. The result is breathtaking. Under the royal prerogative ministers may conclude treaties, move interest rates, appoint anyone they please to any public position they like, award honours and peerages, manage the civil service, and fill endless volumes with delegated legislation, all without requiring prior approval from parliament. Most of the real deciding is done by officials. The courts act as an uncertain brake upon the exercise of this huge quantity of authority. Prince Charles intimated in his film that he finds it difficult to influence the Home Office or the Foreign Office, let alone the Treasury or other departments. Yet all of them take thousands of decisions every year, under cover of his mother's name, and free of any check or balance. Change may come. Mr Jack Straw, campaign manager for Mr Tony Blair in the Labour leadership contest, favours a new Act of Settlement. That would reposition the Crown within the British polity. 'We should aim for a situation where all powers exercised by the executive, and by the monarch, are based upon statute, sometimes . . . reinforced by direct decisions of the electorate through referenda,' he writes. Mr Straw's ideas are not always taken up by his party. Labour is, however, committed to a number of constitutional reforms, all of which would diminish the power of the central executive. Give Scotland its own parliament. Entrench local government. Pass a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. Replace the House of Lords by a senate. These little things add up. Suddenly you have constrained Whitehall. The Prince of Wales was not asked about these matters, but it cannot be taken for granted that he would oppose all or indeed any of them. He might well support some, if only his interlocutor had the wit to inquire. His desire to be sworn in as defender of all religions rather than the church founded by Henry VIII for concupiscent reasons suggests a willingness to be separated from at least one of Britain's constitutional arrangements. Good. But the monarch is one thing, disestablishment quite another. The prince could be defender of the spiritual life and bishops could still sit in the Lords, if that is the way we chose to arrange matters. Republicans for Charles can therefore claim that the House of Windsor would benefit from becoming semi-detached. The monarchy is in difficulties because it is under intolerable pressure. In my hot-headed youth I was an uncompromising republican (Ofhead), but I have since been persuaded that in Britain there is merit in the continuity of a floated-off royal house. It is a fine tourist attraction. On a more elevated plane it serves as a focus for national sentiment. Cutting it free from the barnacled substructure of our unwritten constitution would strengthen it. The occupant of the throne could become a private person, the essence of nationhood. As Sir John Stokes, former Conservative MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, put it: 'It is very important if you are going to war your oath is to the Queen and not to the . . . secretary of state for defence . . .' Fine, so long as said secretary of state derives his authority from the people, and not merely from his officials' ability to deploy the royal prerogative according to whim. *Edited by Anthony Barnett.

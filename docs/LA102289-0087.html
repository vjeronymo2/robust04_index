			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL  </P> <P> With all the controversy going on in the press and elsewhere about women's  right to have an abortion, there is very little thought being given to the  probability that, within a relatively short time in history, the controversy  will not be over the right to have one but over the government's right to make  a woman have one -- throughout the world.  </P> <P> This will be the inevitable result of the burgeoning population growth  worldwide and its effect on the pollution of our water, our air, the  destruction of our rain forests and ozone layer, the disposal of human waste  and the untold number of other problems that will arise as the human population  begins to strain the Earth's ability to handle it. This may seem like a voice  in the wilderness but don't be surprised if many of us live to see it.  </P> <P> JEFFERSON CURRIER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

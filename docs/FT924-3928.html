			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dutch financial group up 6% INTERNATIONALE Neder-landen Group, the Dutch financial services company, said net profit in the first nine months of 1992 rose by 6.6 per cent. Insurance results showed little change, but banking posted an increase of more than 9 per cent. Net profit in the first three quarters increased to Fl 1.14bn (Dollars 630m) from Fl 1.07bn, on turnover up 3.4 per cent at Fl 35.4bn. ING gave no figures for the third quarter alone, but a comparison of the latest results with half-year figures shows that third-quarter net profit was up 5.5 per cent at Fl 386m against Fl 366m a year earlier. Pre-tax results in insurance were virtually flat at Fl 774m in the first nine months, an increase of 0.3 per cent from Fl 772m a year earlier. Life insurance and non-life insurance both showed improved results, but reinsurance swung into the red with a loss of Fl 12m compared with a profit of Fl 29m a year earlier. ING blamed the loss on a deterioration on the London and Scandinavian markets. In banking, pre-tax profits rose by 9.2 per cent to Fl 810m from Fl 742m in the first nine months of 1992. ING, which described its nine-month results as satisfactory, forecast a 'light' increase in 1992 net profit. Three months ago, it predicted that full-year results would at least match those of 1991.</p>

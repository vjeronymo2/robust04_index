			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Patu] </F>   [Text] An eventual government led by Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva will be unable to renegotiate the foreign debt agreement  as stated in the program of the PT [Workers Party] candidate.    In the clauses signed by Brazil and its international  creditors, the Brazilian Government is unable to break or modify  the repayment contracts. The agreement was signed in April.    Under the terms of the agreement, guarantees cover 68  percent  of the debt. This is equivalent to $23.8 billion of the $35  billion that was negotiated. In practice, this amount is  already in the hands of creditors.    The guarantees are in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds that  were deposited to the name of creditors at the BIS (the Bank of  International Settlements, in Switzerland, which operates like a  central bank of central banks around the world).    Eduardo Suplicy, the PT senator for Sao Paulo who is a party  spokesmen for foreign debt affairs, has admitted that  renegotiating the debt will require the approval of creditors.    Suplicy explained that the PT government will try to  "persuade" international bankers. "We will show them a plan  against misery, for which we will need a reduction in payments."    The party program states: "If creditors remain intransigent,  the PT government will suspend interest payments" (a moratorium).    If this happens, creditors may take the guarantees at an  earlier date. If interest is paid normally, the bonds will be  withdrawn in 2024.    The debt agreement falls under New York law, which allows  creditors to obtain compensation if Brazil fails to make  payments.    The PT program has still another obstacle: The current  foreign debt agreement was approved by the Senate, which will  have to approve other agreements.    Brazil has tried to renegotiate its foreign debt since 1983.  If complied with, the most recent agreement will normalize  Brazilian international relations.    The foreign debt was the most controversial subject during  the PT National Meeting on 30 April and 1 May, which designed  the program of government.    Suplicy believes Brazil will be unable to achieve  development  under the terms of the agreement signed in April. He said the  first action by Lula's government in connection with the debt  will be to ask creditors to negotiate.    The total debt amounts to $135.4 billion. The $35 billion  portion that was negotiated in April was reduced, the interest  was also reduced, and the repayment term was extended. The $35  billion portion dropped to $32.5 billion.    This reduction was also caused by the fact that the Dart  family, a U.S. family to whom Brazil owes $1.4 billion, did not  join the agreement.</p>

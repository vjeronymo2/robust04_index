			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. M. Kopeykin, V. N. Kapustin, and M. S. Pekur, </F> Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics of the  Atmosphere]    [Abstract] From February 1989 to December 1991 the  Institute of Physics of the Atmospphere of the Russian Academy  of Sciences conducted regular measurements of concentrations of  soot in the air over the city of Moscow. Aerosol samples were  collected around the clock by two sampling devices, one located  in the center and the other on the outskirts of the city. At the  same time sodar observations of the type of stratification of  the lower part of the boundary layer of the atmosphere and of  the layer of intermingling were conducted, while information on  reverse trajectories of the transfer of air masses and on the  direction and velocity of the wind were obtained from the  Hydrometeorological Center of the USSR. The correlations between  these factors and soot concentrations were determined.    Results of the monitoring of soot aerosol indicated that  concentrations were very similar at both sampling stations. This  appeared to be a result of the fact that the sources of soot  pollution were evenly distributed throughout the city, and that  the circulation of air over the city was such as to cause  additional transfer and intermingling of pollutants. As a result  of this concentrations tended to be the same over the entire  urban area.    Conclusions which can be drawn from the results of the  monitoring are as follows:    1. Concentrations of soot in Moscow in 1991 were higher than  in either of the two preceding years.    2. The soot content in the air over Moscow depends on the  output volume of the sources of soot aerosol within the  city--(these are mainly related to automobile traffic),--on wind  velocity, and on the type of stratification of the boundary  layer of the atmosphere.    3. In summer the city is cleared of soot through the arrival  of clean Arctic air masses and as a result of convection, while  an increase in soot concentration can be observed when surface  inversions are present and during the time of the most intense  automobile traffic.    4. In winter the highest concentrations of soot occur mainly  during surface and raised inversions, and the lowest during  uniform stratification and when the intensity of automobile  traffic diminishes during the night hours.</p>

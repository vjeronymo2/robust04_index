			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Jean-Luc Dehaene Invites </F> Hungarian Prime Minister To Belgium"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Budapest, 21 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene invited Hungarian Prime Minister Peter  Boross to visit Belgium.    On the second day of his official visit to Hungary, Dehaene  had talks on Monday with leading Magyar political, economic,  financial, and social figures. The Belgian prime minister also  met with President Arpad Goncz and Assembly President Gyorgy  Szabad.    At a joint news conference, Dehaene and Boross both stressed  that Belgium and Hungary -- which is seeking closer ties with  the West -- largely share the same approach to Europe's future.  "We support Hungary's role as the driving force" in the process  of integrating Central European countries into European  structures, a process which must be progressive, stated the  Belgian prime minister, who arrived in Hungary on Sunday for a  three-day official visit.    Boross stressed that Hungary -- one of the first countries  to  have implemented reforms prior to the collapse of communism --  would need several years in order to attain the level of  economic development required for European Union (EU)  membership. He added that current reforms had set his country  "on the right road" and noted that EU membership would be  important for Hungary's security.    Dehaene's trip comes less than two months after the entry  into force of the Association Treaty between Hungary and the EU.    Speaking of the Partnership for Peace -- NATO's initiative  to  improve cooperation with its former enemies and which Hungary  joined on 8 February -- Dehaene confirmed that the  implementation of this program should perhaps be speeded up.    "Hungary signed the Partnership for Peace to be able to move  closer to NATO, which would represent total security for the  country," Boross said at the same news conference.    Hungary is ready to compromise on the question of national  minorities, added Boross, referring to the conference on  stability in Europe convened at the proposal of French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur and to be held in Paris on 26 and 27  May to discuss the situation of minorities.    Dehaene is to lunch on Tuesday with the Hungarian secretary  of state for minorities. He will also meet representatives from  the opposition parties in parliament, namely the SzDSz [Alliance  of Free Democrats], the Socialist Party (the former Communist  MSZP or Hungarian Socialist Party), and the Fidesz [Federation  of Young Democrats]. After a sightseeing tour of Budapest, he  will return to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DURAN TITLE NOT ON LINE, WBC CHIEF DECIDES  </P> <P> Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran both made the middleweight limit of 160  pounds, but Duran's World Boxing Council middleweight title apparently will not  be at stake tonight.  </P> <P> Jose Sulaiman, WBC president, said Tuesday that if Duran and Leonard made the  middleweight limit, that title would be at stake as well as Leonard's WBC super  middleweight title.  </P> <P> Sulaiman changed his mind, however, during the mass confusion that followed  today's weigh-in, at which Leonard scaled 160 and Duran weighed 158.  </P> <P> Mike Acri and Tom Mara, representatives for Duran, became upset when promoter  Bob Arum announced that both titles would be on the line. They did not want the  middleweight title to be at stake.  </P> <P> "I don't give a damn about that title," Mike Trainer, Leonard's attorney, told  Acri and Mara. "Duran can keep the belt."  </P></p>

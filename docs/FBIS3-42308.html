			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Vadim Ogurtsov report: "There Was a Reason </F> for the Terrorist To Get Psyched Up"]    [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- The Rostov Prosecutor's Office is  still painstakingly unraveling the extremely complex details of  the dramatic seizure in December of a group of young hostages,  but meanwhile in former Krasnodon a certain Chichkin, who used  to be a miner in one of the local coal mines, took two boys and  a nurse prisoner in a kindergarten, which he threatened to blow  up. The situation was dangerous because the terrorist was  shouting hysterically and would have released the pin of the  explosive device hidden in his clothing had any attempt been  made to challenge him. He demanded to be taken by car to  Rostov, where an aircraft was to be made ready for him at the  local airport.    During the long journey from the Ukrainian city  representatives from both republics' security services and  Ministries of Internal Affairs took every opportunity to  negotiate with the terrorist. He watched over his hostages with  constant vigilance in the ambulance that was made available to  him. He would not remove the black stocking he was wearing on  his head, and he threatened to pull out the pin whenever the  situation seemed dangerous to him. In Rostov he spelled out his  demands: $500,000 for himself, food and potties for the  frightened and crying children, and an airliner made ready for a  long-haul flight along the route Minsk-Kaliningrad-London-United  States.    Attempts to dissuade the terrorist from carrying out his  criminal plan came to nothing. Suspiciously, without letting go  of one of the boys, he took a preliminary look around the  aircraft. The group boarded the aircraft in the following  manner: The nurse led the way with the first young hostage; the  terrorist followed a step behind her with the other. The woman  had already stepped off the gangway into the cabin when someone  brusquely pulled her and the child aside. Somebody else  shielded them on the floor from a possible explosion. At that  very moment the criminal was "grabbed" so tightly that even if  he had wanted to execute his desperate plan, he would not have  been able to move and activate the charge. He was neutralized by  officers from a special section of the Rostov Internal Affairs  Administration Department for Combatting Organized Crime.</p>

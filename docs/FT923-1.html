			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gota Bank parent seeks receiver GOTA AB, the Swedish holding company which owns Gota Bank, the country's fourth largest commercial bank, declared yesterday that it was bankrupt with debts totalling SKr5bn. The group's board said that the whole of its share capital had been exhausted and it was applying to the courts for a receiver. It suspended all payments to creditors on September 16. However, the board's decision will not affect Gota Bank which will continue to operate normally after the Swedish government guaranteed on September 9 to meet the bank's obligations. Mr Bo Lundgren, the minister responsible for financial institutions, emphasised that the bank's customers would not be injured by the collapse of Gota AB. 'The government's earlier commitments to meet Gota Bank's obligations remain in force.' Mr Per Lundberg, Gota Bank's chief executive, said negotiations were going on with the Finance Ministry to reach an agreement on the bank's future. But the bankruptcy of the holding company will bring substantial losses of SKr1.5bn (Dollars 275m) to its chief shareholder, Trygg-Hansa SPP, the insurance conglomerate, while many large Swedish companies and other banks risk losing about SKr1.5bn in loans and other financial support. The group's fate was sealed over the past few days when it became clear that the Swedish state would not extend its guarantee to cover the holding company. Yesterday, Gota Bank announced an operating deficit of SKr2.5bn for the first eight months of the year compared with SKr966m loss for the same period of last year - mainly due to a substantial growth of about SKr5bn in its credit losses. The bank expects to make an operating loss in 1992 of between SKr3bn and SKr4bn with credit losses totalling SKr8bn for the year.</p>

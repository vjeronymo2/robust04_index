			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / ABB seeks to win more projects by reshaping board ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, is restructuring its executive board to strengthen its competitiveness in bids for complex turnkey projects. The move will also help it adapt to the emergence of large regional trading blocks. The board is being cut from 12 to eight, and the group's six operating divisions folded into four. Three directors will have regional responsibilities for the Americas, Europe and Asia. Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said large plant projects account for about a quarter of the group's Dollars 32bn (Pounds 21.4bn) annual turnover. The creation of regional directors reflected the emergence of increasing trade within large blocks and less trading between them. Mr Barnevik found the trend regrettable, but said: 'If you want to be a global player, you have to have a major presence in each.' Mr Alexis Fries, the new regional director for Asia, will be based in Hong Kong; Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, director for the Americas, in Stamford, Connecticut; and Mr Eberhard von Koerber, the European director, at group headquarters in Zurich. Until now, the group has had executive directors with responsibility for Sweden, Switzerland and Germany, the countries in which ABB's main plants are located. Mr Barnevik said these directors inevitably sometimes defended their parochial interests rather than those of the group. This was no longer appropriate in a group with operations as widespread as ABB's. Asked if he expected criticism for having only one Swiss on the new board, Mr Barnevik said: 'I hope we will not have this zero sum game on nationality. Now people move up here on the basis of qualifications.' He said the creation of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) contributed to the management restructuring. It also enabled the group to accelerate plant rationalisations between Canada and the US. Easings of trade restrictions within Europe had similar effects. Mr Barnevik said 15 plants would be closed in Europe and North America in the next few months as a result of the acceleration programme. Details, Page 19</p>

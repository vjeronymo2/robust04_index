			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sidlaw rises 27% on back of increased North Sea market STRONG GROWTH in services to North Sea operators helped Sidlaw, the oil services, packaging and textiles group, report a 27 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.27m to Pounds 10.5m, for the year ended September 30. Sales improved 9 per cent to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 84.6m). Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said he was 'very happy with the profits . . . We are achieving what we set out to achieve'. The group had increased its share of the North Sea oil services market from 33 to 42 per cent since introducing a system called contract logistical services. This entails taking over the management of the supply chain to North Sea operators. Stronger market share and a contract with BP were the main reasons for an increase in oil services operating profits from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 6.7m. The joint venture announced in the spring with Smit, the Dutch support vessel operator, had already acquired two companies. However, Mr Morrow said the venture - designed to sell CLS in the international arena - was expected to cost money in the current year. It was not likely to make 'serious' profits until 1995, he said. Sidlaw experienced a good return from packaging, which saw trading profits advance by 24 per cent to Pounds 4.2m. Margins benefited from lower polymer prices and a Pounds 250,000 gain on the sale of a printing machine. Mr Ian Bodie, finance director, said without those two factors margins had actually declined slightly during the year. However, the division was expected to benefit from record levels of capital expenditure. During the year, Sidlaw spent about Pounds 3m on packaging plant and a further Pounds 5.25m to acquire Falcon Packaging. Capital expenditure for the group as a whole came to Pounds 5.4m against Pounds 3.2m last time. Textiles continued to face difficulties, especially in the sale of jute yarn. However, an increase in synthetic yarns largely offset the decline. Redundancy costs of Pounds 300,000 helped to depress the operating return to Pounds 800,000. Mr Morrow was optimistic about current trading, especially for the oil services division. However, he added the caveat that packaging and textiles were less predictable because of their greater dependence on the UK economy. The final dividend is increased to 6.25p for a total of 10p (9p). Earnings per share, based on a higher tax charge, advanced to 22p (18.1p).</p>

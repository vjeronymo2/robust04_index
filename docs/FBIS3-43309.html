The communique says the Republic of Zaire is behind the  attack which is designed to destabilize the Angolan economy.  The provincial government says the attack was carried out by a  group of UNITA bandits coming from the Republic of Zaire. The  communique adds that Cabinda residents have for a long time now  distanced themselves from Jonas Savimbi's organization and urges  them to close ranks with the Angolan Armed Forces and the  national police.    The Cabinda Government urged the government of lower Zaire  to  adhere to international law so as to uphold peaceful coexistence  and good neighborliness.    Meanwhile, the Ministry of Petroleum says the attack on  Malongo did not in any way affect oil production. Petroleum  Minister Albina Assis says the morale of workers is high.  [passage omitted]</p>

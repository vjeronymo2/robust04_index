			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 8 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 7 June, the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] issued a statement by Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  criticizing the government's position paper submitted to the  International Court of Justice which expresses the view that  "the use of nuclear weapons does not violate international law."  The statement claims the use of nuclear arms "is a violation of  international law, and runs counter to humanism."    Sakigake [Harbinger Party], Group Seiun, and Minshu no Kaze  [Wind of Democracy] also issued an emergency statement, saying:  "From the standpoint of the only atomic-bombed country in the  world, Japan should actively argue the use of nuclear arms is  highly illegal." All parties strongly demand that the  government revise the position paper.    Murayama's statement, quoting the 1961 UN General Assembly  Resolution banning the use of nuclear weapons, emphasizes:  "Nuclear arms are weapons of indiscriminate, mass destruction  which affect even noncombatants. The illegality of using such  weapons is evident under existing international treaties."    The statement further points out: 1) Such a position is an  affront to the sentiments of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima  and Nagasaki, and to the Japanese people who demand the  extinction of nuclear weapons; and 2) a negative attitude on the  nuclear issue will seriously jeopardize the legitimacy of  Japanese diplomacy at a time when the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected development of nuclear devices is a burning issue. It  asks the government to reconsider its position.    The statement issued by Sakigake and the other groups says:  "To claim this is not illegal merely because there are no  actual provisions on it in international law is inappropriate in  view of ongoing efforts to gradually institutionalize  international law to adapt to the needs of the times."    The "Goken Liberal no Kai [Liberals' Association for  Safeguarding the Constitution]" in the House of Councillors also  criticized the government's position paper for "having no  international sense at all." It has issued a statement asking  that the document be rescinded.</p>

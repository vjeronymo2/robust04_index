			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 21 February devotes its "Details" program  to the situation around Sarajevo, the status of Russian blue  helmets there, and an comments by Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev.    Announcer Sergey Dorenko opens the program with the  following:    "The top echelons of the Russian Defense Ministry are  entirely engrossed in the problems of 400 Russian soldiers who  became a human shield in the war in Bosnia. Here, in the  defense minister's office, decisions are made that determine the  lives of our soldiers in Sarajevo, the future of peace in  Bosnia, and the fate of the defense minister himself, even if  you are completely indifferent to it. Good evening! Four  hundred Russian paratroopers occupied new positions on the  southeastern front of Sarajevo. The decision to bring in troops  contradicted Moscow's previous plans. We know that before this,  on Friday, a sharp address with regard to NATO was to be read  out. Moreover, the address was to be accompanied by the  complete withdrawal of Russia's blue helmets, and also from the  Serb Krajina in Croatia. And suddenly, everything changed.  Moscow previously believed that troops should not be put under  bullets until the warring sides sign a peace agreement. Here we  are. There is no peace agreement and the decision on NATO  bombings has not been changed. One should not fully trust what  the Serbs or the Bosnians say, but the troops were brought in."    He goes on to say that the attack on the Sarajevo market  might be repeated, but this time Russian servicemen might be  affected by it. He recalls that the Serbs failed to complete the  disarmament, partly because of severe weather conditions,  shortage of fuel, and the immobility of some of the equipment.  He recaps the movement of the Russian battalion and problems it  encountered on the way. He says: "In Bosnia, our paratroopers  met the Ukrainian battalion. The Ukrainians have stayed in  Sarajevo for a long time and they said that they were often  fired on. Even the outwardly neutral Ukrainians suffer because  they are Christians. Thus, a handful of Russian lads turned out  to be hostage to Balkan military passions, hostage to the  ambitions of military generals from NATO and hostage to  terrorist gangs that are not controlled by anyone."    Dorenko then interviews Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev, asking: "We have learned that the Russian Government  intends in the near future to ask the upper chamber of the  parliament to give a go- ahead to sending another 600 servicemen  to Bosnia."    Grachev replies: "Our 27th motor rifle division of the  Maritime district is practically ready for this purpose, and  also 46th motor rifle division in the Leningrad district. They  will also fulfill the task fully like 1,200 paratroopers of the  106th airborne division."    Dorenko continues by saying that Russian diplomats in the  area of the conflict advised the Russian battalion to move  closer to the French in hope that the latter would not be  bombed. The Russian Defense Ministry, he adds, hopes that NATO  would not carry out "the operation of revenge that was already  calculated in details without informing us first." Dorenko says  today that Grachev spoke about this with his American colleague.    Dorenko goes on to say that there are areas where there is  just 50 meters between the trenches occupied by the Croats,  Serbs, and Russians and that there might be serious clashes  there in four to six months.    Concluding the program, Dorenko says that "in order not to  ruin your mood completely, I leave you in the company of a man  who is a bit more optimistic than me, Minister Grachev."    Grachev's statement ends the program: "As for my proposal to  bring an additional contingent to the territory occupied by the  Muslims, I know that the U.S. plan does not include the use of  ground forces, but perhaps we should propose to the British,  French, and Germans -- they are stationed here close enough and  have enough troops and we all know well the three defense  ministers -- maybe we can reach an agreement on this issue at  our next meeting?"</p>

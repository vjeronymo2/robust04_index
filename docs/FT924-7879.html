			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusaf swims against the tide - South Africa's record-breaking aluminium project A FAVOURABLE power contract, shareholder support and scale benefits lie behind the announcement yesterday by Alusaf, the aluminium producer in the South African Gencor group, that it is to proceed with the R7.2bn (Pounds 1.6bn) construction of a 466,000 tonnes a year aluminium smelter, the largest ever built in the western world. The announcement comes against the background of a deep recession in the world aluminium industry, with about 65 per cent of world smelting capacity uneconomical at current prices of less than Dollars 1,200 a tonne. However, it also follows on the heels of a number of predictions that there will be a shortage of metal by the middle of the decade, when the Alusaf expansion comes on stream. Mr Harry Helton, executive vice president, minerals and metals, at Reynolds Metals, the second largest of the US aluminium groups, recently predicted that the western world's aluminium industry needed to build 13 new smelters of about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 if it was to keep pace with demand. There are, however, no other significant expansions of capacity planned at the moment because the depressed state of the industry makes it difficult to approach shareholders for money. Mr Helton said the industry needed a sustained price of about Dollars 1,800 a tonne before it could reasonably start investing again. Alusaf was not immune to this problem. The original plan was to raise about R3bn of equity finance for the project, of which R1bn was to come from Gencor and R800,000 from the Industrial Development Corporation. The remaining R1.2bn was to come from local institutions. In fact, eight local institutions were in the end only prepared to put up R500,000 towards the project, with about 80 per cent of this coming from Old Mutual and Sanlam, the two giant mutual insurance companies. The R700m shortfall was made up by Gencor, including its investment arm Genbel, putting up another R225m, the IDC investing a further R175m and Escom, the electricity utility, putting up R300m of convertible loan finance. What, however, has allowed Alusaf to proceed where others are showing greater caution? The answer to this question begins not with Gencor or Alusaf, but with Escom. Over-optimistic predictions made during the 1970s of economic growth in South Africa have landed the country with excess generating capacity of about 8,000 Mw out of installed capacity of about 38,000 Mw. Escom's need to recover some of this sunk investment created a 'window of opportunity' in the form of assisting Alusaf to negotiate a favourable power supply deal, which is the cornerstone of the project. The quid pro quo is that Alusaf will use about 16 per cent of Escom's spare capacity, improving the latter's financial position in the process. Alusaf has negotiated a variable tariff with Escom based upon the LME aluminium price. According to Mr Fred Roux, the chairman, Alusaf would, taking an average aluminium price last year of about Dollars 1,300 a tonne, have spent Dollars 202 a tonne on its power compared with a world average power cost of Dollars 320 a tonne for aluminium producers. Alusaf has also negotiated competitive alumina (aluminium oxide) supply contracts with Alcoa, the world's lowest-cost alumina producer, and Billiton, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, for the 900,000 tonnes a year of alumina required. Taken together, these two costs - power and alumina - will always absorb about 41 per cent of the aluminium selling price, leaving a fixed gross margin for other costs and profits. The effect of these contracts is to lower the risk profile of the project, smoothing out variations in earnings from aluminium sales. On a base case aluminium price of Dollars 1,650 per tonne, the project will offer a real rate of return of about 8 per cent. Apart the from low input costs, the size of the project is also crucial. The optimum smelter size in the world today is 233,000 tonnes a year. Alusaf will be the first producer to build a double configuration simultaneously, and this will provide significant cost advantages. Taken together with the old smelter, which will be upgraded, Alusaf will at full production produce 680,000 tonnes a year. From the point of view of Gencor, the project is a crucial step into the mineral beneficiation arena where, it is widely held, the future of South Africa's mining and metals industry is to be found. It also offers an important platform for the internationalisation of the group's activities, an oft-stated ambition. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, made clear yesterday that the company envisages Alusaf expanding upstream into alumina and bauxite and downstream into rolled, extruded and fabricated products. This will necessarily require offshore investments because there are no bauxite deposits of note in South Africa and downstream activity tends to be situated close to the markets. Mr Gilbertson said yesterday that Gencor was comfortable with its R1.125bn exposure in the project, which represents less than half of its current cash and readily available liquid resources. A novel feature of the project is the attempt to involve financial institutions at the start, partaking in the risk and forfeiting the prospect of any returns for about four years. Traditionally mining houses have developed projects and then sold them on for a profit. This project, however, was too large for Gencor to finance alone, hence the involvement of the institutions. Their lukewarm response indicates the difficulty many of them found in reconciling involvement in Alusaf with their traditional commitment to obtain the best available returns for policy holders in the short-term. To overcome this funding gap in future, it is quite conceivable that the government will enact legislation requiring that a portion of institutional cash-flows be dedicated to such projects. There have already been noises from government to this effect. The project has been given go-ahead after accepting the recommendation of an independent environmental assessment that the new smelter be moved from a preferred site to an alternative location in Richards Bay, the East coast port where Alusaf is situated. Mr Roux said this had cost 'many tens of million rand'. The project will not, as originally planned, be listed on the stock market yet, so as to to avoid the possibility - probability in current circumstances - of it trading at a discount following listing. A later listing will be pursued.</p>

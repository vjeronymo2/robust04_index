Applicants now propose to provide card production and related services to entities that are not members of the Honor EFT network. The proposed card production services would include ordering magnetically striped and integrated circuit plastic cards (including plastic cards sometimes referred to as stored value cards) from card manufacturers, embossing the cards with the name and account numbers of cardholders, encoding information on the cards' magnetic strips, hot stamping cards, and generating and assigning personal identification numbers. Applicants propose to engage in this activity throughout the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Closely Related to Banking Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity ``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto....'' In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the matters set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  516 F.2d at 1237.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 49  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> FR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants maintain that the proposed activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act. Specifically, Applicants maintain that the Board has previously authorized bank holding companies to provide data processing services to nonfinancial customers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Citicorp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 497 (1986). In addition, Applicants maintain that the Board has authorized card embossing and issuance functions with respect to medical benefits cards issued by payer organizations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Banc One Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 139 (1994).

Applicants further maintain that the data embossed on the type of cards that are the subject of this application are banking, economic, or financial data that permit the cardholder to initiate or consummate a banking or financial transaction, and that the identity of the customer does not change the financial nature of the information being encoded and processed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proper Incident to Banking Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants believe that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicants maintain that the proposal will enhance customer convenience and efficiency. In addition, Applicants state that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W.

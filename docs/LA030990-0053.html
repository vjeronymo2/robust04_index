			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NORTHVIEW BATS BLUDGEON BISHOP MONTGOMERY, 11-5  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery High School gave up two home runs and seven runs in the first  two innings and never recovered, dropping an 11-5 decision to Northview on  Thursday in the semifinals of the Glendora High Baseball Tournament at  Henderson Field.  </P> <P> The Knights (1-1-2) will play Glendora High for third place on Saturday at 3:30  p.m.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob Anderson sounded more like a football analyst than  a baseball coach when describing the first two innings, in which Northview  pounded out seven hits and scored seven runs.  </P> <P> "Two mistake pitches and boom, you're down 7-0," Anderson said after Northview  broke open the game early with the two homers.  </P> <P> "Obviously, if you get the ball up at this place, it's going to be out. It is  such a short porch."  </P> <P> The Vikings (3-0) took a 4-0 lead in the first inning on a grand-slam home run  by Jeff Eckler, who was 2-for-2 with five RBIs.  </P> <P> In the second inning, Steve Mikesell put Northview up 7-0 with a three-run home  run. Mikesell was 2-for-4 at the plate with three RBIs and two runs scored.  </P> <P> Both of Northview's home runs were hit off Bishop Montgomery starter Mario  Juarez, who lasted just 1 1/3 innings. He gave up five hits and five runs, all  earned.  </P> <P> Juarez was relieved by Tim Newville, who threw 2 1/3 innings and gave up eight  hits and four runs (three earned). Joe O'Brien completed the remaining 1 1/3  innings of the game, which was called after five innings because of a two-hour  time limit.  </P> <P> Three Northview pitchers -- Chach Aguilar, Darren Murphy and Carlos Hernandez  -- held the Knights to five runs (four earned) on four hits and struck out  eight.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery's only extra-base hit was a double by Abab Cabrera in the  fourth inning, when the Knights scored four runs.  </P></p>

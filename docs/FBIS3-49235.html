			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 6 (AFP) -- General Jean Cot,  commander of the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia,  criticised Thursday the lack of "useful dialogue" between United  Nations policy-makers and armed forces on the ground.    Deploring the insufficiency of UNPROFOR resources, the  general called for the creation of a "rapid reaction force" as  the solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia and spoke out  against what earlier this month he described as the  "humiliations" inflicted on UN personnel in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    His comments echoed criticisms by Geneva peace mediator  Thorvald Stoltenberg in Budapest of the "abyss between (UN)  political ambitions and reality" in former Yugoslavia, in which  the UN passed resolutions promising to send peacekeepers to  former Yugoslavia but failed to provide the necessary funding.    "If they (UN officials in New York) consulted responsible  military leaders more systematically, maybe we could set up a  useful dialogue," Cot told Croatian media. Even this would not  be enough because of the "inertia of the system," he said.    The solution, in the French general's view, was the creation  of a "rapid reaction force that we could send into the field  within a few hours or a few days...in regions of potential  crisis."    Cot again protested at what on January 1 he described as the  "constant humiliation" of UN personnel in former Yugoslavia,  notably Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN forces were drawn from  "armies which have a certain sense of dignity, so that you can't  deal with them in the field in any old way," he said.    He stressed that the UNPROFOR mandate in Bosnia was purely  humanitarian: "We have no mandate for interposing ourselves  between the combatants. Our means are already insufficient for  distributing humanitarian aid, and we must not disperse our  efforts in other missions, except in the safe areas," he said.    Cot commended the outgoing commander of UNPROFOR in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgian General Francis Briquemont, who on  Wednesday [5 January] said he was leaving his job earlier than  expected because he was exhausted by the conflict. Briquement  had "given so much, it was difficult to give more, and when you  give so much you wear yourself out a little," Cot said. "I  understand and respect his decision to take up the command in  his own army that he left to come here. Let people not look for  reasons.... which are totally false," he said, in reference to  reports that Briquement had been recalled by Brussels following  his outspoken criticisms of UN impotence in the Bosnian  conflict.

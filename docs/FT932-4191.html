			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Jump in interest reins in Greencore progress to 5% GREENCORE, the Irish sugar, milling and malting group, reported a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 17.1m (Pounds 16.8m) on turnover up 7 per cent, for the half year to March 26. Operating profits for the period increased by 15 per cent to IPounds 23.4m, but a 50 per cent jump in interest charges to IPounds 6.4m due to last autumn's currency crisis cut into the improved profit margins. Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, chief financial officer, said that the increased interest charge 'has been a short-term phenomena which will not affect future results'. Operating profits improved substantially in the sugar and other food divisions, while the agribusiness division suffered a squeeze on margins as CAP reforms put downward pressure on prices for fertilisers and animal feeds. Agribusiness turnover, however, increased by 8 per cent. Earnings per share rose 1p to 17p, while the interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 3.3p. The result was slightly ahead of market expectations, and the shares strengthened to 295p. The company said that the impact of green currency realignments under EC agricultural policy and the stabilisation of interest and exchange rates 'will have a net favourable impact on our second half trading figures and for 1993-94 as a whole'.</p>

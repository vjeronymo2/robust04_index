			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Appeal court upholds college strike ruling The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld a controversial High Court ruling which means that in future trade unions are likely to have to give employers the names of all members participating in strike ballots. The decision drew strong protests from union leaders who complained of an attack on civil liberties. As a result of the ruling by Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, next Tuesday's one-day strike at 355 colleges of further education was called off by Natfhe, the college lecturers' union. The union has been in dispute for more than a year over the introduction of flexible contracts. On Thursday Mr Justice Morison granted an injunction to Blackpool and the Fylde College banning the strike because college employers had not been given the names of union members being balloted. That decision was based on a change to the 1992 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, which became law last summer, stating that a union must 'describe the employees of the employer' whom it is reasonable for the union to believe will be entitled to vote in the ballot. Trades Union Congress and union officials say government ministers had indicated that the purpose of the clause was to prevent unions from surprising large employers over which groups of workers they planned to call out on strike, and that it was not about the naming of individuals. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the decision was a further infringement of the civil liberties of union members and would ensure that the government was embarrassed by public censure from the International Labour Organisation at its conference in June. In practice the decision is unlikely to be much more than a bureaucratic chore for unions, most of whom have the names and addresses of members on computer. Yet union officials say that naming those balloted invites pressure from employers and could involve a civil liberties issue where unions are not recognised and an employer does not know who is in the union.</p>

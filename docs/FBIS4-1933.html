			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Random Talk on Hong Kong" column by Lian Tian (6647 1131): </F> "Live and Work in Peace and Contentment; Usher In 1997"]    [Text] Hong Kong has a large contingent of civil servants.  There is a total of more than 200,000 positions, ranging from  those as senior as government department heads to those as  junior as street cleaners. Hong Kong's civil service system,  which has taken shape and operated effectively over many years,  ensures the Hong Kong Government's highly efficient operation.    Generally speaking, Hong Kong civil servants are better paid  and well fed. They also understand clearly that their pay comes  from Hong Kong taxpayers' money, so they work with might and  main. When staying in Hong Kong, this writer, as required by my  job, came into contact with government departments concerned on  many occasions and had the personal experience of being warmly  received by functionaries who responded to my queries and  dispelled my doubts with their adept professional knowledge.  Moreover, this writer witnessed scenes in which the police  risked their lives to capture robbers in the street. My general  feeling is that Hong Kong civil servants are of high quality and  quite professional, and most of them are dedicated to their  duties.    Today, Hong Kong has become the "Pearl of the East,"  enjoying  prosperity and stability, but this success is inseparable from  the efforts made by vast numbers of civil servants. As far as  this writer understands, a well-knit mechanism of inspiration  and supervision has been built in the Hong Kong civil service  system and a stringent system for assessing civil servants has  been implemented, with rewards and punishments meted out fairly.  In addition, the Independent Commission Against Corruption is  responsible for monitoring corrupt practices committed by civil  servants of the executive. As proved by practical experience,  these measures help government organs bring their executive  functions into play. The mainland also drew on Hong Kong's  relevant practices in the process of studying the implementation  of a civil service system.    More important is that if our country wants to realize a  smooth transition when resuming the exercise of our sovereignty  over Hong Kong, a stable contingent of civil servants is a very  essential aspect and a direct factor. To stabilize the  contingent of civil servants, it is necessary to maintain the  continuity of the civil service system. Actually, issues  related to civil servants have been defined clearly in the Basic  Law. Under the principles of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong  Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy," the Basic Law stipulates  that following our country's resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong, civil servants serving in all Hong  Kong Government departments may all remain in employment in the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional [SAR] Government.  Entering the post-transition period, with the year 1997  approaching, some misgivings have arisen among Hong Kong civil  servants which are largely unnecessary worries, such as concerns  over a "great reshuffle" and the possible loss of existing  positions and benefits. To deal with these misgivings, the  Preliminary Work Committee's political sub-group studied them as  major issues and openly dispelled relevant doubts, thus more  explicitly and concretely guaranteeing the future of civil  servants. This move should pacify some of the civil servants  who are in a state of disquiet.    The Chinese Government sets much store by the role of Hong  Kong civil servants and has repeatedly made clear its wish for  the continued service of Hong Kong civil servants in the SAR  Government after 1997 so as to serve the people of Hong Kong.  This is a sincere invitation sent by the Chinese Government.  It is believed that Hong Kong civil servants -- particularly  the Chinese civil servants, who account for over 90 percent of  the contingent -- will positively orient themselves toward 1997,  in a gesture of mastery, along with vast numbers of the people  of Hong Kong, will live and work in peace and contentment, and  will develop their capabilities to the full. In addition, the  issue of having better communications, stronger ties, and closer  cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland in the  post-transition period also should be placed on the agenda.</p>

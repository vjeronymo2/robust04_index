			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Citicorp restates latest results US BANKING group Citicorp revealed last night that it has restated its previously announced second-quarter results from a profit of Dollars 171m to a profit of Dollars 143m in the wake of an examination of the US mortgage business by bank regulators that was completed after Citicorp filed its second-quarter earnings. Citicorp also confirmed yesterday that it signed an informal memorandum of understanding with federal regulators earlier this year agreeing to keep regulators more closely informed of moves by the bank to strengthen its capital position. On the issue of its restatement of earnings, Citicorp said that although its management and its independent auditors had agreed that the original second-quarter earnings report was consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, net income had to be adjusted by Dollars 28m to reflect the regulators' different judgment on the level of future repayments of mortgages. The bank admitted, however, that because of the recent change in interest rate expectations, it would have taken an identical charge against third-quarter earnings even with its existing approach to mortgage valuation. In a separate accounting move, Citicorp said that it had also changed the balance sheet classification of Dollars 149m of mortgage properties. The classification was switched from 'delinquent consumer mortgages' to 'other real estate owned' to reflect circumstances where the borrower has effectively relinquished control over the property although foreclose has not occurred. The net effect of the change, which Citicorp said had no impact on earnings because of previously established reserves, has reduced consumer loans at June 30, 1992 from Dollars 89.5bn to Dollars 89.3bn. The Student Loan Marketing Association revealed yesterday that it has made a preliminary offer to acquire the Dollars 2.5bn of guaranteed student loans owned by Citibank.</p>

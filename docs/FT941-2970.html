			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Motor insurers expect sharp fall in rates Many consumers can expect the cost of their motor insurance to fall this year as competition drives down premium rates, according to two of the country's biggest chains of insurance shops. Mr Barry Hulbert, managing director of Hill House Hammond, estimated that four out of five drivers could expect to pay less, although drivers with poor records might still face increases. He said: 'Overall, comprehensive premiums should drop by 5 per cent or more.' Figures drawn up by Hill House Hammond show that the average cost of a comprehensive motor insurance policy has already fallen from Pounds 442.54 to Pounds 417.34 during the past four months, while average rates for non-comprehensive policies - which cover third party liabilities and some other risks - have dropped from Pounds 280 to Pounds 273. Mr Hulbert said: 'It is a very competitive market. It is the customer's dream.' Mr Mark Wood, managing director of AA Insurance, said comprehensive rates could fall by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent this year, while rates for non-compre-hensive policies could fall by between 2 per cent and 5 per cent. He added: 'The industry has only recently been prepared to admit that rates are falling. There is now crystal clear evidence.' The reductions will be counteracted to some extent in October when the 2.5 per cent insurance tax announced in November's Budget comes into effect. They follow rate increases of more than 20 per cent a year since 1991, with insurance companies increasing rates in response to a sharp rise in accident and theft claims. Younger drivers or drivers of faster cars have faced even steeper rate increases. Most insurance companies are back in profit, however, and there is evidence that claims have started to decline. In addition several 'direct writers', selling by a combination of mass marketing and telephone sales rather than through a broker or intermediary, have entered the market. Some buyers may benefit from even sharper reductions as the market becomes more sophisticated in its assessment of risks. Hill House Hammond is offering lower rates to women drivers and drivers of cars fitted with high-level rear brake lights, for example.</p>

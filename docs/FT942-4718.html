			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps St James Place Capital to Pounds 81m St James's Place Capital, the financial services group run by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, yesterday announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 81.1m for the year to March 1994. The figures were distorted by a Pounds 26.5m profit from the disposal of its stake in RIT Capital Partners last July, and from Pounds 26.8m investment profits, due to what Sir Mark described as exceptionally favourable conditions. The company's fledgling life assurance and investment management businesses also performed strongly and provided a more substantial recurrent income base. The company is paying a final dividend of 1.5p, making an unchanged total of 3p reflecting the reduction in group capital that followed the distribution to shareholders of the 37.6 per cent stake in RIT. Earnings per share amounted to 27.5p (5p) or 17.8p excluding the RIT profits, while the net asset value per share rose by 29.6 per cent to 86.3p, also adjusted for the RIT distribution, which reduced net assets by Pounds 111.6m. SJP has an investment portfolio of about Pounds 160m, and this generated substantial profits during the year, which are unlikely to be repeated. In the second half of the year, SJP bought 80 per cent of International Financial Markets Trading, the fund management group. The enlarged fund management division, which also includes a 30 per cent stake in Global Asset Management, contributed Pounds 27.7m in profit (Pounds 14.2m). SJP's life assurance business, J Rothschild Assurance, brought in Pounds 250m in new premium income during 1993-94 and the current year figures are 'well ahead'. Profits amounted to Pounds 11.7m. However, the management cautioned that under the technical convention for the life insurance industry, of deducting a notional rate of tax, the declared profit would have been reduced to Pounds 7.3m. Sir Mark said the group planned to reduce the importance of investment profits, by building up financial services. It had set up a subsidiary which plans to acquire and restructure existing life insurance companies. In addition, SJP intends to build up its corporate finance activities, through the 50 per cent owned J Rothschild Wolfensohn. Investment banking lost Pounds 700,000 last year.</p>

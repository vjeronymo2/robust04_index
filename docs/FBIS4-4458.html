			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, April 1 (AFP) -- Vietnam has announced tax  incentives as part of its campaign to encourage overseas  Vietnamese to return and set up businesses here, a report said  Friday.    Profit taxes for businesses owned by overseas Vietnamese,  known as Viet Kieu, will be cut by 20 percent from April 16, the  Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing a circular from the State  Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI).    Investment projects that already have a 10 percent reduction  from the SCCI will not benefit from the tax incentive for  overseas Vietnamese until after the period the "priority  project" expires, the circular said.    Vietnam has been trying to follow China's success in winning  investment from its overseas community but the results have been  mixed so far despite the government's encouragement.    More than one million Vietnamese living in the United States  are now free to invest here following the lifting of the US  trade embargo in February but of those who have returned, most  have come as business consultants rather than investors.    While overseas Chinese have often been resident abroad for  generations, most Viet Kieu left here after the reunification of  the country in 1975 and have not had the time to build up enough  capital for investment projects here.    Political problems also persist on both sides, as many  returning overseas Vietnamese are treated with suspicion by the  authorities here and face opposition to their return from  anti-communist Viet Kieu communities.</p>

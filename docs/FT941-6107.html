			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / People: Constantinidi to become interim chairman of Greycoat George Constantinidi is to become chairman on an interim basis at the recently-restructured property company Greycoat. He replaces Geoffrey Wilson, who founded Greycoat and turned it into one of London's most ambitious property companies, with developments such as Embankment Place. But it was undone by collapsing asset values and complex financing, and Wilson agreed to retire at the end of March, following Greycoat's resuscitation by South African financiers Brian Myerson and Julian Treger. Constantinidi has been a non-executive director since Greycoat acquired City Offices in 1982, but his length of tenure as non-executive chairman will be significantly shorter. It is understood that one appointment recently fell through, but other names are under consideration. The company said it would not rush into a final decision.</p>

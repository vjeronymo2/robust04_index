			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Stores still set to open this Sunday THE House of Lords judgment this week, which strengthened local councils' powers to issue injunctions to prevent Sunday trading, is unlikely to result in big changes this weekend. Most of the 400 local authorities in England and Wales have not sought injunctions to prevent retailers opening this Sunday. Westminster City Council, which covers some of the country's busiest shopping districts, said that it would take no action this weekend and it would be at least the middle of next week before a decision was taken on whether to pursue offenders. It said: 'We haven't formally received the judgement yet. I think the position of most councils is that they will take a while to creak into action, unless they have a particular political bugbear about it.' Reading District Council said it feared injunctions would lead to appeals and would follow the same tortuous legal path as before. Safeway, the supermarket chain owned by the Argyll Group, said the ruling was a technical issue solely relating to cross-undertakings on compensation to stores should an injunction be overturned. 'The judgment has not clarified the position regarding Sunday trading, which remains confused and unclear,' it said. This Sunday, Safeway, Tesco, Asda, and J. Sainsbury are also set to open the same stores they regularly trade from on Sundays. Most DIY chains said it would be 'business as usual'.</p>

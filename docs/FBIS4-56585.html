			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the Nation by President Carlos Salinas de </F> Gortari at Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City on 4  May -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow Mexicans: In recent months, Mexico has faced  some events which have hurt us as well as others that have  saddened and angered us. All of these events have shocked the  Mexican people, and this is why I want to talk to you so we can  reflect on this together and so I can convey my feelings to you  about these events -- events that have forced us to come  together and decisively act in favor of the nation.    I know the Mexican people are convinced that violence is not  the way to resolve differences, remedy difficulties, or promote  personal or group interests. The path we have embarked upon is  one of dialogue and solidarity, and it is one that will not be  interrupted. I am committed to complying with the laws and to  fighting violence, specifically impunity, kidnapping, and drug  trafficking. All of these forms of violence have caused great  damage to other countries, and they seek to harm our nation as  well. This is why this is the best time to reassert our  commitment to Mexico.    To combat the threats of criminals and organized gangs  against public security, I have created a Coordinating Board  that falls within the jurisdiction of the president of the  republic. Through this new organization, we will redouble the  efficiency of the Attorney General's Office to fight crime. As  head of this organization, I have appointed -- by virtue of the  powers bestowed on me by Article 89 of the Constitution -- a  very prominent and experienced jurist with a clear determination  to implement the law.    In light of incidents that seek to generate fear and  mistrust, the state's response is overwhelming. No one should  question our firm resolve to enforce the law vis-a-vis criminals  and gangs. The greatest problem, however, lies in existing  divisions, baseless conjectures, and discouragement, which is  precisely what the criminals want. Our response must be clear,  firm, and committed or we will place peace and the de jure state  at a disadvantage. In the face of rumors and uncertainty, we  will brandish truth and information.    The government is adapting and will continue to adapt to the  de jure state as the primary mechanism for justice and peaceful  coexistence. We will continue waging a battle against gangs and  drug trafficking in all forms and against impunity with greater  strength and efficiency. We will also continue waging a battle  with all the rigor of the law and the strength of our national  unity against these criminals who constitute Mexico's true  enemies. We also will make the greatest efforts possible in  seeking a peaceful solution to the Chiapas conflict. We will  keep our promises, and we will continue giving all our support  to the peace commissioner. The murder of Colosio will not go  unpunished. The special assistant prosecutor has my complete  support to conduct a thorough investigation to enable the  judicial branch to find those who are responsible.    We will continue legally and untiringly opposing those who  stir up violence in Mexico. This campaign requires respect for  decisions made by our courts, because only they can issue  sentences and impose penalties on lawbreakers. Only our courts  can punish those who violate our rights. Moreover, justice does  not permit sentencing without due process or retaliation.    Fellow Mexicans, In light of the recent violent events, we,  the Mexican people, cannot and should not forget the many  positive events, actions, and circumstances that, in recent  years, have transformed Mexico into a nation characterized by  greater opportunities, international respect, and, in  particular, greater justice for the Mexican people. This will  undoubtedly be the best legacy we will be leaving for future  generations. As a result, we must persevere with the changes  proposed and keep making progress in the areas of respect and  dignity of individuals, Indian groups, communities, and citizens  in general.    In response to the question of what we will do, I believe  all  Mexicans are already doing something. For instance, we have  intensified dialogue -- the one taking place between the  government secretary and the political parties is a case in  point -- and we will keep transforming our pluralism into  strength and our differences into starting points for new  democratic encounters. We will continue promoting closer ties  between authorities and communities and work to reduce the  pitfalls that those who oppose Mexico's progress want to  exploit. We will consolidate our economic efforts to create  more opportunities. We will continue implementing measures to  accelerate the economic recovery and, in particular, we will  continue investing, timely and efficiently, those resources  earmarked for social expenditures.    These expenditures are the highest they have ever been.  They are expenditures that support the people, communities, and  families -- the most valuable things in our nation. I know the  economic situation worries families. I will increase the  determination and the efforts to open more economic  opportunities that you need. There will be more actions in  favor of the people's economy [economia popular]. To stimulate  the countryside, we will continue providing direct support to  Procampo [Program of Direct Support to the Countryside], which  helps more than 3 million peasants who work the majority of the  country's cultivated land. With Procede [expansion unknown], we  will continue to issue the title deeds that hundreds of  thousands of ejido holders demand and have a right to in the  country.    To increase wellbeing, we will continue spending more --  more  than ever before in our history -- on education. This year, we  will invest more than 6 percent of the GNP, which is the highest  proportion in the century, in favor of our children's education.  We will continue to support our teachers with tangible  measures. In the health sector, we are protecting more  Mexicans, eliminating diseases that affect our children and  vaccinating all of them. Above all, we are doing so with higher  quality efforts and a sense of service.    We will build nearly 340,000 houses, a number that has never  before been built in a single year and which is more than  one-fourth of all the houses built in the past 60 years. We  have expanded credit facilities for small and medium-sized  businesses which create countless jobs and which are so  important to us. We are doubling the number of scholarships, to  reach the level of 200,000, for the training of workers and  those who are unemployed at this time. In this way, 200,000  Mexicans will obtain an income and improve their training and  preparation to take advantage of the opportunities created by  new jobs. We are strengthening the 130 regional solidarity  funds to finance productive projects in approximately 4,000  Indian communities.    Fellow Mexicans, We are going to continue working for  Mexico,  as is our duty, as is everyone's duty. We are mainly going to  redouble public security, without limiting democracy or freedom.  We will continue to oppose violence with the force of law and  with the values that unite us and give us a future. In the face  of attacks, we will employ unity, legality, and each  individual's commitment to Mexico. In the face of injustice, we  will employ the resolute action of the entire nation in favor of  those who have less. In the face of insult, we will employ our  essential unity as Mexicans. Who benefits from rumors? Who  benefits from confusion? Certainly not the republic's  institutions, not the country's democratic forces, not  tolerance, and not those who peacefully struggle for justice. We  do not accept the use of misinformation against Mexico.    No action can change our determined resolve to respect  freedom of speech or criticism. An excess of this freedom will  always be better than placing limits on it. I reiterate that we  promote unity not to silence dissenting voices but, rather, to  unite resolve to strengthen institutions in a harmonious  alliance of all Mexicans. Of course, this is not the first nor  will it be the last difficult period we will face. Still, the  ties among the Mexicans are great and strong. Our determination  to move ahead and resolve our challenges one by one remains  firm. Our desire remains firm to continue as a whole nation  progressing in peace, with freedom, and more justice. We will  close ranks and redouble our steps; this will be our response in  the face of attempts to block Mexico's progress. That is what I  have heard from the voices of many Mexicans, legislators,  different sectors, the various political parties, and the  population in general in my regular tours throughout the  country. I have in me all of the enthusiasm and energy to  fulfill my duty of serving Mexicans.    Fellow countrymen, This is our most important and  significant  principle -- firm dignity and unalterable strength -- which make  us proud as a people and defines us as a nation. Without a  doubt, Mexico will come out stronger, with more freedom,  democracy, justice, and reaffirmed sovereignty. This is what we  will do because this is what we learned from the generations  that preceded us, and because this is, without a doubt, the best  lesson and example we can give our children and grandchildren.    Fellow countrymen, Viva Mexico!</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Lawyer joins frontrunners in Manila polls MRS Miriam Defensor Santiago, an outspoken lawyer, emerged yesterday as one of the early frontrunners for the Philippine presidency after a heavy turnout in the country's national and local elections. By last night, however, only a fraction of the votes had been counted in preliminary unofficial tallies, and Mrs Santiago was joined at the top of the league of seven presidential candidates by Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and Mr Fidel Ramos, the former defence chief. Slow returns from remote provinces could change the picture, and official results are not expected for days. About 80 per cent of the country's 32m voters are estimated to have gone to the polls. Eleven people were reported killed throughout the islands in scattered election violence, bringing the total number of deaths in the campaign to more than 50, but officials expressed satisfaction at the relatively orderly conduct; over 140 people died in local elections four years ago. Mrs Santiago, a former judge and immigration commissioner, has endeared herself to the poorer voters of Manila for her outspoken condemnation of corruption, but her economic polices are vague and she has been accused of mental instability by her opponents. As she cast her vote, the 46-year-old Mrs Santiago confidently predicted she would win a landslide victory. 'There's an almost palpable thrill of excitement running through the country today,' she said. Mr Ramos, aged 64, was vigorously supported by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the outgoing president. He enforced martial law under Marcos, but helped Mrs Aquino come to power by switching sides in the 1986 revolution and has since protected her from six coup attempts. Voters yesterday were faced with the task of writing down up to 44 names on their ballot papers for the presidential, congressional and local elections. Some - including presidential hopeful Mrs Imelda Marcos, widow of Ferdinand  -looked like worried examination candidates as they took more than the allotted 20 minutes to complete the forms; others gave up the unequal task. Canvassers handed out thousands of sample ballot papers for Filipinos to copy in the polling booths, and by the end of the day voters were wading through heaps of discarded crib sheets. The atmosphere in Manila was calm and cheerful but violence was reported from the troubled southern island of Mindanao and elsewhere. In one incident, three body guards of a provincial governor were shot dead by troops when they tried to enter a polling station. Mrs Aquino reflected the national mood when she said she felt fulfilled 'because we restored democracy and we are able to hold our elections in a very peaceful and orderly manner'.</p>

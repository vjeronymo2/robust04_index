			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Laying the ghost of engines past: The hopes riding on Rolls-Royce's new Trent 800 expose nervousness about a solo strategy On giant test beds in Derby, in the British Midlands, Rolls-Royce has begun running the Trent 800: the most powerful commercial aircraft engine it has ever built. The last time it developed a new high-thrust civil aero-engine - the original RB211 - it went bust. For any aero-engine manufacturer, this is the moment of truth. It is a critical period when a company's new technologies in aero-engine design and manufacturing, developed over several years at a cost of about Dollars 1m a day, come to a head. In short, the next few months will confirm whether the Trent 800 is any good as a flying device. The tests could not come at a more difficult time for Rolls-Royce. 'Life has become very tough,' concedes Sir Ralph Robins, the company's chairman. 'We haven't had any serious surprises with the Trent 800, but the market is the big worry. I can't see any recovery before 1995 or 1996.' Rolls-Royce launched its ambitious Pounds 400m Trent engine programme in the boom days of 1988, when airlines went on an unprecedented spending spree for new aircraft and engines. 'We did not expect the severity of the downturn, but we undertook commitments to develop the Trent and we are keeping them,' says Mr Stewart Miller, the company's head of engineering. The difficulties are not confined to Rolls-Royce: its two bigger US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, are also developing competing high-thrust engines to power the new generation of widebody airliners, which will start entering airline service in the next two years. The immediate problem for all these companies is that development spending is peaking in the middle of the worst recession in the industry's postwar history. 'We won't see any massive Trent business for three to four years, but it is sustainable,' says Sir Ralph, whose company recently bolstered its balance sheet with a Pounds 307m rights issue. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, London aerospace analyst with US investment house Shearson Lehman, explains: 'They have been caught in the classic pincers, with research and development costs running very high at a time when cash flow is inhibited by poor trading conditions.' The stakes are even higher for Rolls-Royce than for its two big US competitors. Despite efforts during the past five years to diversify into the industrial power sector, the UK company continues to rely far more heavily on its aero-engine business than the US companies, both part of larger, diversified industrial groups. For Rolls-Royce, the battle for the big engine market has also assumed a peculiar psychological dimension. Although it is reluctant to acknowledge it, the company is still haunted by its past. Twenty-two years ago, it was forced into receivership and subsequent public ownership when it attempted to enter the then rapidly expanding long-range civil jet market. By its own admission, the company overstretched itself technologically and financially with the RB211, the progenitor of the Trent, which it now hopes will secure its long-term future. The company is in a much stronger position today, says Mr Miller. 'Our success to some extent stems from the difficult technical situations we recovered from,' he explains. 'Some of our difficulty with the original RB211 was the lack of the detailed technical capability to do justice to the concept of the engine; but the concept itself proved absolutely right.' From the original RB211 stemmed all the company's high-thrust commercial engines. Together with its smaller power plants, this has enabled Rolls-Royce to expand its product range and increase its share of the world civil aero-engine market in the past 10 years, from only 8 per cent to 22 per cent. At the same time, the company has sought to broaden its base, by enlarging its activities in the industrial power business with its 1989 merger with Northern Engineering Industries. Industrial power now accounts for about 40 per cent of Rolls-Royce's Pounds 3.5bn annual sales. In the first half of this year, with aerospace earnings squeezed by the prolonged recession, it provided the bulk of the company's profits before interest: Pounds 35m out of a total of Pounds 40m. But much of the company's long-term future rests on the Trent. Rolls-Royce predicts that, in 20 years, 50 per cent or more of the airline market will be powered by engines with thrusts greater than 60,000lb, predominantly for larger twin-engined aircraft. 'It was evident that it was fundamental to the continued success and indeed long-term survival of Rolls-Royce and of its UK suppliers that a substantial share of this market should be secured,' the company told a House of Commons aviation committee this summer. Three versions of the Trent have been launched. However, work on the first and smallest model - the Trent 600 for the McDonnell Douglas MD11 three-engine aircraft - has been halted because of the collapse in 1991 of the Air Europe airline, the launch customer, and low demand for the MD11, which has been badly hit by the slump in aircraft orders. The other two models are the Trent 700, with 72,000lb of thrust, for the Airbus A330 twin-engine airliner and the Trent 800, with more than 80,000lb of thrust, for the Boeing 777 twin jet. But the company's recent technical achievements (the first tests on the Trent 800 last month were successful) have failed to produce any immediate financial benefits. Even after a sweeping cost-reduction programme and favourable foreign currency swings, the aero-engine activities mustered a profit of only Pounds 5m on sales of Pounds 1.078bn in the first half of this year. Fierce commercial pressures are likely to continue during the next two years. All three big aero-engine makers are locked in combat to win new business in a diminishing market depressed by airline losses and overcapacity. In the meantime, Rolls-Royce is having to spend a large amount developing its new generation of high-thrust engines. 'The high rate of R&amp;D was exactly what we predicted and it is now peaking,' says Sir Ralph, adding that annual R&amp;D expenditure was expected to decline gradually, from Pounds 240m-Pounds 250m today to about Pounds 150m in 1998. Two separate factors have put additional pressure on the company's R&amp;D resources. The post-cold war decline in the defence sector has seen the company's military business shrink. In turn, this has meant a reduction on government-funded aero-engine R&amp;D programmes, which have traditionally had important spin-offs for commercial engines. Concurrently, Rolls-Royce has had to increase the thrust ratings on its new Trent family much faster than expected, because of earlier than anticipated demand for the heavier, longer-range version of the Boeing 777, adding to its already substantial R&amp;D effort. Although risk-sharing partners, including BMW, Lucas and Japanese manufacturers, have invested in up to 25 per cent of the Trent programme, this still leaves Rolls-Royce with a heavy burden. The question is whether it has the necessary resources to undertake on its own the next step in the competition to take engine thrusts even higher, into the 100,000lb zone. After its short-lived and acrimonious attempt to form a strategic partnership with GE seven years ago, it is difficult to see Rolls-Royce renewing collaboration on big engines with the group. That leaves Pratt &amp; Whitney, with which Rolls-Royce already co-operates on the smaller V2500 engine. There is a compelling economic case for the two companies to work together. Both are coming under increasing pressure from GE, which is rapidly becoming dominant in the aircraft business, not only through its aero-engine division but also through its aircraft leasing activities, recently enlarged by its rescue of GPA, the Irish leasing company. Both companies have been circumspect about possible co-operation in the big civil engine market. But as Mr Chris Tarry, aerospace analyst at British investment house Kleinwort Benson, puts it: 'There must now not only be a high degree of nervousness but also a focusing of minds whether a go-it-alone strategy is in fact correct.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ROLLS-ROYCE: ENGINE OF GROWTH?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airbus A330  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     GE CF6-80E1    Pratt &amp; Whitney    Rolls-Royce                                        PW 4000         Trent 700  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Air Inter               15 Cathay Pacific                                             10 Euralair                                  2 Garuda                                                      9 ILFC                     4                3                 5* LTU                                       5 Lufttrafik                                1 Malaysia                                 10 Northwest                                16 Thai International                        8 TWA                                                        20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                   19               45                44*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Where an engine decision has been taken  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Boeing 777  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     GE GE90        Pratt &amp; Whitney    Rolls-Royce                                        PW 4084         Trent 800  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All Nippon                               15 British Airways         15 Cathay Pacific                                             11 China Southern           6 Continental              5 Emirates                                                    7 Euralair                 2 ILFC                     6 Lauda                    4 Thai International                                          8 United                                   34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                   38               49                26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIVE-YEAR RECORD (POUNDS M)                      1st half                      1988    1989    1990    1991    1992   1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover            1,973   2,962   3,670   3,515   3,562  1,752 Pretax profits  (loss)               168     232     176      51    (184)    31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ROLLS-ROYCE R&amp;D trends (Pounds m)    1987    1988    1989    1990    1991   1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross expenditure         328     304     343     480     498    482 Externally funded         141     165     182     243     282    253 Net R&amp;D                   187     149     161     237     216    229  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Kleinwort Benson  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

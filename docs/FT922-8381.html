			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extension likely on ITV takeover ban MR DAVID MELLOR, national heritage secretary, has agreed to consider further a proposal to extend the moratorium on takeovers of ITV companies until the end of 1995. Central Independent Television has been campaigning against moves to relax the rules on overseas stakes in Britain's independent television companies. The rules could in theory allow companies elsewhere in the EC to buy all or part of ITV after the end of next year. In most other EC countries there are barriers to takeovers of television networks by foreign companies. UK takeovers, which are subject to the approval of the Independent Television Commission, are blocked until the end of next year. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central, wrote to Mr Mellor last month calling for a two-year extension of the moratorium. Mr Hill argued that EC rules governing television takeovers were unlikely to become fair before 1995. Mr Mellor, whose responsibilities include the media, replied that he was not yet convinced that an extension requiring primary legislation was justified. The government is preparing a complaint to Brussels about barriers preventing British companies from acquiring television organisations abroad.</p>

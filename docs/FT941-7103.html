			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Rugby captain rings the Liffe bell Will Carling, England's rugby captain, yesterday rang the bell at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange to signal the start of trading in the FT-SE Mid-250 index futures contract, Joel Kibazo writes. The new contract is a rival to the Mid-250 futures contract which started trading on the screen-based OMLX exchange three weeks ago. One dealer said the Mid-250's first day of trading, with a total of 617 contracts dealt, had been 'slightly disappointing'. Next to Mr Carling is Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, and immediately in front of him is Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the exchange, who said the contract would enable investors to manage their exposure to all of the UK's 350.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Buying the Bactroban with the bath oil - Why SmithKline Beecham has reshaped its consumer brands side SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, will today set the seal on a year-long reorganisation of its consumer brands business by giving it a new name. In future, the business, which last year provided almost a quarter of the group's Pounds 5.2bn turnover, will be known as the consumer healthcare division. Behind this apparently trivial detail lies a drive to ride a wave of change sweeping through the world pharmaceuticals industry. SB aims to sharpen the international marketing thrust which it, and many rivals, believe will be increasingly important to success in the future. The most powerful impetus is the industry-wide stampede to generate more business from over-the-counter drugs, as ballooning health budgets force governments everywhere to squeeze prescription medicine costs. 'Ten years ago, increasing OTC sales was tactically right. Today, it is strategically right', says Mr Harry Groome, chairman of SB consumer healthcare. Competitors have drawn the same conclusion. Six months ago, Glaxo, Warner-Lambert and Wellcome joined forces to develop and sell OTC drugs. A year earlier, SB formed a joint venture for similar purposes with Marion Merrell Dow of the US. History has endowed SB with some advantages in consumer marketing. It is relatively more exposed to consumer products than most of its large rivals, thanks to brands like Lucozade and Ribena soft drinks, Macleans toothpaste and Tums antacid tablets. However, not all the brands fitted the company's newly- defined vocation as a healthcare supplier. Last year, it disposed of products including Brylcreem hairdressing, Badedas bath oil and the Silvikrin and Vosene hair care brands. The streamlining leaves the consumer healthcare division focused on three main businesses: OTC drugs, currently about half its total sales; oral care, including toothpaste and brushes, which accounts for a further quarter; and nutritional products. Mr Groome reckons the business will get off to a flying start this year when it launches in Britain a non-prescription version of Tagamet, its best-selling anti-ulcer drug, designed to treat heartburn. It also plans to market over the counter in the US anti-smoking gum and patches developed by Marion Merrell Dow. Other candidates for OTC treatment include Bactroban antiseptic cream and its Relafin anti-arthritis drug. The company also sees a promising market in home diagnostic kits. By next year it reckons it will have five OTC products each generating annual sales of more than Pounds 100m. Its confidence is inspired by the US, where sales of the most popular OTC drugs have increased on average two and a half times five years after they came off patent. That growth has offset their lower net profit margins which, at 10 to 15 per cent of sales, are half those on best-selling prescription drugs. However, industry analysts point out that the OTC business has pitfalls. An OTC version of Tagamet will have to do a similar job to the prescription drug with a much lower strength. It also risks competing directly with Tums as an antacid treatment. And once Tagamet patents finally expire, rivals will be free to make it. 'The market is going to be much more competitive', says one analyst. SB has spent the past year girding for that challenge by overhauling its international marketing, which had been hampered by the company's division into loosely-linked geographic units. 'There was no way to drive a cohesive marketing or product development strategy worldwide, because it quickly ran into geographic barriers', says Mr Groome. After studying successful consumer products manufacturers, including Unilever, Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble, SB set up six teams, each responsible for managing a product category. Headed by proven marketing executives and backed up by research and development staff, the teams are free to co-opt managers from the company's national subsidiaries. The new approach is already paying dividends. Mr Groome says the division's sales rose by about 11 per cent in 1993 after stagnating in 1992. Tighter cross-border co-operation has reduced the number of different toothbrush designs SB sells around the world, cutting manufacturing costs by Pounds 1m a year. 'Better co-ordination hasn't just saved on costs,' says Mr Peter Glynn-Jones, SB's head of corporate strategy. 'It means that if something has been done once by a group of experts, you can be sure it's right.' Product development has also been speeded up. Mr Glynn-Jones says a new toothbrush with a flexible head has been developed in 40 per cent of the time needed under the old system. SB aims to launch it in all its main markets in two years, instead of the four it would have taken previously. The next challenge is to extend products across frontiers. This has advanced slowly since SB was formed in 1989 out of a merger between SmithKline French of the US and the British Beecham group. Though the healthcare division's biggest markets are in the US, Europe and Japan, the only places outside Britain where many former Beecham brands, such as Horlicks, are sold are Commonwealth countries. Furthermore, the UK is still the only market in which all the division's three businesses are active. Mr Groome says SB is considering launching nutritional drinks such as Ribena and Lucozade in the US. It also wants to broaden its product range in China, where its Contac anti-cold treatment is already selling well. However, the division's ideas for expansion do not end there. It is also on the look-out for acquisitions and believes further strategic alliances will play a role. 'We take a very pragmatic approach,' says Mr Groome.</p>

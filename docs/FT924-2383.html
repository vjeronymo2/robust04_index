			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Tiny prepares to walk into the sunset - London IT WAS a week for fairytales to end. Some, as all good stories do, ended with a happy ever after. Others did not. The poor youth who found fabulous riches and came to rule an empire has, at last, chosen an heir and is even now painting a sunset into which he can walk. Called Tiny, but not by any means an eighth dwarf (and, if fairytales are to be believed, once a railway porter), Roland Rowland is not, however, quite the unblemished hero of pantomime for all his expense accounts and corporate jets. He will never live down being called 'the unacceptable face of capitalism' in 1973 by Edward Heath, then prime minister. And his planned exit from Lonrho is as convoluted as his business empire. Had the likes of the Prudential still been shareholders in Lonrho, he could expect a rough ride from the institutions on the terms of the deal. Rowland is selling his shares to Dieter Bock, a German financier, for 115p while Lonrho is selling shares to the same man at 85p. Rowland was quoted this week saying that he regarded Bock almost as a son. Why Rowland's shares are worth 30p more than new ones issued by Lonrho is hard to see, but the effect is that the shareholders - for the company is the embodiment of its shareholders - are getting less for selling shares than Tiny is. The fact that, as individuals, they also can buy shares at 85p is little comfort; even if they take up their rights, they will be diluted because the company would then issue yet more shares to Bock. As it is, Rowland may well get away with no more than a 'boo, hiss' from the audience as he heads for happy-ever-after land. Meanwhile, in another part of the forest - Brentwood, in Essex - Alan Sugar's fairytale was ending this week, too, but not quite so happily for the principal character. Here, the Prudential was still a shareholder and, with others, refused to accept a 30p a share offer from Sugar to buy back Amstrad, the consumer electronics group he had founded. Sugar's proposition was that Amstrad's problems were so bad that the company had to be shrunk. It would, he claimed, be better to do this as a private rather than public company. So, he offered to buy the 65 per cent of the shares he did not own for 30p each. Amstrad shareholders are nothing if not suspicious, though, especially when confronted with an offer without any independent advice or forecasts about the future profitability of the business. If this was a good deal for Sugar, it must be bad for them; and if it was not a good deal for Sugar, why was he doing it? Since Sugar has for so long played up his role as the unsmiling pantomime villain, no one would believe that he had been transformed suddenly into a fairy godmother. His offer was rejected. Now, he must struggle on in the public domain, either to prove himself right and suffer a fall in the value of his investment in the company, or to be wrong and make a second fortune. The fairytale of 6 per cent base rates by Christmas also has ended. As the chart shows, UK interest rates have dipped below German rates for the first time since 1981 - a year when sterling fell from over DM 5 to little more than DM 4. There is an important difference between then and now; the UK inflation rate announced yesterday was below the German rate for the first time in decades. Even so, barring another sterling devaluation of that magnitude, history would suggest that UK interest rates cannot fall further until German rates do. Fortunately - for the UK - Germany appears to be moving rapidly into recession, making a fall in rates there likely in the new year. So, although the stock market was unsettled this week by the realisation that an immediate fall in base rates had been ruled out, and the FT-SE 100 index fell 43.2 points to 2,716.2 over the week, there is still something to look forward to after Christmas. Nick Knight, the investment guru at Nomura Research Institute - who was on Black Wednesday touched by a magic wand and transformed from a bear to a bull - has calculated that in 21 of the past 27 years, the stock market has risen during the three-week Christmas account. The average rise, including the down years, is 2.23 per cent. Since the market generally has a run in the first three weeks of January, too - in 20 of the past 27 years, with an average rise of 2.53 per cent - Knight concludes there is a good chance of a near-5 per cent rise in the market in the next six weeks. But Knight does not stop there. He forecasts the FT-SE 100 index will reach 3,500 by the end of 1993. This is well above most equity strategist's forecasts of about 2,800 to 3,000. His main point is that UK corporate earnings will rise sharply next year - by as much as 30 per cent - and the year after as recovery comes through, unit costs are lower, and the lower pound helps on translating overseas profits. Others have much less optimistic views on corporate earnings growth in 1993, picking numbers around 15 per cent, and believe that the stock market is already discounting that rise. What is more, as far as the UK market is concerned, the prospect of the government selling Pounds 1bn worth of gilt-edged stock a week from April onwards will soak up much of the institutions' cash and drive up gilt yields, putting a damper on equities. While the UK may be on the verge of recovery - unless it is yet another false dawn - Europe appears to be slowing down fast. That certainly was the message from the Guinness share price this week when the market realised that its profits could fall this year because of the cooler European economic climate. Guinness dropped 47p to 478p over the week.</p>

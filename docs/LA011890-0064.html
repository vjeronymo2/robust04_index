			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS LIBRARY BOOKS SUFFER HEAVY DAMAGE IN RAIN  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks Library, which has experienced leaks since it opened eight  years ago, suffered its worst water damage to date during heavy rains last  weekend and its roof and gutters may have to be replaced, officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Director of Library Services Marvin Smith said "dozens and dozens" of books  have been ruined, including six to eight rare volumes on the history and art of  book binding. An assessment of damages was still under way Wednesday.  </P> <P> In addition, Smith said, large areas of carpet were soaked and buckling paint  was peeling off the walls in his office, and the computer room had been  inundated with half an inch of water Saturday night. The computer was not  damaged, however.  </P> <P> The library was closed Sunday for cleaning and immediate repairs, and again  Monday for the Martin Luther King's birthday holiday. It reopened Tuesday.  </P> <P> Smith and City Manager Grant W. Brimhall said the 60,000-square-foot library,  which cost $9 million to build, has had leaks since it opened in 1982. Both  officials attributed most of the leaks to an inadequate gutter system and said  previous discussions with the architect and contractor had proven futile.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the architect, Albert C. Martin and Associates of Los Angeles,  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Brimhall estimated the city had spent between $50,000 and $100,000 on temporary  repairs and said "more dramatic action" seems necessary, such as complete  replacement of the roof and gutters.  </P> <P> "We cannot have a library that leaks," Brimhall said. "People come to the  library to read books, not take showers."  </P> <P> City Atty. Mark Sellers said he would review a file on the history of problems  at the library before deciding whether to file a lawsuit. But Brimhall said he  hopes to avoid going to court.  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks Library, whose modern design has won several awards, holds  265,000 volumes and circulates 1.4 million materials a year, an amount  comparable to the circulation of all 17 branches of Ventura County's library  system, Smith said.  </P></p>

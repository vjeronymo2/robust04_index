			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): US airlines on a roll after cost-cutting - United Airlines The big US airlines are on a roll, and United is the biggest of them all. American and Northwest have both reported their best quarterly figures for years, mainly because of cost-cutting. Earlier this year United gave workers a 55 per cent stake in return for Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3bn) worth of wage cuts and other concessions. Other cost-cutting should help produce a good result. The consensus forecast for earnings per share is Dollars 5.72.</p>

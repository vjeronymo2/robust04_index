			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Housing university students The spires of Oxford are the backdrop for WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION's new contract  -the eleventh student accommodation project the company has won in the last 12 months. The Pounds 5.4m scheme covers the construction of a hall of residence (pictured above) for Oxford University's Merton College. The contract will provide 93 study bedrooms in three blocks together with eight, one and two-bedroom flats, a porter's lodge and glass conservatory. Building at Merton, amid the historical architecture of central Oxford, will require Wimpey to use materials carefully selected to blend with the existing colleges and buildings in the surrounding area. The three-storey buildings will be enveloped with hand-made brick and a bath stone cladding and topped with Cumbrian slate pitched roofs. The 66-week contract will be complete by September next year ready for the new intake of students and the start of the 1994 academic year.</p>

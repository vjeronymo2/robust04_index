			<p>BFN     [Text] Most Black Sea Navy personnel disapprove plans to  divide the fleet, a Naval Commander Aleksandr Penkin said in an  interview with INTERFAX.    "The Fleet must be single, powerful, and battleworthy. It is  in the common interests of Russia and Ukraine -- two great  brotherly Slavic nations -- to secure the southern sea  frontiers," Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin remarked and added  that the Black Sea Navy Command was always prepared for  constructive dialogue and smooth civilized ties with its  Ukrainian counterpart.    If Ukraine takes over more than 160 ships through navy  division, there will not be anyone to serve aboard the vessels  since "the overwhelming majority of commissioned and  noncommissioned officers in the Black Sea Navy are unwilling to  join the Ukrainian Armed Forces."    Penkin suggested that there would also be problems for the  Russian crews if the seamen who have sworn allegiance to Ukraine  leave. He said that at the moment the navy is made up of an  equal number of Ukrainians and Russians -- about 15,000 men on  each side.    Penkin runs for the office of Chairman of Sevastopol's City  Council from the Black Sea Fleet and the Sevastopol-Russia  electoral bloc.    Local and presidential elections in Ukraine will take place  on June 26.</p>

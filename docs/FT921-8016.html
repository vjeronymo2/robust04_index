			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gains extended as volume increases PRESSURE from the stock index futures sector helped the UK stock market to extend its gains yesterday. A modest improvement in sterling against the D-Mark encouraged optimism for early cuts in base rates, although few analysts expect such a move until the date for the UK general election has been announced. UK institutions were buyers of equities in London yesterday. Firmness in the dollar brought gains among the international blue chips, which also responded to a firm re-opening by Wall Street after its one-day holiday. The Footsie Index staged two attempts at regaining the important 2,550 mark before finally closing modestly above that level. The closing reading of 2,555.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a rise of 14.9 on the session. In very late deals, London was helped by early bullishness on Wall Street. Mr Richard Lake, the equity chart strategist at Hoare Govett, commented that the index has not yet 'decisively' established itself above the 2,550 level, a move which he believes would be required if an upward trend is to be re-established. This week's resurgence of optimism for an early reduction in UK base rates continued, although analysts warned that another half-point cut has probably been fully discounted in the stock market. The debate has long been over the timing of such a move, and recent actions in the London money markets by the Bank of England have not encouraged suggestions that rates will be cut before the Budget day, March 10. Shares opened higher but once again prices did not move up strongly until the stock index futures market opened, and the March contract on the Footsie Index quickly established a premium of around 20 points against the underlying index, a level it effectively sustained throughout the remainder of the session's trading. The Footsie quickly bounced to 2,557.1 but as quickly fell back to 2,546.8 as traders found the 2,550 mark a little forbidding in what was at that stage a fairly quiet market. Later, the institutions began to buy stock, often on the back of recommendations from UK broking houses. The market moved ahead but was still fairly cautious until Wall Street returned to business with a gain of 11 Dow points in UK trading hours. London brightened up again but was still shy of the Footsie 2,550 level and closed below the top of the day. Trading volume picked up smartly towards the close and the day's Seaq total of 559.3m shares compared with 465.5m in the previous session; Monday's retail, or customer, business in equities totalled Pounds 832.6m, which was considered a relatively satisfactory figure in view of the holiday closure on Wall Street. Interest rate hopes, while encouraging across the broad range of equities, had a somewhat irregular effect on retail and building shares, which have become closely linked to such prospects. Some retail stocks advanced sharply, while others held back. Building shares made little response, and interest focused around current takeover bid situations, with Steetley moving up strongly on hints that Redland might increase its offer for the equity now that the rival bid from Tarmac has been sent for scrutiny by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

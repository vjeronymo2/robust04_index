The region includes a  10-square-mile area that was sprayed initially on Nov. 30 and three time since  then.  </P> <P> The entire region will be sprayed perhaps as many as a dozen times by summer.  </P> <P> The only other spray region in Orange County, covering 36 square miles around  Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its second application on  Thursday, Feb. 15. But lawyers for the cities of Garden Grove , Huntington  Beach and Westminster will go to court before then to try to get it halted.  Residents with questions can call the county's Medfly Hotline at 447-7118.  </P> <P> Medflies reported on Dec. 6: La Habra Heights  </P> <P> Medflies found Nov. 17: Brea  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tighter rein to be put on public spending - Red Book details The government's objective is to reduce public spending as a share of national income over time. The public spending plans set out in this Budget are consistent with that. In each of the three survey years, the new plans are well below the figures set out in the last Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR). Control of public spending will therefore contribute significantly more to reducing the public sector borrowing requirement than expected at the time of the last Budget. The government's plans for public spending are set in terms of the new control total (NCT). This covers 85 per cent of total spending, but excludes the two areas of expenditure most affected by the cycle. A full description of the NCT and its components was given in the 1992 Autumn Statement. The control totals for the three survey years 1994-95 to 1996-97 have been set at Pounds 251.3bn, Pounds 263bn, and Pounds 272.3bn. These are Pounds 3.6bn, Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn below the figures in the last FSBR. The control totals include reserves of Pounds 3 1/2 bn in 1994-95, Pounds 7bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 10 1/2 bn in 1996-97. In real terms (ie deflated by the GDP deflator) these figures imply a fall of 1 1/4 per cent in the NCT in 1994-95 and rises of 1 per cent in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Average real growth over the three year period is less than 1/4 per cent a year, well below the 1 1/2 per cent ceiling established by the government last year. The effect is to lower the path of real NCT growth for the second successive survey. The control total for the current year, 1993-94, is currently forecast at Pounds 244.7bn. This is an underspend of Pounds 0.4bn compared with the plans set in last year's Autumn Statement, after taking account of classification changes. Higher social security spending within the control total and higher net contributions to the European Communities together account for most of the reserve of Pounds 4bn. Some Pounds 1.7bn of the claim on the reserve reflects higher support for local authorities, mainly in respect of rent rebates and allowances and mandatory student awards. The government's ultimate public spending objective is expressed in terms of general government expenditure (GGE) excluding privatisation proceeds. This is a wider aggregate than the NCT and includes debt interest, elements of social security spending which are significantly affected by the cycle and various accounting adjustments needed for consistency with the national accounts. GGE is now expected to grow by just under 1 per cent a year on average over the three survey years, substantially below the expected growth of the economy. As with the NCT, the rate of growth is sharply down on the projected path in the last FSBR, and represents a marked slowdown on the growth seen over recent years. In 1993-94, GGE (excluding privatisation proceeds) is estimated to be around Pounds 1bn lower than forecast in the March FSBR, due mainly to lower spending on cyclical social security. GGE (excluding privatisation proceeds) is expected to be some Pounds 3 3/4 bn lower in 1994-95 as a result of the Budget. Over the three survey years, the Budget reduces GGE by a total of Pounds 10bn. Public expenditure restraint therefore contributes about the same as revenue increases to the reduction in the PSBR over the next three years. In 1994-95, spending contributes about twice as much as revenue. In recent years, the impact of recession has contributed to a rise in the GGE/GDP ratio, both because of increased cyclically-related spending, such as unemployment benefits, and because of the fall in GDP between 1990 and 1992. The ratio is now thought likely to have peaked at around 45 per cent in 1993-94. With restraint in public spending and the economic recovery gathering pace, the ratio is projected to fall to 43 3/4 per cent in 1994-95, and to 42 1/2 per cent in 1996-97. This represents considerably faster progress on the Government's public spending objective than expected in the 1992 Autumn Statement or the March FSBR. As announced by the Chancellor on 14 September 1993, central government departments will be expected next year to cover pay and running costs increases from efficiency savings of at least 2 per cent and other economies. Increases for higher workload in areas such as the prison service and tax compliance are offset by reductions elsewhere. Provision for the running costs of central government departments in the period 1994-95 to 1996-97 is frozen at broadly the 1993-94 level of Pounds 20.1bn. Compared with previous plans, provision has been cut by around Pounds 400m in 1994-95 and Pounds 600m in 1995-96. Provision for pay throughout the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable basis. The general government paybill is not therefore expected to change much next year, except where major workload changes are projected. Total public sector capital spending in 1993-94 is expected to total Pounds 23.8bn, up from Pounds 23.2bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 21.5bn in 1991-92. In 1994-95 public sector capital spending, which is measured net of receipts from asset sales, is expected to be Pounds 22 1/4 bn. The fall compared with this year mainly reflects the profile of capital spending by local authorities. This follows the decision announced in the last Autumn Statement to relax for a limited period the rules governing the use of receipts by local authorities. Spending financed by this measure will continue for a number of years, but at a steeply diminishing rate. In addition, investment associated with a number of large-scale projects, particularly in relation to the Channel Tunnel, has now passed its peak of activity. The level of public sector capital spending beyond 1994-95 is particularly uncertain. After allowing for a stylised allocation from the reserve, based on historic expenditure shares, it is expected to be at about the same level in 1996-97 as in 1994-95. There is a temporary dip in 1995-96, reflecting the expected sale of married quarters by the Ministry of Defence. Public sector capital spending was maintained at high levels during the recession. As the recovery continues, capital spending by the private sector is likely to rise and that in the public sector to fall. The overriding need for public spending to contribute towards the reduction in public borrowing means that capital spending will not be sustained at levels as high as in 1993-94. Even so, tight control of public sector pay and civil service running costs has enabled the Government to sustain capital spending at a level higher than would otherwise have been possible. The figures above take no account of the investment programmes of the former nationalised industries, which amounted to over Pounds 10bn in 1992-93, nor of the large amount of private sector investment stimulated by government policies, including housing and urban programmes. Over the medium term, the government intends that an increasing proportion of the capital invested in public services will be delivered through private finance. The aim of the private finance initiative is to involve the private sector in new investment and service provision in areas traditionally regarded as the responsibility of the public sector. This will produce projects which are better designed and better managed. The initiative is based on two fundamental principles: to receive rewards the private sector must genuinely assume risk, and value for money must be demonstrated for any expenditure by the public sector. Spending by the public sector, by way of a contribution to a privately financed project or a payment for services, counts against a department's spending allocation or its external financing limit in the case of a nationalised industry. But the private sector's contribution is additional to public provision. This means that, for a given amount of public expenditure, new and better quality capital investment will be secured by the nation. In March the government announced that the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Heathrow Express would proceed as joint ventures between the public and private sectors and that the government would examine how the private sector could become fully involved in Crossrail and the second Forth road bridge. Work on building the Heathrow Express began in October 1993; the secretary of state for Scotland's feasibility studies into how the proposed second Forth road bridge might be privately financed are nearing completion; and the secretary of state for transport has recently announced the basis on which the Channel Tunnel Rail Link will be transferred to the private sector, with the competitive process starting in early 1994. In addition, the home secretary has said that he will invite the private sector to put forward proposals for custodial service packages involving the finance, design, construction and operation of six new prisons. A briefing pack for those interested in tendering for the first two prisons will be issued in December 1993. The government is committed to expanding further the scope of private finance. The initiative offers, for example, major opportunities for improved services in the NHS, and the prospect of improved water and sewerage infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In this Budget, the chancellor has announced that the refurbishment of the West Coast main line will be privately financed; that the Lewisham extension of the Docklands Light Railway will proceed as a joint venture; and that a new air traffic control centre for Scotland will be developed as a financially free-standing private sector project. The chancellor also announced that the government intends to introduce contracts under which the private sector will design, build, finance and operate roads. Electronic motorway charging will be introduced when the technology is ready. In addition, a scheme now going to tender for the rationalisation of NHS trust facilities at Aintree in Liverpool may serve as a model for similar schemes; and the private sector is to provide nursing home accommodation for NHS patients in Eastbourne. The chancellor has recently established a joint public/private sector working group, with Sir Alastair Morton as chairman, to stimulate the flow of private finance projects. The group is intended to identify new areas of activity where the private sector can get involved and find solutions to any obstacles which may impede progress. The new plans reflect a careful consideration of priorities. Additional resources are being made available for health, education and science and technology, while the Home Office law and order budget is being maintained at the level previously planned. Those additions have been achieved despite demand-led pressures, in particular on social security spending, running to several billion pounds. To ensure that the remit was achieved and priority programmes were protected, a dual strategy was adopted during the survey. First, drawing on the programme of fundamental expenditure reviews, the government looked to reductions within the demand-led programmes themselves. This approach has been largely successful: the proposals on social security in particular will deliver substantial savings later in the decade. But, given the lead-times involved in reform, the demand-led programmes on their own could not deliver the totals required. The second part of the government's strategy was therefore to seek savings from efficiency improvements and in lower priority areas. Public sector pay and running costs were identified as key candidates for reductions: the greater the restraint on paybills the more the resources available for service provision and capital spending. This approach has enabled priority areas of spending to be protected even in departments where total budgets have been reduced. The accompanying table analyses the control total by department showing changes from previous plans. Central government support for local authorities and the financing requirements of nationalised industries have been attributed to appropriate departments. The following paragraphs briefly describe the new plans for each department. The departmental reports published in the first half of March 1994 will give more details. Planned spending on defence in 1994-95 and 1995-96 will be Pounds 23.5bn and Pounds 22.7bn respectively, Pounds 260m and Pounds 520m lower than previously published figures. Defence spending in 1996-97 will be Pounds 22.8bn, broadly the same in cash terms as the new 1995-96 plan. These plans will be delivered in part by lower procurement and employment costs than previously assumed, and by the planned sale to a private sector housing trust of married quarters for service personnel. The government also intends to place greater emphasis on the efficiency with which our forces are supported. The defence secretary has set in hand a major study to identify those aspects of the support given to the front line where costs can be reduced without affecting the government's commitments in the UK and overseas. The additions to previous plans are Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m in 1994-95 and 1995-96 respectively. They reflect the importance attached to diplomatic activity and take account of various pressures on the diplomatic budget, including increased international subscriptions and relative overseas price movements. Planned provision for overseas aid will rise by Pounds 30m in 1994-95 and Pounds 50m in 1995-96. The higher level is maintained in 1996-97. The UK aid programme is one of the largest in the world and widely recognised as providing high quality aid. It will continue to focus on the poorest countries, generating sustainable economic growth and social development, the promotion of good government and the direct reduction of poverty. Spending on agriculture in the UK is to a large extent determined by the European Community's common agricultural policy (CAP). Expenditure on CAP agriculture market support in the UK increases substantially, largely due to the depreciation of sterling since autumn 1992, which results in an increase in the value of CAP payments and prices in sterling terms. This increase is partly offset by expected savings due to policy changes. Against a background of higher farm incomes, support for domestic agriculture has been reduced. Capital grant rates will be significantly reduced and the designation of some new environmentally sensitive areas will be deferred. There are also reductions in research and development spending. Hill livestock compensatory allowances will be lower, following the autumn review of economic conditions in the hills and uplands. The department has refocused its efforts to match industry's needs more closely. The provision of advice to exporters has been reorganised to include up to 100 secondees from the private sector. The full range of DTI's functions has been reviewed to see whether improvements in the delivery of services can be made by transferring functions to the private sector. Provision is made for the external financing limits (EFLs) of Nuclear Electric, the Post Office, British Coal and British Shipbuilders. Nuclear Electric's EFLs are substantially lower due to its increased efficiency and reflect the reclassification of payments from the fossil fuel levy as external finance. The figures for the Post Office, which take account of the proposed sale of Parcelforce, show an increase in its cash surplus. The figures for British Coal, which for planning purposes assume privatisation at the end of 1994-95, show a decrease in the need for external finance compared with 1993-94. ECGD provides credit insurance facilities for UK exporters. It supports the provision by banks of export finance at fixed rates of interest. The new plans largely reflect changes in the estimated cost of interest support. The department will continue to finance a wide range of training measures for young people and the unemployed and other help with work preparation and job search. These are delivered mainly by Training and Enterprise Councils and the Employment Service. The new plans provide for spending of Pounds 3.8bn in 1994-95, an increase of Pounds 30m on the previous year after excluding the transfer of provision for the Careers Service to the department from 1994-95. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have separate provision for the main training and enterprise programmes. The plans allow for the introduction of a new apprenticeship initiative, an extension of present Employment Service measures and additional opportunities on the Community Action programme over the next two years. The new apprenticeship initiative will enable over 40,000 young people a year in England to achieve national vocational qualifications at level 3 (equivalent to A level). The government retains a substantial road building programme. Total spending on trunk roads and motorways in England will average nearly Pounds 2bn a year throughout the survey period, although it will be reduced from previous plans by Pounds 140m in 1994-95 and Pounds 100m in 1995-96. The roads programme is still benefiting from low construction prices and the baseline for 1994-95 is worth more in volume terms than when it was set in 1991. Central government support for spending on local roads will amount to Pounds 2.7bn in the Survey period, but will be reduced from previous plans by Pounds 120m in 1994-95 and Pounds 70m in 1995-96. The department's programmes also include the external financing limits of British Rail (BR), London Transport (LT) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Total funding for BR (including Railtrack) over the Survey period will average over Pounds 900m a year. This should allow investment of over Pounds 1bn in 1994-95. The new plans for LT show total EFLs of Pounds 900m in 1994-95, Pounds 930m in 1995-96 and Pounds 990m in 1996-97. These include Pounds 493/437/417m for the Jubilee Line extension and Pounds 34/16/14m to support the Crossrail project. CAA plans have been reduced over the period largely as a result of the new air traffic control centre in Scotland proceeding as a financially free-standing private sector project. The Housing Corporation's capital programme has been reduced from previous plans but will comfortably meet the manifesto commitment to provide more than 153,000 additional social rented homes through housing associations between 1992-93 and 1994-95. The Housing Corporation's overall spending continues at a level of over Pounds 1.6b a year from 1994-95 to 1996-97. Provision for local authority capital spending on housing in 1994-95 and 1995-96 has also been reduced from last year's plans, but remains substantial. It rises from around Pounds 900m in each of these years to over Pounds 1bn in 1996-97. Estate Action spending has been transferred to the single regeneration budget. The new plans show the resources being brought together from DOE's programme and other departmental programmes into the SRB, announced on 4 November, which will be used to support local partnerships carrying out regeneration measures. The SRB is over Pounds 1.4bn in 1994-95 and over Pounds 1.3bn in both 1995-96 and 1996-97, and will be administered through new integrated regional offices. The budget for countryside, water and environmental protection programmes has been set at over Pounds 400m a year over the survey period. PSA Projects was privatised in December 1992 and the five PSA building management businesses were privatised in September and October 1993. The new plans provide for the cost of residual central functions, including the redundancy costs of staff returning from secondment. The new plans reflect the priority the government gives to maintaining law and order and tackling crime. Provision for the police allows current levels of policing to be maintained and for the introduction of the reforms announced in the recent White Paper. Over the next three years Pounds 100m will be spent on measures to tackle juvenile crime. Over the same period the number of places at existing prisons will be increased by over 2,000. Six new prisons and secure training centres for persistent juvenile offenders will be privately financed. Reductions of Pounds 50m in 1994-95 and Pounds 60m in 1995-96 compared with previous plans have been achieved despite forecast workload growth in the courts and prosecution services. Provision increases by Pounds 100m in 1996-97. Within these totals legal aid provision has been increased to cover increases in workload while reflecting the lord chancellor's policy of limiting growth in unit costs from 1996-97 to the increase in inflation. The level of court services will be maintained in line with anticipated demand. Prosecution services will also be producing efficiency gains while responding to demand. Total spending by central government in England (including support for local authorities) will rise by over Pounds 1 1/2 bn between 1993-94 and 1996-97. Current expenditure on higher education will increase by 3 per cent in real terms over the survey period. This should maintain at almost one in three the proportion of young people entering higher education compared with one in eight in 1979, stabilising student numbers after the recent rapid expansion. Total support available for individual students from loans and maintenance grant will be maintained in real terms while the shift from grant to loans will be accelerated. Capital funding to higher education institutions will rise by 20 per cent in real terms between 1993-94 and 1996-97. The new plans also provide for a 19 per cent increase in student numbers in further education and sixth form colleges over the survey period. Provision for capital and other special purpose grants to self-governing (grant-maintained) schools is planned to rise from Pounds 160m in 1993-94 to Pounds 590m in 1996-97 in support of this growing sector. Government support for capital spending on all maintained schools in 1994-95 will remain at broadly the same level as in 1993-94. The plans include finance for the new British Library building and the costs associated with the move, and for restoring Windsor Castle. Priority will be given to projects which attract matching private finance. There is a small increase in provision for the Arts Council compared with previous plans. Provision for the programme as a whole will be Pounds 31.7bn in 1994-95, an increase of Pounds 1.8bn over 1993-94 plans. Cash provision for the NHS in England will be Pounds 1.6bn (5.6 per cent) higher in 1994-95 than in 1993-94 plans, while for the UK as a whole it is likely to rise by nearly Pounds 2bn. Total current spending on hospital and community health services (HCHS) in England is planned to be 5.4 per cent higher in 1994-95 than in 1993-94. As announced by the secretary of state for health on 21 October, the management structure of the NHS in England will be streamlined to maximise the proportion of NHS expenditure devoted to direct patient care. HCHS capital provision of Pounds 1.8bn remains at near-record levels and allows for the full costs of rationalising London's health services. Provision for the family health services allows for forecast demand while reflecting the government's determination to restrain the growth in the drugs bill to what is necessary to meet patients' needs. Centrally financed services will continue to be funded in line with government priorities, after a fundamental re-examination to eliminate low priority and unnecessary expenditure. The government proposes a number of changes to the benefit system which affect both cyclical social security and spending within the NCT. The new plans include extra help for the higher fuel bills of pensioners following the introduction of VAT next April. The government proposes to restructure invalidity benefit and increase the contributions made by non-dependent members of households in assessing housing benefit. It intends to make employers fully responsible for paying statutory sick pay, with an exemption for small companies. Costs to business will be lower after the Budget because of reductions in employer national insurance contribution rates. The government will also introduce in 1994 a disregard in family credit to meet part of the cost of childcare. The plans allow for revised estimates of the number of beneficiaries, and provide for further uprating of benefits in April 1995 and April 1996. The government also intends to equalise the state pension age at 65. The change will be phased in over 10 years, starting in the year 2010. Changes in these programmes mainly reflect the effect of changes in comparable programmes for England. As in past years, the decisions of the secretaries of state for scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the distribution of resources within their responsibilities will be announced later. For present purposes, a notional split between programmes has been assumed, taking account of the pattern of spending in 1993-94. Most of the spending of the chancellor's departments is accounted for by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise and is largely running costs. The new plans for the chancellor's departments include substantial running costs savings reflecting further increases in efficiency and containment of costs. The new plans also reflect reduced estimates of expenditure on mortgage interest relief to non-taxpayers. Provision for basic and strategic research will be slightly higher in real terms in 1994-95. This will provide the resources required to implement the policies in the recent White Paper on science, engineering and technology. Net payments are lower in 1994-95, but higher in other years, compared with the previous forecast. The uneven profile arises because contributions are paid on the basis of agreed estimates and adjusted in the light of outturn, and because of the consequential effects on the UK abatement. The main reason for the higher level of net payments in 1993-94 is the likely advance of contributions within the 1994 EC budgetary year, to reflect the timing of reimbursements of CAP expenditure to member states. The lower level of net payments in 1994-95 is largely due to adjustments for 1993 contributions. In the later years, factors affecting the profile include higher levels of EC spending, reflecting decisions at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992, and higher contributions in 1995 because of the United Kingdom's higher growth relative to other member states. Spending on the science base (basic research in science, engineering and technology funded through the Research Councils and the Higher Education Funding Councils) will increase slightly in real terms to Pounds 2.3bn in 1994-95. Total planned central government spending on civil science and technology will be about Pounds 3.7bn, broadly in line with last year's plans. Total local authority spending is made up of expenditure financed through central government support and expenditure net of capital receipts financed by local authorities out of their own resources (local authority self-financed expenditure). The level of total local authority spending in future years will be substantially for local authorities themselves to decide in the light of central government support, finance available from their own resources and the implications for local taxation. The government intends to use its powers to cap local authority budgets should that be necessary. Total standard spending (TSS) - the amount which the government thinks local authorities should spend on revenue expenditure - in England in 1994-95 has been set at Pounds 42,660 million. The government has for the first time also announced TSS levels for the later years of the Survey to assist local authorities in their financial planning. The figures are Pounds 44,050m in 1995-96 and Pounds 45,210m in 1996-97. These figures include amounts for care in the community, part of which will be paid as a special grant. Excluding care in the community and adjusting for other function changes, the increases on the preceding year are 2.3 per cent in 1994-95, 2 per cent in 1995-96 and 1.75 per cent in 1996-97. Aggregate external finance (AEF) - central support for revenue expenditure - is planned to be 1.7 per cent higher in 1994-95 (after adjusting for function changes). Gross capital expenditure by local authorities in 1994-95 is assumed to be around Pounds 8 1/2 bn. It is expected to be lower than spending in 1993-94, which was boosted considerably by the temporary relaxation of the capital receipts rules announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement. Capital receipts in 1994-95 are projected to be around Pounds 2 3/4 bn, giving net capital expenditure of Pounds 5 3/4 bn. In addition to expenditure within the control total, GGE also includes cyclical social security, privatisation proceeds and debt interest (see accompanying table). Cyclical social security is defined as unemployment benefit and income support paid to people of working age. Planned spending on cyclical social security in 1994-95 is 1.8 per cent higher in real terms than 1993-94. The average annual growth in the three years to 1996-97 is 1.6 per cent. The plans also take account of the effect of the government's proposed Job Seekers Allowance. This will replace unemployment benefit and income support for unemployed people from April 1996. The benefit will be paid either on a contributory basis for six months without a means test or as income support is at present. Thereafter benefit will be paid on a means tested basis. There is also help with higher fuel bills for those on income-related benefits. The Budget measures reduce cyclical social security by Pounds 0.3bn in 1996-97. Privatisation proceeds are projected to be Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1994-95, Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1bn in 1996-97. The spending and revenue measures in the Budget will reduce government borrowing and debt. This is estimated to reduce debt interest payments by Pounds 0.2bn in 1994-95, Pounds 0.6bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.2bn in 1996-97. General government gross debt interest is projected to rise from Pounds 18bn in 1992-93 to about Pounds 26bn in 1996-97. Gross debt interest payments declined as a proportion of GDP from 5 1/4 per cent in 1981-82 to about 3 per cent in 1992-93. But with the public finances moving into deficit in recent years debt interest payments are projected to rise to about 3 1/4 per cent by 1996-97.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> EX-APARTMENT OWNER FINED  </P> <P> The former owner of a Hollywood apartment house has been ordered to pay $35,286  in fines, penalties and restitution after pleading no contest to violations of  fire, health and building and safety codes.  </P> <P> Charles A. Folcke, 45, entered his plea to 18 violations March 27, as the  second day of his trial was about to get under way in Municipal Court,  according to the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Folcke also was placed on two years' probation, the office said.  </P> <P> Folcke's company, Hollywood Terrace Investments, acquired the 52-unit apartment  complex at 1921 N. Highland Ave. in May, 1982, and sold it last December  without first repairing items cited in the violations, said Deputy City Atty.  Michael R. Wilkinson, who handled the case.  </P> <P> The current owner has not repaired the building, which remains under  investigation by the city's Housing Enforcement Task Force, according to a  statement by the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> When criminal charges were filed July 6, the building was cited for fire code  violations, such as defective and missing fire doors, missing and broken smoke  detectors and defective fire houses, said City Atty. James K. Hahn.  </P> <P> "These types (of violations) . . . are always of particular concern because of  the threat they pose to the safety of tenants in the event of a fire," Hahn  said.  </P> <P> Other problems included blocked drains and cockroach infestation, Wilkinson  said.  </P> <P> Folcke, of Irvine, said he relinquished operation of the building to partners  long ago and was not aware of the conditions.  </P> <P> "I had no inkling until it was way too late that there was any problem," Folcke  said. "Once I was made aware of the conditions, I was appalled and took action  immediately. I thought the building was in the hands of capable people when it  was not."  </P></p>

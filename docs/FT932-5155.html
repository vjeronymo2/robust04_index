			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Croat-Moslem mediation bid: Meeting scheduled in Split INTERNATIONAL mediators met Bosnia's Moslem President Alia Izetbegovic in Sarajevo yesterday in a bid to end fighting between former Moslem and Croat allies, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. But Mr Mate Boban, the leader of Bosnian Croat forces, failed to arrive later for a meeting with envoys Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg after bad weather grounded his helicopter. The meeting, due originally at Sarajevo airport, will take place in the Croatian port of Split in the near future. Lord Owen reaffirmed his faith in a peace plan that would share power roughly on ethnic lines between Moslems, Serbs and Croats in 10 provinces, and said the Serbs faced many pressures to accept a just solution to the war. He said he had intended to spend 'all day trying to put Bosnian Moslems and Croats into a working relationship to stop them fighting each other and get them to accept parts of the Vance-Owen peace plan'. The peace effort has been complicated since January by fighting between Moslems and Croats, previously allied against rebel Serbs who took up arms when Bosnia broke from Yugoslavia 14 months ago. The mediators met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Thursday in Pale near Sarajevo for the first time since his self-proclaimed Serb republic rejected a blueprint drafted by Owen and former envoy Cyrus Vance to end the war. Mr Karadzic agreed to allow UN military observers into the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, under fresh Serb attacks for the past week. But Lord Owen said little progress had been made on establishing six UN-protected 'safe areas' for besieged Moslems.</p>

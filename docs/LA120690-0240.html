			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ITALIAN MILITARY JET CRASHES INTO SCHOOL; 12 DIE  </P> <P> An Italian military jet crashed in flames into a suburban high school today,  killing at least 12 people and injuring 70, officials reported.  </P> <P> Students jumped out of windows of their two-story, red brick school to escape  the smoke and flames, witnesses said. Others trapped on the top floor were  rescued by firefighters on ladders.  </P> <P> Rescuers found one teen-age girl uninjured under the plane's wing and continued  to dig for bodies four hours after the mid-morning crash. Bologna prosecutor  Mario Forte said he expected the death toll to remain at 12.  </P> <P> Officials said all the dead were believed to be students. Many of the injured  suffered serious burns. About 200 students, ages 14 to 18, were in school at  the time.  </P> <P> Police said the pilot bailed out and the plane crashed minutes later into a  classroom of the school, smashing a 12-foot-wide hole in the wall on the second  floor.  </P> <P> "I saw this plane in flames coming down slowly, it seemed to level off and then  it turned suddenly and crashed into the school," a witness told state RAI  television.  </P> <P> Students rushed in panic to escape as flames and smoke swept through the  building, witnesses said.  </P> <P> "The upper floor was full of flames and students who were immersed in the smoke  were jumping out," a young woman said.  </P> <P> The plane, a Macchi 326 trainer, came down in Casalecchio di Reno, three miles  outside of this central Italian city, and crashed into the Gaetano Salvemini  technical high school.  </P> <P> Air force Gen. Carlo Brandini said the plane was on a mission to test radar  effectiveness for anti-aircraft readiness. The aircraft took off from  Villafranca military airport near Verona, 55 miles north of Bologna, and was  scheduled to return there.  </P> <P> The pilot, 2nd Lt. Bruno Viviani, "reacted according to regulations," the  general said. Brandini said the jet's only engine had developed some sort of  problem and caught fire.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old Viviani suffered fractured vertebrae and was questioned by a  prosecutor in the hospital, the Italian news agency ANSA said.  </P></p>

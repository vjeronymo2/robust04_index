			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Waste Management sees flat term WASTE Management, the world's largest rubbish hauler, said that it expected to report flat earnings in the first quarter. The Oakbrook-Illinois-based company's stock tumbled to a 52-week low this week as investors became disillusioned with the company's growth potential. Waste Management issued the earnings estimates on Tuesday, in response to adverse Wall Street projections on the previous day. It will release official results next week. In spite of adding more than 400 sales people in North America last year, Waste Management forecast first-quarter earnings of 40 cents per share to 41 cents per share. This was little changed from last year's 39 cent first-quarter results. It's publicly-traded subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, is also anticipating flat results for the quarter, at Dollars 29m or 15 cents per share.</p>

Mentese noted that the terrorists and their supporters were  in a panic as a result of not being able to resist the security  forces as well as from suffering great losses. Mentese further  stated that the terrorists are trying to solve their  difficulties, which result from failure and the lack of support  they receive from the people, by undertaking efforts to  cooperate with foreigners. Mentese indicated that these  developments are clear proof that certain foreign circles are  using the terrorists as their tools.    Stating that it is unfortunate that there are parties and  persons who boycott the regional elections in spite of the  safety in the country established by the great sacrifices of the  security forces, Mentese said that the political parties' duty  of participating in the elections is a fundamental principle of  democracy, adding that the people who avoid this duty will  receive what they deserve from the people.</p>

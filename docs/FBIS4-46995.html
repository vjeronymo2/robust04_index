			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sakhalin-2--A Precedent"] </F>   [Text] At the present time negotiations on the Sakhalin-2  project are entering a decisive phase. Acting as a foreign  partner is the 4-M consortium, in which the American side is  represented by the companies Marathon Oil Company, and McDermott  International Inc. and the Japanese side by Mitsubishi and  Mitsui.    The essence of the project is to develop gas reserves on  Sakhalin and carry out its initial refining with subsequent sale  to a foreign consumer, the main one ready to play this role  being South Korea and also, possibly, Japan after the year 2005.  The implementation of the project is intended to take several  decades. The cost of investments is estimated at $6 billion U.S.    Negotiations on this contract have already been underway for  a long time. They became especially active during the time Ye.  Gaydar was in the post of Russian Government acting deputy prime  minister.    For the foreign partners the situation was exacerbated by  the  circumstance that the South Koreans became a dangerous  competitor to 4-M. In particular, the Palmko Korn company, with  support from the South Korea Ministry of Energy and Resources,  offered the Russian Government its services for participating in  the development of the Sakhalin-2 project. The political aspect  was important here: South Korea did not want to obtain gas from  Russia through the Japanese.    Ye. Gaydar and certain members of the Russian Federation  Government took advantage of the heightened competitive struggle  fairly successfully. They did not give final guarantees to any  of the parties but still they gave their assurances that they  were ready to cooperate with each of them. To a certain degree  by these actions they managed to stimulate among them  competition that was advantageous to Russia. But at the same  time the most highly placed figures in the Russian Government  received on a regular basis fairly large "honoraria" for the  corresponding lobbying efforts.    The proposals from the South Koreans have unquestionable  financial and also political advantages over the 4-M version.  This pertains in particular to the higher profitability, more  rapid return in hard currency, Russia's retention of possession  of both the deposit itself and the gas that is sold. But because  of their more energetic measures, including financial ones, by  the middle of 1993, 4-M representatives had managed to sway a  number of the leading members of the Russian Federation  Government in their direction. The Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet at that time received a fairly detailed documentary  report on the degree of "personal involvement" of the  aforementioned individuals in the process of rendering decisive  assistance from 4-M in the realization of their plans. Some of  these documents were to have been made public were it not for  the use of gunfire on the White House.    At the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, even in spite  of the reshuffling and changes in the Russian Federation  Government, the draft proposed by 4-M began to receive growing  support. One of its main lobbyists was Sakhalin Governor Ye.  Krasnoyarov. He worked very hard in the government, mainly in  the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy. In an  unofficial setting representatives of the consortium repeatedly  emphasized that the governor was their "main motive force."    The question of the Sakhalin-2 project was discussed several  times in various expert commissions of the Russian Government  and on the whole received support. They began to coordinate  legal and technical details of the official contract, which  could be signed between the Russian Federation Government and  4-M in the near future.    At the same time the 4-M leadership is afraid that the State  Duma, especially with its present membership, is capable of  stopping the implementation of this project. One of the main  provisions of the project is that the foreign side (4-M) will be  given the right to own part of the Russian gas which, according  to existing legislation, belongs to the state. In this  connection there is a need to change the laws of the Russian  Federation, which is the prerogative of the State Duma.    Taking into account the situation that has developed, 4-M  has  begun to work out measures for exerting the corresponding  influence on the Duma and creating the necessary channels of  influence on its key figures. A most active role in this work is  played by Ye. Krasnoyarov and also certain government  representatives, including from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy.  The leader of this ministry himself, Yu. Shafranik, is in favor  of beginning to implement the Sakhalin-2 project as quickly as  possible. The ministry's main demand is that the foreign  partners actually be ready to deliver the necessary investments  for the project.    But in the given stage 4-M is not prepared to allot the  required investments. Within the corporation it is mainly  Japanese companies that are to make these investments. But  because of the ambiguous development of the domestic political  situation in Russia, the current condition of Japanese-Russian  relations, the fact that Japan will not have an additional need  for gas until the year 2005, and a number of other factors,  Mitsubishi and Mitsui so far are not ready to make the final  decision to allot investments in the Sakhalin-2 project.    In this situation the main task for 4-M, and mainly its  American part, is to attempt to change the existing Russian  legislation with respect to ownership of natural resources in  the interests of the West and the largest transnational  companies operating in the sphere of extraction and processing  of minerals. It cannot be ruled out that under the cover of the  future possibilities of realizing Sakhalin-2 and with the help  of 4M these circles will try to push through the State Duma a  decision which will create a precedent and could lead to a  radical change in Russian legislation. The main aspect of these  changes is the possibility for foreign legal entities to own  Russia's natural resources.    This step would open up new possibilities for foreign  capital  to pursue a policy of increasing the dependence of the Russian  Federation on the leading states of the world.</p>

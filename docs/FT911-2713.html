			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capital Gains Tax and you THE INLAND Revenue has now published its March indexation table for those wishing to calculate their capital gains tax liability. The table shows the allowance which investors can make for inflation on assets sold in March. To calculate your liability, multiply the original cost of your shares by the figure shown for the month in which you bought them. Then subtract that indexed sum from the amount you received when you sold the shares. For example, supposing you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in March 1983, which are worth Pounds 12,000 now. Without indexation, your gain would be Pounds 7,000, above the 1990-91 capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,000 (the 1991-92 allowance has been increased to Pounds 5,500). However using the table, you multiply Pounds 5,000 by the March 1983 figure of 1.581 to reach Pounds 7,905. Your indexed gain is just Pounds 4,095 (Pounds 12,000 minus Pounds 7,905), well below the CGT allowance.  ---------------------------------------------------- March CGT indexation allowance  ----------------------------------------------------          1982    1983    1984    1985    1986  ---------------------------------------------------- Jan     -        1.591   1.513   1.441   1.365 Feb     -        1.584   1.507   1.429   1.360 Mar      1.654   1.581   1.502   1.416   1.358 Apr      1.621   1.559   1.482   1.386   1.345 May      1.610   1.552   1.477   1.380   1.343 Jun      1.605   1.549   1.473   1.377   1.344 Jul      1.605   1.540   1.475   1.380   1.347 Aug      1.604   1.534   1.461   1.376   1.343 Sep      1.605   1.527   1.458   1.377   1.337 Oct      1.597   1.521   1.449   1.375   1.335 Nov      1.590   1.516   1.445   1.370   1.323 Dec      1.593   1.512   1.446   1.368   1.319  ----------------------------------------------------          1987    1988    1989    1990    1991  ---------------------------------------------------- Jan      1.314   1.272   1.184   1.100   1.009 Feb      1.309   1.267   1.175   1.093   1.004 Mar      1.306   1.262   1.170   1.082  - Apr      1.291   1.242   1.150   1.050  - May      1.289   1.237   1.143   1.041  - Jun      1.289   1.233   1.139   1.037  - Jul      1.291   1.231   1.138   1.036  - Aug      1.287   1.218   1.135   1.026  - Sep      1.283   1.212   1.127   1.016  - Oct      1.277   1.200   1.118   1.008  - Nov      1.271   1.195   1.109   1.011  - Dec      1.272   1.191   1.106   1.012  -  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

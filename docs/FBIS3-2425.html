Last year's exports totalled 14.2 billion Macao patacas  (about 1.84 billion U.S. dollars), a 1.1 percent rise over the  previous year's figure. While the imports reached 16.1 billion  Macao patacas (about 2.09 billion U.S. dollars), climbing by 2.9  percent.    Textile and clothes are Macao's main export commodities,  accounting for 72.9 percent of the total export volume.  However, the ratio dropped by 3.4 percent in 1993 as compared  with 1992.    There was also drop in exports to Europe and the United  States, two main export markets of Macao, which absorb 60  percent of the total export volume.    Exports to Asian markets continued to rise reaching 28.6  percent last year.    Rise in imported consumer goods, raw materials and  semi-finished products, which amounted as high as 82.7 percent,  has resulted in the increase of Macao's imports.</p>

Yan Haiwang made an important speech at a  provincial meeting on commending advanced collectives and  individuals and on judicial work yesterday.    He said: Comprehensively implementing the party's basic line  and preserving social and political stability are the main tasks  in judicial work at present and are also new demands on judicial  work in this new situation. Without a stable social and  political environment, reform, opening up, and economic  development will be impossible. Leaders at all levels must have  a good idea of development trends, profoundly, thoroughly, and  meticulously perform their work, and make earnest efforts to  improve the legal system and supervision. They should formulate  local laws and regulations to stimulate the healthy and stable  development of the province's market economy. In the meantime,  it is necessary to carry out severe crack downs on crime and to  concentrate efforts on cracking major cases, curbing criminal  gangs, and tracking down fugitives. We must fully display the  functions of comprehensive management over social order.    Yan Haiwang pointed out: We must profoundly carry out the  fight against corruption, resolutely crack down on all crimes in  the economic field, and form a leadership contingent which is  firm in politics, well versed in professional work, and sound in  work style.    Provincial leaders present at the meeting were: Lu Kejian,  Shen Xiaozeng, Yang Zhenjie, Yang Huaixiao, Hu Huie, and Wang  Ping.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Countdown to 1993: Difficult marriage of customs - The chaos likely when EC barriers come down BRITISH businesses face the prospect of administrative chaos in complying with customs and VAT regulations after the single European market comes into force on January 1. Many companies say they are worried by questions about detailed procedures, which customs officials across the EC have yet to resolve. 'The whole thing is a total imposition,' says Mr Ken Solomons, the accountant for Wilson &amp; Kyle, a small supplier of fuel injection equipment in Brentford, south west London. Wilson &amp; Kyle is one of 30,000 British companies with trade of at least Pounds 135,000 a year with other EC states. As a result, it must file a new statistical form called Intrastat within 10 working days from the end of each month - on pain of criminal penalties. That could be a risk if its only bookkeeper falls ill or goes on holiday. Yet the company has not yet received from Customs the directory of commodity codes required to complete the form. It says it has found ignorance, conflicting information and inaccurate advice on preparations for the single European market among trade associations and consulting groups. Many of its suppliers had no idea what changes were required. Executives at Unisys, a large US-owned computer company, appear somewhat better prepared. Mr Bob Marshall, director of operations for distribution in Europe and Africa, has been publicly reassuring his staff about the changes required. However, in private, he is less sanguine. 'We are quietly comfortable that we will be ahead of the game,' he says. 'But if only we knew what the rules were.' He is particularly worried because Customs authorities in some other EC states - notably Spain, Italy and Portugal - still have not issued details of the procedures companies must follow. Unisys must comply with widely differing requirements. In the UK the Intrastat returns may be supplied electronically, but the Danes are insisting on cumbersome paper documents. Mr Marshall is also concerned about how to cope with 'triangulation' - the process by which a trader in one EC country supplies to a customer in a second through a branch plant or sub-contractor in a third. He believes officials are only just realising the administrative difficulties this involves and the potential for fraud that it could generate. He has not yet received answers on how to deal with this. From January 1, traders will no longer be required to present documents at EC border crossings. In the UK, larger traders will instead have to complete two new forms, and two extra boxes on their existing VAT returns. Mr Athol Cowley, controller of the tariff and statistical office at Customs in Southend, who is co-ordinating Intrastat, says: 'We are relatively happy with the way things are going. My feeling is that we will achieve a pretty high state of readiness.' Yet by the end of last month, planned visits by UK local customs officials had still not been made to 5,000 of the top 30,000 EC traders in Britain. Recent internal figures show that some 6,000 traders declaring EC trade on their VAT returns had done so incorrectly. Mr Solomons of Wilson &amp; Kyle is unconvinced. 'It'll be a terrible shambles in January everywhere,' he says. 'There's no question about that.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday denied that British industrialists were unaware of potential European markets, saying on BBC radio that inquiries to his department were running at 1,000 a week, writes Ralph Atkins. But he confirmed that the UK is reviewing how EC directives have been implemented.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NO.1 TIGERS TARGET, BUT RUTGERS MISSES  </P> <P> Missouri Coach Norm Stewart insisted that his team's No. 1 ranking had no  effect on his players, but it clearly inspired visiting Rutgers Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "We came in here with everything to gain and nothing to lose," Rutgers (8-10)  forward Curtis Hughes said after Missouri held on for an 89-84 victory in its  first game atop the Associated Press poll. "We had fun all night."  </P> <P> It was not fun for the Tigers (18-1), who didn't seal their 27th consecutive  home victory until Travis Ford made two free throws with six seconds to play.  </P> <P> "I honestly don't see any effect," said Stewart, whose team became No. 1 this  week after beating then-No. 1 Kansas on Saturday. "I hope we can keep some  order. I think our guys are loose."  </P> <P> Missouri led only 82-79 when the Tigers' John McIntyre made a three-pointer  with 1:42 to play. McIntyre made 10 of 15 shots, including five of eight  three-pointers, and scored a career-high 25 points.  </P> <P> "I thought he must have been standing out of bounds, that was such a long  shot," Rutgers Coach Bob Wenzel said. "They should have given him five for  that."  </P> <P> "I told John, 'You're not looking for the shot. You won't shoot unless you  look,' " Stewart said. "Tonight there was no hesitation. We have good shooters.  We have to look for it and take it outside. Before, McIntyre was looking  inside."  </P> <P> No. 11 Syracuse 83, Pittsburgh 74 -- Billy Owens scored 23 points and led a  second-half run by the Orangemen in a Big East game at Syracuse.  </P> <P> The Orangemen (13-3 overall, 4-3 in the conference) ended a two-game losing  streak. Pitt (6-10, 1-5) had won three consecutive visits to the Carrier Dome.  </P> <P> Syracuse's Derrick Coleman had 21 points, and his 10 rebounds made him the  all-time leader in Big East games. His 606 rebounds in conference play put him  ahead of Patrick Ewing, now of the New York Knicks, who had 597.  </P> <P> Tennessee 78, No. 24 Alabama 70 -- Freshman Carlus Groves scored seven of his  nine points in a key stretch midway through the second half for the Volunteers  in a Southeastern Conference game at Knoxville, Tenn.  </P> <P> Greg Bell scored 21 points and Allan Houston added 18 for Tennessee (10-6,  5-2). Alabama (13-5, 4-3) was led by David Benoit's 22 points. Tennessee made  seven of its first eight shots and took a 15-2 lead in less than four minutes.  </P> <P> But Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson switched his team to a zone defense and slowed  the Volunteers. Alabama got as close as three points several times in the  second half but could get no closer.  </P> <P> Seton Hall 81, Boston College 66 -- Michael Cooper scored a career-high 26  points and freshman Terry Dehere added a career-best 24 points, helping the  Pirates end a four-game losing streak in a Big East game at East Rutherford,  N.J.  </P> <P> The losing streak was the longest for the Pirates (9-7, 2-4) since the 1986-87  season. Boston College (6-10, 0-7) suffered its seventh consecutive loss.  </P></p>

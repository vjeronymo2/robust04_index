			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / North Korea cleared in arms row Radioactive fuel rods removed from North Korea's nuclear reactor are still under the supervision of international inspectors and have not been diverted to make bomb-grade plutonium, US officials said yesterday. North Korea's decision to press ahead with the discharge of fuel from its reactor without making proper inspection arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency constituted 'a serious safeguards violation,' officials said, but the situation could still be retrieved. 'The IAEA, in fact, has told us that it is confident there is no diversion of the fuel that has just been discharged,' said Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, describing this as a hopeful sign. On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea. Tension over the refuelling of the North Korean reactor has centred on the IAEA's ability to ensure continuous monitoring of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities. Inspectors want to be able to reconstruct the reactor's operating history in order to verify that North Korea did not remove more fuel than it declared during a previous discharge in 1989. To do this, they must set aside a precise sample of the fuel rods from the current discharge for a later analysis to determine the isotopic burn-up, which would yield proof of North Korea's declarations. With the discharged rods now in a storage pond, it is still possible to reach agreement on this sample, but US officials warned that if North Korea did not suspend the discharge, as IAEA officials have asked, or reach a quick agreement with the IAEA on the sampling methodology, the opportunity for this type of analysis could be lost. 'If the fuel is discharged without preserving the opportunity for this kind of analysis, then it's irrevocably lost,' said Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads the US policy steering group on Korea.</p>

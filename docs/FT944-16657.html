			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Welpac loss deepens Shares in Welpac fell by 3p to 14p yesterday after the hardware and gardening products maker reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.25m for the half year to July 31. There were losses of Pounds 138,000 last time although continuing operations produced a Pounds 1,000 profit. The result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 25,000), being redundancy costs of Pounds 144,000 and an Pounds 80,000 loss on the termination of a supply arrangement. Mr Gerald Lavender, chairman, said the 'extremely disappointing' results were largely because of a fall in turnover, particularly in the second quarter when sales were 26 per cent below budget. Turnover of continuing operations declined to Pounds 7.88m (Pounds 10.1m). Interest charges fell to Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 266,000) partly because of the Pounds 2.64m received from the placing and open offer in May. Losses per share deepened to 3.2p (0.5p). Mr Peter Dixon, who has been appointed a director, will take over as non-executive chairman in February. Mr Lavender retires from the board at the 1995 AGM.</p>

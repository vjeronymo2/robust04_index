			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Renewed doubts over economy A FEEBLE rise in bank and building society lending last month suggests that the lowest base rates for 16 years have done little to entice people and companies to borrow more. Weak M4 lending, and the prospect of further heavy job cuts in the construction industry, yesterday cast new doubt on the strength of the economy. But reports of improved optimism among businesses, further signs of a slight upturn in the housing market and buoyant growth of cash and notes in circulation indicated that some sort of recovery may be under way. Yesterday's mixed signals on the UK economy will not make it any easier for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to decide whether to cut base rates below 7 per cent ahead of the Budget on March 16. Bank of England figures showed that M4 lending rose by Pounds 200m last month, an improvement on the November figure when lending fell by Pounds 600m, but significantly less than economists' expectations. The annual growth rate of M4 - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - was similarly sluggish. It hit a record low and dropped through the bottom limit of the government's recently announced monitor range of 4-8 per cent. M4 fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent on the month, to rise by 3.7 per cent in the year to December. This compares with 4.6 per cent in the year to November. By contrast narrow money, which comprises mainly notes and coins in circulation, rose by 0.2 per cent in December, taking the seasonally-adjusted annual growth to 3 per cent. Weekly figures for notes and coins in circulation indicate that the buoyancy of M0 has continued this month with some economists estimating that the annual rate for January will exceed 4 per cent. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, said the discrepancy between the two sets of figures could be explained by debt overhang. The Treasury said two special factors had depressed the growth of M4 last month; the purchase of debt by the government from British Telecommunications and the electricity holding companies, and the switch by big companies to monthly payments of value added tax. Figures from the British Bankers Association yesterday confirmed the sluggish nature of private and corporate sector lending. Total sterling lending by the nine biggest UK banking groups to the UK private sector fell by more than Pounds 1.7bn in December, the second fall in four months.</p>

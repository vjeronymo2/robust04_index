			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CS BAKERSFIELD CRUSHES CSUN IN SWIMMING  </P> <P> On the surface, Friday's meeting between the Cal State Northridge and Cal State  Bakersfield men's swim teams had the makings of a highly competitive dual meet.  </P> <P> Bakersfield, the four-time defending NCAA Division II and five-time California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion, came into the meet ranked first nationally.  Northridge, ranked third, has won nine national titles.  </P> <P> But the anticipated classic meet never materialized as Bakersfield swam away  with a convincing 178-56 decision.  </P> <P> In the women's competition, Northridge (7-1), the three-time defending national  champion, had no difficulty handling Bakersfield (2-5), winning, 142-33. "It  was an embarrassing loss," Northridge Coach Pete Accardy said, referring to the  men's meet. "We just swam terrible. Bakersfield has a good team and there is no  way that we could have beaten them today, especially because we are weak in  diving this year. However, I thought that the swimming part would be close."  </P> <P> It wasn't.  </P> <P> Bakersfield won 11 of the 13 events, including the 400-yard freestyle and  medley relays, and swept the 200-yard backstroke.  </P> <P> Even Bakersfield Coach Ernie Maglischo was surprised with the margin of  victory.  </P> <P> "We were really motivated for the meet," he said. "I'm ecstatic. We swam some  really good unshaven times for this time of the year despite training through  the meet. It's great to win, but it doesn't mean much. We're pointing for the  CCAA meet (Feb. 15-18)."  </P> <P> Accardy also is looking ahead.  </P> <P> "It's an emotional rivalry, but it's only a dual meet." he said. "I didn't  expect to see fast times, but I was upset with how slow we swam. I hope we  learned something."  </P> <P> Ted Hollahan was the bright spot for the CSUN men, winning the 100- and  200-yard freestyles in 46.65 seconds and 1:40.53.  </P> <P> In the 200 freestyle, Hollahan and Bakersfield's Brent Katzer battled on even  terms over the last 25 yards, but Hollahan touched the wall ahead of Katzer  (1:40.64).  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors won all 10 events, sweeping six. Lisa Dial won three events  -- the 200 backstroke (2:22.08), 200 breaststroke (2:35.60) and 1,000 freestyle  (10:44.26).  </P> <P> Toady Kimble, the national leader in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle races, won  those events in 25.22 and 55.97.  </P></p>

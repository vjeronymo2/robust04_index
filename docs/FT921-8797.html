			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities sustain their trading range THE FLOOD of bad news on the corporate and economic fronts was stemmed yesterday by satisfactory inflation data and the UK stock market bounced convincingly after testing the lower end of its current trading range. The market fell heavily in early trading when BP came under renewed selling pressure, after a breakfast meeting with the board had done little or nothing to change the bearish views of analysts in the City of London; however, BP shares rallied later when the new session on Wall Street brought US buyers for stock in Britain's premier oil group. Unsettled from the outset by the falls in US and Tokyo equity sectors, the London market followed the lead of the BP share price and a loss of 22 points brought the FT-SE Index to 2,500.6. Traders held their breath as this important support level was tested but, with an equally significant 2,520 mark on the FT-SE March futures contract successfully held, the stock market began to rally. BP bottomed out at the same time but continued to dominate the market by virtue of its very heavy turnover. The latest retail price statistics, announced at mid-morning, indicated an annualised inflation rate of only 4.1 per cent in January, significantly better than most City expectations. The inflation statistics helped offset the announcement of a further fall in manufacturing and industrial production in December. However, the market's losses were only partially recovered and the more convincing rally did not come until after Wall Steet opened the new session with a minor fall, and displayed support for BP shares. With Wall Street closed on Monday, London remained wary of the New York market, in spite of its 30.18 Dow fall on Thursday. Trading volume in UK equities picked up significantly in the afternoon, when BP shares were no longer playing a leading role. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,513.9, a net loss of 8.7 on the day and of 3.3 on the first week of the equity account. Although unconvinced that this week's flow of economic distress will prompt a cut in base rates, equity strategists regained confidence after yesterday's rally in the Footsie from the 2,500 area. Long-dated UK government bonds lost half a point yesterday, but trading volume was not on any great scale. 'UK equities are good value at these levels from a purely domestic view,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. But there is still concern over the outlook for Wall Street and also for Tokyo in the wake of its latest political scandals. Retail volume in equities has fallen heavily as political and economic worries proliferate and is now below last year's average daily levels.</p>

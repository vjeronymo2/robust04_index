			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / SDP rejects fresh polls in Nigeria NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party, the apparent victor in an aborted presidential election last month, has refused to take part in a new poll sought by the military government. On Monday night President Ibrahim Babangida withdrew his offer to let the SDP and the rival National Republican convention form an interim government of unelected civilians and replace his eight-year regime on August 27, the scheduled date for completing the transition to democracy. The NRC has always said it would prefer another election. Yesterday the government said an interim government would have invited instability. The president used similar reasons to explain anulment of the June election, in which Mr Moshood Abiola, the SDP candidate, was ahead when counting was halted. A group of leading Nigerians including two ex-heads of state condemned the government's action and demanded that 'the Babangida administration be terminated forthwith'.</p>

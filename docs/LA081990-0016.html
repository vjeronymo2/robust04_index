			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LADIES HOME PRISON  </P> <P> Jack Smith's essay bothered me. I'm 30 years old, and my contribution to our  family income is the five house-cleaning jobs I do every week.  </P> <P> In a society where essentially no one remains at home to carry on with "dreary  and isolated drudgery," workers like myself are critically in demand and can  command a respectable wage for our services.  </P> <P> The sincere gratitude I receive from the working moms makes me a little sad;  they often seem so frazzled when they get home. Their dependency on my service  makes me feel guilty when I have to quit a job at their house. There may be  some hard looking before they will find a trustworthy, responsible replacement  to come into their home. But it's always easier for me to clean for a single  person or a couple rather than a family of four. If I have to let a client go  because of my own time constraints, families are the first to go. It seems like  a tough approach, but I'm running a business, after all.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH BLAKE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

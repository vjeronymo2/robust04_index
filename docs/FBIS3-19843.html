			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by political editor Pekka Vaisanen: "It Hasn't Been </F> Cut Off, But It Won't Save Us Either"]    [Text] Finland is seeking a 2-billion-markka regional  subsidy pot in the negotiaitons with the EU [European Union].  The subsidy will by no means be like a dinner for Manu [a  banquet for President Mauno (Manu) Koivisto]: Finland will have  to contribute more than the same amount out of its own pocket.  Nor will the money be given as a lump sum, but for carefully  examined projects. If Finns' own funds and ideas run out, the  flow of money from Brussels will also come to an end.    The EU's latest offer of a new subsidy for sparsely settled  areas came like a cold shower to the province governors. If the  EU sticks to its offer, Finland will not get EU supersubsidy  areas either.    Only last November the regional subsidy offer was outlined  during the negotiations with the EU as a way of making  reparations for farm sector losses. Finland was promised  altogether five of the most important EU areas, that is,  category one areas. In many of the provinces they were already  jumping for joy.    At that time doubters had already raised the question as to  what the subsidy funds could be used for. The EU grants category  one aid for the development of infrastructure, that is, the  construction of roads, communications networks, hospitals, and  schools, among others. In Finland most of these have already  been built.    Eric Hayes, EU ambassador to Finland, recently also wondered  at the emphasis placed on category one subsidies with reference  to Finland's goals. According to him, [these subsidies] are not  a "gold mine" for a country like Finland, which is already built  up, especially since this aid also requires investments on one's  own part. In Hayes' opinion, subsidies for rural areas could be  more useful for Finland.  <H5>  Only One Fly in the Ointment </H5>   What counts chiefly for regional aid per se in Finland are  subsidies disbursed to businesses, funds granted to the  provinces, and funds to promote jobs. These funds for regional  development account for a total of over 3 billion markkas in the  budget. Calculated in another way, over 20 billion can be found  in the national budget. The money is in part transferred to the  provincial governments on the basis of regional policy  principles as aid for jobs, road-building funds, and  supplementary aid for agriculture.    EU regional policy would to a certain extent limit the  subsidies Finland disburses to businesses, but it will not put a  stop to them. Domestic regional policy will be preserved, but it  will be transformed. Actually, the administration has for years  now been shaping a system that conforms to the way EU funds are  distributed.    "Regional policy reform has really been effected precisely  with EU funding in mind. And we are noticeably farther advanced  in this than Sweden and Norway," regional development adviser  Risto Tienari of the Interior Ministry boasted.    In the national budget there are already in practice  ready-made regional development subsidies, the national share of  which required for EU projects can easily be separated from the  rest. The EU share generally accounts for 50 percent at most.  The EU grants only a small percentage of this for business  ventures.    Tienari does not believe that Finns will run out of ideas or  money. He relies on the conviction that there will be enough  meaningful infrastructure, education, and business projects over  the next few years.  <H5>  Pohjois-Savo in the Vanguard </H5>   There is optimism elsewhere than in the Interior Ministry as  well. Several provincial associations are already groping for EU  subsidies and mapping support bases. The Pohjois-Savo  Association, among others, is in the vanguard of these efforts.    Province manager Antti Mykkanen is counting on his  province's  getting the Varkaus area included in the aid for industrial  areas in decline program. The EU would release 9.6 million  markkas a year for it over a three-year period. The money could  be used for, among other things, improvement of Varkaus-Joroinen  Airport, repairing the Number 5 Highway, and investments in  paper-making machines for the Ahlstrom Company.    Mykkanen is also counting on getting 34 million markkas a  year in rural area subsidies. This aid could be used for a joint  Stromsdal Company and Koillis-Savo communities cardboard and  lumber venture and the construction of an Iisalmi bypass road,  among other things.    If Finland gets its version of the new category six aid  accepted, there would also be aid for the regional communities  of Koillis-Savo and Yla-Savo, altogether about 70 million  markkas, Mykkanen estimates.    On the west coast the Satakunta Association has been so  interested in the new subsidies that it has even tested out its  calculations on the EU Commission. The association expects to  get the Pori-Rauma area classified as an EU industrial area in  decline. They could get 180 million markkas from the EU for  various development projects, but Finland -- businesses, local  communities, and the national government -- would also have to  invest 900 million markkas.  <H5>  Will the State Cut Its Aid for Rural Areas? </H5>   Mykkanen and his colleagues' enthusiasm over or realism with  regard to the EU has given rise to terror in the Agricultural  Producers Association (MTK), among others. There they estimate  that the subsidies received from the EU would only cover a small  part of the provinces' potential losses.    The MTK's rural area man, Jukka Pekka Kataja, estimates that  the regional aid provided by the EU would come to about a  billion while, on the other hand, membership in the EU would  reduce the state's revenue from taxes on manufactured goods and  value-added tax by over 15 billion markkas. Kataja estimates  that, as a result, the state will have to reduce its own  investments in the regions corresponding to EU aid.    "The EU's category one subsidy funds will account for maybe  one-tenth of what the state itself uses for similar purposes,  that is, for roads, education, unemployment relief, and  environmental protection," Kataja compared the two.    A report made in Sweden a couple of years ago estimates that  EU membership will reduce the state's contributions to the  provinces and that the number of public sector jobs will be  considerably reduced. Because of the report, opposition to the  EU increased among the Social Democrats, among others, and in  the provinces.    According to MTK estimates, farm sector gross income would  drop by at least 500 million markkas in Pojhois-Savo. In that  organization they believe that the drop in gross income will be  reflected more extensively in rural sector activities.    Province manager Mykkanen estimates that membership in the  EU  will cost Pohjois-Savo 400 million markkas. Of this, 300 million  would be the province's share of Finland's EU membership fee.  The drop in tax revenue from farmers would deprive the province  of 100 million.  <H5>  Problems May Pile Up in Outlying Areas </H5>   According to Mykkanen, EU membership would cause a "small  dip" in the 1995-96 regional economy. After that, industry and  tourism would begin to reduce the deficit. "We'll pull through  any situation here, that's for sure," Mykkanen said  optimistically. "But we won't accept the EU's offer regarding  agriculture and regional policy."    The Interior Ministry's Tienari feels that what is important  in the negotiations with the EU is a solution to the agriculture  problem that preserves production in at least eastern and  northern Finland. "It is very important that there be as little  change as possible in agriculture precisely there since it is in  those areas that there are now already other major regional  problems."    Tienari noted that in some provinces primary production and  the public sector provide employment for as much as from 50 to  60 percent of the work force. "If the number of public and farm  sector jobs decreases at the same time, these problems may very  quickly come to a head."</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Zapatistas ready for talks Mexico's Zapatista rebels are willing to restart stalled peace talks with the government, according to Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in the negotiations. The talks have been stalled since March 2, when the government laid out its formal response to rebel demands. On March 24 the Zapatistas suspended consultations with their supporters on the government offer after the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Since then the state of Chiapas has become increasingly tense, as landlords and poor farmers have fought over land and political power. Bishop Ruiz said the Zapatistas had asked him to explore ways of restarting the dialogue.</p>

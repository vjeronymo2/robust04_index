			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A communique from the Office of the President  broadcast in Kigali has just announced the setting up of the  transitional institutions this Wednesday, 23 February at 1000.  The president of the Republic announces that he was obliged to  take the measure since the political parties, he says, have not  come to an agreement, and the country is slowly plunging into  insecurity.    How will the decision, which must have been motivated by the  extent of the demonstrations which followed the assassination of  the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, the late  Felicien Gatabazi, be viewed by the parties concerned. To get  an answer, we must wait for their reaction, in particular that  of the prime minister designate to lead the transition, Faustin  Twagiramungu. The head of state declared that he was waiting for  a visit from the Rwandan prime minister-designate to discuss the  program for the setting up of the institutions tomorrow.</p>

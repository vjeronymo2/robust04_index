			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "More on Christopher's </F> Article"]    [Text] Since the article written by [U.S. Secretary of  State Warren] Christopher while he was in Saudi Arabia was  published in the THE NEW YORK TIMES last Friday [29 April] did  not add anything new to the declared U.S. stand concerning the  blockade on Iraq, why then was he in such a hurry to write this  article and to publish it in THE NEW YORK TIMES, of all U.S.  papers?    In our humble estimation, the U.S. secretary of state wrote  his article, which was full of the usual stupid U.S. fallacies  and allegations, in order to reassure his allies and "hosts,"  the Saudi rulers, and possibly the Kuwaiti rulers as well, to  convince them that another article published by THE NEW YORK  TIMES, following the shooting down of the two U.S. helicopters  in northern Iraq, which called for a revision of the entire U.S.  policy toward Iraq, did not express the opinion of any of the  U.S. decisionmaking institutions but merely the opinion of the  writer himself. When the secretary of state writes in THE NEW  YORK TIMES he definitely expresses the official U.S. viewpoint  and the U.S. position on the blockade.    It seems to us that the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, who must  have paid a handsome political and financial reward for the  Christopher article, were not reassured and did not believe that  what Christopher alone writes really expresses the U.S.  position. In fact, they are justified in not feeling reassured,  because they are not ignorant of the fact that what is written  in this paper is not very far from the viewpoints of the U.S.  decisionmakers, or some of them at least!</p>

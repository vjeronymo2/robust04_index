We will build a  single economic space with Russia," Tajikistan's leader Emomali  Rakhmonov said at a meeting with local activists in the  mountainous region of Tajikabad on 12 May.    "We discussed these questions with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin and government chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin," Rakhmonov  said.    At present the heads of government of the two countries are  busy drafting relevant bilateral agreements to cover all  economic aspects of the merger -- banking, customs, and taxation.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Significant' fall in Russian gold output predicted Russia's gold production is set to fall steeply next year, according to some analysts. The drop could be as much as 30 per cent, suggests Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. Ms Natalia Zubareva, representative to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States for the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, thinks that Russia's gold output will remain steady at about 130 tonnes this year but see a 'significant' fall in 1994. Mr Smith cites three main reason for the expected fall: shortages of resources; the black market; and obstacles to foreign investment. More than half Russian gold production comes from two areas, Magadan and the Sakha republic, but by the end of August Sakha had received only 30 per cent of its food and only half of its fuel from Moscow. The republic has publicly warned that it may have to sell its gold and diamond output outside the centrally-controlled organisations to meet its needs. Mr Smith says interior ministry data shows that about 30 per cent of Magadan's 40 tonnes of gold output last year was sold on the black market. Other factors depressing output are a steep fall in production of mining equipment and a quadrupling of electricity prices in the far east of the country. Only 46 per cent of the minimum funds required were allocated to the region for geological purposes in the second half of this year. In a recent speech to the Western Gold Show in San Francisco, Ms Zubareva also stressed that ties between mines and equipment suppliers in different parts of the former Soviet Union were breaking down, that the mineral resource base was deteriorating and delays in state payments to producers were causing great difficulty to the CIS gold industry. She said that in recent years investment in gold mining had fallen but it had now reached the stage where there was no investment at all. China is the world's sixth biggest gold producer, Mr Cui Dewen, vice-president of the Metallurgical Industry Ministry's gold administration, told Xinhua news agency, reports Reuter from Beijing. During the past 14 years, production had increased at an average rate of more than 10 per cent, he said, but gave no details. He claimed more than 20 companies from a dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Australia and South Africa, had shown interest in investing in China's gold mines. China would have an 'active attitude' towards Sino-foreign co-operation in gold production, Mr Cui said, with the departments concerned drawing up detailed policies. 'Readjustment of the gold price (in September) stimulated China's gold production,' he said. 'Some original gold markets have appeared around gold mines and more efforts must be made to standardise these.' On September 1 the People's Bank, the sole legal buyer, raised the state purchase price to 10 per cent below the international price, converting at the exchange rate on national swap markets.</p>

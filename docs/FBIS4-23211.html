			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 31 May (AFP) -- The national committee of  Etienne Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress,  UDPS, the main radical opposition party in Zaire, today  criticized France's activities in Rwanda and its "accomplice,"  Mobutu.    In a communique, the UDPS criticized the "cynical" support  by  French leaders, from both left and right, to former President  Habyarimana's "criminal policies," and stressed that it is  advisable "to point out the highly negative role played by  Mobutu, the accomplice of French imperialism, in the name of a  badly understood and poorly assimilated so-called francophone  movement."    The statement continued: "The UDPS stigmatizes the hypocrisy  of both France and Mobutu, who are indecently trying to cover up  their crimes by organizing a meeting in Nairobi on 6 June (...)."    Finally, the UDPS "condemns in the strongest terms the  presence of Mr. Mobutu and France at this ill-timed meeting in  Nairobi, and called on its fighters in Kenya and on all justice,  democracy, and peace-loving persons to prevent, by all means,  the holding of this parody, which is a disgrace to Africa."    Newspapers close to the radical opposition also took up  these  attacks against France, criticizing France's African policy in  general and accusing it of continuing to "support dictators."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "Vladimir Volfovich--a Pure </F> Russian! But Sometimes a Little Jewish"]    [Text] Let us engage in some racism. It is a shameful  pastime, but it is entertaining. It is especially pleasant to do  this at night on the eve of the nativity of Jesus Iosifovich  Christ. He is now God, but when he was crucified he was a poor  Jew, the son of Mary and Joseph, the great-great-great grandson  of Solomon, David... (there is more detail on Jesus Christ's  genealogy in the Gospels).    You will not find a Russian named Volf on any kind of church  calendars and, indeed, anywhere at all. Such fantasies do not  exist among Russian parents, although it, fantasy, is very  rich--it allows itself Adolf, and Elzevir, and Akakiy, and  Dazdraperm (Long live the first of May).    In German, Volf means wolf. In small-town Jewish  pronunciation--it is Vulf. Volfson, Vulfson are typical Jewish  last names; in a literal translation--the son of Volf (wolf plus  sohn).    On 14 December, at 1500 hours (it is nice to be precise),  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy explained his nationality. This  happened at his press conference at the International Press Club  (Slavyanskaya Hotel) in the presence of 500 journalists.    Zhirinovskiy, as is well known, answers any question  forcefully and rapidly. So rapidly that he does not have the  time to think about logic. Therefore, concerning the humiliating  position of the Russians, he promises to correct this matter,  for "there are too many persons of a certain nationality on  television." But to the question about racism, he angrily denies  having anything to do with it: He says, I love all nations, it  will be good for everyone, and it will be bad only for enemies.    When my turn came, I asked:    "You declared that there will be 99 percent Russians in your  government. How do you intend to determine their nationality?"    Zhirinovskiy set out to show that it was necessary for  Russia  to have a purely Russian Government. One can argue here, for  Russia needs intelligent PEOPLE, and not questionnaires and  genealogies. Let us say that many would agree on Margaret  Thatcher. But I had no wish to argue. I wanted to get a direct  answer to a direct question. And I interrupted the fuhrer:    "Excuse me, but you did not answer: HOW AND ACCORDING TO  WHAT  FEATURES will you identify Russians? According to the shape of  the nose? According to a blood analysis? Explain the METHOD of  identification.    Zhirinovskiy did not like this. He angrily uttered the  irreproachably liberal formula:    "He who considers himself Russian is Russian. He who  considers himself a Jew is a Jew. He who considers himself a  Tatar is a Tatar.    This is a noble approach. It can even be said that it is  Jewish. In 1990, while in Israel for four days, I saw a lot of  Russian people there who had immigrated on forged documents. I  even became acquainted with a cheerful girl, Klava from  Leningrad, who, chuckling, related how for a small payment she  became a Jewess, "having lost" her old passport.    In Jerusalem I asked a highly placed MFA [Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs] official how Russians who arrive on forged documents  are treated? He waved his hand indifferently.    "We do not force anyone to pull down his pants. If a person  calls himself a Jew--he is a Jew."    It is accepted that Zhirinovskiy is of the same opinion. But  soon a foreign journalist, who spoke Russian fairly well, got to  the microphone.    "Mr. Zhirinovskiy! Everyone is quoting your words that your  mother is Russian, and your father is a lawyer. The inference is  made from this that your father is a Jew. How is this reconciled  with your anti-Semitism, and is it not time to answer precisely  the question about your nationality?"    Everyone gasped. No one yet had the courage to ask a  question  about this anecdotal Russian-juridical hybrid. Zhirinovskiy  answered brilliantly!    "This was fabricated by newspapermen. I never said that my  mother was a Russian, and my father--a lawyer. It is simply that  I answered questions at one rally. I read the question: What is  your mother's nationality?' I answered: `She is Russian.' After  a certain time, I get a piece of paper. I read the question:  `What is your father's profession' I answered: `A lawyer.' But  what was I supposed to do. Imagine, I get the question: What is  my father's profession, and I answer--Russian. I would be called  insane!"    The audience laughed and applauded. One needs talent to  extricate oneself so brilliantly. Even if he lied, it was still  brilliant.    Further, Zhirinovskiy explained his genealogy all the way  back to his grandfathers and grandmothers. `ALL ARE PURE  RUSSIANS, THERE ARE NO KINDS OF MIXTURES.' The parents of the  father, it is true, are from Poland, but, after all, Poland is  not a state, it is one of the Russian provinces...    That is the way it is.    But it was different recently.    I have an interesting document in my hands.    The form: "Communist Party of the Soviet Union. CENTRAL  COMMITTEE." Stamp: "Top Secret."    "Excerpt from protocol No. 101 of the meeting of the  Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee 29 March 1983.    Concerning the establishment of an Anti-Zionist Committee of  the Soviet public    1. To concur in the proposal of the propaganda department of  the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR KGB to establish an  Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet public.    2. To confirm the staffs and official salaries...    5. To confirm the nomenclature of the positions of the CPSU  Central Committee for the Anti-Zionist Committee...    7. To publish the appeal of the initiative group to Soviet  society in the newspapers PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA,  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the journals NOVOYE VREMYA, SOVETICHE  HEIMLAND, and newspapers of the Union republics and the Jewish  Autonomous Oblast...    8. To instruct the propaganda department of the CPSU Central  Committee to examine jointly with the USSR KGB plans for the  work of the committee and to render the necessary assistance in  their implementation."    There are secret attachments to this Top Secret protocol:  about rates of pay, material-technical support (the building,  the Kremlin telephone exchange, high frequency, a polyclinic of  the Fourth Administration (with members of families),  automobiles...); expenditures in rubles and hard currency for  international activity...    The Soviet people could not even imagine how much the  struggle against Zionism cost it, and more specifically the  state anti-Semitism of the CPSU and the KGB. Dozens (and perhaps  hundreds) of fighters against Zionism travelled throughout the  world: to Austria, Argentina, Israel, Spain, Italy, the United  States, France, the FRG, and Sweden. The countries are all  somehow sick with Zionism. If at least someone would help the  fight against Zionism in Mongolia, Poland, and Bulgaria...    But it soon became clear: The West perceived the  Anti-Zionist  Committee of the Soviet public as it should have--as communist  propaganda and a KGB cover. And then the Anti-Zionist Committee  (without making a show of it) established the Jewish society  Sholom.    Sholom did not have an open association with the CPSU  Central  Committee and the KGB, and--according to the plan of its  creators--was supposed to become for the West the authentic  voice of the Soviet Jews. Comrade Vladimir Volfovich  Zhirinovskiy spoke at a Sholom organizational meeting. He  sensibly and clearly commented on the charter. He introduced his  candidacy for the election list of the leadership of the Jewish  society Sholom. And--as a result of the vote--became a member of  the council.    Thus in 1988 Comrade Zhirinovskiy became a member of the  council of the Jewish society Sholom.    To my question as to whether the members of the Sholom  society clarified Zhirinovskiy's nationality, one of the leaders  at that time answered:    Sholom was established by Jews, they created a Jewish  society. All the members and all the leaders were Jewish. This  goes without saying. In addition, Zhirinovskiy's face and accent  are rather characteristic.    We have a remarkable country. If people like you, you are  Russian. If they do not like you--you are a Yid.    Lenin's grandfather was liked--he was Russian; people  stopped  liking him--he became a Jewish Kalmyk. Yeltsin was liked--he was  Russian. He became disliked--he became Eltsin. And Solzhenitsyn  was Solzhenitser, and Sakharov--Tsukerman.    WHEN THE COUNTRY ORDERS YOU TO BE A JEW, anyone will become  a  Jew!    This clear, sincere, vital (bloody) argument made many  Soviet  people shake with feeling.    When the newspaper DEN started to hate Yeltsin--they wrote  about him: Eltsin is the ringleader of the occupiers, the puppet  of the Jewish-Masonic lobby.    When MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS and other democrats see Volfson  (that is to say, Volfovich), we also first of all expose the Jew  in him.    Because we are a united people, and we like to drink  (something on Easter, something on 7 November). And why should  we examine the nuances of the anticrisis program when there is  such a native, pleasant, usual, and simple method of determining  who is a friend and who is an enemy.    We are a united people. Only in our country 90 percent of  the  jokes are built on national arrogance: topknots, Yids, Chukchi,  Armyashki...    We roll with laughter, while a foreigner, if he understood  the joke, blushes and diverts his eyes. This is not funny in his  country. It is improper. It is forbidden.    Well, the hell with them! We will enjoy ourselves.    "What is the fastest animal in the world?"    "A cheetah?"    "No a Chechen in a Mercedes!"    These are dangerous jokes. People may laugh, or they may  kill.    But he who was always despised in Russia was he who  repudiated his own father. If you betray your father, you will  betray your fatherland also.    There he is--forceful, zealous, clever, an elusive liar,  clambering to the top. Like a Jewish member of the council of  the Sholom society. Like a Russian member of the State Duma.    He is horrible! The whole world held its breath! Parliaments  are meeting in fear. The Group of Seven, the UN Assembly, and  the Baltics are trembling!..    And before whom? Just who is he? Who the hell knows!    Whether he is a schizophrenic (typical speech: rapid,  without  thinking, without pausing, wound up. Saltykov-Shchedrin's  "little organ": I will pull apart! I will destroy!) Whether he  is a paranoiac (there are enemies, enemies, enemies all around).  Whether he is a child of the Lubyanka; he had his fill, matured,  broke away from the leash, and started his own game, but the  confused Lubyanka is not able like Taras Bulba: "I gave you  life--I can take it away."    In 1988--a Jew; in 1993--a pure Russian...    Oh, how I understand you, Vladimir Volfovich! It is  sometimes  the same with me. I wake up in the morning--like a Russian; the  weather outside the window is Russian, the books on the shelves  are only Russian. But when I watch you on TV, and your little  falcons--no, I am still a Jew. Although Russian also.    P.S. Grow a moustache, Vladimir Volfovich, for heaven's  sake,  it is about time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko: "We Become Partners in </F> European Security"]    [Text] In Brussels yesterday at the NATO headquarters  Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the  framework document of the "partnership for peace" program and  the bilateral "Russia-NATO" protocol which proclaims at official  level the sides' agreement to cooperate in the political,  military, and military-technical fields.    Commenting on this event, the head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry explained that it is a case of the two programs  starting simultaneously. One of them, "Russia-NATO," reflects  Russian priorities in cooperation with the alliance while the  other, NATO's "partnership for peace," reflects the North  Atlantic Alliance's proposals which have been accepted by the  Russian side. The two programs, Kozyrev said, do not contradict  each other but on the contrary supplement each other.    It is symbolic that the ceremony of Russia's accession to  the  "partnership for peace" program took place 22 June, on the  anniversary of the start of the Great Patriotic War, one of  whose results was the world's division into two opposing camps.  Having become the West's partner in European and global  security, Russia has thus overcome one more frontier on the path  toward a civilized world community. Here, NATO Deputy Secretary  General Sergio Balanzino stressed, Russia is the only superpower  in Europe and it will continue to retain this status. Without  it it is impossible to achieve success in building a new, secure  Europe.</p>

The PLO would continue its efforts to achieve a "precise and  faithful implementation" of the September 13 autonomy deal, he  said.    'Arafat spoke after briefing Tunisian President Zine El  Abidine Ben Ali on the PLO-Israel security pact signed in Cairo  on Wednesday, which overcame some of the obstacles to launching  self rule.    Israel's withdrawal is due to be completed by April 13.    The two sides will resume talks in Egypt on Monday to  finalize agreement on autonomy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow 19 May ITAR-TASS -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe arrived in Moscow today on his first visit to  Russia. Juppe's goal is to get a better idea of the fundamental  economic transformations which are taking place in Russia, to  give a push to the development of bilateral cooperation between  Paris and Moscow, and to improve the effectiveness of the two  countries' cooperation in resolving international problems.    "Contacts between the French and Russian leaders are  maintained regularly. They have already become a good  tradition, reinforced by the 1992 Russian-French agreement", the  foreign minister told ITAR-TASS before his departure. "Russia  is one of the world's great powers and is rich in cultural  traditions and in her ability to renew herself, which is most of  all thanks to, I am convinced, the Russian people".    Juppe's itinerary for his three-day visit is extremely  packed, including meetings and talks with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, leaders in the government and parliament, Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  The top priority in the talks will belong to questions of  economic and political mutual cooperation, including along the  Russia-European Union and "Big Seven" lines. The two sides will  also exchange opinions on ways to attract more French capital  into the Russian economy.    Among international problems, the French diplomat intends to  discuss with his Russian colleagues the Bosnian crisis, the  strengthening of European security through the realization of  the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme, the upcoming  international conference in Paris for the signing of the pact on  stability in Europe, and the state of affairs in the CIS "hot  spots" and their surrounding regions.    The foreign minister's unofficial activities will include  visits to Nizhniy Novgorod and St. Petersburg, a city which he  has wanted to visit for a long time.</p>

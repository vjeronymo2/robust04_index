Kravchuk: They were good, normal talks. We  discussed several problems. The first one, naturally, was the  nuclear problem; the second, the economic one, our relations  with the United States. We discussed questions connected with  tomorrow's signing of documents by the presidents of Russia, the  United States, and Ukraine. I think this is a great  breakthrough, a political breakthrough, an economic  breakthrough. The main thing is that we have succeeded in  resolving a very complicated global problem -- the nuclear one  -- in a civilized way, in the interests of our states, Russia,  Ukraine, and the United States, and, of course, of the entire  world.    Chernyshova: And what compromises have been made  by Ukraine and by Russia?    Kravchuk: Well, the compromises are natural. We  have reached an agreement. That is no longer a secret --  compensation for Ukraine's tactical nuclear weapons, and, of  course, the agreements which have already been signed on  strategic nuclear weapons, normal economic relations, normal  economic ties, the exclusion of any pressure, territorial  integrity of states, mutual respect, relations of partnership.  That is to say, frankly, that this is nothing new. It is all  generally accepted in the world. The only thing is that we have  so far been finding it very difficult to get accustomed to this.    Chernyshova: Will the Ukrainian parliament ratify  this agreement?    Kravchuk: I think it will ratify the agreement  because it is a good solution for everyone, including us. It is  good in that it increases our people's awareness that we are  being treated with respect, normally, as a country, as a state,  and not as some -- well -- secondary appendage. That is the  first point. Second, everything is being resolved fairly,  therefore the parliament must ratify. I am convinced of this.    Chernyshova: And tomorrow you will sign the  agreement?    Kravchuk: Absolutely!</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: FERMENT AT WINE-CONSCIOUS RESTAURANT  </P> <P> Robert Rogness, longtime wine director and maitre d'hotel at Joss, the  contemporary-style (and extremely wine-conscious) Chinese eatery on the Sunset  Strip, calls it "Chinese restaurant meltdown": Victor Fung, who was imported  from Hong Kong amid great fanfare last year to serve as head chef at the  establishment, has returned home. And, adds Rogness, Serry Osmena, "who had  come in as a significant partner, to the great benefit of the restaurant," has  severed her relationship with the restaurant as well, after a falling-out with  restaurant owner Cecile Tang -- who, Rogness says, "got upset when Serry was  listed in a review of Joss as one of the owners, even though that was true."  Now Rogness himself resigned from the establishment, he says, after the  proprietors failed to meet his demands regarding compensation and staff hiring  practices.  </P> <P> Is this, then, the end of Joss as we know it? By no means, Tang responds. To  begin with, she says, chef Fung is on temporary leave, and is expected to  return to the restaurant -- and in the meantime, his second-in-charge, Kan  Liam, who has been with Joss since it opened, continues to run the kitchen in  the same style. Tang further promises that the ambitious and innovative wine  program which Rogness developed for the restaurant will continue -- but now  under the direction of Napa Valley-based master sommelier Ronn Wiegand, who  will visit the restaurant on a regular basis and make frequent use of the fax  machine in updating the wine list and planning special events. (Wiegand helped  draw up the original wine list at Joss, before Rogness was hired.)  </P> <P> Regarding Serry Osmena, Tang says that, "She and I had talked about the  possibility of her becoming a partner, but it really didn't work out. There has  been no change in her relationship with us, then. If she were to become a  partner, that would be a change, because she has never been one."  </P> <P> Tang adds, though, that she is indeed on the lookout for a new maitre d'hotel.  </P> <P> Rogness, meanwhile, is teaching wine classes at UCLA, and has formed a  partnership with Osmena, with the idea of starting a new Iberian restaurant in  the Hollywood or West Hollywood area in a about a year's time. Rogness has also  formed what he calls an "umbrella group" for wine consulting and instruction,  called The Society for the Prevention of Jaded Palates. Under said umbrella, he  will host a series of wine events at various local restaurants.  </P> <P> TOOLS OF THE MODERN RESTAURATEUR: These days, it's not enough to have good food  and efficent service. The up-to-date restaurateur must take care of the  customer's whole being. At least that's what Noa Noa's Kenji Seki thinks.  Discreetly printed at the bottom of the Noa Noa menu is the following:  "Cordless payphone available. Cigarette smoking in the bar area only. Noa Noa  concerns itself with ecological and environmental issues."  </P> <P> RESTAURANT STEW: What's Up is new in the Brentwood Gardens complex in  Brentwood, directly above the California Pizza Kitchen. Unfortunately, the  menu, which features what the restaurant describes as "updated American basics  and European provincial dishes," is a little too cute. Sample: You Can't Tuna  Fish, Garden of Eatin', Totally Tubular, and A Clockwork Chicken. . . . And  Toshi Takahashi, former owner/chef of the now-defunct Les Joues Hioux in  Torrance, serves as guest chef at Chez Melange in Redondo Beach Tuesday through  Thursday. . . The South Bay Free Clinic's third annual South Bay Gourmet  Sampler is Sunday, April 29, from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in  Manhattan Beach. Twenty-eight area restaurants -- from Bobby D's and the Bottle  Inn to Tout de Suite and the Twelfth Street Grill -- will participate.  </P></p>

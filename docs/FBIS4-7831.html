			<p>BFN     [Text] The 59th day of the Serb aggressor's offensive on  the Bihac region was marked by fresh attacks on civilian  targets, industrial areas, and defense lines. The industrial  area in Bihac was hit by a number of artillery shells and one  woman was killed. The Serb aggressor shelled defense lines on  Mount Grabez and the Grmusa-Srbljani plateau throughout the day.  However, the soldiers of our army destroyed yet another  aggressor tank in an energetic counterattack.    Members of the paramilitary units of the so-called Kladusa  Autonomy [Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia -- declared by  Fikret Abdic] used mortars to shell the Cazin municipality [area  loyal to Izetbegovic]. One person was killed and another one  seriously wounded.</p>

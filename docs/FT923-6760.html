			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's iron ore giant spreads its wings - Companhia Vale do Rio Doce's diversification programme IN THE world of iron ore Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled Brazilian mining giant, stands head and shoulders above the rest. It produced over half of Brazil's domestic output of 150m tonnes last year and handles about a quarter of international demand for the commodity. Its Carajas deposit, in the Amazon state of Para, alone yields 35m tonnes of ore a year. If the market could absorb it, the annual figure could probably be pushed up to 50m tonnes without much trouble. The company's iron ore deposits are so rich that one company official's boast that, 'we've got enough for 400 years', is probably not too much of an exaggeration. But over the last two decades, behind its huge iron facade, the company has been implementing a strategy of diversification - first into other minerals, now farther afield into transport and the pulp and paper industry. It is also steering toward vertical integration into metal production, both at home and, tentatively, abroad. Planning such strategic decisions will be eased by a recently signed administrative contract with its majority shareholder, the state, which allows CVRD to operate more like a private company. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding this year, the company is beginning a third stage of company development, according to Mr Juarez Fontana dos Santos, director of development for Paulo Abib Engenharia, a mining consulting firm. Until 1970, it concentrated almost exclusively on iron ore extraction. Then, with the founding of a prospecting subsidiary, Docegeo, the company expanded into other minerals. Now it is primed to move into complementary activities and direct overseas investment. Expansion seems almost inevitable. The 16-company group has sales of Dollars 4.5bn a year. 'I would say that, today, the biggest problem is where to invest all that money,' says Mr Fontana. Since the late 1970s, manganese, bauxite, limestone, and - notably in recent years - gold have become important products for CVRD. Last year, it produced 28 per cent of the country's 1.97m-tonne manganese output, and it owns 46 per cent of Mineracao Rio do Norte, the country's largest producer of bauxite (aluminium ore). Executives are predicting that gold output this year will approach 12 tonnes, putting it among the leading Brazilian producers. Encouraged on by privatisation of the state-dominated steel sector, horizontal expansion is now paralleled by vertical integration. In a sell-off last October, CVRD bought a 15 per cent stake in Usiminas, a flat rolled steel producer, which has the country's second largest mill; in July it took 15 per cent of Companhia Siderurgica Tubarao, one of the world's leading producers of slab steel. While privatisation purists might question the purchase of public companies by their state-controlled sisters, CVRD had clear strategic goals - guaranteeing a market for its iron ore and manganese, as well as a slice of profits from the value added by milling. In March the company bought 35 per cent of Seas, a manganese alloy producer in Dunkirk, France. The deal included a contract to supply nearly 200,000 tonnes of manganese a year, about two-thirds of Seas consumption. An earlier step in a vertical direction, the Alunorte project, which tripped up seven years ago, may get back into its stride this year. It involved CVRD's Aluvale subsidiary, the majority partner, and a consortium of 31 Japanese companies called NAAC. The 1.1m-tonne capacity alumina (aluminium oxide) plant was primarily to supply Albras, an aluminium ingot producer and another CVRD-NAAC joint venture. Construction was halted when the Japanese partners balked at further investment. Resumption plans have been approved by NAAC and now await a final decision from CVRD, which may first try to entice an additional partner into the fold, thus ceding majority control. The search for an extra partner characterises another strategic shift by the company. Once jealous of control, it now favours minority stakes in joint ventures, reflecting an international trend in mining towards sharing risks. By the end of the year, it is expected to conclude negotiations on a joint venture to exploit the 1.2m-tonne copper deposit at Salobo, in the Carajas region. The partnership is likely to include one foreign company and a private Brazilian mining company. CVRD's new-found minority-share philosophy is so prevalent that the company has refused to even undertake the basic engineering project for Salobo by itself, even though this customarily accounts for what would be an affordable 1 per cent of total investment. Given the security of massive existing mineral reserves, especially of iron ore, CVRD has been free to branch out into other areas, like transport. An early step was the 'marriage' of shipments abroad, administering the rational combination of its dense iron ore with bulky soyabeans, for example. Now it wants to attract agricultural exporters in the central-western region to use the company railway leading to its port terminal in Vitoria, north of Rio de Janeiro. Soon CVRD will inaugurate its first foreign port terminal, in Los Angeles, California. Last year, transport accounted for 13 per cent of gross sales, Dollars 606.6m. Pulp and paper production is another non-mining priority, with two major joint ventures on the drawing board. In 1991, such activities accounted for 4 per cent of gross sales, Dollars 178.8m. In the mining sector, gold is getting most of the attention ' as well as 80 per cent of the Dollars 20.7m exploration budget of Docegeo, CVRD's prospecting subsidiary. The effort appears to be paying off, as last year's gold output of 7.1m tonnes is expected to grow to nearly 12m this year, but Mr Fontana warns that those figures could fall drastically in coming years if new deposits are not turned up. According to the consultant, gold is one mineral of which CVRD does not boast ample long term deposits.</p>

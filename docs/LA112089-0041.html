			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA;  </P> <P> 3RD EX-OFFICER BACKS DEATH SQUAD REPORT  </P> <P> A dispute over the existence of an official South African death squad gathered  momentum when a third policeman alleged that the squad killed anti-apartheid  leaders between 1980 and 1982. The Johannesburg Sunday Times said former police  constable David Tshikalange, a black man, admitted in an interview that he  helped kill black civil rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981. Tshikalange's  claims supported charges by former police Capt. Johannes Coetzee, who left the  country after telling the liberal Afrikaans-language weekly Vrye Weekblad that  he headed an official police death squad.  </P></p>

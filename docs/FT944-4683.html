			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids disappoints with 27% rise Shares in Allied Colloids fell 13p to 117p yesterday after its first half results fell short of market expectations, despite a 27 per cent increase in profits. Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 24.2m, on turnover ahead 7 per cent at Pounds 170.2m (Pounds 159.3m)  -a slowdown on the 10.8 per cent growth reported in the year to end March. The company admitted, however, that half the profits increase was due to favourable exchange rates, with overseas sales accounting for 86 per cent of the total. Profits were also enhanced by improved cost controls and lower raw material prices, although these have risen sharply in recent months. Contract prices for acrylonitrile - one of Allied Colloids' main raw materials - have risen from a January low of Dm1,065 per tonne to a high last month of Dm1,830. Spot prices, meanwhile, have increase from Dollars 675 per tonne to Dollars 1,220 per tonne over the same period. Mr Gordon Senior, finance director, said higher raw material price would have an impact in the second half, but claimed the company would be able to pass on most of the increase to customers. 'We expect to recover costs by not only passing on prices but also increasing volume sales and reducing unit costs,' he said. In the first half, sales growth was underpinned by buoyant demand in North America and continental Europe, which rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 57.6m and 7.7 per cent to Pounds 57.9m respectively. Sales in other markets were more modest, with UK turnover rising slightly from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 22.7m. Of the group's core products, only paper products showed any sizeable increase and improvements in pollution control, textiles, mineral processing and coatings remained sluggish. Nevertheless, the company said its balance sheet was strong and it would continue with capital expenditure on new plant and facilities, which reached a record Pounds 22.5m in the first half. Earnings per share rose 34 per cent from 2.5p to 3.35p, and an interim dividend of 0.55p (0.5p) is declared. COMMENT Allied Colloids will need to engineer a strong second half sales performance to recover some of the market confidence lost yesterday. Analysts downgraded their full year forecasts from Pounds 56m to Pounds 51m and expressed scepticism of improving sales growth as higher raw material prices begin to bite. Some of its rivals, however, would be happy with margins of 14 per cent and Allied Colloids' strong product portfolio. On a forward multiple of 16.5, a 21 per cent premium to the market, the shares may yet fall further. But they remain a safe bet in the medium term.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IT WAS A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS FOR STAN HUMPHRIES  </P> <P> This is a magical time of joy and thanksgiving for Washington Redskins  quarterback Stan Humphries and his wife, Connie.  </P> <P> Natives of Louisiana, they celebrated Christmas in the Washington area for the  first time. They also shared it with a child for the first time.  </P> <P> The health of that child, a 6-month-old daughter named Brooke, is why Stan  cares much less about being stranded on the injured reserve list and much more  about the gift some good fortune and helpful people brought him around the time  he was hurt.  </P> <P> "It's been a real special time," Stan said. "Everything now is great."  </P> <P> When Brooke Renee Humphries was born June 20, there was some doubt she would  make it to June 21. A little more than three weeks premature, but already 7  pounds 6 ounces, Brooke came into this world a little too easily for her own  good.  </P> <P> "It went really fast," Connie Humphries said. "And they (the doctors) said she  was a lot like a Caesarean baby." Fluid that normally would have been squeezed  from the baby's lungs as she was being born remained there.  </P> <P> "She would just quit breathing," Connie said.  </P> <P> Horrifying moments, but ones Brooke overcame.  </P> <P> Soon, though, there was a bout with jaundice. And then came a condition that  would terrorize Stan and Connie Humphries not for moments, but for months.  </P> <P> It was an allergy to protein. Think about what that means -- a basic nutrient  being rejected by the body at a time it needs it the most. "She has to get so  much for her brain to form and for her to grow," Connie said.  </P> <P> But protein was making Brooke's stomach do gymnastics. And, of course, there  was only way for her to let anyone know something wasn't right.  </P> <P> "Every minute, all day long she was crying," Stan said. "She was starving but  when you would feed her, she would cry even worse because it was hurting her so  bad."  </P> <P> For what seemed the longest time, the Humphries' doctors could not determine  the problem. And for a parent -- especially a first-time parent -- there is  nothing worse. "The baby can't tell you what's wrong and you just sit there  wondering," Stan said.  </P> <P> Eventually, the time came for Stan to go to training camp in Carlisle, Pa. Left  alone with Brooke for the first time, Connie wore down. She finally made two  phone calls -- one to her mother, one to Stan.  </P> <P> "Stan, I'm sorry if you're mad," she told him, "but I can't handle it any  longer. I'm getting on the next plane home."  </P> <P> Connie took Brooke to the doctor who had been her pediatrician. After changing  Brooke's formula "like six times" during the week and a half Connie and Brooke  spent in Louisiana, the doctor found one that seemed to agree with the little  girl.  </P> <P> But about four weeks later, in early September, Brooke started having trouble  again. Stan and Connie were frantic.  </P> <P> "I asked everybody," said Stan, who spoke to the Redskins' team physicians and  asked them for help.  </P> <P> Connie ended up taking Brooke to a specialist at Georgetown University  Hospital.  </P> <P> "He was wonderful," Connie said. "I told him five minutes worth of stuff, just  different things that she had gone through. He said, 'She's allergic to  protein.' I said, 'How do you know that? You haven't run a test. You haven't  done anything.'  </P> <P> "He said he sees this eight to 10 times a week. That really shocked me.  </P> <P> "I mean, how many kids would you think are allergic to protein?"  </P> <P> It was a relief, but the battle was just beginning.  </P> <P> On Sept. 23, during the time the Humphries and the doctors were struggling to  find the proper mixture of formula and water for Brooke, Redskins starting  quarterback Mark Rypien injured his knee. The job, the media crush and a huge  responsibility were Stan's. Meanwhile, Brooke still was spending a lot of her  time crying. But Stan now needed his rest and his space more than ever.  </P> <P> "We pretty much slept in separate bedrooms," Connie said. "We had to because  she was up so much that he would have never gotten any sleep."  </P> <P> As it was, Stan would get very little sleep and drag himself to Redskin Park.  He kept mostly to himself about Brooke.  </P> <P> "I don't know why," he said. "I guess that once I got here, I kind of tried to  put it out of my mind for a little bit and tried to contend with what was going  on here. But it was hard to cut it all the way out. The sad thing was that  Connie never had any time to get away. She was there continuously."  </P> <P> Even now, Connie isn't sure how she managed.  </P> <P> "It's hard," she said. "It is very hard. But Stan was under a lot of pressure,  and I wanted him to do well. I didn't want because Brooke was sick or whatever  ... well, you just do it. I don't know. I don't know where I found the energy  to stay awake all the time or anything.  </P> <P> "But I have some really good friends."  </P> <P> Susan Edwards, the wife of safety Brad Edwards, was among those who helped  Connie with her ordeal. The Redskins' bye week helped, and so did quarterbacks  coach Rod Dowhower. Formerly a coach at Stanford, Dowhower put the Humphries in  touch with a doctor at the school who had just completed a paper on protein  intolerance.  </P> <P> Things came to a head as the Redskins were getting ready for the three-week  stretch in October in which they played the Giants twice and the Eagles once.  </P> <P> With Brooke continuing to struggle and Stan continuing to start, the doctor at  Georgetown recommended that Brooke be placed in the hospital for a series of  tests.  </P> <P> "Just to make sure that it wasn't a tumor or an ulcer or anything like that,"  said Connie, who again called home to Louisiana for reinforcement.  </P> <P> Brooke emerged from the tests still diagnosed as having only the allergy,  although the Humphries were told the ailment might linger until she was 2 or 3  years old. Remarkably, though, by about the beginning of November the problem  disappeared. The Humphries and the doctors think Brooke has outgrown it.  </P> <P> Of course, it was just about then that Stan injured his knee in a Monday night  game against the Eagles in Philadelphia. But now Stan has recovered, though he  remains on the Redskins' injured reserve list, and Brooke is headed in the  right direction.  </P> <P> She still weighs only 15 pounds (about double her weight at birth), "so it's  going to take her a little while to catch up," Connie said.  </P> <P> "But we are so happy right now. It's wonderful."  </P></p>

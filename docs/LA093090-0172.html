			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO BAN FISHING OF CROAKER IS VETOED  </P> <P> For the second straight year, Gov. George Deukmejian has rejected legislation  to ban the commercial harvest of white croaker fish off the Palos Verdes  Peninsula.  </P> <P> In a veto message Thursday, Deukmejian described the latest bill, written by  Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), as unnecessary because the state  Department of Fish and Game has closed the area to commercial white croaker  fishing under emergency regulations.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he expects the fishing ban to become permanent.  </P> <P> The ban was ordered in May after a state health study determined that white  croaker in Peninsula waters pose a cancer risk because they contain excessive  levels of DDT and PCBs.  </P></p>

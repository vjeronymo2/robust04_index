			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Arjo shares advance to SKr121.5 as conditional trading gets under way SHARES IN Arjo, the Swedish international healthcare group, closed at SKr121.5 as conditional trading started in London yesterday. The shares were priced last week at SKr112, giving a market capitalisation of SKr2.3bn (Pounds 189m). Arjo, which is raising SKr1.43bn before expenses, has applied to be listed on both the London and Swedish stock exchanges. It expects the listings to become effective and unconditional dealings to begin next Monday. The group intends to use the money to reduce its net borrowings of SKr1.43bn. Last month it forecast a pre-tax loss of SKr140.9m for the year ending September 30, but it estimated that without the debt operating profits would have been SKr175.2m on turnover of SKr1.1bn. A total of 14.55m ordinary shares were on offer. Of these 2.05m were placed with Warburg, Pincus Investors and 310,000 were placed with Arjo employees and Swedish retail investors. The remainder were placed with international institutions, 40 per cent in the UK, 20 per cent in the US and 40 per cent, including a large slice to Sweden, in Europe. Demand was roughly equal to allocation. After the offering Arjo's leading shareholder will be Warburg, Pincus with 23.3 per cent. CWB Capital Partners will hold 11.5 per cent and the management 2.3 per cent. Arjo claims to be the world leader in hygiene and lifting systems for elderly and disabled patients, with customers in 40 countries. Half the manufacturing is in Sweden, 25 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US. Arjo was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1990 from Malmros International, a Swedish conglomerate.</p>

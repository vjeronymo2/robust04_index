			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Military Measures Against </F> Moscow and Athens"]    [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that Turkey has taken  military measures to deal with any possible threat, particularly  from Moscow and Athens. The officials have said that Turkey has  been worried by Russia's move to quickly convert its cumbersome  military forces into an army capable of taking swift action and  by the steps Greece has taken in the same direction.    Stressing that Turkey is also restructuring its military  forces, the officials asserted: "An effort is being made to  establish a smaller army that will be capable of taking quick  action with very high fire power."    It has been ascertained that the summit held on security  discussed the threat to Turkey the day before yesterday. It  also agreed on the need to convert the Turkish Army into a  military force capable of taking quick action. There was a  decision to strengthen the Turkish Armed Forces when the cold  war ended, but that decision was not pursued.    Recalling that Turkey has not made significant changes in  its  threat concept for many years, several sources said that the  threat to Turkey comes from all sides -- from the north, south,  east, and west. That, they said, was also the case in the past.  <H5>  Anxiety Caused by Russia </H5>   The Turkish experts on strategy have been worried by  Russia's  recent move to change its doctrine and base several of its air  force units in the southern part of the Caucasus. Meanwhile,  the Papandreou Government's disclosure that Cyprus and the  Aegean Sea are "Hellenic regions" has created a tense atmosphere  between Ankara and Athens. Greece's claim that it has the right  to fortify the Greek islands in the eastern part of the Aegean  Sea has compelled Ankara to take certain measures.</p>

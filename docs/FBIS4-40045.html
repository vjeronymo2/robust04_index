			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS Gennadiy Kulagin] </F>   [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 14 June TASS -- President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has taken new steps to  accelerate market reforms and pull his republic out of the  economic crisis. The local press today carries decrees of  President Nursultan Nazarbayev aimed at major restructuring of  the Republic's ministries and scrapping some of them altogether.    The abolished Ministries of Foreign Economic Relations,  Industry and Trade will be replaced by one single Ministry of  Industry and Trade for purposes "of making a more effective use  of the Republic's production potential and meeting market  demand, as well as for purposes of entering international  economic relations as soon as possible."    The Ministry of Transport and Communications will take over  from two other abolished ministries, those of transport and  communications, which is expected to cut spending on the upkeep  of state government bodies and streamline their operations.    On the other hand, the Ministry of Energy and Fuel resources  is now divided into two ministries, the Ministry of the Oil and  Gas Industry and the Ministry of Energy and the Coal Industry to  ensure a more effective implementation of the state policy in  the use of the republic's fuel and energy potential as a major  precondition for accelerating the social and economic  development of all of its regions.    The chairman of the National Bank is given a more  independent  status in pursuing the monetary and crediting policy. He will  no longer be a member of the cabinet.</p>

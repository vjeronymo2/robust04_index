			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Keep your eye on dividends - The Bottom Line EVERY investor knows that there are two ways to make money from shares - dividends and capital gains. But, as stockbrokers James Capel pointed out this week, it is the growth in dividends that is the key to share price outperformance. James Capel has calculated that the share price of a group of 24 companies for which it is forecasting annual dividend growth of more than than 12 per cent over the next two years rose on average, by 25 per cent more than the stock market in the last year. Investors long since realised that on a long-term view shares should be better investments than fixed interest stocks as the risk of investing in equities is more than offset by the fact that dividends (usually) grow, but fixed interest coupons cannot. Further, an investment theory first expounded more than 30 years ago has it that the amount a company pays in dividends is irrelevant to a company's value. It is the company's future earnings power - out of which dividends will eventually be paid - which matters. James Capel argues that while this rule may be true in the long term, in the short term a company's dividend policy will affect its share price. At times such as these when dividend cuts and receiverships are in the air, investors put a higher value on actual cash than on theoretical future gains. The problem now facing companies is that dividend cover, the number of times a dividend can be paid out of earnings, has fallen to an historically low level. Many companies kept paying dividends through the recession in spite of falling profits, some making payments out of reserves rather than current profits. James Capel says that 'with the onset of recession in 1990-91, earnings fell by 14 per cent, but dividends rose by the same amount. This attempt to maintain dividend growth at an unrealistic rate raised the payout ratio of industrial companies to an unsustainable level'. As a result, in 1992 dividend cuts became more frequent, and dividends for industrial companies are likely to have fallen slightly over the year. But equity strategists are now expecting a rise in dividends in 1993, though by a slower rate than earnings growth. At County NatWest the forecast for the industrial group is for an increase in dividends of between 5 and 6 per cent, slightly ahead of the expected inflation rate. However, earnings growth of around 15 per cent is expected by the strategists there - and over 20 per cent by the analysts. There are a few cuts still to come, says County NatWest, and dividend growth will lag earnings because of the cover problem. Barclays de Zoete Wedd has a slightly lower forecast of dividend growth, of 4 per cent in 1993 and again in 1994. That would mean little or no real growth when BZW's inflation forecasts are taken into account. Again the level of cover is cited as holding back dividends. 'Payout ratios are not going to be rebuilt that quickly,' says Michael Hughes at BZW. But he argues that this is not necessarily a negative story. Companies which are using their earnings to reinvest in their businesses rather than paying it to investors, could in the longer term be in a better position to pay higher dividends than if they pay more out now. Thus, the theories about total return - from dividends and capital gains - and the irrelevance of dividend payments, come back to suggest that total returns could be better if dividend growth is not as rapid as investors might hope. Even so, as Hughes suggests, the policy to pursue in the short term might be to select shares on high yields, where the dividend is covered, as these may offer better capital gains too.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT BY FBI CLEARS TOWER, BUSH DECLARES;  </P> <P> PANEL TO VOTE ON PENTAGON NOMINEE THURSDAY AND SENATE COULD ACT ON CONFIRMATION  FRIDAY  </P> <P> With a long-delayed Senate committee vote on John Tower now set for this week,  President Bush offered a vigorous defense of his nominee for defense secretary,  declaring that the most recent allegations about Tower's personal life and  financial dealings "have been gunned down" and insisting that his support for  Tower has "never wavered."  </P> <P> Bush made his comments at a press conference as members of the Senate Armed  Services Committee reviewed the 140-page government report that the President  said cleared Tower of recent charges and prepared to vote Thursday on whether  to recommend his confirmation by the full Senate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prompt Action Promised  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has said that the Senate is  "prepared to act promptly" as soon as the Armed Services Committee sends the  nomination to the floor, and congressional sources said that a Senate vote  could be held as early as Friday.  </P> <P> Sources said that the FBI report, sent Monday to the White House and to  Congress, cleared Tower of charges that illegal contributions had been funneled  to his last senatorial campaign.  </P> <P> The report included detailed interviews with persons familiar with Tower's  drinking habits. The finding, officials said, was that the Texas senator may  have drunk excessively in the early 1970s but has moderated his consumption  since then.  </P> <P> "I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I've felt all along, and that is that  John Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense -- he will be a good  secretary of defense," Bush said. "I hope the Senate will move forthrightly on  this nomination."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alcoholism Reports Denied  </P> <P> Bush denied suggestions that Tower may have a continuing drinking problem --  the issue that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) has  said he finds most troubling.  </P> <P> "There is no evidence of any kind of the disease (of) alcoholism," Bush said.  "None. None, whatsoever."  </P> <P> Nunn and Virginia Sen. John W. Warner, the ranking Republican member of the  panel, announced that the committee would meet in closed session once more  before it moves to a final vote on Thursday. The White House, in an effort to  minimize further speculation about allegations against Tower, has pressed  lawmakers to complete their deliberations in open session.  </P> <P> But Nunn said that a closed meeting is necessary in some cases to protect the  identities of confidential informants.  </P> <P> "We'll also have to try to figure out a way to do that on the floor of the  Senate -- if (the nomination) passes the committee and goes to the floor -- and  that's not going to be easy," Nunn said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Criticize Committee  </P> <P> Bush on Tuesday refused to fault the Senate committee's handling of Tower's  confirmation proceedings, which have been stalled for more than three weeks as  Nunn and Warner called for further investigation of allegations reaching the  panel.  </P> <P> "I think (Nunn has) been fair," Bush said, responding to a reporter's  suggestion that Nunn hoped to dominate defense policy by delaying the Tower  vote. "The idea that he will run defense policy, I think he'd be the first to  say that's not true."  </P> <P> But Bush added that Nunn "will be a key player in it, and I hope that he'll be  able to support Sen. Tower."  </P> <P> After reviewing the latest FBI report, Nunn refused Tuesday to discuss his  position on the Tower nomination, saying that he would not do so until the  committee is ready to vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Kill Nomination  </P> <P> On Thursday, the committee will vote first on whether to recommend Tower's  confirmation. If a majority votes no, the committee could then take a vote on  whether or not to send the nomination to the Senate floor for a vote by the  entire chamber.  </P> <P> Nunn's position on Tower's confirmation is believed to be critical both within  the committee and to a Senate floor vote. Since becoming chairman of the  committee in 1986, Nunn has had broad influence on defense matters within the  Senate among members of both parties.  </P> <P> When asked Tuesday how his handling of the Tower confirmation hearings would  affect his working relationship with Tower if the ex-senator is confirmed, Nunn  replied cautiously.  </P> <P> "One step at a time," he said.  </P></p>

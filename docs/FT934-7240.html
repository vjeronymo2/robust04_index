			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swedbank withdraws request for state aid SWEDBANK, the Nordic region's largest bank in asset terms, yesterday withdrew its request for state support after announcing a SKr2bn (Dollars 242m) rights issue and much improved financial figures for the first nine months. Its move means the three Swedish banks which applied for state aid earlier this year have now withdrawn their applications, testifying to the recovery in the country's financial sector. The bank said the rights issue was the final part of an action plan designed to strengthen its capital base by SKr8bn and increase its capital adequacy ratio to more than 10 per cent. Other measures, already announced, include the sale of a 90 per cent stake in a fund management unit and two large issues of perpetual stock. The share issue will be in the form of a private placement and will be launched in the first quarter of next year. A maximum of 38m shares is to be offered to existing owners and Swedish and international investors at a minimum price of SKr55 a share. The bank is also aiming for a stock exchange listing within the next three years. Nine-month figures from Swedbank confirmed an improving results trend, with operating losses cut to SKr2.65bn from SKr8.81bn. Cost-cutting helped the bank to lift its result before loan losses to SKr6.21bn from SKr5.07bn. Credit losses shrank 36 per cent to SKr8.86bn, and problem loans fell 19 per cent to SKr18.9bn. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Foreningsbanken have also withdrawn requests for state assistance after announcing big share issues.</p>

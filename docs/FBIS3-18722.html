			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "na": "Demographic Trends Demand More </F> Adjustments in the Pension Law"]    [Text] The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] rejects a  general provision for all citizens. The draft of the new CDU  basic program states that it contradicts the basic principle of  making one's own provisions through contributions and makes the  individual unreasonably dependent on decisions by the state.    The program is to be approved at the Fifth All-German CDU  Party Congress, which will take place in Hamburg from February  20 to 23 (HANDELSBLATT of 9 February 1994).    The petition commission for the party congress meanwhile has  discussed the petitions and made its recommendations. In the  version of the basic program recommended for approval by the  party congress, it is explicitly pointed out that earned income  remains the basis for determining contributions. The CDU wants  to maintain the graduated social security. It combines  solidarity and subsidiarity.    To preserve the functioning capability of the social  benefits  systems in the long term and to be able to ensure social  security of the individual, fundamental revisions must be made.  Not every risk in life can be safeguarded collectively. The CDU  goal is not expansion of the social security systems, but rather  their restructuring. In addition to greater promotion and demand  of self-responsibility, self-provisions, and self-participation,  the CDU wants to strengthen the insurance principle. The draft  states that our social insurance must gradually be freed  financially of those tasks which are national in nature and must  be financed with tax money.    The CDU supports preserving the several-generations contract  as the regulative principle of the pension insurance system. To  secure this, it supports a family-friendly society and  family-friendly measures, particularly in the tax and social  insurance law. It wants to balance the extra burdens on parents  because of child rearing, and recognize more strongly than  before in the pension law, the time spent in child rearing as a  pension contribution.    In the opinion of the CDU, pension insurance must remain  contribution-related, and hence performance-related. However,  the CDU leaves no doubt that, due to demographic developments,  further adjustments in the pension law will become necessary.  Pension entitlements already earned will remain secure. The  economic development and the number of employed will determine  what contribution the present pension system will provide to the  next generation for old-age security. Private old-age  provisions, among them company provisions, are of growing  importance. The CDU means to promote them.    A gradual extension of the working years is also an element  to deal with the demographic development and the growing life  expectancy of the population.    The CDU also stands for subjecting in principle all  permanent  work positions to the social insurance obligation.    With regard to statutory health insurance, it is said that  the growing life expectancy and demographic change, as well as  still-existing undesirable features, demand further measures for  limiting costs. For this, the increased capability of the  insured for self-responsibility must be drawn upon to a greater  extent. A reorganization of the benefits catalogue will have to  better differentiate which benefits will continue to be paid by  the statutory health insurance from a health and social policy  standpoint, which will have to be borne by the individual, and  to what extent self-participation will be necessary.  <H5>  Extending the Working Years </H5>   At the same time, the CDU wants to create more possibilities  for a self-responsible shaping of insurance protection, and  shape the structures of the health system in such a way that all  participants have a self-interest in a humane, efficient, and  low-cost health care system. In the opinion of the CDU,  competition between health insurances and also between benefit  providers must be strengthened.    Within the framework of restructuring the social welfare  state, the CDU wants to set another milestone in social policy  with elderly care insurance. The need for care is a risk that  can happen to anyone, without everyone being in a position to  make the necessary provision for it. This demands collective  safeguarding against this risk through a general elderly care  insurance. The benefits of the elderly care insurance should  above all promote home care. Supplementary private provisions on  a voluntary basis are necessary and to be promoted by the state.    The CDU advocates that humane working conditions, work  protection and coparticipation possibilities at the workplace be  better understood as important preconditions for entrepreneurial  success. It expects of the wage agreement partners a new  flexibility in setting working hours. This must take into  account company requirements as well as improvement in  reconciling family and work. "We want to make greater  flexibility possible in determining daily, weekly, yearly, and  lifetime working hours and shape the transitions between the  sectors and stages of life more smoothly." The CDU calls on the  public service sector to carry out its model function in  offering and shaping flexible working hours. In the CDU's  opinion, Sundays and holidays must be kept workfree in principle.  <H5>  Retaining Codetermination in the EU [European Union] </H5>   The CDU holds the opinion that the side-by-side of civil  servants and employees in public service has proven itself. It  considers the permanent civil service indispensable for carrying  out sovereign tasks. However, the party also advocates making  the public service law more flexible and performance-oriented.    The CDU supports expansion of parental leave time and unpaid  leave to care for family members. It calls for more qualified  part-time jobs and more flexible company and wage regulations of  working hours for women and men.    In its new program, the CDU supports codetermination. In its  opinion, it should be maintained in the European Union. The  increasing international interlocking of industry, states the  program draft, demands that in enterprises active Europe-wide,  border-transcending workers' representations with training and  consulting rights are established abroad.    The party congress was also presented with a petition by the  party executive committee for growth and employment. Important  demands of this program (HANDELSBLATT of 18 January 1994) were  included in the Federal Government's action program for growth  and employment. The petition commission will present its  recommendations on the executive committee petition only at the  CDU party congress.</p>

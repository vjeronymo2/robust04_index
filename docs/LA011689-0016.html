			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE STEP ON AIDS  </P> <P> The preliminary passage of a Los Angeles County anti-discrimination ordinance,  protecting those with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS,  is a constructive step. It would put into effect the implementation of a key  recommendation of the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Rand Schrader, vice chairman of the county AIDS Commission,  urged passage of the ordinance because it makes "clear and unequivocal" the  position of the Board of Supervisors, just as the Los Angeles City Council made  its position clear in 1985 with the adoption of a municipal anti-discrimination  law. He was right. And making that clear in the county is of particular  importance because the county ranks second in the nation in the incidence of  AIDS.  </P> <P> The vote was by the narrowest possible margin, however, with Supervisors Pete  Schabarum and Mike Antonovich voting in opposition. The majority of three was  made up of Supervisors Deane Dana, Kenneth Hahn and Ed Edelman.  </P> <P> There were signs that the opposition was based on misunderstandings. Antonovich  argued that it would duplicate federal and state laws. He had perhaps forgotten  that the radical right forced out of federal legislation proposals for broad  protections against discrimination and that Gov. George Deukmejian had vetoed  state legislation last October that would have extended protections to those  who test positive to the virus but who may not yet have AIDS. Protection of  those with the virus but without symptoms of the disease is an important  provision of the county ordinance. Furthermore, it was argued that this would  be a costly venture when, in fact, it will not be because it provides only for  recourse to the civil courts or the county dispute-resolution program in the  event of violations.  </P> <P> The community will be well served if the supervisors can now move ahead on  other critical questions related to the AIDS pandemic. Until now, there has not  been majority support for more candid informational programs targeted on  high-risk populations. And only Edelman of the five supervisors thus far has  supported the proposal of the county AIDS Commission for a campaign directed at  intravenous drug users that would include the distribution of bleach for  cleaning needles and of condoms to encourage safer sex. These programs have  been proved effective in other communities, and delays in their implementation  only raise the risk of an accelerated spread of the infection.  </P></p>

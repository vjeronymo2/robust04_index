			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> UPSCALE ON A LARGE SCALE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS PLAN TO TRANFORM COASTLINE-AND IMAGE OF ORANGE COUNTY TOURISM-WITH  NEARLY 5,000 RESORT HOTEL ROOMS IN THE NEXT 4 YEARS  </P> <P> Not too long ago, vacationing in Orange County meant packing the kids into the  station wagon for a trip to Disneyland, the beach and maybe a couple of nights  in a local motel.  </P> <P> Plenty of young families still make that legendary pilgrimage. But others with  a taste for the high life -- and the cash to indulge it -- are discovering that  Orange County tourism has gone upscale.  </P> <P> In 1984, when the Ritz-Carlton hotel opened on a stretch of oceanfront property  that is now part of of Dana Point, some hotel experts predicted that the  luxurious 391-room hotel would never make money. For one thing, it seemed out  of character with Southern California. (At first, the hotel required men to  wear jackets after sunset; it still requires jackets and ties in the dining  room.)  </P> <P> Today, the Ritz-Carlton says it is operating at a profit, and by all accounts,  it is a success. It has since been joined by the 350-room Dana Point Resort,  which is more modest than the Ritz-Carlton but nevertheless an upscale  establishment on a bluff overlooking Dana Point Harbor.  </P> <P> Now other developers, eager to tap the market for well-heeled travelers, have  cleared a variety of environmental hurdles and are planning three giant  developments that will forever change stretches of the Orange County coastline.  </P> <P> Within the next 4 years, nearly 5,000 additional resort hotel rooms will be  built along the coast from Huntington Beach to Dana Point. The construction  promises to transform the coastline into an area that the tourism industry,  with characteristic boosterism, claims will one day be known around the world  as the Orange Coast Riviera.  </P> <P> In April, construction is scheduled to begin on a four-hotel, 1,450-room  development on 20 acres along Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach called  the Waterfront.  </P> <P> In May, construction will begin on the Monarch Beach Resort, a $300-million,  1,126-room extravaganza on one of the last untouched strips of land along Coast  Highway, just north of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. The ocean-bluff project  is a joint venture of Stein-Brief Inc. and the Hemmeter Corp., famous for its  elaborate Hawaiian resorts. They are spending nearly $20 million on landscaping  alone for the development.  </P> <P> And by 1990, the Irvine Co. plans to begin construction on the first of three  hotels with a total of 2,150 rooms and two 18-hole golf courses on one of the  choicest pieces of real estate in Southern California, a 3-mile strip of  rolling hills between Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar called the Irvine Coast.  </P> <P> Despite a general slump in the Orange County hotel market, developers are  confident that there will be enough tourists to back up this unprecedented  building spree. Some assert that demand for these huge seaside resorts has gone  unmet for years. Others say that even if adequate demand does not yet exist, it  can be created with savvy marketing.  </P> <P> "Resort development is hot across the country. People are taking more  vacations. Travel is up and more foreigners are coming here," said James Burba  of Pannell Kerr Forster, a consulting firm serving the hotel industry.  </P> <P> "The Ritz opened everyone's mind to the idea that here is a real resort area,"  said Sherrie Laveroni, general manager of the Dana Point Resort.  </P> <P> The Ritz-Carlton, jointly owned by Prudential Insurance Co. of America and  Atlanta-based W. B. Properties Inc., billed itself as the first major resort  built along the Southern California coast in nearly 30 years.  </P> <P> Besides its seaside locale, the $100-million project boasts tennis courts,  swimming pools, meticulous service and a collection of 18th-Century art on its  walls. The hotel has won five stars -- the highest award -- from both the Mobil  Travel Guide and the American Automobile Assn., two of the more prestigious  honors in the U.S. travel industry.  </P> <P> Its look and feel have been compared to opulent turn-of-the-century seaside  resorts. But its rates are definitely modern, with rooms starting at $185 a  night and going up to $2,000 for a five-bedroom suite with a baby grand piano.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developments Mushrooming  </P> <P> After a rocky first year marked by a protracted battle with creditors, which  was eventually settled, the Ritz-Carlton became profitable by 1986. According  to general manager Henry E. Schielein, the hotel's occupancy rate in 1988 was  well above the Orange County average of 69%, and its revenue was between $45  million and $50 million.  </P> <P> Room rates at the Dana Point Resort range from $160 to $1,050 per night,  Laveroni said. The hotel, owned by Ed and Tom Slatkin (sons of Burton Slatkin,  the former owner of Beverly Hills Hotel), claimed a 50% occupancy rate in 1988.  </P> <P> Since the Ritz-Carlton opened in 1984, coastal hotel development has progressed  at a good clip from Santa Barbara to San Diego, according to numbers recently  compiled by Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the accounting and consulting firm. In  1985, there were only 13 "upscale water-oriented hotels" along the Southern  California coast, with 4,500 rooms. By 1988, there were 21 such hotels with  7,500 rooms.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, several new seaside resorts are under consideration  along the Palos Verdes coastline, including another Ritz-Carlton hotel about  two miles south of the former Marineland aquatic park site. In northern San  Diego County, developers expect to complete 1,500 new rooms in 1989 from Del  Mar to Oceanside, according to the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> But local developers assert that the strip of resorts along the Orange County  coast will be more distinctive, more elaborate and more luxurious than the  competition.  </P> <P> Their intention is to turn the area into a tourist destination in itself, not  just a place to recuperate from day trips to Disneyland, Sea World or Knott's  Berry Farm. These resorts don't plan to compete with nearby inland lodges or  with other seaside hotels but with resorts in Hawaii, Palm Springs, Scottsdale,  Ariz., and, yes, even Monte Carlo.  </P> <P> Can Orange County -- once considered a byword for provincialism in some circles  -- draw the same well-heeled travelers who patronize resorts such as Palm  Springs?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aura of Sophistication  </P> <P> Industry experts say the jury's still out. A lot depends on whether the new  hotels scheduled for construction live up to their billing and are snazzy  enough to complement the Ritz-Carlton.  </P> <P> According to general manager Schielein, the Ritz-Carlton's reputation is  drawing a steady stream of vacationers from Europe and Japan.  </P> <P> But while the upper-crust, international flavor of the Ritz-Carlton has  provided an aura of sophistication to the Orange County resort concept, its  potential primarily reflects economic and demographic growth within the greater  Los Angeles area, industry experts said.  </P> <P> Schielein, in fact, acknowledged that virtually all of the Ritz-Carlton's  weekend guests are Californians. Of those who sign on for longer stays, most  hail from California or other western states.  </P> <P> "The Orange County coast's greatest asset is that it is adjacent to a nearly  14-million-person market in Southern California, and the Northern California  market is certainly available to it," said Sam L. Van Landingham, a partner  with Portman Properties, an Atlanta development firm that has built posh hotels  from New York to San Francisco and the Far East.  </P> <P> "Clearly the success of the Ritz-Carlton is supported primarily by Southern  California. And a larger critical mass of hotels along the Irvine Coast and  south county coast can be successful," said Van Landingham, a former Irvine Co.  executive who was in charge of the company's hotel development.  </P> <P> "How successful it will be on an international or national basis is harder to  determine," Landingham said. "It doesn't have a year-round climate, like  Hawaii, so it's not a true year-round ocean resort."  </P> <P> One thing working in its favor is that the coastal resort market appears to be  far from saturated.  </P> <P> "For the inland hotels, there has been an oversupply that has come into the  market. But the coastal resorts are quite different animals," said Donald  Engfer, head of hotel development for the Irvine Co. "There is an established  pattern of coastal tourism in California, but there has been comparatively  little development over the years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Receptive  </P> <P> In 1972, the creation of the California Coastal Commission put a halt to most  large seaside hotel developments of any kind. In its early years, the  commission was guided by a strict interpretation of its mandate to manage  coastal resources that blocked most development. But since Gov. George  Deukmejian took office in 1983, the 12-member board has become more receptive  to developers.  </P> <P> Hotels also seem to be one of the paths of least resistance for developers  faced with hostile environmentalists. A resort often leaves much more open  space and has less impact on the environment than dense clusters of housing.  </P> <P> "The coastal (conservation) act does favor the development of tourist  facilities, particularly when it is done in a such a way that it increases  access to the coast for both paying and non-paying visitors," said Jack  Liebster, a spokesman for the commission. "Developers have gotten better at  this."  </P> <P> The Ritz-Carlton, which built a public parking lot and a path down to the  beach, is "a perfect example," Liebster said.  </P> <P> And the Irvine Co. began to make changes in its plans for the Irvine Coast 10  years ago in the face of resistance from citizens. Originally, the company  planned to build 21,000 homes and two 10-story office towers on the parcel,  among other things; then the Coastal Commission came along and everything  changed.  </P> <P> Eventually the Irvine Co. agreed to let environmentalists help plan a new  development and sold land it had originally intended for houses on the ocean  side of Coast Highway to the state for a park in 1979.  </P> <P> The result is a blueprint that includes 2,600 homes and three hotels perched  along the hills, which even environmentalists grudgingly approve. About  three-quarters of the land will remain open.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Changes Coast Forever'  </P> <P> "Let's face it, developments like these are going to have an impact. They're  going to change the whole coast forever," said Judy Rosener, assistant dean at  the Graduate School of Management at UC Irvine and a former Coastal Commission  member with environmentalist leanings.  </P> <P> "But there's no question the development we have now is better than it would  have been" without the time-out imposed by the commission, she said.  </P> <P> Despite all the excitement over the coming resorts, industry consultants warn  that making a luxury hotel work is a tricky proposition.  </P> <P> A rough rule of thumb in the hotel industry is that a project will not pay off  unless it can charge $1 in room rates for each $1,000 spent building a room. At  the Ritz-Carlton, which cost about $100 million, that translates to about $250  a night.  </P> <P> While the Ritz won't divulge its average room rate, it says it falls within a  range of $200 to $250 a night.  </P> <P> Even if the average falls somewhat short of the mark, upscale hotels such as  the Ritz-Carlton have other sources of revenue that can push the hotel into the  black, such as food and alcohol sales and special events, including wedding  receptions.  </P> <P> "The Ritz was a calculated risk, and it paid off," said Christopher B.  Leinberger, managing partner of Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., a real estate  consulting firm based in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "But that high-end group of the hotel market is so hyperdiscretionary that you  have to give them exactly what they want and when they want it," he said. "And  if they don't like what you give them, they'll go back to their friends at the  country clubs and spread the word. Then the hotel will fail."  </P> <P> And there is concern that California laws requiring open public access to all  beaches might compromise efforts by resort operators to create an exclusive  ambiance.  </P> <P> Boosters, however, counter that being on the beach really isn't as important as  being able to see it, especially because Orange County's resorts are designed  to be centered around golf, tennis and shopping.  </P> <P> "The best situation is to have a private beach," acknowledged the  Ritz-Carlton's Schielein.  </P> <P> "But the second best is to have this beautiful (public) beach, the sunset in  the evening and the fresh sea breeze. . . . In the summer the beaches do get  crowded, but we are perched on a bluff 150 feet above it all."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael Flagg contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THREE RESORTS PLANNED FOR ORANGE COUNTY'S COAST  </P> <P> THE WATERFRONT  </P> <P> Perhaps nothing signifies the changing image of Huntington Beach's coastline  from a funky surfer haven to a more upscale, high-rent district better than the  Waterfront, along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, between Huntington  Street and Beach Boulevard. Construction of a 300-room hotel is scheduled to  begin in April. Developed by Robert Mayer Corp. of Newport Beach, the project  will include:  </P> <P> Four hotels with a total of 1,450 rooms  </P> <P> Residential and commercial development  </P> <P> THE IRVINE COAST  </P> <P> After an 18-year struggle with the California Coastal Commission and local  community groups, the Irvine Co. won approval last year to develop the stretch  of unspoiled hills that roll down to Pacific Coast Highway between Corona del  Mar and Laguna Beach. Construction on the first of three hotels, a 450-room  "spa resort," is scheduled to begin by early 1991, with a completion date set  for early 1993. The development will include:  </P> <P> Up to 2,150 hotel rooms  </P> <P> 2,600 houses  </P> <P> Two golf courses  </P> <P> MONARCH BEACH  </P> <P> Construction is scheduled to begin in May on this 1,126-room resort on 209  acres of hillside off Coast Highway in Dana Point. Stein-Brief Inc. and  Hemmeter Corp., known for elaborate Hawaiian resorts, are co-developers. The  resort, scheduled for completion by mid-1991, will include:  </P> <P> An 850-room hotel  </P> <P> A 276-room "luxury suite hotel"  </P> <P> An aerial tramway to carry guests down from the hotels to Monarch Beach.  </P> <P> An 18-hole golf course  </P> <P> Nine restaurants  </P></p>

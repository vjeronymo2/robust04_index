			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / India seeks Dollars 5bn investment in oil exploration India needs to attract Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in domestic and foreign capital over the next three years for oil and gas exploration if domestic petroleum production is to maintain its 50 per cent share of the country's energy market. Mr Satish Sharma, energy minister, said a sharp increase in exploration was needed to cope with India's fast-expanding energy demand, which is growing at 8-10 per cent a year. At present about Dollars 1.4bn is spent each year on exploration and development. The scale of the task is such that the government is seeking large foreign involvement in the oil industry, which until recently had been the sole preserve of India's two big state-owned oil companies. The government has opened a new licensing round, in which it hopes that medium-sized western oil companies will take part. Mr Sharma, who is on a world tour to promote the round, said he was aware of past accusations that India was withholding the best acreage for domestic companies. But he said the latest licensing round included areas in which there were confirmed oil and gas deposits. He also acknowledged that there was a perception among the big western oil companies that India was unlikely to contain the very large fields which were most highly valued. He noted, however, that half of India's 26 sedimentary basins remained unexpl-ored. The minister added that a significant number of cash-rich private Indian companies were keen to enter the oil industry with western partners.</p>

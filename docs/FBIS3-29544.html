Senator Evans says  there is no shortage of available troops, and the decision has  been taken out of respect for Australians with ties to the  former Republic of Yugoslavia.    In a television interview, he said that once a country  provided troops it was hard to appear impartial. Sen. Evans  said the Bosnian conflict had a strong emotional impact on  important sections of the Australian community--including  Croats, Serbs, and Bosnian Muslims. He said they were  represented in Australia in large numbers and, in such a  situation--if troops were committed--it would be hard to avoid  being seen to take sides.</p>

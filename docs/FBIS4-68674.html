			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Kosolapov, Chelyabinsk: "My Radio Telephone </F> Started Ringing: a Modern Communications Network System Has Been  Created in Chelyabinsk"]    [Text] "If you want to, we can call a foreign country.  Would you like to call Germany, for example?" My conversational  partner picked up a touch-tone telephone with a short antenna,  and quickly ran his fingers over the keyboard: about twenty  seconds later, I could hear coming from the other end of the  line the voice of a woman who was speaking in German. The  audibility was excellent, just as though we were not thousands  of kilometers apart: there was no interference, no noise, or  crackling.    "The automatic international responder," it was explained to  me, "tells whom to call, how to call him, where to go for advice  or the necessary information.."    Possibly for a businessman in Hamburg or North  Rhine-Westphalia this is an everyday occurrence -- communication  with a subscriber located even a tremendous distance away,  almost instantaneously -- but I, a person unspoiled by  domestically produced communications equipment, perceived  everything that happened as a minor technical miracle. Obviously  I had seen radio telephones, which practically every militiaman  carries nowadays, and, in addition, important managers have been  installing them for many years in their official cars, but I  myself did not have any contact with this kind of progress.    "Now everyone who concludes a contract with our organization  will have the opportunity to become a subscriber to the mobile  radio telephone system," A. B. Blinov, technical director of the  Radiotelefon AO [joint-stock company] says. "Today I signed an  official order concerning the completion of preliminary tests,  and a week or two will go into bringing the entire complex to a  steady, stable state, and in late April we shall begin working  at full strength."    But how does the mobile radio telephone communications  system  operate? The Chelyabinsk system has two main centers: one is  situated in the oblast radio teletransmitting center, and the  other in Metallurgicheskiy Rayon, in the ATS-21 [dial telephone  station No. 21] building. Relay communications have been  installed between them. Both centers are switched into the city,  long-distance, and international automatic-dialing system.  Therefore there will be no problems in reaching a subscriber  located anywhere on the planet. Calls have already been made to  the United States, Finland, and even Australia, without any  problems. And I myself could talk to Germany, if there was  anyone I wanted to talk to.    Incidentally, the city network is not limited for the radio  telephone to the territory of Chelyabinsk. The signal extends to  a radius of 30 kilometers from the telecommunications tower and  gets as far as Kopeysk and many suburban settlements and  villages. Simultaneously with this, the telephone can be  extremely selective. It can connect with just one  mobile-communications subscriber, if that is what you want.  Provision has also been made for other services, which we  previously have not even dreamed of: you can indicate the number  of a subscriber from whom you do not want to get calls, and he  will not be able to connect with you. If what you need is only  one-sided communication, you can make the call, or if not, there  is nothing complicated about this -- that is how it will be. If  you are talking too long, the telephone will indicate to you at  the proper time that your money is running out...    Chelyabinsk is the fourth city in Russia where a mobile  radio  telephone system has been created. A year ago the system was  activated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, then, quite recently, in  Nizhniy Novgorod. The fact that our city proved to be among the  pioneers in the communications sphere is definitely not  accidental. For many years the oblast center has housed the  Scientific-Research Institute of Measurement Technology (NIIIT)  previously was kept extremely classified and which specialized  in developing electronic systems for the navy, aviation, and  space travel. Hence the high proficiency level of its workers,  and their initiative and ability to make contact with their  partners. The basis of the Radiotelefon AO, which is headed by  V. O. Lenkevich, is made up of people from NIIIT. Also, many  production orders for the manufacture of equipment are also  executed by former work associates.    However, the main supplier of the modern technology is the  Swedish Ericson company. The first consignment of equipment was  delivered from Scandinavia in January. A month later five more  tons of freight arrived. Simultaneously, the installation  workers arrived, and, incidentally, not all of them are  necessarily Swedes. Currently, for example, two people are  working here: one is from Malaysia, and the other is from  Mexico. They have not yet become fluent in Russian, but they  have watched the "Simply Mariya" television series and have  suffered through a lot with the characters.    The first phase of the system is planned for 2000  subscribers, and the maximum capacity is 12,000. The experience  gained by foreign countries indicates that, on the average, in  an ordinary city one percent of the people use mobile telephone  communications. The capacities that the Radiotelefon AO is  proposing for Chelyabinsk are apparently completely adequate.  Although it is difficult to know: in Finland, the country in the  world that is most densely saturated with radio telephone  communications, three percent of the population prefer mobile  communications.    In our oblast the new system, it seems to me, has rather  good  prospects: currently the NIIIT specialists are working on the  introduction of radio telephone service in Miass. The  telecommunications tower possibilities have been studied, and  contracts have been concluded with enterprises, including such  an important one as UralAZ. According to the plan, the  installation of the equipment will begin at the end of the  second quarter. The reception zone will include the city of  Chebarkul, and all the sanatoriums situated in its environs. In  parallel with this, preparatory work is under way to introduce  mobile communications in Magnitogorsk. Whoever possesses modern  communications, possesses the world...</p>

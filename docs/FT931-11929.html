			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reinvestment warning on trusts KLEINWORT Benson and Fleming have written to shareholders in two investment trusts warning that they stand to lose everything if they continue to re-invest dividends from the trusts' high-income ordinary shares. Nearly 3,000 ordinary shareholders in the Kleinwort High Income trust and 250 in the Fleming International High Income trust were sent letters before Christmas. Kleinwort Benson said the practice of re-investing dividends from high-income ordinary shares would bear fruit only in a rapidly rising market, because the ordinary shares were paid out after the trust's zero dividend preference shares. In a weak stock market, the high-income shareholders may not receive their capital back, a danger compounded if investors re-invest their dividends. Ben Siddons, director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, said investors were offered alternatives to the Kleinwort High Income trust if they wanted to continue to re-invest dividends. Siddons added: 'The last thing we want is this black hole when trusts are wound up with people finding they haven't achieved the hurdle rates necessary and all the money goes to zero dividend preference shareholders. It could damage the reputation of the industry and the integrity of the product.' Fleming said that if the stock market produced consistently high returns, then reinvesting dividends for total return could pay off. But it was only fair to warn investors about the potential risk of ending up with a zero return when the trust was wound up. The cases highlight the dangers of investing in split capital investment trusts if investors fail to understand the nature of the shares they choose and the assets which back them. The Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) will try to persuade investment managers of member companies to adopt a new code of practice when launching split capital trusts, entailing more disclosure of the potential risks.</p>

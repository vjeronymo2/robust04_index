Yang Chuantang, Standing Committee member of the  regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the  regional government, made a closing speech. He urged cadres  across Tibet to, in line with the tasks and objective set by the  Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Regional Party  Committee and by the current conference, work conscientiously  with one heart and one mind to push the regional economic  structural reform and development to a new height.    Gyamco, executive vice chairman of the regional government,  chaired the conference.    Attending the conference's closing were regional leaders  Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Buqiong, Puqung, Sengqen Lozong  Gyaincain, Pudoje, Gong Daxi, Baima Duoji, Gying Puncog Cedain,  Zeren Sangzhu, Yang Song, Ciren Zhuoga, Luosang Dunzhu, Jimzhong  Gyaincain Puncog, Cedain Zhoima, and Zhou Qishun; as well as  Yang Youcai, chief procurator of the regional people's  procuratorate.    The conference transmitted and studied the guidelines of the  national economic work conference and conferences of special  trades convened by the relevant state departments, analyzed the  current economic situation, mapped out arrangements for the  regional economic structural reform and economic work in this  year, and discussed and revised a number of major reform  measures. During the conference, its participants held animated  discussions on the conference documents, focused on the theme of  reform, development, and stability; and offered many  constructive suggestions and opinions.    Comrade Yang Chuantang said: Through study and discussion  over the past few days, conferees have deepened their  understanding of the necessity of accelerating the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure, increased their sense  of responsibility and urgency toward expediting reforms and  promoting economic growth, clarified the guiding principles and  tasks of this year's economic work and the basic ideology for  reform, and strengthened their confidence in successfully  carrying out the tasks. They agree that the conference, which  has witnessed in-depth study of issues centering around a  clear-cut theme, reveals a new outlook of reform and opening up,  a new momentum of hard work, and a prevailing mood of  concentrating all resources on economic construction.    Discussing the conference guidelines, Yang Chuantang pointed  out: It is necessary to, first, study; second, transmit; and  third, organize the implementation of the guidelines effectively.    Comrade Yang Chuantang said: The theory and practice of  China's socialist construction and development have testified  that reform is the propelling force for economic expansion and  the only way for liberating productive forces and opening up a  new situation in the work of all fields. The rapid growth of  the regional economy over the past more than a decade has been  achieved mainly through reform. To continue our advance and  effect a new leap in the future, we should continue reforms. At  present, we are facing an excellent opportunity of accelerating  the development as well as the pace of reform. This is because,  first of all, through the 15-year practice of reform, we have  accumulated rich experiences and promoted reform from single to  comprehensive projects. Second, Deng Xiaoping's talks during  his southern tour and the 14th CPC National Congress have  determined the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure as the objective of reform. Third, the nation and the  region have increased their overall economic strength and laid  more solid material foundations. Fourth, the broad masses of  people have greater tolerance and sense of urgency for reform,  while party committees and governments at all levels are more  capable of grasping the tasks of reform. Fifth -- and most  important of all -- we have the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics as our guide and the strong and  effective leadership of the party Central Committee. We must  not miss the opportunity. Therefore, to strengthen the intensity  of reform and quicken the pace of reform is an inevitable trend  of history. He said: As far as the question of reform is  concerned, whoever takes a firm grip and makes an early start  will achieve faster growth; and whoever makes a slow start will  lag behind and be placed in a passive situation. Without making  reform, or making slow-paced reform, we will retreat. In a  sense, the rate of economic growth depends on the range and  intensity of reform.    Yang Chuantang called on leaders at all levels to raise  their understanding of the importance and urgency of reform,  guide the overall situation through reforms, work relentlessly  and innovatively in carrying out this year's reform measures,  and promote economic development through reforms, thereby  opening up a new situation in all fields of endeavor in Tibet.  As far as this question is concerned, it is necessary to  achieve unity in not only thinking and understanding, but also  in action. Meanwhile, leaders at all levels should step up  study and practice, constantly studying new circumstances and  solving new problems. They should, in the light of the  realities of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive,  diligently study the basic tenents of Marxism and the important  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the  party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies;  knowledge of the market economy and modern management and  science; and knowledge in general so they can become experts in  developing a socialist market economy. In the course of study,  they should be bold in exploration and practice. As reform is a  penetrating and complex evolution, temporary differences in  thinking and understanding are only natural. However, once a  reform measure is adopted, it is necessary to organize its  implementation. When in doubt on an issue, it is necessary to  apply the criterion of "conducive to three causes," avoid  squabbling, explore further, and be bold in practice so as to  unify understanding and emancipate the mind through the practice  of reform. Moreover, it is also necessary to discover and use  advanced models as pacesetters, as well as to identity and help  typical cases of lagging behind in reform, thereby promoting  reform as a whole through grasping both ends to bring along the  intermediate zone.    Yang Chuantang emphasized: The key to achieving, or more  effectively achieving our established goal, lies in concrete  action. Upon returning to their work units, conferees should  translate the conference guidelines into concrete action in  every aspect of work and ensure effective implementation of each  and every policy measure. They should vie with each other in  striving to achieve fruitful results in the course of  implementation. It is necessary to strictly enforce a  responsibility system, and clearly define tasks and  requirements, as well as reward and penalty. While implementing  various tasks, it is imperative to improve the style of work,  and encourage the pragmatic spirit of more solid work and less  empty talk. To this end, leading cadres at all levels should  guard against and overcome piles of documents and countless  meetings, the formalism of issuing general calls while lacking  concrete guidance, and the bureaucratism of divorcing from  realities and failing to go down to the grass roots to do  concrete work. They should periodically go down to the  frontline of reform and development to conduct investigation and  study, to give guidance in work, and to discover and solve  problems in good time, thereby facilitating the smooth progress  of reforms. Meanwhile, in carrying out a new reform measure, it  is necessary to stress scientific approach; under no  circumstance should we do things on the spur of the moment or  according to subjective wishes. We should conduct scientific  verification based on investigation and study to ensure each and  every policy measure and specific project can yield the optimal  economic and social benefits. In improving the workstyle, it is  also necessary to attach importance to and strengthen the mass  work. We should foster a firm awareness of the masses; and  periodically go down to the grass roots to mingle with the  masses, to do thorough and meticulous mass work and propaganda  and guidance work, to listen to the opinions of the people, and  to grasp the pulse of the man in the street. We should conduct  in-depth investigation and promptly solve problems reported by  the masses in general. Meanwhile, we should care about the  livelihood of the people, paying particular attention to those  who still do not have enough to eat and wear, to workers of  enterprises in production stoppage or semi-stoppage, and to  retirees. We should show the concern of the party and  government for them by helping them solve practical problems,  thereby forging closer ties between the party and government and  the masses, safeguarding and bringing into better play their  enthusiasm, and working concertedly to more successfully carry  out the three major tasks of reform, development, and stability.    In conclusion, Yang Chuantang said: The whole year's work  depends on a good beginning in the spring. While transmitting  and implementing the conference guidelines, all localities  should pay close attention to economic work, spring farming  preparations in particular. They should step up efforts to  organize the allocation and transportation of chemical  fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural  production means, ensuring their prompt delivery for spring  farming. Industry, communications, commerce, and capital  construction departments should also conscientiously implement  the tasks set by the current conference and the regional  planning conference, striving to get off to a good start and lay  a sound foundation for comprehensive fulfillment of the various  tasks for this year. Public security and judicial organs, mass  organizations, and civil affairs departments should also make  their share of contributions to creating a favorable social and  external environment for reform, opening up, and economic  construction. He said: This year will be a crucial year for  promoting overall reform and achieving a breakthrough in key  areas. Cadres throughout the region should, in accordance with  the tasks and goal set by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of  the Fourth Regional Party Committee and the current conference,  work conscientiously with one heart and one mind; and channel  the enormous enthusiasm of the broad masses to reform in  promoting the expansion of productive forces and accelerating  economic construction in Tibet so as to greet the 30th  anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region with  outstanding achievements in building material and spiritual  civilizations.</p>

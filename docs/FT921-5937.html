			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Treasury sees German 'constraint' on loan rates THE TREASURY has rejected suggestions that a drop in the value of sterling or the pound's withdrawal from the European Monetary System would result in lower UK interest rates. It also indicates in the latest issue of the Treasury Bulletin that there is little chance of UK interest rates falling below German levels in the foreseeable future. Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said when launching the bulletin that the level of German rates was a 'real constraint' on British interest rates. He added that there was 'really no escape from that (constraint)' - although he refused to be drawn on the implications for UK base rates. The Bank of England has been resisting market pressure for a cut from the current 10.5 per cent before the March 10 Budget. The Treasury's comments in the bulletin are clearly intended to counter critics of government policy such as Sir Alan Walters, who served as economic adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher during her premiership. They have argued that devaluation of sterling in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, or withdrawal from the system, would enable the government to cut rates. The Treasury says a significantly lower exchange rate over the past year - either inside or outside the ERM - would 'probably have meant less inflation convergence and higher UK nominal rates'. A fall in sterling's exchange rate would be 'bound to add to UK inflation', it says, and 'lead to higher rather than lower nominal UK rates'. Drawing on a study of German and UK interest rates and the exchange rate of the pound against the D-mark since 1979, it describes the present narrow gap of less than 1 percentage point between UK and German short-term rates as 'a rare event'. It says there has been only one very brief period - in 1981 - when UK short-term rates were lower than German rates. That was after two years when sterling had unexpectedly been very strong.

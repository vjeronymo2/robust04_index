			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: SEC tightens rule for brokers to disclose order flow payments THE US Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday in favour of new rules that would require stock brokers to disclose to their customers the payments they receive for diverting stock orders to market-making firms. The practice of brokers steering business to marketmakers in return for money or payment in kind, known as 'payment for order flow', has been the subject of controversy for several years. The big established US exchanges such as the New York and American stock exchanges have vigorously attacked payment for order flow. When brokers are paid by marketmakers to divert business their way, it is usually at the expense of the big exchanges, whose members lose the opportunity to execute the buy and sell orders for brokers and their customers. Marketmakers are willing to pay for this business because they can make money every time they handle a stock order. From now on, brokers will have to reveal on the confirmation slips they send out to customers if they have been paid cash, or received a rebate, or a reduced fee, to divert the order to a marketmaker. Although payment for order flow remains legal, the SEC has left the door open for a ban on the practice if enough brokers' customers complain about the payments. In two separate decisions, the SEC voted to reduce to three days from five days the time investors and brokers have to settle their stock trades, and to grant large, well-capitalised German companies exemption from certain SEC trading rules. The vote on shortening settlement time was expected. The decision to grant big German companies exemption from the rules which limit participation in securities distribution by companies selling debt or equity in the US markets is designed to make it easier for foreign companies to sell their securities in the US. Daimler-Benz, the big industrial group which on Tuesday became the first German company with a full listing on US equity markets, is an obvious beneficiary of the exemption. The SEC said the exemption was limited to German companies because the agency addressed the issue because it was asked to by lawyers representing a German company. However, the agency said it would consider extending the exemption to other foreign, and some US, companies.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Observer: Talking shop How Jim Slater, the former financial shooting star of the 1970s, must envy George Soros, speculator extraordinaire. There was once a time when it seemed as if the financial world hung on Slater's every word in much the same way as the current markets hunger for a word from George about what he thinks is the next thing to go up or down. Take last week. On July 26 Soros declared in Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper, that he did not plan to speculate against the franc. Four days later, he issued a press release saying that he had changed his mind. Why does Soros talk so much? Perhaps he is genuinely concerned about the global financial system, or feels he has to justify his actions so that he cannot be accused by unsophisticated politicians, at some future stage, of manipulating the markets. Whatever the reason, Soros could learn something from Slater, another active investor whose record has been subjected to even greater scrutiny. Slater's weekly share tipping column in The Independent newspaper always carries a note that the financier has agreed not to deal in a share within six weeks before and after any mention in his column. Soros's reputation for straight talking would be enhanced if he observed the same sort of rule.</p>

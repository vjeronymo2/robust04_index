			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Widney in black and dividend forecast Widney, the broadly-based mechanical and electronic engineering group, announced a turnround from a first-half loss of Pounds 417,000 to a Pounds 638,000 pre-tax profit and predicted a return to the dividend list this year after a four year absence. Mr David Cassidy, chairman, explained that the dividend decision followed the clearing of preference dividend arrears, covering the period from July 1989 to December 1993, and amounting to Pounds 754,000. He said that with the debit balance on the parent company's P and L account cleared, ordinary dividends were now possible. Second-half results were expected to continue the progress shown in the first half, he added. Turnover for the six months to April 2 grew to Pounds 15.23m (Pounds 9.88m). Interest costs fell to Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 314,000) as a result of lower rates and borrowings, while earnings per share came to 0.41p (0.91p losses). The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 11 3/4 p yesterday.</p>

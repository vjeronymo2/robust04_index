Many of Russia's best-known professors, covering a wide range of scientific and technical fields from the environment to nuclear research, have joined the new organisation, known as Thesaurus. Institutional members include the Russian Academy of Science and the Moscow Institute for Physics and Technology. Thesaurus will be marketing research and consultancy services through Anglo-Russian Trade and Shipping, a joint venture of Robson Rhodes, the London accountants and management consultants, and the Peter Dragadze Group based in Moscow. Prof Sergei Kapitza, president of Thesaurus, said scientists were keen to work through a UK organisation because 'the British have a better attitude to the correct compensation of labour'. Mr Peter Dragadze said attempts by US companies to hire Russian researchers for as little as Dollars 25 per month 'were thought to be not only offensive but also impractical'. The price of a Thesaurus consultant is likely to be slightly lower than for a senior western scientist. Prof Kapitza, one of his country's best known physicists, expects Thesaurus experts to be most in demand for physics and engineering, particularly in energy-based industries. They could offer 'a fresh approach, a way of thinking that might not have occurred to western scientists'. Many Russian scientists were demoralised by the loss of status and continuity after the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union, Prof Kapitza admitted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vaino Reinart, Estonian delegation head at </F> Russian-Estonian talks, by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondents Igor  Klyuyev and Aleksandr Veretennikov in Tallinn; date not given:  "Estonia Is Not About To Agree to Compromises Designed To  `Perpetuate the Occupation'" -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] The 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks opened in  Moscow yesterday. Ahead of this event Estonian Delegation Head  Vaino Reinart answered RIA-NOVOSTI correspondents' questions.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to the Estonian press, the  republic leadership is extremely pessimistic about the chances  for the 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks. Is that right?    [Reinart] Not at all. The Estonian delegation is going to  Moscow with a calm heart. The somewhat unexpected turn of  events at the 17th round of talks caused a stormy reaction in  Europe, which clearly confirmed the correctness of our stance at  the talks. The demand for the Russian troops to be withdrawn by  31 August this year won the unequivocal support of NATO, the  CSCE, the EC, and the United States. At the same time it was  stressed that the withdrawal must be effected without any  additional terms being put forward. I hope that Russia too has  drawn the necessary conclusions from the international reaction  and chosen a more constructive approach than the one it voiced  during the last round.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is known that the preparation of a  general treaty regarding the troop withdrawal, including the  settlement of matters pertaining to military pensioners, has  been a stumbling block in the negotiating process. There are  reports that Estonia is drafting new wordings of some agreements  that will now be acceptable to the Russian side. Can you  confirm that?    [Reinart] The Estonian delegation has naturally spent all  this time working on various drafts and we hope that Russia too  has not abandoned the quest for constructive solutions. The  main troop withdrawal treaty was ready during the last round and  I do not really understand why we were not able to initial it.  I cannot see Russia's proposed changes regarding the text that  has already been coordinated as anything but Russia's reluctance  to complete the work on this draft treaty. Estonia's priority  in this round of talks is to complete the preparation of the  troop withdrawal treaty as required by the resolutions adopted  by international organizations. We are of course willing to  discuss the draft agreement on social guarantees for military  pensioners and we hope that Russia will give up its demands for  Estonian legislation to be amended in order to secure decisions  beneficial to it.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] The Estonian Government has approved and  submitted to parliament the draft law on the border whereby  Estonia's land border is fixed in accordance with the 1920 Tartu  Peace Treaty. Does this mean that your delegation will raise  the question of territories during the 18th round of talks?    [Reinart] Estonia has not taken any unilateral steps  regarding the border issue. We believe that such actions will  not bring us closer to really resolving the problem. In its  proposals Estonia acts on the principle of international law  whereby interstate borders are fixed by international treaties.  The only treaty fixing the border between Estonia and Russia is  the Tartu Peace Treaty, which is still valid today. Despite the  Estonian side's repeated requests, Russia is refusing to provide  legally valid explanations that accord with the principles of  international law as to why the border should run through an  area not prescribed by the Tartu Peace Treaty. Russia has also  responded in the negative to Estonia's suggestion that this  question be submitted to the International Court of Arbitration  in The Hague for consideration, which, as you know, only  examines contentious issues with the consent of both parties.  If Russia is so convinced of its arguments, I cannot understand  why it is not willing to resolve this issue on the basis of  international law.    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Latvian Delegation Head M. Virsis  described the results of the Russian-Latvian talks as a  "difficult compromise for both sides." Is Estonia ready for  such "difficult compromises," will it take its neighbor's  experience into consideration?    [Reinart] Russia has repeatedly said that the example of  another Baltic country -- Lithuania, from which Russian troops  were withdrawn without the corresponding treaty's being  concluded -- does not set a precedent for Estonia and Latvia.  The corresponding Russian-Estonian and Russian-Latvian draft  treaties were different from the very outset just as certain  aspects were also different. Estonia has already made "difficult  compromises" with Russia by agreeing to the final date for the  troop withdrawal by 31 August this year. The possibility of a  certain number of military pensioners obtaining residence  permits in accordance with Estonian legislation is also a  compromise. Estonia is not about to agree to any compromises --  difficult or easy -- that are designed to perpetuate the  occupation. We hope that Russia is also prepared to act on the  basis of the principles of international law when resolving the  remaining problems.</p>

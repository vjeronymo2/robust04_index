			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / No need to hit the panic button: The growing fear in the US of higher inflation and faltering growth looks exaggerated The irrationality of financial markets is sometimes remarkable. A few weeks ago, the fear on Wall Street was that the US economic recovery had ground to a halt. In the past few days that concern has been replaced by fear of galloping inflation. The price of gold - still regarded by many small investors as the ultimate hedge against inflation - has surged and is now 15 per cent higher than in early March. And the yield on long-dated bonds climbed briefly above 7 per cent, on worries that the Federal Reserve might begin to tighten monetary policy. When the Fed concluded its policy meeting this week without signalling an immediate rise in interest rates, there was a collective sigh of relief. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Average rose more than 50 points to a new record. Bond yields and the gold price retreated from earlier highs. But confidence is fragile: the next bad economic number is liable to set off another wave of concern. Faltering growth and faster inflation are ever-present risks. But both at the same time? If the economy is really slowing, inflation is unlikely to pose a threat - and vice versa. History suggests that 'stagflation' is a product of 'supply shocks' - such as the sudden increases in oil prices that hit the world economy in the 1970s. Nothing of that kind is happening today. The most legitimate source of concern lies in Washington politics. With conservative Democrats, Republicans and Texas billionaire Ross Perot all taking pot shots at the Clinton economic plan, the fate of the deficit-cutting package is uncertain. If the end result is a substitution of bigger spending cuts for some of the tax increases, markets will be well pleased; but the risk is that the various factions in Congress will be unable to agree on anything. Meanwhile, if you allow for the 'noise' that seems to envelop nearly every US statistical series, the stagflation fear looks greatly overstated. Inflation probably has passed its low point for this business cycle, but it seems unlikely to gather momentum rapidly. At the same time, the vigour of the US corporate sector suggests the outlook for growth is better than widely appreciated. Mr Paul Mastroddi, senior economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, notes that business investment in new equipment has accounted for about a third of total economic growth in the past year even though this sector represents only 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Equipment investment was up 14 per cent in real terms in the first quarter of this year against the same period of last year. This startling rate of growth helps explain why business leaders showed no interest in the temporary investment tax credit proposed in President Bill Clinton's economic plan but since axed by Congress. The investment surge is being led by huge purchases of computers and other information processing equipment. Investment in these items (which now accounts for 45 per cent of all equipment investment) was up more than 21 per cent in real terms in the year to the first quarter. But other categories of business capital formation are also doing well: investment in transport equipment and general industrial equipment was up 11.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. Capital formation is admittedly recovering from a relatively low base. But the investment recovery looks secure because it is underpinned by higher profits and productivity following extensive corporate restructuring. After-tax profits rose 10 per cent last year and may rise by nearly 20 per cent this year. Productivity was up 3.3 per cent last year, the sharpest increase for a decade. Gains in service-sector efficiency slowed in the first quarter but manufacturing productivity was up 5 per cent compared with the same period last year, the strongest rise since 1977. Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, reckons the underlying rate of productivity growth in all sectors of the economy is 2 per cent a year, or about twice the average rate in the past two decades. The investment-driven recovery reflects a special feature of this upturn: it is the first in recent decades to occur spontaneously - that is, without a big artificial boost from fiscal or monetary policy. Fiscal policy could not be loosened because of the huge federal deficits carried over from the 1980s. The Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy, but not as quickly or as sharply as in some previous business cycles. Real short-term interest rates are roughly zero, rather than negative; long-term real rates are 3.5 to 4.0 per cent, high by historical standards. The federal government's inability to lend a hand together with 'structural' impediments - such as defence cuts and weak balance sheets in the personal and corporate sectors - explain the halting recovery. The ballooning of the trade deficit in March may result in first quarter growth being revised down to an annual rate of as little as 1 per cent. This sounds awful, but it follows growth at an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent in the fourth quarter and is merely the latest of a succession of 'growth dips' since the economy stopped contracting two years ago. More recent data is mixed but on balance quite encouraging. Housing starts and retail sales rebounded in April after bad weather hit businesses in the first quarter. Car sales early this month were well above first quarter levels. Industrial production and payroll employment, however, are growing only slowly. But provided consumer confidence does not sink further, the economy seems capable of an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent this quarter, rising to perhaps 3 per cent in the second half of the year. Americans are frustrated by the slow recovery. But it may be no bad thing. The lack of an artificial public-sector stimulus means that companies, rather than consumers, are taking the lead; ultimately this could result in a more durable upturn. But will inflationary pressures force the Fed to tighten monetary policy and ruin everything? Superficially, there are grounds for concern. Sharp increases in consumer and producer prices in April were the third set of bad figures in four months. Since the beginning of the year, the consumer price index has risen at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent against a 2.9 per cent increase last year. This cannot all be put down to distortions such as a surge in the price of fresh vegetables following bad winter storms. The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile food and energy components - has risen at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent since January. Some of the Clinton administration's policies are also having an adverse effect. A ruling to block steel imports has allowed US steel companies to raise prices sharply. The yen's sharp appreciation is forcing Japanese companies to raise US prices. Instead of concentrating on regaining market share, US competitors seem to be following suit. Yet it hard to get too alarmed. Industrial capacity utilisation rates are well below the levels that sparked inflation in the past. Wage pressures are subdued, reflecting the 7 per cent jobless rate. Unit labour costs were up only 1.4 per cent in the year to the first quarter, reflecting the improvement in productivity. Price increases, moreover, have been bunched in the first four months in each of the past three years, casting doubts on the quality of seasonal adjustments. Some of the biggest sources of price pressures in recent months, such as higher air fares and tobacco prices - are already being reversed. Bond markets are upset because they had anticipated a decline in inflation from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. This no longer looks feasible. But few of the leading forecasters expect inflation to rise much above 3.5 per cent this year and some say 3 per cent is still achievable. In his Delphic public utterances, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has shown every sign of leaning towards this relatively relaxed view of inflation trends. Under his leadership, the Fed has sensibly responded to 'facts not forecasts'. At some point in the next six months to a year, the Fed probably will have to prove its anti-inflation credentials by raising short-term rates. But when that crucial turning point arrives, Mr Greenspan will want to confront a sceptical Clinton administration with incontrovertible evidence of the need for action. With unemployment high and the vigour of the recovery still a matter of debate, he does not yet have that compelling evidence.</p>

Japan's three common carriers submitted a petition Thursday [27  January] to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  requesting an investigation into discount services offered in  Japan by U.S. firms.    Meanwhile, three Japanese agents of the U.S. firms told  KYODO NEWS SERVICE that they have agreed to file a complaint  with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) if  restrictions are placed on their services.    For the Japanese Government, the bickering comes at a  crucial  time as U.S. negotiators are threatening possible sanctions if  the ongoing framework trade talks fail to reach an agreement  before President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa hold their summit in Washington on February 11.    "We are confident that we will not have to take such  actions," said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc.,  stressing that its discount services are legal both domestically  and internationally.    "But if the ministry decides to restrict our services, we  will have to explain to our parent U.S. firms preparing to file  a complaint," he said.    The Tokyo agent to New York-based US Fibercom Network Inc.  began operations in October with a call-back service offering  up to 40 percent lower rates than the three Japanese carriers.    The two other agents are International Network Services Inc.  for USA Global Link in Iowa, and Telecom System Co. for  International Telephone Co. in New York.    The Japanese carriers, led by KDD, a former international  telecommunications monopoly, said in a joint statement that the  call-back system "unfairly uses their lines free of charge and  causes trouble to their customers by making lines busy."    The two other Japanese carriers are International Digital  Communications Inc. and International Telecom Japan Inc.    In the past two years, U.S. discount services entered Japan  with the call-back system. The user calls a switching center in  the United States and hangs up after two rings. After a few  seconds, the center calls back and the user dials the number he  wishes to call, thereby making the U.S. the country of origin.    Back in the U.S., the operators lease lines from major  carriers like American Telephone and Telegraph Co. under  discount contracts for large-lot users in order to offer cheap  international telephone rates to individuals and companies.    Under a written agreement, the three agents are to "continue  offering the call-back service with an aim to further spread the  advanced U.S. telecommunications service in Japan."    "We will agree to hold friendly talks" with the three  Japanese firms and the ministry, "but are prepared to ask for  help, while explaining the situation in Japan to the USTR, the  U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and other U.S. Government institutions  that support our call- back service," Kawakami said.    Kawakami stressed that the service brings benefits of the  yen's appreciation and deregulations to Japanese companies now  actively streamlining amid the prolonged economic slump.    ''This is one of the key policies'' of the government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the services ''also help  Japan in reducing its current-account surplus with the United  States,'' he said.    But the share is still very small at less than 1 percent of  the 250 billion yen market in Japan, Kawakami said.    A KDD spokesman described the service as ''abnormal,''  stressing that the lines are used free of charge.    Kawakami said the three agents have also sent a joint notice  to the ministry and the Japanese companies indicating they are  prepared to pay if reasonable rates are presented.    ''We haven't received such notice yet, but will in any case  seek restrictions on the services,'' the spokesman said.    Ministry officials had said the discount services are no  problem under the existing telecommunications licensing system,  and the ministry has no control over rates provided by overseas  switching facilities.    In fact, the ministry issued permission to the three firms.    Telecommunications licenses are divided into two main types  -- one for common carriers, obliging them to submit rates for  ministry approval, and one allowing the free fixing of rates for  those providing service without possessing domestic switching  machines and lines.    But the officials had hinted at problems concerning `civil  laws'.</p>

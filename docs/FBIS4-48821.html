			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- South Africa could  not afford to be inward looking or isolated in an age of rapid  global communications, the minister of foreign affairs, Mr  Alfred Nzo, said on Friday. Speaking in debate on the  president's speech, Mr Nzo said South Africa should strive to  live in harmony with its neighbours and should conduct a foreign  policy aimed at the promotion of the well-being of all its  people. "As an African country with a rich international  heritage, we should promote Africa's interests, not only its  immediate economic and social needs, but also the continent's  long-term wellbeing in all spheres."    South Africa's foreign policy would be guided by the  promotion of freedom and democracy and commitments to human  rights, the principles of justice, to the interests of Africa,  and to expanded regional and international economic  co-operation. South Africa would seek to promote unity among  all the peoples of Africa.    South Africa's first step in realising the ideal of African  unity was its acceptance as the 53rd member of the Organisation  of African Unity. "Africa has taken us to her bosom with  overwhelming warmth and friendship. We are now part of Africa."    A regional security mechanism was important to deal with  regional conflicts.</p>

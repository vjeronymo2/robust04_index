By 1700, 58 percent of Kazakhstan residents had turned out  at  election precincts. And the CEC could now be firmly confident  that the republic population would not boycott such an important  political campaign as elections to the Supreme Council and to  maslikhats. Subsequent statistics confirmed this optimistic  prognosis: By not yet final data, 73.84 percent of the  Kazakhstan residents took part in the elections; in the capital,  this figure stood at 62.59 percent.    Nature attempted to make its negative adjustments to the  course of elections: In the north, it was unseasonably bitter  cold; the south and west were hit by snowstorms. Activists from  district and precinct commissions, assured the CEC chief,  countered the weather with a high degree of organization, aided  by modern communications. For instance, it was decided to  transmit the preliminary results of voting at the remote animal  husbandry pastures by radio telephone.    A high degree of organization in the course of election  campaign was noted, according to the CEC chairman, by numerous  foreign observers as well.    Of course, the question arose regarding violations recorded  in the course of both election campaign and the elections.    "I do not see grounds for great concern," said Karatay  Turysov, in this connection. "Shortcomings and snags always  happen in such a major undertaking. There have been no major  incidents in the republic."    As to "minor incidents," the head of the chief electoral  body  sees the cause as being that both the candidates and some  district commissions did not comply with the provisions of the  Electoral Code. As is known, the Supreme Council brought  different level administrations into organizing the elections.  And in this, even the watchful CEC had trouble distinguishing  where the local administrations' direct duties ended and direct  abuse began. Where the violations were obvious, electoral  bodies' sanctions followed: warning, withdrawal of registration.  Or, vice versa, actions to protect contenders for deputy  mandates. Six candidates have been restored in their rights by a  direct CEC decision. Some "eliminated" candidates for deputies  have not succeeded in going all the distance in their appeals:  Election day found some in the corridors of the Supreme Court,  and some, of the Constitutional Court. The Karaganda procurator  decided to invalidate election results in those districts where  the code had been violated in the process of candidate  nomination.    "As a CEC chairman, I am satisfied with the election  campaign," said Karatay Turysov in conclusion. "I believe that  under any circumstances we will have a highly professional  parliament!"    The CEC promises to make public the final results of the  vote  and the names of deputies in our new parliament on 14 March.</p>

The award of grant assistance for such purpose shall be consistent with section 106(d)(3)(B) of the Act, in such amount, and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine. Since guaranteed loan funds (as defined in &sect;570.701) are required to be used in accordance with national and primary objective requirements, and other applicable requirements of this part, any grant made to make payments on the debt obligations evidencing the guaranteed loan shall be presumed to meet such requirements, unless HUD determines that the guaranteed loan funds were not used in accordance with such requirements. Any such determination by HUD shall not prevent the making of the grant in the amount of the payment due, but it may be grounds for HUD to take appropriate action under subpart O based on the original noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In 24 CFR part 570, subpart I, a new &sect;570.497 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;570.497  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Condition of State election to administer State CDBG Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 106(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, a State has the right to elect, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary may prescribe, to administer funds allocated under subpart A of this part for use in nonentitlement areas of the State. After January 26, 1995, any State which elects to administer the allocation of CDBG funds for use in nonentitlement areas of the State in any year must, in addition to all other requirements of this subpart, submit a pledge by the State in accordance with section 108(d)(2) of the Act, and in a form acceptable to HUD, of any future CDBG grants it may receive under subpart A and this subpart. Such pledge shall be for the purpose of assuring repayment of any debt obligations (as defined in &sect;570.701), in accordance with their terms, that HUD may have guaranteed in the respective State on behalf of any nonentitlement public entity (as defined in &sect;570.701) or its designated public agency prior to the State's election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In &sect;570.507, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;570.507  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The first report on a small cities grant for a New York grantee should be submitted no later than October 31 for all grants executed prior to April 1 of the same calendar year.

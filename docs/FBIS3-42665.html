			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Bazhenova and Yuriy Katsman, with </F> commentary by the Financial Transactions Department: "Funds of  Private Individuals in the Bank for Foreign Economic Relations:  `National Credit' Assumes the Problems of VEB Clients"]    [Text] Opportunities for transferring funds from  accounts at the VEB [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] being  offered to private individuals by commercial banks stand out  among the new services that have appeared on the Russian banking  market. As a result, VEB clients will be given an opportunity to  get back their foreign exchange funds without moral loss or  waste of time, while the banks will be able to perceptibly  increase their volume of outside funds. This is why the number  of banks offering such services keeps growing. For example,  yesterday the VEB signed an official contract with the National  Credit Bank which gives the latter's clients preferential right  to the return of funds from the VEB.    Despite about 10 banks now actively providing the service of  transferring the funds of private individuals from the VEB, only  two of them, the Savings Bank and National Credit, have official  contracts with the VEB. The existence of a contract means that  requests by private individuals to have funds transferred from  the VEB to accounts at the Savings Bank or National Credit will  be met on a priority basis. This operation is effected on the  basis of a general sequence for banks that do not have such  agreements (in particular, one of these banks is the Moscow  branch of the Tveruniversalbank, which has been carrying out a  vigorous campaign for the transfer of funds of VEB clients since  the fall of 1993).    A client of the National Credit Bank must open an account at  the bank and draw up the requisite petition in order to receive  his funds from the VEB. National Credit guarantees the transfer  of funds within six days; in the process, the owner of the funds  is charged 1 percent of the amount as a commission to benefit  the VEB. Foreign exchange funds may be placed in a current  account or on deposit. The amount received may be withdrawn from  a current account in cash, in full or in part (in this case, the  commission comes to 1.5 percent), transferred to an account at  another bank (a transfer within the CIS will cost a client $5,  transfer abroad--$10). The bank will credit between 6.5 and 9.5  percent annually to the balance in the account. The profit of  clients from the placement of foreign exchange funds transferred  from the VEB to deposits ranges between 7 and 16 percent.    In addition to traditional opportunities, clients of the  National Credit Bank may purchase OLBI-Cards with funds received  from the VEB. The minimum amount necessary to receive the card  comes to $300 (annual interest on the deposit accrues at an  annual rate of 9.5 percent), plus $14 which is the price put on  the card itself. When cash is withdrawn with an OLBI-Card, a 5  percent commission is charged. When goods are purchased, the  owner of the card gets a 10 percent discount.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   At present there are more than 3,000 petitions to transfer  funds to other banks in the general card file of the VEB, and  the number of petitions keeps growing. On average, transfers of  funds on 400 petitions are effected during one banking day.  However, despite an increase in the number of banks that offer  their clients the service of transferring funds from the VEB,  most depositors still prefer to get cash funds right away rather  than use to this end accounts opened at other banks. In  particular, a permanent waiting line of former VEB clients who  wish to receive cash funds before the department of current  accounts of the bank testifies to this. The opportunity for  signing up to receive cash funds ahead of time does not improve  the situation much because only about 250 clients of the VEB may  sign up daily.

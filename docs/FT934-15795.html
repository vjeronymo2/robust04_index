			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nippon Oil lifts interim target NIPPON OIL, Japan's largest distributor of petroleum products, has revised upwards its pre-tax profit forecast for the half year to September after firm sales of its high-priced high octane gasoline and foreign exchange gains. Unlike the country's export oriented businesses which are facing sharp profit falls due to the strong yen, the rise in the currency has increased profit margins at Japanese companies which rely on imports, such as petroleum related companies and power utilities. The company expects non-consolidated interim pre-tax profits to total Y19bn (Dollars 180m), Y4bn higher than its original forecast. The figure, however, remains lower than the previous year's Y20.6bn due to a decline in financial gains. For the whole year, pre-tax profits are expected to remain unchanged from the previous forecast of Y40bn, as the company revised down annual sales estimates to Y1,900bn from Y2,000bn. Sales are expected to decline due to the continuing slump in the economy and declines in wholesale prices. Osaka Gas, the country's second largest city gas supplier, meanwhile raised its pre-tax profit projection for the first six months to September by Y2.5bn to Y10.5bn, 46 per cent higher than the same period last year. The company benefited from a cool summer, a higher yen and lower crude oil prices.</p>

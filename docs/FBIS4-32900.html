			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential candidates Ernesto </F> Samper of the Liberal Party, Andres Pastrana of the Conservative  Party, and Antonio Navarro Wolff of the April 19 Movement  Democratic Alliance by Dario Arizmendi and unidentified  reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota; from the "Caracol's 0600 to  0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] Dr. Ernesto Samper, thank you very much  for being with the Caracol Network of Colombia this morning.  Antonio Navarro Wolff is also on the line. Good morning.    [Samper] Good morning, Antonio.    [Navarro] How are you doing?    [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, how do you assess the election  results?    [Samper] Dario, I am very pleased with them. They speak for  themselves. I think it is clear that people in the major  cities, where the most independent and less committed votes are,  voiced their opinions. That was the case in Bogota, Cali,  Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. Their votes favored us and they  also favored Antonio Navarro.    Most of the votes cast for Dr. Pastrana came from areas  traditionally considered to be conservative. It does not  surprise me that he won in the Departments of Caldas, Narino,  and Northern Santander. I admit that Conservatives voted more  massively there just as the Liberals voted massively in the  departments that are traditionally liberal. The Conservative  machinery favored the Conservative candidate and others favored  me and my ticket partner Humberto de la Calle, and they also  favored Antonio Navarro.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, do you agree with Dr. Samper's  assessment?    [Navarro] I see something that perhaps Dr. Samper has not  analyzed. The Liberal Party made an all out effort to win in  the first round. A few hours before the elections, Former  President Dr. Alfonso Lopez predicted there would be a knockout.  That did not happen. I think that there was a technical tie.  This result deserves an in-depth analysis with electoral  figures in hand.    I think that abstention was high. This is another fact that  we must take into account. Abstention could be even higher  during the runoff. This could reflect a lack of voter interest  in political options, especially the most favored ones during  the first round. That is the result of polarization.  Yesterday's decision was virtually reduced to two choices.    I would say this tie created a complicated situation for  both  presidential candidates. Each one has his own reasons and  possibilities, but I think the key to salvation during the  runoff -- and this was determined yesterday by the support  received by each participant -- [pauses] it is now important to  listen to the voice of minority groups, which were not heard  very much during the final part of the campaign in view of the  polarization that was created.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, in this first public flirting with  Dr. Ernesto Samper, would you tell us on what bases you would be  willing to hold talks to present your basic proposals next  Thursday before the 400 or 500 people who will be coming to  discuss precisely what position should be adopted toward the two  candidates?    [Navarro] Let us give it another name. This is not flirting  but a friendly exchange. Regardless of what the electoral  result might be, I hope to maintain a friendly relationship with  Dr. Samper. I think we will make a decision after very calm  reflection and after consulting many people. We have the  responsibility of representing 220,000 people who heroically  voted for us and against the establishment. We must genuinely  represent those 220,000 people, and, thus, we will first consult  and listen to many people before taking even one step forward.    [Arizmendi] Yes Dr. Samper?    [Samper] Well, I think Dr. Navarro explained his view very  well. Of course, he has won an important opportunity. I have  always felt a third political force is needed and that an  opportunity should be given to an option other than the Liberal  and Conservative options. I think he has every right to summon  the people and I think there should be broad discussion. I am  sure, because I have known Antonio Navarro for many years, that  he will not make that decision by thinking of short-term  considerations but of long-term considerations with regard to  the support for the project of political opening, as the one  that has been carried out since the new constitution.    Dario, a topic that we should highlight is that of the  abstention rate. The fact is that we are moving from a  representative democracy to a direct democracy as a result of  the new Constitution. We have to continue working for the  development of the structures that were established in the  Constitution. Citizens' participation does not only mean  electoral participation, but also political and social  participation, which is what will finally enable this country to  have a much stronger democracy.    [Arizmendi] We inform our listeners and Drs. Ernesto Samper  Pizano and Antonio Navarro that we are going to welcome Dr.  Andres Pastrana Arango now. Good morning Dr. Pastrana.    [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] Colombians and Drs. Samper and Navarro are  listening to you. We are very happy to have you again on Latin  America's first radio network after yesterday's election results.    [Pastrana] Dario, I am also very happy and pleased to be  back  on Radio Caracol. Permit me to greet Ernesto Samper and Antonio  Navarro and to congratulate them. Yesterday, we held a  first-rate democratic election. Let me congratulate Ernesto,  Antonio, Regina Betancourt, General Maza, and each and every  candidate who participated in yesterday's elections. I wanted  to personally greet you Dario but I have an interview at 0900  with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, a man who you know has a  lot to teach us with regard to the topic of peace. In any case,  I wanted to greet you Dario and all my contenders, wishing them  luck and success. We have to work hard these next three weeks.    [Arizmendi] Thank you Dr. Pastrana for your gesture. I want  to invite you to come tomorrow to our studios or to talk with us  over the telephone from your house at 0730. We can talk at  length about yesterday's elections and the future.    [Pastrana] I will be there Dario. I would have liked to be  there right now. Thank you for the invitation, so tomorrow I  will be talking with all Colombians.    [Arizmendi] Well sir, we will wait for you at 0730. Very  nice of you to accept; have a good day, and thank you very much.    [Arizmendi] It is 0834 and we continue with Dr. Samper and  Antonio Navarro. Dr. Samper, what happened with the Liberals  who did not vote with the sufficient zeal and profession for  your party to win in the first round?    [Samper] I feel I received a significant portion of the  Liberal vote. One cannot regard this in absolute terms but in  terms of a comparison between the congressional and presidential  elections. Liberal leaders were able to get in yesterday's votes  the same number of votes they got in the congressional  elections. Of course, we still have to summon many Liberal  sectors. In some strife-torn areas, public order problems  hampered the vote of certain Liberal municipalities, like  Bolivar and the municipalities in the Santander and Norte de  Santander Departments. At any rate, I think Liberals are going  to be much more efficient in the runoff.    [Reporter] If one looks at what the Liberal and Conservative  Parties have been historically, one realizes Pastrana got the  vote of the Conservative party and others who rallied around his  program, personality, or any other reason. Others who are not  in the Conservative party joined that campaign. The same thing  did not happen with you because all the Liberal Party did not  vote for you, and your Alliance for Colombia group did not yield  results, it seems.    [Samper] On the contrary, if we did not have the support  from  sectors that make up the Alliance for Colombia, the amount of  votes would have been less.    I do not think the independent vote went to Dr. Pastrana. I  respectfully tell you, I repeat that such a vote was  concentrated in the big cities and the big cities voted for our  ticket. I do admit that, initially, the vote was proportionally  greater for Dr. Pastrana's Conservative machine. It can also be  the case that in certain regions, such as the coffee region,  there could have been a protest vote, a vote that went to Dr.  Pastrana [words indistinct] there are surprises. I repeat, if  one looks at the figures, department by department, one would  see that there was no change to the historical trend. It was  not a case that those who were Liberal Party supporters became  Conservative. What happened is that there was a great  Conservative vote turnout in favor of Dr. Pastrana and to this,  we must add the vote of support by regions especially affected  by the crisis in the agricultural sector.    [Arizmendi] One must suppose that there will be changes in  strategy or perhaps a readjustment or a strengthening of the  leadership positions within the campaign. When will you make a  decision in this regard?    [Samper] We will analyze the figures this week. We will  establish contact with the regions. We will summon those who  have been supporting us. The idea is to make decisions which,  of course, will not change the strategy much. This week's polls  predicted a virtual tie which is just what happened in the end.  Of course, we would have preferred to win in the first  elections, as Navarro said. It was not possible, however. This  gives minorities the opportunity to seek an understanding in  order to have a great majority in the next round of elections. I  think this is democratic. Runoff elections have that virtue. I  am obviously willing to form that majority seeking an agreement  with all the sectors that participated in yesterday's elections.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Samper, obviously the answer to as crude a  question as the following will not be easy, but what arguments  and bureaucratic reasons are you planning to use to convince  Navarro Wolff to support you?    [Samper] I do not expect to use bureaucratic reasons to  convince Navarro Wolff to support me. I think this is out of  the question because the truth is I have never reached political  understandings on the basis of giving out bureaucratic  positions. I think Antonio Navarro has never done so throughout  his political career. We are responsible for making this  country work on the basis of programmatic and ideological  coalitions. It is not a matter of bureaucratic positions, but  rather ideological and doctrinaire positions. I am confident we  will have the chance to reach an understanding with Antonio  Navarro in this arena.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Navarro, are you willing to form a  programmatic and ideological alliance on the basis of some  principles with Dr. Ernesto Samper, or are you also willing to  reach a kind of governability pact with his political group,  should he win the 19 June elections?    [Navarro Wolff] [Reporter says communication was lost]    [Arizmendi] Unfortunately, we lost communication with Dr.  Navarro. Let us go on with Dr. Samper. Dr. Samper, as for the  29 May elections, there are two greatly talked-about issues:  Are you going to maintain your emphasis on economic openings  and the agricultural sector? Do you believe it is necessary to  advocate more definite policies in such areas as coffee  production and urban development?    [Samper] I think we must put an emphasis on the countryside.  I think part of the profound crisis that was clearly expressed  yesterday by the municipalities is that there is a profound  agricultural crisis as never before seen in Colombian history.  This is why for the past year, I have been alerting the  government and authorities on the risks of failing to address  this agricultural crisis, which the subversion has helped  amplify.    [Arizmendi] Finally Dr. Samper, I thank you for these  statements to the Caracol Radio Network despite your staying up  all night, the parties, the expectations, the tension, and the  intensity with which you lived yesterday's events. There are  many Liberal leaders -- I insist on the word many -- who were  very upset with the campaign yesterday because the politicians  believe they were ignored and not taken seriously. Are they  going to be taken into account during these runoff elections?    [Samper] I have always been in direct contact with Liberal  leaders. We appreciate their work, support, and participation.  We, the independent and uncompromised sectors and the sectors  that do not operate through the traditional Liberal and  Conservative parties, have been working hard. We will continue  with this strategy and we hope to count on the leaders' support  and understanding to ensure that they will gather the votes of  the so-called Liberal active membership. We believe our  responsibility lies in enticing the new sectors that can support  our Liberal plan, and we expect to achieve this goal.    [Arizmendi] You have also reported that it seems some  Conservative politicians purchased votes in Atlantico  Department. Will you file a report?    [Samper] We have very distressing reports on an alleged vote  purchase in Atlantico Department. I will personally investigate  these reports this morning because any vote-purchasing  accusation would be serious. I think it would be very adverse  for this democratic process.    [Arizmendi] Finally, it is important to note the electoral  results in Santa Fe de Bogota and their meaning to you and to  the city's political present and future. How would you  interpret your victory here in Santa Fe de Bogota?    [Samper] The first thing I see is that people put an end to  the myth that the only mayor Santa Fe de Bogota had was Dr.  Pastrana. The truth is that people responded generously and  enthusiastically to the appeal we made. This position has a lot  to do with the plans I have proposed for the city from the  beginning. I committed myself to building the Santa Fe de Bogota  subway, creating the Social Advisory Board [Consejeria Social]  to coordinate government presence in the city, and relocating  the Police. I believe this contributed to the vote of  confidence the city gave me. As I said earlier, if there is a  city where people voted without prior commitments it is Santa Fe  de Bogota. People here never requested t-shirts, alcohol, or  transportation; they only wanted a convincing message. This is  what happened yesterday, and I am very pleased because in  addition to those who voted for other candidates, the majority  voted for us in Santa Fe de Bogota and other cities.    [Unidentified reporter] It was very kind of you to grant us  this interview on your first impressions of the results of the  elections.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Tajik deal struck A COALITION of Islamic and democratic opposition forces consolidated their control of the Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday, after their apparent overthrow of the ex-Communist government. The situation last night remained very tense with both sides allegedly still holding hostages. Sporadic outbursts of gunfire continued throughout the city and former Soviet army tanks were patrolling the streets near their garrison. A protocol agreement, aimed at ending the bitter dispute between the opposition and the former communist government was yesterday signed by representatives from both sides after 24 hours of negotiations and fighting which left at least 20 people dead. Under the agreement, the Communist government has been replaced by a Revolutionary Coalition Council until parliamentary elections are held later this year. The democratically elected president, Mr Rahmon Nabiyev is to be retained as nominal head of state. However, Mr Nazrullo Dustov, the powerful hardline vice-president, and other key government figures have been removed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Malange residents have once again been penalized  following yet another National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] attack on a World Food Program [WFP] airplane  carrying relief aid. Albino Malungo, minister of assistance and  social reintegration, discusses the situation:    [Begin recording] [Malungo] Right now, Malange is the  province with the largest food supply problems. The province  has a huge population and people cannot work. They depend on  relief aid from the government, the United Nations, and  nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]. That is a sad situation  because UNITA is still not serious. It is using relief aid for  political gain. From 16 to 20 May UNITA attacked WFP aircraft.  That is a gross violation. We have already had talks with the  United Nations and will once again meet its officials this  afternoon. I think the government will take measures regarding  supplies for UNITA in areas like Huambo and Jamba where we are  not sure whether UNITA has distributed aid to the right people.    [Unidentified correspondet] Does that mean retaliatory  action  will be taken?    [Malungo] Not exactly. Regarding the suspension of relief  aid for Huambo, I have information that UNITA soldiers raided  NGO and UN warehouses. They either did it on their own or were  following orders. That is a violation of the principles  governing relief aid. We are owed an explanation. [end  recording]</p>

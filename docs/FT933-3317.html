			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (5): Catalysts in the boardroom - Consultants / John Dunn, deputy editor of The Engineer, says that companies are now restructuring their whole business processes 'WHEN I started in consultancy, I was doing feasibility studies on flexible manufacturing systems like shelling peas. Now I can't remember the last one I did.' 'Manufacturing technology is not an issue any more. Most companies have now got their factories about right. We've done all the easy things.' ENGINEERING consultancy has changed. The old adage, that companies could afford to use consultants in the good times and couldn't afford not to in the bad times, died with the end of the Thatcher boom years in 1989. In a recession, consultancy is a discretionary spend. But industry's demand for engineering consultancy and the issues facing clients have also changed markedly over the past four or five years. Companies now have a much clearer strategic view of what they want to achieve and are beginning to examine their whole business, not just their production operations or shopfloor technology. Also, the catalyst for change is now coming from within companies themselves - directly from the boardroom  -not from some consultant's report. As a result, the consultant's role has changed. In the 1980s consultants would recommend and then implement change for their clients. Today, consultants are facilitators, not front-seat drivers. They are being hired to help companies manage change themselves, to hold their clients' hands, to give them 'ownership' of the changes. Mr Colin Leisk of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton says engineering firms are 'a hell of a lot wiser' about what they want from themselves and from consultants. 'They don't want 'how to' manuals and they don't want us to do the work for them. They want training and help on how to do it themselves. More and more, it is not us doing the work, but the client, with us providing the framework and inspiration.' Mr Tom Cuttill, partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand responsible for its manufacturing business, agrees. 'Engineering consultancy today is about the transfer of skills and knowledge to the client. Our business has changed significantly. Five years ago we would have been very pragmatic, very analytical, making recommendations on how to reduce the cost base. The business was very consultant driven.' But today, says Mr Cuttill, clients call him in to help them understand more about the way their whole business operates and to reduce non-value activities. 'Technology is no longer an issue. Nor is labour reduction. All the easy things have been done.' Clients are also much better users of consultants, says Mr Tony Roberts, head of manufacturing practice at PA Consulting. 'In the boom market of the 1980s almost everyone used a consultant and they got to know how to get the best out of them. Now they want consultants to work with them, not simply to recommend a solution. They know the solution, the problem is how to achieve it.' Mr James Bentley at KPMG Peat Marwick reckons the UK is the most well-developed consultancy market in the world - and the most demanding. 'The profession itself has grown up. The typical consultancy has been at it for some years and has built up a stable track record. As a result, clients have a vast choice. They know who to ring up to get a competent job done.' In some respects, he suggests, the UK may now be over-consulted. The result of all this, argues Mr John Crampton of Ingersoll Engineers, is that industry has become much more competent at the 'easy' jobs such as investment planning - new factories, new machines, new technology. 'I can't remember the last manufacturing investment programme I did for a client,' says Mr Crampton. 'Most people have got their factories about right now.' Thus life has become very challenging for consultancies as the issues facing clients have become softer, more subtle and more complex. The big issue at the moment is business process re-engineering. There is a growing realisation that the way a company does its business - the information flow through the company - has a very real effect on the success of that business. And the more successful companies are now turning their attention towards restructuring or 're-engineering' their whole business processes. They realise that every product or service they produce is the output of a process - a series of operations and functions. And in order to improve a product, it is necessary to look at the complete process, examining each step in detail and improving it. 'In the old days you would look at your factory vertically and sort it out function by function - purchasing, design, manufacturing and so on,' says Mr Bentley at Peat Marwick. 'But today, you have to take a much more horizontal approach. And companies can find that very difficult to do since it crosses so many key internal boundaries.' Mr Mike Tremouth, marketing director for the Peter Chadwick consultancy, says the aim is to simplify the process and make it more capable of delivering the right products by reducing 'the opportunities for defect' - the chances of something going wrong. Typically, he says, this means looking at a company's whole value chain all the way from the supplier, through design, manufacture and distribution, to customer service. 'If you can reduce the opportunities for defect and can compress the time taken along the value chain, you get real benefits.' It is a similar concept to simultaneous engineering or parallel engineering, he says, to get suppliers hooked into your business. 'Ideally, you should manage them so that they become part of your business,' Mr Tremouth argues. But it is not just the clients who are beginning to re-examine the way they do business. The consultancies are at it too. Mr Bentley at Peat Marwick believes that in future consultancy will come down to a matter of individuals and their relationship with clients. 'Clients will only buy the people with a track record. The problem for us is how to retain our experienced people. There aren't that many new, clever things we can keep coming up with to keep them happy. So, yes, we call in outside people to help us look at ourselves. The future for consultancy is all change.'</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AUTO SALES RISE 2.8% IN A SLUGGISH MID-MARCH  </P> <P> New domestic car sales rose 2.8% in mid-March, the auto companies reported  Thursday. The overall sales total was disappointing, auto industry analysts  said, and only confirmed a pattern of weakening sales throughout the year.  </P> <P> The sales slump is due, they said, to consumer worries about the economy --  caused by reports of rising interest rates -- and a lessening of consumer  demand for autos.  </P> <P> The eight domestic auto manufacturers -- including foreign manufacturers that  produce cars on U.S. soil -- reported that they sold 194,597 units in the  10-day period, against 189,245 units in the period last year.  </P> <P> "Sales were slightly weaker than I expected," said David Healy, an automotive  analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. "They were up a bit from last  year, but last year's period was very weak. I think you'll see (the sales) go  down sharply next period. . . . There is a continuing pattern of slowly  weakening sales that's been going on for some time."  </P> <P> Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; Associates,  agreed that sales were weak, especially given the fact that auto manufacturers  launched a new round of incentives just before the beginning of the mid-month  sales period. He said auto manufacturers are being affected by consumer worries  about the economy, a lack of demand and overcapacity in the industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerns About Economy  </P> <P> "I think what is causing the slowdown . . . is partially due to growing  concerns about the economy," Cedergren said. "The other part is the fact that  demand for new cars is off. We've had four to five years of strong car sales  that satisfied all of the pent-up demand for new cars.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that 1989 is going to be the year of reckoning," Cedergren  added. "If sales continue at this level . . . sales are going to be tough for  all the manufacturers, because there is so much more availability of new car  models. Even a slight downturn will cause severe pressure on the  manufacturers."  </P> <P> Ford's sales were up 6.1% for the period, while GM's sales rose 2.1% and  Chrysler's sales dropped 16.2%.  </P> <P> Most of the transplanted auto manufacturers reported dramatic gains, due  largely to increased production capacity at their U.S. assembly plants. Honda's  sales of U.S.-built cars rose 24.5%, while Nissan's sales jumped 55.8% and  Mazda's sales rose 86.3%. Toyota's sales rose a softer 3.3%, and fledgling  transplant Mitsubishi reported sales of 557 units in the 10-day period.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AUTO SALES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.22IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Mar. 11-20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 10-Day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GM  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 92,362  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +2.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 57,479  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +6.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chrysler  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25,824  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -16.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Honda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9,052  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +24.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nissan U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,912  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +55.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Toyota U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,027  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +3.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mazda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,384  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +86.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 557  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  --  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 194,597  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +2.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> There were 8 selling day in the selling period this year and last year.  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Fewer Norwegians want to join EC NORWEGIAN opposition to European Community membership has risen in the run-up to next month's parliamentary elections, a Gallup poll published yesterday shows. Some 47.1 per cent of those questioned oppose membership, a rise of 1.8 percentage points in one week. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 Norwegians, put support of membership at 28.3 per cent, a decline of 1.2 percentage points, while 24.6 per cent were undecided. Norwegian membership in the EC is the main issue in the September 13 elections. The electorate narrowly rejected joining the EC in 1972, but Brussels and Oslo began fresh negotiations last April and a new Norwegian referendum could be held in 1995. The poll, in the Conservative newspaper Aftenposten one week after the campaign started, showed popularity of the pro-EC Conservative party down 2.9 percentage points to 20.3 per cent. The ruling Labour party, whose minority government applied for EC membership, advanced 1.2 percentage points to 32.8 per cent.</p>

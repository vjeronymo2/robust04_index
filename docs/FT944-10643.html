			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (21): Income is gradually rising - Rural development programme The town of Comanche in the province of Pacajes - some 120km south of the capital La Paz, on the bleak and wind-swept Altiplano - is the site of an unusual sustainable rural development project, writes Raymond Colitt. Only a few years back, the population of Comanche was struggling with daily survival. The inhospitable lands did not allow for any type of agriculture. Water is scarce during 10 months of the year and the temperature at 4,000m above sea level often drops well below zero. Well-water in the area is salty and unsuitable for human consumption. The Pacajes, a pre-Incan indigenous group, had once earned their living as merchants, bringing goods from the Pacific coast. The coming of the railway meant that their way of life changed drastically, forcing them to rely on agricultural activities. Yet even cattle ranching, the only source of income, was not feasible on a large scale because of the meagre vegetation. The villagers of Comanche, like those in many other towns throughout the Altiplano, left home to look for jobs in the city, to practice slash-and-burn farming in Bolivia's lowlands, or to join the multitude of coca-growers in the sub-tropical Chapare region. Then, in 1983, a non-profit aid organisation, Semta, launched a rural development plan. Unlike countless other aid projects, this one introduced simple and inexpensive technologies to promote environmentally sustainable and economically yielding agricultural practices. One of the earliest and most successful projects was the construction of a new type of greenhouse - a low, four-walled building covered with an 'agrofoil' that allows the temperature to rise to 350C, while protecting the plants from strong winds. Other low-cost, high-impact projects include the construction of ditches and dams to retain and channel rain water, which is otherwise wasted and erodes the already thin layer of fertile soil. A programme to recuperate 17,000ha of grassland by sowing native grass seeds is already bearing fruit: the number of cattle able to graze there has increased substantially. Semta's projects are based neither on hand-outs nor on 'top-to-bottom' coaching. Mr Oscar Aguilar Calderon, Semta's executive director, says: 'Community participation is crucial in avoiding dependence and in guaranteeing the success of a project.' Farmers must, for example, produce and hand over to Semta new seed for the grassland project - in exchange for which they get barley seed. High-school children are in charge of reforestation and receive an award for the biggest tree at the end of each year. Management plans are also jointly established between the community and Semta. Today, the results of Semta's work are clearly visible. Many families are virtually self-sufficient in grains, vegetables and milk. Their income is gradually rising through the commercialisation of cattle-farming and their agricultural skills have improved significantly. However, one member of every family usually still migrates to La Paz, Cochabamba or Santa Cruz to secure additional income, and the inhabitants of Comanche are still uncertain about the future of their community. But the massive flow of migrants has at least been halted. The question is whether this type of project can be implemented on a national level.</p>

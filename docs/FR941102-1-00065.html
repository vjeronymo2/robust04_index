Adoption of Multiple Component Pricing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals to incorporate multiple component pricing in the Chicago Regional (Order 30), Nebraska-Western Iowa (Order 65), Upper Midwest (Order 68), Eastern South Dakota (Order 76) and Iowa (Order 79) Federal milk marketing orders (the five orders) should be adopted, with some modifications. The pricing plan generally would be patterned after the multiple component pricing plan proposed by National All-Jersey, Inc. and other dairy organizations. Producers would be paid on the basis of the pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids (solids-not-fat other than protein) in their milk, and would share in the value of the pool's Class I and Class II uses on a per hundredweight basis. Regulated handlers would pay for the milk they receive on the basis of total butterfat, the protein and other nonfat solids used in Classes II and III, skim milk used in Class I, and the hundredweight of total product used in Classes I and II. A somatic cell adjustment, per hundredweight, would also apply to payments for all producer milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the present time, milk received by handlers under the five orders is priced according to the pounds of producer milk allocated to each class of use multiplied by the prices per hundredweight of milk testing 3.5 percent butterfat, as determined under the orders for each class of use. Adjustments for such items as overage, reclassified inventory, location and other source milk allocated to Class I are added to or subtracted from the classified use value of the milk. The resulting amount is divided by the total producer milk in the pool to calculate a price per hundredweight of milk testing 3.5 percent butterfat to be paid to producers for the milk they have delivered to handlers. The price paid to each producer is then adjusted according to the specific butterfat test of the producer's milk by means of a butterfat differential. The butterfat differential is computed by multiplying the wholesale selling price of Grade A (92-score) bulk butter per pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as reported for the month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by 0.138 and subtracting the Minnesota-Wisconsin price at test, also as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, multiplied by .0028.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

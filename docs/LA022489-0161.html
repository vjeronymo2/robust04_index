			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: IT'S NOT JUST WHERE YOU EAT, IT'S WHERE YOU SIT WHEN EATING  </P> <P> Close to the harpist. Near the waiter's station. Next to the kitchen.  </P> <P> Spots to get the very best food service?  </P> <P> Hardly. Spots the cognoscenti say are simply "Siberia" inside of power  restaurants.  </P> <P> At Antoine, that divinely chic salon that perches like a royal jewel box inside  Le Meridien hotel in Newport Beach, you will never see a power couple like  Renee and Henry Segerstrom sipping vintage bubbly in the same chamber as the  woman strumming the heavenly strings. Never. Never. Never. The Segerstroms are  always escorted to Table 21, in a chamber once removed from the harpist.  </P> <P> At Antonello in Santa Ana, where Orange County supervisors dine frequently, and  where Forbes 400 member George Argyros regularly sinks his teeth into power  lunches, you won't see heavy hitters at Table 1, the "worst seat in the house,"  says a laughing Antonio Cagnolo, the debonair Italian who owns the place.  "That's next to the waiter's station.  </P> <P> "The A spot is Table 27. It sits in the corner of our villa area and has all  the things an A table should have: it's up front enough to have a view of the  dining room but private enough to keep people from bothering you."  </P> <P> Argyros, Cagnolo says, frequently requests Table 6, a larger table where more  power folks can dine and still see, and be seen, but not be pestered. When  Henry Segerstrom was courting the powers-that-be of Tiffany &amp; Co., he  requested round Table 6.  </P> <P> Never-never land at the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach is around Table 20,  located immediately outside the kitchen exit, manager Craig Schisler says. "The  A table is No. 38, the booth that sits under an oil painting of Auguste  Escoffier."  </P> <P> An A table never had it so good. Sitting under the toque-topped, dashing master  of French cuisine, guests get to sip an extra-dry martini and drink in the  panorama of the smart set as they dine in the plush main room. And one also  gets to gawk at the goings-on within the clubby bar (where, overhead, owner  Hans Prager has posted the saying: "It's my life. I live it. I love it. Critics  be damned.")  </P> <P> Other power spots at the Ritz include the posh Ritz Brothers' room, where the  power booths are 10, 11 and 12. And then there are those ritzy, curtained  tables in the piano room that look rather like posh church confessionals.  (Irvine Co.'s Gary Hunt -- billionaire Don Bren's right arm -- and Forbes 400  megadeveloper William Lyon were recently spotted there doing a power lunch  behind drawn curtains.)  </P> <P> At the private Center Club in Costa Mesa, the only table is Table 56, the spot  where diners can pick at poached salmon while gazing upon the curvy bronze  sculpture "Sun Glitter" by Sweden's Carl Milles, located in the water gardens.  </P> <P> "It's the ocean view of Costa Mesa," says the club membership chairwoman, Susan  Stebbins.  </P> <P> Siberia at the Center Club, Stebbins says, is Table 70, the first table you see  as you enter the dining room. "If you sit there, you feel like everyone is  coming directly at you, like you're about to throw a huge dinner party!"  </P> <P> Dear Miss Manners: What do you do when the star of your party, a celebrated New  York society queen who just happens to be the wife of Henry Kravis -- the  corporate buyout king -- calls to say, boo-hoo, she has the flu? Janice Johnson  knows. You smile at your guests as they sweep into your cliff-hung Laguna Beach  home. You bubble. You make sure everyone has a drink.  </P> <P> And you have a tiny nervous breakdown before guests arrive. "It's  embarrassing," said Johnson on Wednesday after learning fashion designer  Carolyne Roehm would not attend her patron party that night. The sparkling  soiree kicked off "The Guilds Take Manhattan," a benefit for the Orange County  Performing Arts Center that, on Thursday at the Irvine Hilton, featured Roehm's  breathtaking spring collection and netted more than $70,000. "But Carolyne  called me personally and she sounded very sincere. She said she was from the  Midwest and never breaks a promise, that she would be at her fashion show on  Thursday night." Among the 100 missing Roehm at the patron bash were: Johnson's  husband Roger, CEO of Western Digital; Willa Dean and William Lyon; Gus Owen  and Kathryn Thompson; Harry and Shari Esayian; Barbara and Jim Glabman and Bob  and Gayle Anderson.  </P> <P> Hot Stuff: Watch for the Round Table West, a high-level book club that formerly  met at the now-defunct Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, to begin meeting at the  Balboa Bay Club (Fay Wray plans to promote her new book there soon) . . . Pilar  and Aissa Wayne, along with author Joseph Wambaugh, will be among the celebrity  waiters Monday night at Dizz's As Is restaurant in Laguna Beach to benefit the  Orangewood Children's Foundation . . . Watch for designers Bob Mackie and Oscar  de la Renta to make back-to-back charity appearances at the Amen Wardy boutique  at Newport Center Fashion Island this spring. De la Renta will appear at a  luncheon May 12, and Mackie will appear the next night at a black-tie soiree.  Both events will be staged by Angelitos de Oro, a highly sophisticated support  group of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County.  </P></p>

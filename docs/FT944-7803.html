			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A dangerous vacuum Sir, Your editorial, 'Ukrainian virtue' (November 18), states that the Ukrainian parliament made the world a safer place. But has it also made an 'independent' Ukraine safer? Ukraine cannot survive as an independent state without creating economic prosperity. Poland has understood this very well. But Poland also knows that economics does not guarantee security. This is why it is strongly seeking Nato membership and integration with western Europe. Ukraine begins an attempt at radical reform with no offer to become part of Nato. The possibility of becoming part of European Union is measured in decades. An independent Ukraine today exists in a vacuum. Because of its size and location, this is a dangerous state to be in. Ukraine's history attests to this.

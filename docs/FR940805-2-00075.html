			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Opioid Drugs for Treatment of Chronic Intractable Pain._An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer opioid drugs (e.g., morphine) intrathecally or epidurally for treatment of severe chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin in patients who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and who have proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The patient's history must indicate that he/she would not respond adequately to non-invasive methods of pain control, such as systemic opioids (including attempts to eliminate physical and behavioral abnormalities which may cause an exaggerated reaction to pain); and   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A preliminary trial of intraspinal opioid drug administration must be undertaken with a temporary intrathecal/epidural catheter to substantiate adequately acceptable pain relief and degree of side effects (including effects on the activities of daily living) and patient acceptance.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Coverage of Other Uses of Implanted Infusion Pumps._Determinations may be made on coverage of other uses of implanted infusion pumps if the contractor's medical staff verifies that:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The drug is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the individual patient;   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It is medically necessary that the drug be administered by an implanted infusion pump; and   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FDA approved labelling for the pump must specify that the drug being administered and the purpose for which it is administered is an indicated use for the pump.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Implantation of Infusion Pump Is Contraindicated._The implantation of an infusion pump is contraindicated in the following patients:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug being used (e.g., oral baclofen, morphine, etc.);   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients who have an infection;   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients whose body size is insufficient to support the weight and bulk of the device; and   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients with other implanted programmable devices since crosstalk between devices may inadvertently change the prescription.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of an implantable infusion pump as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are not covered under medicare:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. External Infusion Pumps._  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Diabetes (Effective for Services Performed On or After 1/29/85)._The use of an external infusion pump for the subcutaneous infusion of insulin in the treatment of diabetes is not covered.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Implantable Infusion Pump._   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or After 9/26/84)._According to the Public Health Service, there is insufficient published clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the heparin implantable pump. Therefore, the use of an implantable infusion pump for infusion of heparin in the treatment of recurrent thromboembolic disease is not covered.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transmittal No. 68. Section 50&hyph;32. CHANGED IMPLEMENTATION Instructions_Effective Date: For Services Performed on or After 03/17/94.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 50&hyph;32, Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA), is revised to provide for additional coverage of this procedure. PTA coverage is expanded to include treatment of atherosclerotic obstructions of vessels in the upper extremities. The upper extremities do not include head or neck vessels. Clarification is made that PTA is covered in the treatment of obstructive lesions of the arteriovenous dialysis fistulas through either an arterial or a venos approach.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 50&hyph;32&blank;Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This procedure involves inserting a balloon catheter into a narrow or occluded blood vessel to recanalize and dilate the vessel by inflating the balloon. PTA is covered to treat the following indications:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Atherosclerotic obstructive lesions:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

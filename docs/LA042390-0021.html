			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PERSPECTIVES;  </P> <P> PROTEST WINDS WILL GUST AGAIN;  </P> <P> HAS OPPRESSION KILLED THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT? DESPITE SURFACE SIGNS OF ITS  DEMISE, IT IS ALIVE AND STRONG.  </P> <P> Foreigners, whose unenviable task it is to fathom China, are reduced to  studying what they see and hear, without means to gauge the true feelings of  the people, who even on the sunniest days resort to rituals and masks.  </P> <P> And nowadays, the skies over Beijing are dark indeed. The square is empty. The  voices are silenced.  </P> <P> The 1989 outpourings of citizens in the Communist world occurred first in Tian  An Men Square, then spread, toppling one dominion after another, reaching  toward the heart of the Soviet Union, stirring even Mongolia. Similar forces  were at work: Communism's endemic failure to meet either material or spiritual  needs; wanton corruption; economic woes; the devastating contrasts with lives  in the Free World; a stultifying atmosphere where the party, right and wrong,  knows best.  </P> <P> Why, then, has China remained a country apart?  </P> <P> For Confucian ages, Chinese were taught to kowtow publicly to elders and  authority, however unreasonable. For Maoist decades, individuals had to submit  meekly to the will of the party or they and their clansmen suffered dire  reprisals. Throughout the vast, populous and poor land, harmony was exalted  above equity. Thus the students sought to work within the system, petitioning  for dialogue and respect as patriots. Also, unlike their foreign counterparts,  the spontaneous Chinese demonstrators lacked experience, organization, unified  tactics or popular leaders like Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel.  </P> <P> Why then did the demands of the Chinese students -- infinitely more modest than  the radical ones of East Europeans -- elicit such a brutal response?  </P> <P> Not as well-educated or informed as Mikhail S. Gorbachev and others, China's  first-generation rulers were Long Marchers whose political instincts were akin  to those of Mao and Stalin. They played on traditional Chinese fears of chaos.  They painted hunger strikers, who harmed only their own health, with the  terrifying images of youthful Red Guards who overturned heaven and earth during  the Cultural Revolution. They called in extensive debts of personal loyalty  owed by a legion of underlings. They drew on credits earned through a decade of  bold economic reforms and relative openness.  </P> <P> As the demonstrations persisted and amassed broad support, Party Secretary Zhao  Ziyang, as well as others in high places, urged moderation. Some key generals  petitioned for nonviolence. But the feudal patriarchs, fearing even modest  gestures would thrust them on a slippery slide out of power, ordered the  People's Army to shoot at its own people. Blinded by pride and ignorance, they  underestimated reactions at home and abroad to the indelible image of one lone  man braving tanks.  </P> <P> This mistake only intensified their paranoia. Ever since, they have reverted to  Maoist tactics that can only destroy the road to modernization they themselves  had so arduously paved.  </P> <P> Has oppression killed the democracy movement?  </P> <P> Despite surface signs of its demise, it is alive and strong. The Chinese people  recognize the Big Lie and know that the bloody climax last spring was hardly  inevitable. It took Deng Xiaoping seven weeks to marshal sufficient consensus  to unleash the soldiers. Splits that opened in the political and military ranks  then are widening still. Many party and provincial officials defy or dilute  directives from the Politburo. Many in the army are shamed by its inglorious  role and resent elevating politics over professionalism. The regime, clearly  uncertain about the loyalties of even the police, recently replaced their top  leaders. An underground that protects political fugitives and allows them to  flee can only exist with the connivance of authorities and popular support.  </P> <P> Last spring's demonstrations, the largest in China's history, broke out in  virtually every major city in the nation. Students led, but intellectuals,  workers, entrepreneurs, ordinary citizens, government and party officials  followed. The myriad economic pressures that fueled discontent multiply as  austerity measures have smothered growth and spread unemployment, raising the  specter of larger numbers of workers joining the ranks of the disaffected. Much  of the opposition, once willing to settle for gradual change, has been  radicalized.  </P> <P> Though China appears tranquil today, it is seething with anger, cynicism and  passive resistance. People lie in wait. They know that octogenarian patriarchs  must soon leave the stage. They ask: If the legendary Mao failed to anoint a  successor, how could lesser men succeed? No longer do Chinese regard their  leaders as the keepers of an unerring faith, but as wardens of temporal powers  shorn of ideals. Even the despicable Gang of Four in 1976 only sprayed water,  not bullets, at Tian An Men crowds wishing them ill.  </P> <P> Thus, while public obeisance continues, it is forced and does not reflect  legitimacy. The elders know this, too. So they have forbidden citizens to  stroll in the square, have even outlawed black armbands and white flowers to  commemorate the dead, any dead, on the day marked by the ancients for mourning.  </P> <P> But anniversaries abound. And derisive laughter is more infectious than tears.  A leadership that fears above all its own people cannot last.  </P> <P> In this era, sooner or later, through takeover by reformers at the top or new  demonstrations from below or both, the global winds of change that first gusted  in China will return ever stronger to Tian An Men Square.  </P></p>

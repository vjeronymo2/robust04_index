Our correspondent  Yevgeniy Zherebenkov reports:    [Zherebenkov] This is not the first time the State Duma has  turned its attention to the Yugoslav problem. Hearings on the  situation in former Yugoslavia have already been held by the  committee on international affairs. One of the Duma's first  documents was a resolution on ways of settling the Yugoslav  conflict. But the latest hearings, held by the Liberal  Democrat-dominated committee on geopolitical issues, have not  really heard any fundamentally new proposals. Deputies again  demanded that the president use his right of veto in the UN  Security Council against NATO's decision on air strikes in  Yugoslavia. They also want him to tackle the question of  lifting Russia's economic sanctions against Yugoslavia.    Vladimir Ivanovskiy, a Foreign Ministry representative,  assured the deputies that Russia would do all it could to  prevent an escalation of the conflict. Here is what he said to  me in an interview:    [Begin Ivanovskiy recording] I arrived at the hearings  straight from consultations at the Foreign Ministry with British  Foreign Office officials. As you know, Major is here at the  moment. Yugoslav problems will be one of the central topics at  the talks. We are doing everything we can, working with the  different sides. I said that the president's special  representative had spent almost the whole of Saturday night in  talks with Milosevic. It is also envisaged that our president  will have further contacts with the presidents of the leading  countries, those that are playing an active part in the  settlement process. The minister is in constant contact with  them. So everything possible is being done to avert the worst.  There is only one method available to us -- talks and  clarification of positions, the search for a joint solution.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Indonesian gas find boosts shares of O&amp;Y offshoot SPECULATION over a natural gas find in Indonesia has pushed up the market value of one of the companies for which Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened property developer, is seeking a buyer. The share price of Gulf Canada Resources, a large oil and gas producer, that is 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, has risen by more than 80 per cent in the past week. This is attributed mainly to Gulf's announcement last Monday that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Asamera Oil, has discovered what it described as a gas zone 'of significant thickness' on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The jump in the share price has lifted Gulf's market capitalisation in the past week from CDollars 724m (USDollars 608.4m) to more than CDollars 1.3bn. Gulf's shares stood at CDollars 8.25 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Uncertainty about O&amp;Y's financial condition pushed them as low as CDollars 4.50 last month. Gulf cautioned that initial data from its exploratory well has yet to be confirmed by more detailed tests. However, the preliminary findings have prompted speculation that the gas field could be as big as the nearby Arun field, which is a large supplier of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Asamera has a 50 per cent equity interest in the area being drilled. The remainder is owned by Aceh Gas and Oil of Japan. Asamera's discovery has also pushed up the share price of Encor, another Calgary oil and gas producer, which has a 22.5 per cent interest in an exploration block in the Malacca Strait of Sumatra. O&amp;Y, which is owned by Canada's Reichmann family, has been seeking a buyer for Gulf as part of efforts to raise cash to service its debt. But Mr Bill Magee, analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said yesterday that neither buyers nor sellers are likely to commit themselves until there is greater certainty about the value of the Sumatra gas discovery. Another O&amp;Y subsidiary, GW Utilities, said yesterday that it has bought for a discounted price the proceeds of a special dividend which it is due to pay on April 14 to another company controlled by the Reichmann family. The deal enables the Reichmanns to gain immediate access to the special dividend, which it is using to meet overdue repayments on two O&amp;Y commercial paper programmes. The Reichmanns are entitled to special dividends from GWU of CDollars 158m on April 14, but will immediately receive CDollars 147m. O&amp;Y said yesterday that it was immediately using the proceeds of the GWU special dividend to help retire one of its commercial paper programmes. The company said it was redeeming about CDollars 78m in securities issued by O&amp;Y Commercial Paper II. The remainder of the funds would be used to help retire CDollars 153m in paper which had still to mature. A run on O&amp;Y's commercial paper last month contributed to the liquidity crisis which forced it to restructure its debt. Outstanding obligations in a second CP programme are expected to be met from the sale of Exchange Tower, a Toronto office building. The company expected this transaction to be concluded within the next few days.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ciaran Ryan] </F>   [Text] The National Party [NP] Government sent the national  debt soaring by more than R[Rand] 60-billion in its final year  of power. The money was spent on tidying up the nation's books  and settling some apartheid debts.    Economists warn that SA [South Africa] is careering to South  American-style debt and future generations will bear a heavy  burden. The nine new regions will shoulder part of the  R15-billion debt inherited from the homelands. Finance  Director-General Estian Calitz says the regions will be  responsible only for "that portion of the debt linked to assets".    Most of it will be taken over by the Government. It is faced  with a 13 percent rise in the interest bill from R20.5-billion  in 1993-94 to about R23-billion -- the largest item in the next  budget.    Mike Brown, economist at stockbroker Frankel Pollak  Vinderine, says: "State debt is approaching danger levels. The  real problem is the rate at which the interest burden is rising  relative to economic growth."    Economist Edward Osborn says the interest burden is running  out of control, restricting the new Government's ability to  embark on radical spending programmes. "There is no easy way  out. The new administration inherits the problems caused by  decades of economic mismanagement. The country is in a  public-debt trap."    Total State debt is more than R200-billion, about 55 percent  of gross domestic product [GDP]. This compares with  R155-billion, or 46.5 percent of GDP, in March last year.    It is still shy of the internationally accepted ceiling of  60  percent of GDP.    In a valedictory vote of thanks to public servants,  government stock of R7.3-billion was issued to offset the  R29-billion actuarial shortfall in State pension funds.    The outgoing Government borrowed R30.5-billion in the past  year to balance the Budget, bringing to R45-billion the amount  of interest-bearing stock issued for the year. The interest is  R4- billion.    Dr Calitz says: "The homeland debts were being serviced all  along through transfers from SA and the homelands' own  resources. Consolidating the homeland debt does not add to  overall expenditure, it merely shifts its location."    Notions that SA is "underborrowed", as suggested by some in  the ANC, are rejected by economists.    Mr Brown says: "The reconstruction and development programme  will have to be partially funded through the capital markets and  this will strain the capacity of the market to absorb new debt  issues.    "The Government will have to offer higher interest rates on  new stock, adding to the interest burden."    Mr Osborn questions official figures showing the deficit for  the year to March to be on target at 6.8 percent of GDP. "I  suspect that they have fudged the final deficit figure. There  is R2-billion of additional expenditure for the provinces which  does not appear to have been accounted for."    Mr Osborn predicts the interest bill could be as high as  R26-  billion in the coming year. Finance officials dispute Mr  Osborn's predictions.    Finance Minister Derek Keys says extra-budgetary commitments  add R2-billion to the deficit.</p>

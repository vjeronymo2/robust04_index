			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  the chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander  of the Armed Forces, has visited the 48 Revolution Camp. He was  received by the brother commander of the camp, officers, and  troops. They welcomed the brother leader president and  expressed their happiness over the visit, which embodies the  leader's eagerness to observe the situation of the sons of the  valiant Armed Forces and take care of them. They also expressed  their high readiness to perform the national duty of defending  unity and protecting constitutional legitimacy, as well as  protecting the homeland's achievements and gains.    During his visit, the brother leader president got  acquainted  with the qualification and training operations in the camp. He  spoke to the troops, paying tribute to the high morale of the  personnel of our valiant Armed Forces, which have embodied -- by  championing the people's will of unity and protecting  constitutional legitimacy -- the true belonging to the homeland  and the deep faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and the  unity.    He added: Our Armed Forces have proven throughout all stages  that they are the invulnerable shield of the homeland, the  property of the people, and a tool to protect their  achievements, security, and stability. The heroes in our Armed  Forces have championed the Yemeni revolutions of 26 September  and 14 October. Today, they are valiantly championing unity and  are protecting it from all the challenges imposed by the gang of  rebellion and secession that drove the homeland to war to  implement its criminal secessionist scheme for a handful of  filthy money and for the sake of its narrow selfish interests.    The brother leader president noted that the Yemeni homeland  is passing through an important, decisive turning point to  formulate a new era in light of the fortification of its unity  and embodying the national aspirations to build a new Yemen on  the basis of justice, democracy, comprehensive developments,  respect for human rights, and a state of law and order and  modern institutions.    The brother leader and supreme commander also asserted that  the sons of our people and their Armed Forces have never  refrained from making precious sacrifices to protect and  safeguard unity. Unity is a great objective for which the free  men of the sons of our people have struggled until it was  achieved in a historic, bright action. Today, they will not show  reluctance to pursue struggle and make sacrifices in order to  face the criminal, secessionist gang that is trying to harm  unity and set the clock back to the situation that prevailed  prior to 22 May 1990. He noted that the epochs of separation  have gone and will never return and that Yemen's strength and  prosperity lie in unity, noting that without unity, there is no  future for Yemen, because it is the source of pride, stability,  and progress.    The brother president praised our Yemeni people's  broad-based support for their brothers and sons in the Armed  Forces in the battle to protect unity and democracy and defend  constitutional legitimacy. He said this excellent national  cohesion between our people and Armed Forces, the forces of  unity and legitimacy, in various parts of the Yemeni homeland  embodies the sincerity of national affiliation and feelings of  national responsibility. He appealed for further national  cohesion among the masses, particularly among the political  forces and prominent figures on the national arena, to confront  the secessionist scheme, which was hatched by the secessionist  gang led by traitor and agent al-Bid and his clique, who sold  themselves cheaply and wanted to push the homeland into the  furnace of destruction in order to achieve their selfish goals.    The brother president noted the cease-fire violation by the  gang of apostasy and secession. He said the Armed Forces have  announced that they will abide by the resolution as of 2400  yesterday in implementation of the UN Security Council  resolution. That gang, he said, continued its aggressions and  provocations against our Armed Forces and launched air raids  against the positions of our Armed Forces on all axes at the  time when our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy,  were abiding in full by the cease-fire resolution. He explained  that the rebellious secessionist gang does not respect any  agreements or conventions; violates all agreements and treaties  with its criminal conduct and conspiratorial mentality; and does  not fear God or care about the homeland.    The leader president urged the brother officers, NCO's, and  soldiers to display further discipline and to deal well with the  citizens and to offer them all cooperation and care, and to  treat well their brothers who were deceived by the secessionist  gang when they join or surrender to the forces of unity and  legitimacy. He said: Those are your brothers and comrades in  arms. He noted the wrong indoctrination and deceptive  propaganda the secessionist gang is trying to promote among the  deceived ones against their brothers and comrades in arms in the  Armed Forces and against all citizens in general.    He called again on the remaining deceived brothers to  quickly  join the ranks of unity and legitimacy and to take advantage of  the general amnesty law. He said they will be received and  treated very well and will get all of their rights just like  their colleagues in the Yemeni Armed Forces.</p>

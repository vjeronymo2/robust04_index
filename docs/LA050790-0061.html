			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Phoenix, which lacks a mountain in the middle and a Mr. Olympia on the wing,  should be easier for the Lakers to handle than Utah would have been. . . .  </P> <P> Of course, this bit of wisdom comes to you from the same authority who thought  the Kings were fortunate when they got to play Edmonton instead of Winnipeg in  the second round of the hockey playoffs. . . .  </P> <P> The difference in the Salt Palace Sunday was the free-throw shooting of Sun  forward Tom Chambers, who gets insulted if the ball hits the rim before  dropping through the net. . . .  </P> <P> Remember when Utah was being touted as the next power in the NBA after  extending the Lakers to seven games in the second round in 1988? Since then,  the Jazz hasn't gotten out of the first round. . . .  </P> <P> Boston showed its age in the fourth quarter Sunday when the big four -- Larry  Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson -- couldn't stay with New  York. . . .  </P> <P> Can you imagine Bird missing a dunk shot at crunch time? . . .  </P> <P> The Knicks have the talent to give Detroit a battle in the next round, but the  question is whether they will continue to play with poise and spirit after what  should have been a tremendous confidence booster. . . .  </P> <P> Barry Irwin of Clover Racing Stables tried to buy Unbridled after he won a  stakes race in Florida last December. "There's absolutely no way," he was told  by a bloodstock agent. "The lady (Frances Genter) who owns him is 92 years old  and has a zillion dollars.  </P> <P> What's she going to do with the money if she sells the horse?" . . .  </P> <P> ABC did a marvelous job on the replay of the Kentucky Derby, showing trainer  Carl Nafzger screaming into the ear of Genter during the stretch run. . . .  </P> <P> Otherwise, this was a pretty dull Derby. No suspense, no controversy, no  second-guessing. . . .  </P> <P> Mister Frisky's disappointing performance was similar to that of another  favorite coming off a Santa Anita Derby victory, Snow Chief in 1986. Snow Chief  stopped at the top of the stretch, but came back two weeks later to win the  Preakness. . . .  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham was without an entry in Louisville, but he still  had an impressive winner Saturday. The Prime Minister, a 3-year-old running on  the turf for the first time in only the second race of his career, won the  ninth at Hollywood Park in a swift 1:40 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. And he did it  the most difficult way possible on the Hollywood turf course, wire-to-wire. . .  .  </P> <P> A healthy Riki Ellison would help the Raiders, who need improvement at inside  linebacker. . . .  </P> <P> I look at the senior golf results before those of the regular tour unless it's  a major or the L.A. Open. . . .  </P> <P> This could be the week that Artesia High basketball star Ed O'Bannon signs his  letter-of-intent. Nevada Las Vegas and USC reportedly are the most likely  choices. . . .  </P> <P> It's nearly certain that the 1992 U.S. Olympic team will be coached by an NBA  man. The only college coach with a shot is Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. . . .  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky, who has won the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player in the  NHL nine times, isn't among the three finalists this year. . . .  </P> <P> Tom Brunansky has just joined Boston, but already there is speculation that the  Red Sox will trade the power-hitting outfielder to California if they can't  sign him within a few weeks. Brunansky, who began his major league career with  the Angels, is in the option year of his contract. . . .  </P> <P> Cecil Fielder should change his name to Hitter. . . .  </P> <P> The Oakland Athletics, who used to win world championships without drawing a  million fans, attracted 139,752 for the weekend series against Boston and are  aiming for three million this season. . . .  </P> <P> What could be even more harmful to the Dodgers than the loss of Orel Hershiser  is their lack of a reliable bullpen. . . .  </P> <P> Is it just me or are the umpires giving Fernando Valenzuela that screwball on  the outside corner, where they weren't before? . . .  </P> <P> Pittsburgh may be another right-handed hitter away from being a pennant  contender. . . . Break up the Royals! . . .  </P> <P> From commentator Tim McCarver on WWOR's telecast of the Met-Houston  doubleheader: "You get ahead with strikes, you get 'em out with balls." . . .  </P> <P> Houston catcher Craig Biggio also plays some center field, bringing to mind  that Dale Murphy began his career behind the plate. . . .  </P> <P> I refuse to believe that Carlton Fisk has played more games for the Chicago  White Sox than the Boston Red Sox.  </P></p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / European Government Bonds: Spanish poll may renew ERM tensions TWO events have helped to ease tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism recently - the gradual lowering of German interest rates, and the centre-right election victory in France. However, yesterday's news of an early general election in Spain could lead to another bout of speculation against the peseta and renewed tension within the ERM. The European government bond markets expect the Bundesbank to continue easing, albeit in rather small steps in the near term, and as German interest rates fall this should pave the way for other European central banks. Although there was some disappointment that the Bundesbank cut only its discount rate - to 7.5 per cent - on March 18, and not its Lombard rate as well, the bund market has since witnessed a very gradual easing in short-term interest rates. The rate at the Bundesbank's repo tender was lowered from 8.25 per cent to 8.17 per cent at the beginning of April, and by a further 4 basis points to 8.13 per cent last week. While the bund market would much prefer to see bigger and bolder cuts in interest rates, statements from the Bundesbank suggest that the market may have to remain content with a 'slowly, slowly' approach for the time being at least. The other piece of good news for the European bonds markets was the French election result. The landslide victory for the centre-right parties in the elections and the subsequent appointment of Mr Edouard Balladur as prime minister has provided considerable support for the franc. Already, short-term interest rates have started to decline, and further falls are expected possibly as early as this week. While the background for the European bond markets looks good, economists point out that there are a couple of hurdles which must be overcome in the short term. One danger is the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty which takes place on May 18 and which, given the Danish rejection last June, will provide an important focus for the European markets in the next few weeks. 'Although the opinion polls are currently suggesting that a comfortable majority will vote in favour of monetary union, there is likely to be a degree of nervousness ahead of the vote given the surprise outcome of last June's referendum,' says Mr Nigel Rendell, bond analyst at James Capel. The other 'trouble-spot' as far as the bond markets are concerned is Spain. Last week, the Spanish bond market focused on threats by Prime Minister Gonzalez to resign as leader of the Socialist Party over an alleged funding scandal. Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global Markets Research, pointed out last week that in the event of an election being called in June, 'the peseta would probably not be able to survive in the interim without devaluing. The whole ERM could come under new strains with the Portuguese escudo sure to follow the peseta down.' However, taking the most optimistic scenario - in which Denmark votes in favour of monetary union, and the peseta remains within the ERM - bond analysts expect the main talking point in the European markets to be interest rate convergence. Mr Rendell points out that 'the depth and duration of the current recession is likely to lead to further declines in inflation and substantial cuts in short-term interest rates. This should more than offset the potential negative impact of extra bond issuance as a result of deteriorating budget deficits throughout Europe'. Yields on French government bonds have already narrowed considerably compared with those on German bonds. The 10-year yield spread has fallen from above 100 basis points to 60 basis points recently, and could fall to as low as 30 basis points by next spring.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDGE TO REDUCE BEROSINI'S AWARD  </P> <P> A District Court judge plans to cut $1.1 million from the $4.2 million awarded  entertainer Bobby Berosini in his lawsuit against a group of animal rights  activists.  </P> <P> A jury returned a verdict Saturday awarding Berosini damages for defamation and  invasion of privacy. The damages were assessed against two groups and three  individuals accused of releasing videotapes showing Berosini striking  orangutans used in his act at the Stardust Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.  </P> <P> Judge Myron Leavitt said today that though the jury could return damages on  counts of defamation and holding a person in a "false light," Berosini can  collect on only one of those counts under Nevada law.  </P></p>

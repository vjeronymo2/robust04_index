			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BISHOPS URGE PRIEST'S RETURN TO CHURCH  </P> <P> The nation's 13 black Roman Catholic bishops urged a Washington priest who  established an independent African-American Catholic congregation to abandon  his efforts and return to the church. The bishops said they hoped that Father  George A. Stallings Jr. and his followers "are not commingling personal  disappointment, individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the  banner of racism." Racism, they said, "is too serious an issue to be used as a  cover for selfish concerns." But the controversial priest told the Washington  Post the bishops had "opted for office and position over their ability to  exercise a prophetic voice." Earlier this month, Stallings established the  Imani Temple, saying the Catholic Church had failed to embrace the culture,  history and spirit of its black members. Church officials have suspended  Stallings from preaching, celebrating Mass or administering any of the church's  sacraments, including baptism and Holy Communion.  </P></p>

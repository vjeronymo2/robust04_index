			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Laws that Provide Preference.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The section 3 preference in hiring for low- and very low-income persons, and in contracting for businesses owned by these persons was not created by the 1992 Act. Section 3, when originally enacted in 1968, provided for this preference. The 1992 Act amends section 3 to require that in providing preference to low and very low-income persons, recipients, contractors, and subcontractors must first target for job opportunities smaller groups within the broad category of low-income persons, such as public housing residents. Since its enactment in 1968, the Department is not aware, or has not been made aware of any existing Federal, State, or local law or regulation that is expressly in conflict with the section 3 preference requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule of statutory construction is to interpret statutes to give meaning to all and to avoid conflicts. For example, section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act provides a preference for training and employment opportunities and contracting for Native Americans. Where both the preference for Native Americans and the section 3 preference for local residents cannot be met, the preference for Native Americans takes priority. However, it is possible that the two preferences can work together so that the intent of both statutes is met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consideration given to utilization of women's business enterprises (WBEs) and minority business enterprises (MBEs) in HUD programs is also not necessarily at odds with the section 3 preference, as believed by some commenters. The preference required by section 3 is neither gender specific nor race, nor ethnic origin specific. The preference required by section 3 is one of income (to be eligible for the preference, the person's income may not exceed a certain level) and one of location (the preference is for low-income and very low-income persons residing in proximity to the project or activity where the HUD financial assistance is being expended). This is a very broad preference category, and can encompass preferences promoted by other statutes and regulations, such as preferences for WBEs, MBEs, and other socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (i.e., business for which are 51 percent or more owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals). The Department anticipates that section 3 and similar preference laws will serve to support, rather than obstruct, the preferences specified by each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preemption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the issue of preemption, generally, Federal law may preempt the enforcement of a State or local law if: (1) The Federal statute expressly preempts State or local law; (2) the Federal statute does not contain an express preemption provision, but it is clear that the Congress intended to preempt by occupying an entire field of regulation, and has thereby left no room for the State to supplement Federal law; or (3) compliance with both Federal and State law is impossible, or State law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the Congress. Under the third test, Federal preemption must reflect a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency's care by statute. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 699 (1984) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first two tests do not apply because section 3 contains no express preemption provision, and there is no clear indication of Congressional intent to preempt. In fact, the statute specifically provides that a recipient's efforts to employ section 3 residents and award contracts to section 3 business concerns shall be ``consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.'' Therefore, any claim of Federal preemption would have to be based on the third test, and the Department would have to determine that compliance with both section 3 and State or local law is impossible, or that State or local law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inclusion of the phrase ``consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations'' indicates that the Congress did not envision that State or local law would make compliance with Section 3 impossible or that State or local law would be an obstacle to compliance with section 3. Again, as discussed earlier in this preamble, the preference provided by section 3 is sufficiently broad that there should be little conflict with State or local laws. However, the section 3 preference requirements would prevail over a permissive (not mandatory) State or local law provision that has the potential to conflict with section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determining if There Is a Conflict in Laws.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issue of conflict between part 135 and an existing Federal, State, or local law would only arise if a recipient or contractor failed to comply with the requirements of part 135, and asserted the position that the failure was based upon conflicting Federal, State, or local law. The Department would consider the recipient's assertion of conflicting laws (e.g., a local legal opinion) when the Department determined that the recipient or contractor failed to meet the requirements of part 135 and that there was a reasonable basis for the Department to take sanctions based on that failure. (The Department notes that some program statutes or regulations (e.g., the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnership programs) may require notice and opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge before sanctions are imposed. Accordingly, the Department would have to convince the administrative law judge of the Department's determination regarding failure to comply with section 3, including the Department's determination regarding the conflict of other law with part 135.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> New Section on Compliance With Other Applicable Laws <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the subject of the relationship of section 3 to other related laws, the interim rule contains a new section (&sect;135.11) that references other laws that are applicable to job training, employment, and contracting. These laws include program statutes that require payment of prevailing wages determined under the Davis-Bacon Act or (in the case of public and Indian housing) determined by HUD to be prevailing. These laws also include reference to Executive Order 11246 (which requires affirmative action to ensure that employees or applicants are treated without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin), and regulations governing approved apprenticeship programs. This section also references the procurement procedures of 24 CFR 85.36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

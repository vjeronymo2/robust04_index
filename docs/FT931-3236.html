			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME stocks top 3m-tonne mark METALS MARKETS received a psychological battering yesterday when another huge rise in London Metal Exchange stocks took the total above 3m tonnes for the first time. Even though most aluminium, lead, nickel, tin and zinc producers were unprofitable at present, metal prices were unlikely to recover substantially with so much highly-visible stock weighing down the market, analysts suggested. LME stock levels were 'indicative of the situation in the physical markets. Economic recovery in the US is being offset by weakness in Germany and Japan,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. He recalled that Japan was the second most important consumer of all base metals except for nickel, of which it was the biggest consumer. Germany was the third-largest consumer of all six base metals traded on the LME. However, Mr Nick Moore, metals analyst at Ord Minnett, the Westpac subsidiary, pointed out that there were now about 325 LME-authorised warehouses world-wide compared with only 16, all in Europe, in 1982. This had encouraged producers and consumers to move their stock on to the LME so not all of the metal was readily available. Nevertheless, Billiton's Mr MacMillan said that total western world stocks - not just those in LME warehouses - of aluminium and nickel were at 'horrendous' levels and those of tin and zinc were heading fast in that direction. Copper and lead stocks were now 'uncomfortably high'. Mr MacMillan said: 'We need a return to synchronised growth in the major industrialised economies before there is any sustained recovery in metals demand - and there is not much chance of that before the year end.'  ----------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Monday's close)  ---------------------------------- tonnes  ---------------------------------- Aluminium  +1,950 to 1,701,650 Copper     +6,700 to   346,100 Lead       -2,150 to   235,150 Nickel       +222 to    85,752 Zinc       +7,825 to   587,400 Tin          +180 to    19,170  ----------------------------------</p>

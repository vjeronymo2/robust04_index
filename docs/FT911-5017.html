			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soaring gas sales show flaws in Norway's strategy - The lack of a co-ordinated exports drive is creating avoidable difficulties NORWAY'S lack of a national gas export strategy in the face of spiralling demand is creating unnecessary difficulties. The country is one of Europe's main suppliers of gas and has North Sea reserves of two trillion cubic metres. The existing organisation for exporting gas is Gassforhandlingsutvalg - the Gas Negotiating Committee. This is under threat and the industry fears that negotiations could become a fragmented free for all among companies which own gas fields. European gas demand is set to increase mainly because of increasing Soviet difficulties meeting supply, and virtually no chance of increasing it, and because of the 'green' trend in Europe where gas is considered a more environmentally friendly replacement for oil and coal in power generation. Under the giant Troll/Sleipner gas sales agreement signed in 1986 with a consortium of European buyers 30.51bn cubic metres of gas is committed under contract. However, the Sleipner East and Troll fields together have reserves of just 26.5bn cubic metres. To fill the 4.01bn cubic metre shortfall, the licences in the Troll field, operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, have agreed to sell an additional 3.7bcm from two other fields - Veslefrikk and Brage - on behalf of those field's respective owners. For this service, the Troll field owners will charge the owners of Veslefrikk and Brage a handling fee of five oere - there are 100 oere in each Norwegian krone - per cubic metre of gas. This agreement forms the basis of what is known in industry circles as the 'Troll Commercial Model' which may mark the end of the gas negotiating committee. The committee comprised Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum and was established five years ago to sell gas for Norway. This is a sensitive issue for it has always been held that the three Norwegian companies were best placed to protect sovereign interest in the country's international gas trade. Also, the buyers of Troll gas have additional purchase options contained within the sales agreement which could boost their total supply requirement to 40.82bcm. However, before the European gas buyers will exercise these purchase options, Norway must provide a guarantee that it can meet this demand. In order to provide this guarantee the owners of the Troll field have identified four sources of Norwegian gas which they could sell on behalf of these fields' owners as part of the Troll deal. This would allow the Troll field to underwrite future gas sales - a requirement of the buyers. However, the owners of these fields would also be obliged to pay Troll owners a five oere per cubic metre handling fee. The four fields being considered by Troll's owners include the Midgard gas/condensate field, operated by Saga Petroleum and located in the Norwegian Sea. The Sleipner West field is also under considation. However, two other fields being considered - Oseberg and Troll phase two - are both operated by Norsk Hydro, which may not want to offer this gas to Troll field owners to sell under the Troll agreement. Instead, Norsk Hydro may want to negotiate its own sales with the hope of securing contracts in Britain. Norwegian energy authorities, pondering over a national gas export strategy, have also yet to decide whether all gas field owners should be allowed to negotiate sales contracts on their own behalf, or whether this should be done under the Troll Commercial Model. The difficulty of gas transport capacity has been solved by the recent decision to build a third export line from Norway to Europe. That would lift export capacity to about 30bcm, although it could be doubled by adding compressors. Owners in Britain's North Sea J-block field, however, have asked Norway to assist them in transporting gas to Germany by allowing them to tie a spur line into Norway's Norpipe line which runs to Emden in Germany. Britain seems prepared to allow new Norwegian imports into the UK if Norway complies. However, if Norway allows J-block gas to be transported through Norpipe it would interfere with the country's flexibility to negotiate new gas sales contracts with new buyers such as East European countries which have expressed interest in Norwegian gas. Italy, which does not currently buy Norwegian gas, says it wants to purchase 5bcm annually from 1996. In order to maximise transport capacity in pipelines, Norway is considering exporting gas from Snoehvit, a field off northern Norway, to Italy in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Later this year an engineering study will start in the 2.5 trillion cubic metre Shtokmanovskoye gas field in the Barents Sea 600km north east of Murmansk and last for about one year. A decision on whether to develop Shtokmanovskoye is to be taken next year. The field, in 300 metres of water, is said to be one of the world's biggest offshore gas fields.  ------------------------------------------------------------------          TROLL PLATEAU VOLUMES SOLD IN BILLION CUBIC METRES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Customers             Under     30 per cent   50 per cent                      Contract     option         option  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Germany              13.37         14.66          19.96 France                8.00          8.00           8.00 Netherlands           3.97          4.57           5.57 Belgium               2.00          2.60           3.60 Spain                 2.11          2.11           2.11 Austria               1.06          1.06           1.58 Total                30.51         33.00          40.82  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

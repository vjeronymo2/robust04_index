			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Mulroney wins the race to be last - Munich Notebook UNLIKELY as it may sound at such an international circus, world summits are still about personal contact, personal chemistry, about leaders getting to know each other. So body language means something, and the great and good are still not above a little blatant physical point-scoring. Take Monday night's reception at the Schloss Nymphenburg given by Mr Helmut Kohl. It all began with the leaders arriving one by one at the great stone staircase, solemnly ascending and joining the chancellor on the balcony to wave at what appeared to be a small crowd of loyal retainers, and a band. As is his wont, President Francois Mitterrand went to inordinate lengths to arrive last. He turned up a good five minutes after all his colleagues - or so he must have thought. But it was not so. He was beaten for the slot by the scheming Mr Brian Mulroney of Canada, who must have twiddled his thumbs for ages in his hotel suite to win the race to keep the others waiting. Perhaps it was a message for Quebec? Once on the balcony, witness phase two. As if by magic, all the great leaders somehow managed to squeeze to the front, to wave for the television cameras. All that is, except a man who has shone in Munich for his unusual modesty and shyness - Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He was left peeping over Mr Mitterrand's shoulder. Perhaps it was deliberate, for Mr Delors has also been pretty retiring in the debate inside the summit. In the first main round on the world economy, he said nothing at all, preferring to let the debate develop. Since then he has kept well out of the firing line. The same cannot be said for the one man who managed to wheedle his way into that front line on the balcony when he should not have been there: Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister and vice-chancellor, and the least important member of Mr Kohl's team. Just as Mr Delors was spotted on television trying to peer past Mr Mitterrand, Mr Mollemann could be seen pushing into the picture, just under Mr Kohl's left shoulder. Those who know the man are not surprised. Summits are also about meaningful entertainment. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, knows all about it. He began his day yesterday with a massive Bavarian breakfast for the press - supposedly an intimate occasion with about 200 mostly German journalists. Pride of place on the menu went to the bulging Bavarian white sausage, a confection of veal and herbs, served with sauerkraut, sweet mustard, and even beer, for those feeling strong enough. Not content with such a sterling start to the day, Mr Waigel turned right round and entertained his fellow finance ministers to an identical meal at 9am. Indeed, his British counterpart, Mr Norman Lamont, found the fare so good that he allegedly went back for second helpings of white sausage. There's no accounting for taste.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yi Sung-chol: "Is the Exchange of </F> Special Envoys Possible Before 21 March?"]    [Text] In spite of the pessimistic view on the exchange of  North-South special envoys before 21 March, high-ranking ROK and  U.S. officials believe that "it is not yet a desperate state,"  thus attracting the people's attention.    In a news conference held just before his departure from the  ROK on the afternoon of 13 March, Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs,  said that the situation is "hopeful," unlike the general  observation that the issue "has gone up the river," although he  did not elaborate on this.    Such remarks by Assistant Secretary Gallucci may be  construed  as an expression of mere formality intended to not influence  negatively the ongoing North-South working-level contacts for  the exchange of special envoys. However, people believe that  since he has experience in sitting face to face with the North  Korean side during the first and second rounds of talks as  senior delegate of the U.S. side, his remarks should not be  taken lightly.    After holding the working contact on 12 March, Song  Yong-tae,  vice minister of the National Unification Board and our side's  delegate to the North-South working-level contact, also revealed  that although he is not definitely sure, the exchange of special  envoys before 21 March is not technically impossible, thus  making a similar suggestion to the one made by Assistant  Secretary Gallucci.    Then, what is the reason they have not abandoned hope  despite  the prevailing general pessimism?    The day in which the exchange of special envoys could be  possibly held, without breaking the "25 February North  Korea-U.S. agreement," would be the first day of the week  immediately following the 16 March North-South contact, or 21  March, which is designated as the date for the North Korea-U.S.  high-level talks. It is the unanimous view of government  authorities that the exchange of special envoys during the  weekend is practically impossible in view of past instances.  Therefore, the date to which both the ROK and the United States  pay attention is 21 March. The two countries believe it is very  likely that North Korea will propose this date.    It has been learned that the two sides discussed this issue  in depth during Assistant Secretary Gallucci's visit to the ROK.    North Korea will possibly propose 21 March as the date for  exchanging special envoys because, by doing so, it can avoid  international criticism for breaking the "25 February North  Korea-U.S. agreement," which requires the exchange of special  envoys before the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, and because  it can propagandize that it is simultaneously pushing for North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks and North-South dialogue according  to its own intention.    Besides, the "21 March special envoy exchange" corresponds  to  North Korean foreign negotiation tactics in the "settlement of  all problems at the same time at the last moment."    There is an eight-hour time difference between Seoul and  Geneva, where the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks are to be  held. Therefore, the exchange of special envoys on 21 March  would not necessarily mean that "the 25 February North  Korea-U.S. agreement" was broken.    The ROK and the United States have not finished finalizing  their positions toward this speculation but are intensively  discussing whether or not they would accept such a North Korean  proposal.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu temporarily showed a negative  position toward "the possibility of the special envoy exchange  on 21 March." However, an official close to him revealed that  Minister Han is keenly attentive to this possibility.    Because of President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit to Japan  and China slated for 24 to 30 March, the government has not  finalized its strategy to cope with a possible North Korean  proposal for an envoy exchange on 21 March.    A relevant government official said: The 21 March special  envoy exchange would be the best card for North Korea. Although  there were many negative views on the proposal on our side at  first, positive opinion is now growing gradually from the  standpoint that it is not necessary for us to drive North Korea  into a corner by any means.</p>

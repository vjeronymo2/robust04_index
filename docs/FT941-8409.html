			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Sensible way to a balanced portfolio  -Bonds Professional investors value bonds for their redemption yield (total return) rather than price. Normally, a rise in the yield of a bond with a short life (say, three years) will equate to a much smaller fall in price than would the same yield movement in a 25-year bond. The longest bonds of all are irredeemables, known also as perpetuals. For these, which pay a fixed rate of interest without limit, a general change in yield levels can exaggerate greatly the price movements of shorter bonds. This is known as volatility. Permanent interest-bearing shares, which are irredeemable fixed-income securities issued by building societies, have recorded sharp falls recently, partly because of their volatility. But the extent of the falls has had an interesting side-effect. The ease with which Pibs may be bought, and held, has resulted in a high proportion of them being held by private investors. But the market is dominated by institutional investors because of the greater liquidity (dealing in large size) in the perpetual Eurosterling market. Over recent weeks there have been some selling orders in Pibs, forcing prices down to levels not seen for several months. But few professionals have sold their perpetuals. Why not? The main reason is the problem of re-investment. Often, bonds are the core holdings of a larger portfolio for generating a consistent flow of income. If high-yielding bonds are sold, the income from the portfolio will fall. Of course, if you are sure that bond prices are going to fall and equities will rise, a switch into shorter-dated bonds or equities would be well advised for the shorter term. But no one ever can be certain where markets will go next. At times like this, investors must ask themselves: why do I invest? If the main reason is income, then compare the return from bonds with that available elsewhere. Annuity rates are low, while UK deposit rates continue to fall. For a low-risk portfolio with a more moderate income, you should consider short-dated bonds. If you require a balanced portfolio with income, hold a proportion of the money in bonds and build capital via equities or equity-based investments. This means that while the value of your portfolio fluctuates, the bonds will continue to pay a fixed income (however, the benefit of a fixed income is not normally possible from bond funds). For the more cautious seeker of a balanced portfolio, a mixture of bonds and zero dividend preference shares could well provide the ideal combination. But if your only desire is for capital gains, then perhaps now is not the time for any sort of bond. Michael Dyson is a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets. This is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients directly. Readers interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             FIXED INTEREST SECURITIES FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Coupon                          Red'n Issuer                         %         Price               date  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priority for income  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia bs Pibs               13        135                 n/a Brixton Estates              11.75      136.5           31/3/2018 General Accident             8.875     124.25                 n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balanced income &amp; capital  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- De Beers (Reg'd)              8.25       98.5           31/3/2009 Dudley Borough Council        7.00         35 (part      1/2/2019                                               paid)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Zero dividend pref shares  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ivory &amp; Sime                     0        208             26/3/97 M&amp;G Income                       0      56.25           5/11/2001   .TX.-  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Red'n      GRY      Inc Yld    Interest                               price      sa                  dates  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priority for income  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia bs Pibs              n/a       n/a        9.63        31/1                                                                 31/7 Brixton Estates                100      8.24        8.61        31/3                                                                 30/9 General Accident               n/a       n/a        9.03     1/1;1/7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balanced income &amp; capital  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- De Beers (Reg'd)               100      8.43        8.38        30/3                                                                 30/9 Dudley Borough Council         100      7.45        7.37     1/2;1/8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Zero dividend pref shares  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ivory &amp; Sime                259.66      7.40         n/a         n/a M&amp;G Income                  102.46      7.86         n/a         n/a   .TX.-  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             NRY     Net Inc.                                              25%       25%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Priority for income  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia bs Pibs                            n/a      7.22 Brixton Estates                             5.95      6.46 General Accident                             n/a      7.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balanced income &amp; capital  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- De Beers (Reg'd)                            6.35      6.28 Dudley Borough Council                      5.63      5.53  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Zero dividend pref shares  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ivory &amp; Sime                                6.57*      n/a M&amp;G Income                                  6.98*      n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Assumes inflation at 4 per cent; Call on Dudley due 1/8/94 @ 60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / A-levels 'past sell-by date' says headmasters' leader THE A-LEVEL examination is 'past its sell-by date', the chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents the UK's leading independent boys' schools, said yesterday. Mr Robin Wilson, headmaster of Trinity School, Croydon, told the conference's annual meeting in Oxford that the surge in post-16 education, the expansion of national education targets and the pressures on higher education 'all suggest that we are in the dying years of our present system'. His comments add to several recent calls to reform A-levels so that sixth-formers can study a broader range of subjects. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, is preparing a report into 'the merits of a modified approach to the curriculum from 14 to 16, which retains a mandatory core but which provides a smoother transition to study post-16 education, through a wide range of options'. Mr Wilson gave strong support to those calling for the age of 14 to replace 16 as an educational watershed. He said: 'The national curriculum has been designed for a system which is programmed until the age of 16. Evidence is growing that such a timescale is out of date and unhelpful.' He said that the framework of discussion was now the 14-19 age group, and that A-levels demanded a commitment to a limited number 'and too often a limited range' of subjects at an early age. Mr Wilson described the divide between vocational and academic education as 'artificial', and said that it made pupils choose decisively at an undeveloped age. A-levels were also attacked yesterday by Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, who described them as 'too restrictive, too narrow, and against the interests of the pupils who take them'. She said that neither higher education nor employers supported the A-level system. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday appointed the members of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority who will work under Sir Ron and will have control of the national curriculum and its tests. Half are teachers. They include Mr Graham Mackenzie, group chief executive of UES Holdings, Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of J Sainsbury, and Mrs Shahwar Sadeque, director of computer software company Art of Intelligence and a governor of the BBC.</p>

The statement  indicates that in his decree "On Conducting a Poll Among the  Citizens of the Crimea Republic on 27 March," President Yuriy  Meshkov was guided by the electors' will and also took into  account the refusal of the Supreme Council of Crimea to lift a  moratorium on holding an all-Crimean referendum.    In setting the date of the poll, the president was guided by  the fact that with the assistance of the Central Electoral  Commission, significant organizational and material losses could  be avoided in the course of conducting the poll and electing  deputies to the Supreme Council of Crimea. The document  underlines that the president will continue taking into account  the Crimea citizens' will while solving the most important state  issues.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / The ups and downs of interest rates They do it not by halves but quarters these days, it seems. The Bank of England yesterday dropped into a rare quarter-point mode when it prompted a fall in bank base rates to 5 1/4 per cent, countering the US Federal Reserve's upward nudge of the federal funds rate to 3 1/4 per cent. There is a strong whiff of compromise about the Bank's failure to go straight to 5 per cent. The London markets responded positively to begin with, but in fact the change could be viewed negatively - as implying that the low point for short-term interest rates this cycle may be quite close. Meanwhile, eat your hearts out, efficient market hypothesisers. It was widely anticipated that the US Federal Reserve was about to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter or half-point. Yet when the news came, the world's securities markets suffered a minor panic. So much for the markets' ability to discount expected changes smoothly. True, it is possible to argue that all we have seen in the past two or three days is over-active marketmakers chasing shadows. Real money does not appear to have been on the move and indeed the London stock market had almost fully recovered at one stage yesterday before tailing off again. It is slightly worrying, though, that the US Treasury long bond yield should have drifted higher, because this above all is where a tightening might have been viewed positively. What could justify the jitters? In equities one widely expressed concern is that there is an unusually large quantity of amateur money riding the bull market. Some Dollars 280bn of net new money cascaded into US stock and bond mutual funds last year, and spilled over into emerging markets, while household bank deposits fell. Yet as a paper from the doggedly bullish Goldman Sachs argued last week, private investors are actually rather slow to react to interest rate changes, the usual time lag being at least a year. One might add that a mere quarter-point change would surely scarcely register in the punters' consciousness. The real issue here, though, is that a lot of sophisticated investors may be trying to run ahead of the anticipated panic of the herd. So there may be several minor attempted sell-offs before the retail investors finally get the message. A possibly more important theme is that there may be an unusually large amount of speculation propping up the securities markets, and more specifically a dependence upon money borrowed at low interest rates. This has been a particular feature of the US bond market, where the banks have been encouraged by the Fed to generate solvency-restoring profits along an exceptionally steep yield curve. In the UK too, last week's banking figures showed a sharp jump in lending to the financial sector during the final quarter of 1993. Even the doziest players in the US Treasury market have now been given formal notice that they must unwind their positions (though most have been already shifting their strategy for several months now). The quarter-point hike is only a starter, and although the spreads along the yield curve have changed little, they could be dwarfed by potential capital losses. To take the extreme case, the price of the benchmark long bond has dropped by 8 full points since it peaked in October, rather nasty if you are leveraged (though the banks are focused less ambitiously around the five-year dates). The burden of financing the US fiscal deficit will therefore shift from the banking system to other domestic and international investors. This explains the upward drift in bond interest rates. There are also the unknown hazards of derivatives. The extraordinary profits earned by some of the players last year gave prima facie indications of large discontinuities in the markets. A change of trend could be difficult to handle. But now the action is switching to the foreign exchange markets. After a year when many currencies slumbered and the army of dollar bulls grew staler and staler, the markets are now faced with the long-awaited relative rate shift as the US raises and Europe continues down. But we wait to see whether the Bundesbank, having preferred for some weeks to be a wallflower, will join this interest rate tango.</p>

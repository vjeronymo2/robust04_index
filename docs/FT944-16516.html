			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Early summer sales help reduce inflation A shift in the timing of this year's summer sales, supermarket price wars and a fall in the petrol price all helped to lower the annual rate of inflation last month. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the retail price index rose to 145.0 last month, with 100 representing the prices in 1987. This was 0.2 per cent higher than the previous month, and 2.2 per cent higher than the same period last year. One reason for the lower inflation rate was that the cost of household goods, clothing and footwear rose by less in September than they did last year in the aftermath of the summer sales. This was mainly because the price rebound after the sales largely occurred in August this year, instead of in September as last year. This shift in the timing meant that the annual rate of inflation for these sectors looked high in August but slightly lower last month. Clothing and footwear prices, for example, grew 3 per cent in September after rising 2.2 per cent in August. This brought the cost of footwear and clothes back to exactly the same level it was before the summer discounts, and the same level as last year. If the effect of the early price rebound is smoothed out by looking at a two-monthly basis, the figures show that the overall price swing in clothing and footwear was exactly the same as in the previous year. Household goods rose 0.5 per cent in September compared with the previous month after a monthly rise of 1.6 per cent in August. These rises were slightly higher than the 2.1 per cent fall that occurred in the sales in June and July. They suggested that retailers remained wary of raising prices in face of strong consumer resistance, analysts said. Indeed, some suggested that retailers were likely to be particularly cautious about raising prices with the new stock this autumn after a fall in retail sales last month. Elsewhere in the index, food prices fell in September by 0.8 per cent compared with August, with a 0.5 per cent rise in the year to September. The fall partly reflected continued price wars in the supermarkets, with non-seasonal food costs dropping 0.4 per cent. But it was also flattered by a normal drop in seasonal food prices as a result of the harvests in Britain. Motoring costs also fell, running 0.2 per cent below the level in August and 1.8 per cent above the same level last year. The main reason for this was a drop in the price of petrol, which had risen in August partly as a result of the oil strike in Nigeria. The yearly trend was also flattered by the fact that petrol prices rose last September. Housing costs were 0.2 per cent higher in September than August, and 4 per cent higher than a year ago, reflecting a continued rise in the average outstanding mortgage debt.</p>

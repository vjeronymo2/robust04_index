			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Fears grow of Soviet nuclear brain drain AT LEAST half a dozen countries are thought to be eager to employ nuclear specialists from the former Soviet Union to help develop nuclear weapons, David White and Clive Cookson write. According to western nuclear experts and military analysts, the potential head-hunters include Arab countries which had close military links with the Soviet Union: Iraq, Libya, Syria and possibly Algeria, which has recently been at the centre of a controversy over a reactor it is building with Chinese help. On the other side of the Middle East conflict, Israel's active weapons programme could benefit from the emigration of Jewish nuclear scientists from the Soviet Union. India, Pakistan and Iran are seen as other likely destinations. Last week a senior Russian scientist at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow said at least two of his colleagues had recently received offers from Libya to work on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The two turned down the proposals, which offered salaries of Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,100) a month - high by Russian standards but only a quarter the salary of a senior nuclear warhead designer in the US. Some countries would be ready to pay 'astronomical' sums, according to Mr Owen Greene, a specialist in international security at the University of Bradford. Mr Victor Mironov, a 60-year-old Russian expert in plutonium processing, claimed last month that Iraq had offered him Dollars 100,000 in 1990 to join its nuclear programme. He refused, he said in a television interview, but 'a young specialist did go and there are a lot of cases like that.' Western analysts estimate that 3,000 to 5,000 Soviet scientists have direct experience of plutonium production and uranium enrichment, two of the most sensitive proliferation activities. About 2,000 are involved in nuclear weapons design. In total, there are tens of thousands of people in the former Soviet Union who could assist in nuclear proliferation in some way. It would probably be possible to keep track of the few 'big fish' capable of designing a whole nuclear programme, Mr Greene said. But would-be proliferaters would also be keen to get technicians with laboratory experience. Many analysts believe that foreign recruitment of Soviet scientists is a greater proliferation threat than the sale of nuclear materials. 'All the plutonium and highly enriched uranium is in a few secure facilities in Russia,' says Mr William Walker of the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. 'Smuggling out the material is not easy, although there have been a few scare stories about it recently. On the other hand people are very mobile. Movement of people has had a big effect on the history of nuclear proliferation.' Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, warned in London last week: 'I'm not certain that we can successfully stop those kinds of transfer.' The main Soviet nuclear laboratories and production facilities are in Russia. They employ mainly Russians and, to a lesser extent, Ukrainians. Very few scientists from the Moslem southern republics - regarded as the likeliest recruits for Arab nuclear programmes - belonged to the Soviet nuclear elite. However Mr William Potter, director of the Centre for Russian and Soviet Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, has learned from his Soviet contacts that there were also uranium enrichment facilities in Uzbekistan and Kirgizia. Even so there is still little evidence, even anecdotal, of scientists being tempted to leave the former Soviet Union. Mr Wolfgang Panofsky, chairman of the US National Academy of Sciences Committee on International Security and Arms Control, said his Russian contacts had given no indications about scientists being approached. 'To the best of our knowledge, they're staying where they are,' he said. But he added: 'It's a clear problem.' Mr Henry Plater-Zyberk of the Centre for Defence Studies in London said an immediate exodus was unlikely. Most employees engaged in nuclear weapon production lived in purpose-built towns. 'For the time being they are probably being provided with the minimum,' he said. But they would face a combination of economic disarray and a decline in nuclear spending. 'These are people whose future is intensely insecure,' said Mr Greene, who along with some other observers is proposing that the west should pay the scientists and technicians to remove their incentive for going to Third World countries. US proliferation specialists including Mr Potter are urging the Bush administration to 'put Soviet nuclear experts to work cleaning up the enormous environmental damage caused by 40 years of nuclear weapons production.'</p>

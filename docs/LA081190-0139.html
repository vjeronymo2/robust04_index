			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Keating Counterplan: Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of bankrupt American  Continental Corp., filed a reorganization plan Friday in federal court in  Phoenix that is in opposition to an earlier plan filed jointly by the company's  unsecured creditors and federal regulators. American Continental, which filed  for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, is the one-time parent company of  Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the failed thrift that is expected to  cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Among the features of the Keating proposal are a $50-million payment to  creditors that would be made two years after confirmation of the plan. It would  also provide the Resolution Trust Corp. -- the government agency created to  sell off assets of failed thrifts -- an option to pay $21 million to creditors  in exchange for dropping Lincoln as a defendant in certain lawsuits related to  Lincoln's receivership. The plan would also include buying certain American  Continental assets for about $580 million, plus interest, by a new company to  be headed by Keating and other current and former American Continental  managers.  </P></p>

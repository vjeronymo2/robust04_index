			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / BSkyB acts to resolve row over high quality television pictures BRITISH SKY Broadcasting could be transmitting higher quality pictures for reception on wide screen television sets by the end of the year under a proposal before the European Commission. The move could end a potentially serious row over European television standards and represent a big step towards eventual adoption of a system under which high definition television would be provided throughout Europe. This would help free movement of production equipment, television sets and programmes. A current European Community directive requires all satellite broadcasters to use the Mac system which provides better pictures than those from other television transmission systems. BSkyB - formed last year from the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television - avoids the Mac requirement by transmitting from Astra, which is a telecommunications rather than a television satellite. The proposal being discussed with the Commission envisages BSkyB broadcasting simultaneously in its existing Pal system and in a Mac system called D2-Mac, but only if the Commission pays the additional cost - of more than Pounds 5m a channel a year. The D2-Mac system was created as a half-way house to European high definition television, which is expected to be introduced in the mid-1990s. A directive is under discussion which could impose D2-Mac on all satellite broadcasters, a move favoured by some EC governments. If D2-Mac became the satellite standard, Pal could be phased out for satellite use over three-seven years, rendering much European satellite reception equipment obsolete. BSkyB says it is prepared to broadcast first one and then the second of its movie channels in the new wider screen format using D2-Mac. If there was enough demand the sports channel could also be broadcast in the format. Agreement by BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, to broadcast in D2-Mac would provide a big boost to Europe's efforts to create its own advanced television system. The enhanced standard suffered a serious blow when BSB merged with Sky. BSB had used D-Mac, a British variation of D2-Mac, but the merged organisation made clear it would broadcast in Pal. Its decision had represented a setback to the prospects for the Mac system. EC telecommunications ministers meet on June 3 to decide on the new satellite broadcasting directive to succeed the one expiring at the end of the year. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the technology commissioner, has said new legislation should be combined with a consensus approach to resolving the standards issue. Simultaneous D2-Mac and Pal transmission by BSkyB, one of Europe's largest satellite broadcasters, would mean that confrontation with the Commission could be avoided. British-based television makers threw their weight behind the drive to create a single European satellite standard. Lord Chapple, president of the British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers' Association, expressed support for D2-Mac, in effect withdrawing the manufacturers' backing for D-Mac, which has been used only in the UK.</p>

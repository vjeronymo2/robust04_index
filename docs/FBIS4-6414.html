			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Michio Watanabe, former  foreign minister of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), said Tuesday he has decided not to leave the party to be  a prime ministerial candidate in an election to choose a  successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Watanabe, 70, conveyed his decision in a third meeting with  LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run in a Diet  election to select a successor to Hosokawa, 56.    Hosokawa announced his resignation on April 8 over a  financial scandal and a Diet stalemate.    Watanabe made the decision against a backdrop of ruling  coalition partners coming close to agreeing on key policies such  as national security and tax system rehabilitation, and picking  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the alliance's core party  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) as its candidate for prime  minister, political sources said.    Watanabe's change of heart over quitting the LDP paved the  way for the party to field Kono as its official candidate for  the premiership election, party sources said.    Kono met with Watanabe on Friday and Monday hoping to  persuade him not to run in the premiership race to keep party  unity but the efforts proved fruitless then.    Watanabe, an LDP veteran who has held various ministerial  posts under LDP governments, declared Sunday he will quit the  party to be a candidate for the election, saying a cabinet  capable of rescuing the country from the current difficult  situation should be formed.    As a crack grew among coalition parties over the process of  picking a successor to Hosokawa, Shinseito and Komeito, the  coalition's other key party, briefly considered Watanabe to be  new leader of a post-Hosokawa coalition.    The LDP's 38-year-long grip on power ended last summer as  seven parties ranging from socialists to conservatives formed  the current coalition following the July general elections, in  which the LDP failed to retain a majority.    Watanabe told reporters after the face-to-face meeting with  Kono that he will not help the coalition and will remain in the  LDP to promote reform.    Watanabe also said that he will vote for Kono in the prime  ministerial election in the Diet.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, meanwhile, told  reporters  that Watanabe decided not to leave but to remain in the party  because the coalition has not yet forged agreement on crucial  policies such as national security and its stand on North  Korea's suspected nuclear arms development project.    Diet balloting for a new prime minister is likely to take  place on Thursday [21 April] or after, parliamentary sources  said.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: The price of sound finance - Conference Notebook IT'S the economy, stupid. The Conservative party briefly escaped yesterday the inexorable logic of US President Bill Clinton's dictum. Criminals, single mothers, leftwing teachers and social security scroungers are unmissable targets. Messrs Michael Howard, John Patten and Peter Lilley took full advantage. They scored one or two bullseyes. Today it is back to reality. By all accounts Mr Kenneth Clarke is planning a typically combative speech. There will be some good news. The recovery may be patchy but Britain's economy is growing faster than any other in Europe. The fall in inflation is more than a blip. Manufacturing industry has both a grip on its costs and a real competitive edge. Lady Thatcher's enterprise culture lives on. As Mr Stephen Dorrell, one of Mr Clarke's Treasury team, put it yesterday on the fringe, the prize on the horizon is an end to boom and bust. In the background other ministers are whispering about the opportunity for an early cut in interest rates. All that's needed now, Mr Clarke will tell us, is one more heave to get the country's public finances in order. That means the toughest public spending round for a decade or more. The chancellor must keep open also the option of further measures to raise revenue (the phrase does not sound quite as bad as tax increases) in the Budget. But what is a Tory government for if it is not to preside over sound finance. No mention, of course, of how the government got itself in to this particular mess. In spite of the threat that the economic debate will be the first in Blackpool worthy of that description, Mr Clarke cannot afford to backtrack over the imposition of value added tax on fuel. In retrospect he believes it was a mistake to prolong the agony by deferring full implementation until 1995. He might yet bring it forward to next April. His only hope is that the promise of a relatively generous compensation package will contain the anger among the Tory faithful. It is a plausible package for a conference which would occasionally like to forget how divided its party has become. Even Lady Thatcher might allow herself a supportive smile. Mr Norman Lamont, speaking on the conference fringe only moments after Mr Clarke has sat down, may not be quite so forgiving. For all his natural self-confidence, the chancellor is a worried man. So is Mr John Major, who spent yesterday afternoon poring over Mr Clarke's text. Promising sound finance is a lot easier than delivering it. Nor can the beleagured prime minister afford the luxury of the medium-term perspective of his chancellor. Mr Clarke has made two basic promises which provide the fixed points for the Budget. The first is that he will secure a faster reduction in the borrowing requirement. The second is that he will not cut public spending to below the level agreed by the cabinet in July. Only faster economic growth, higher taxes or both will square that particular circle. There have been one or two signs that faster growth will provide a partial lifeline over the medium term. Shrewd observers in Blackpool are suggesting that the doomsters may be pleasantly surprised. Against that, the latest smoke-signals from the Treasury suggest that for the current financial year borrowing may still be close to Pounds 50bn. For all the jeers from the Tory right it is also clear that the spending round is turning out to be a great deal tougher than generally realised. Mr Clarke has referred to blood on the Whitehall carpets. Spending colleagues say the blood is also on the walls and ceilings. Mr Clarke will not make up his mind on how much extra revenue he needs until around the end of this month, although the broad shape of the Budget will be sketched out at Dorneywood in 10 days time. But the best guess of those who read his lips is that the chancellor is thinking in terms of a net tax increase of between Pounds 4bn or Pounds 5bn. For all his public bravado about extending VAT, there is no certainty that he will bite that particular bullet. The prospective spending cuts already threaten Mr Major's fragile Commons majority. The switch in Budget timing will give restless Tory MPs four months before the start of the financial year to rebel against VAT on transport, books or children's clothes. Much safer, Mr Clarke might judge, to raise what he needs by some clever juggling with income tax allowances. His combative style and the reflex loyalty of the Tory faithful should guarantee him a standing ovation for his first conference speech as chancellor. He should make the most of it. There won't be many plaudits from Tory voters after November 30.</p>

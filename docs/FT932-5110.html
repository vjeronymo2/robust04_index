			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Budgie the Helicopter lands contract with ITV THE DUCHESS of York may no longer be a wholly paid up member of the Royal family but she is still reaping the rewards of her literary endeavours. Sleepy Kids, the children's programme maker, and HTV have just been commissioned by the ITV Network Centre to a make an animated series out of her creation - the four Budgie The Helicopter books. The deal will be a boost for the loss-making Sleepy Kids which last month announced a Pounds 1.2m rights issue mainly to fund the group's participation in the production of the series. The ITV deal for thirteen 11-minute episodes should also provide some extra uplift for HTV's share price which has risen from a low of 19p to 50p. The ITV company for Wales and the West is planning to specialise in making children's programmes for the national ITV network. At the moment HTV is broadcasting The Pig Attraction - a series that marks the return to the national screen after a long absence of Pinky and Perky. Budgie is described as a resourceful little character who constantly gets himself into tricky situations because he wants to help but doesn't really think about the consequences of his actions. A bit like the Duchess of York. Her financial adviser, Mr John Bryan, was involved in the negotiations with Sleepy Kids on the original rights deal.</p>

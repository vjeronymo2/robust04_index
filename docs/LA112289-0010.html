			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERPRETING ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> Gee. "On Tuesday, White America Came of Age," says the Rev. Jesse Jackson  (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 9). "But after Tuesday's elections, we are now one important  step closer to the day when, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we in  America judge other people not by the color of their skin. . . ."  </P> <P> In the New York City election 98% of the blacks voted for the black candidate.  Wow. Like affirmative action in the polling booth, eh, Jesse?  </P> <P> GEORGE H. McCARTY  </P> <P> Highland  </P></p>

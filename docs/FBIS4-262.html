			<p>BFN     [Text] Shooting flared up between security forces and armed  opposition activists in a Brazzaville district, near the home of  former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who has become an  opposition leader. One person died, but it is not known if the  victim -- a noncommissioned officer assigned to guard a union  leader, Bocamba Yangouma, who is close to the presidential group  -- was involved in the shoot-out or if he was simply hit by a  stray bullet. Sergeant Vourou Samba died from a bullet wound in  the stomach. Calm returned soon after the incident, which  occurred in an eastern suburb of the Congolese capital. Since  the cease-fire agreement reached at the end of January, after  two months of political and interethnic violence, there have  only been isolated incidents in Brazzaville.</p>

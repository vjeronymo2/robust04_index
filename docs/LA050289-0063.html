Department of Health Services inspectors said  Petroleum Waste Inc. failed to implement a required emergency contingency plan  following the exposure of three employees to hazardous wastes, failed to submit  a written report on the incident to the state and inspectors noted what they  called poor laboratory management practices. Kizer said most violations have  been corrected.  </P></p>

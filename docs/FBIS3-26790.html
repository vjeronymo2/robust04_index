Speaking at a UN Security Council session on the situation  in  Bosnia, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright  said that "it is only force plus diplomacy that can stop the  slaughter in Sarajevo and break the stalemate in Geneva."    On the ten-day deadline for the withdrawal or placement  under  UN control of heavy weapons of the warring parties in Bosnia,  Albright said that NATO would respond in coordination with the  United Nations to the artillery or mortar fire that had wreaked  the havoc in Sarajevo on February 5.    "These decisions are consistent with resolutions approved by  this council," she said, and "they do not require further  council action."    Observers here noted that the statement was in sharp  contrast  with that of her Russian counterpart Yuriy Vorontsov, who said  at the same meeting that "the Security Council should back up  its demands by a proper decision."    The U.S. ambassador also said that her government believed  that the Bosnian conflict should be resolved at the negotiating  table, not on the battlefield.    "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should  impose a settlement upon the parties, for an imposed settlement  will not be a lasting settlement."    However, she added, by seeking to reduce the level of  violence around Sarajevo, her government hoped to reinvigorate  and lend substance to the negotiating process.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK, France reject Bosnia criticism BRITAIN and France yesterday forcefully rejected claims that the Western powers and Russia had endorsed Serb territorial conquests in Bosnia. In a visit to Paris, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, strongly defended Britain and France against charges that, in the recent Washington declaration, they were condoning Serb aggression. It was 'a plan for pressure until such time as the Serbs disgorge their (land) gains,' he said. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said: 'Things are perfectly clear. We do not accept any fait accompli.' Mr Major also stressed the convergence of UK-French interests and roles, arising in general out of the two countries' status as UN Security Council members and nuclear weapon states, and in particular from their common involvement in the Bosnian crisis. In talks with Mr Balladur, and at lunch with President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Major said he had largely sought to intensify co-operation in areas where the two countries were in agreement - such as enlarging, decentralising decision-making and reinforcing security co-operation in the EC. 'It was not a day for short-term decisions, but for long-term planning,' Mr Major said, adding that he hoped to further improve UK-French relations, which were 'in better shape' than at any time he could recall. He said he had invited the French president and prime minister to London on July 26 for the first full UK-French summit since 1991. Mr Balladur said the two leaders had ordered a special effort to try to bridge their differences in the Gatt talks, essentially over France's insistence on tying an agricultural deal with the US, satisfactory to French farmers, to non-farm aspects of world trade talks.

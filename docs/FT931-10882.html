			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Heavitree hit by bad debts HEAVITREE Brewery, the USM-quoted pub operator, reported profits substantially lower over the 12 months to October 31. Although turnover improved 34 per cent to Pounds 8.38m (Pounds 6.28m), the pre-tax line tumbled from Pounds 910,000 to Pounds 560,000. Directors of the Devon-based group blamed the decline on 'settling down costs' following the acquisition of its small managed estate and bad debts which amounted to Pounds 344,000. Interest charges on loans were 'exceptionally high', they added. However, a recovery was under way and the recommended final dividend is held at 2.45p for a maintained total of 3.05p, payable from earnings of 4.2p (8p) per share.</p>

Addressing a meeting in Durban last night, Mr. de Klerk said the  government had not been consulted on this issue, and that he  needed a concrete proposal to be tabled before it could be  considered. However, he had serious reservations as to whether  international mediation could address the issues at stake. Mr.  de Klerk said he was open to negotiations to reach agreement for  implementation after the elections.    Mr. de Klerk said he was disappointed with the Freedom  Alliance's actions regarding the amendments proposed by the  government to break the constitutional deadlock. He described  the alliances' reaction as inadequate, as the government's  proposals address the core of the problems. Mr. de Klerk said  he rejected the alliance's efforts to play down the latest  amendments.</p>

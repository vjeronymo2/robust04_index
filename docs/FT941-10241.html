			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Ford As a proxy for economic statistics, Ford's figures would serve tolerably well. Strength in the growing US domestic market is offset by weakness in depressed Europe. Market share gains in the US result in part from pressure on Japanese imports as the yen has risen. The strong performance of the finance subsidiary shows how alternative forms of financing - particularly leasing - are displacing traditional methods. With many of its models selling well, the company would seem merely to have to wait for recovery in Europe to fire on all cylinders. There are, however, problems. The company restructured for leaner production in the 1980s, but new model development is still more expensive than that of its rivals. Its product mix is also biased towards low margin general cars and away from higher margin trucks and specialist sectors such as four-wheel drive sport vehicles. In the face of the Japanese challenge, the rejuvenation of Detroit has begun. But Mr Alex Trotman, Ford's new chairman, still has much to do.</p>

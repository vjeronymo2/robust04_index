			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The government will adopt  a set of measures for North Korean loggers in Russia seeking  refuge and settlement in South Korea.    The decision was made at a working-level meeting of related  government ministries and agencies, including the National  Unification Board, the Economic Planning Board, the Foreign,  Home, Justice, Labor, and Information Ministries, the Agency for  National Security Planning and the National Police Agency,  presided over by the chief assistant to the prime minister for  administrative coordination, Kim Si-hyong, on Tuesday.    Under the measures, the North Korean defectors protection  law  enacted in June last year will be flexibly implemented, while  programs to help North Korean loggers settle in the South as  soon as possible will be developed.    These programs will include job training and placement,  housing assistance and security steps to ensure their safety.    In addition, civic organizations such as religious and  charity groups will be encouraged to stage fund-raising  campaigns for North Korean loggers arriving in the South.    The government will hold two or three more working-level  meetings to finalize the measures, an official said.    For the 10 or so North Korean loggers expected to arrive in  the South soon as negotiations with the Russian Government are  almost completed, Seoul will provide job training to aid their  early settlement in the South, officials said.    The South Korean Mission in Moscow has formed a task force  to  negotiate with the Russian Government on legal procedures for  North Korean loggers traveling to the South.    Moscow, considering its relations with Pyongyang, has not  yet  set a policy on North Korean loggers seeking refuge in South  Korea, an official said.</p>

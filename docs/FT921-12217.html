			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: BP hopeful of share in east German refinery BRITISH Petroleum, recently beaten in the race for east Germany's lucrative Minol oil company and the Leuna petrochemicals refinery by Elf-Aquitaine of France, may yet share in the Leuna site near Merseburg. Elf won the preliminary DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.91bn) contract to take over Minol and build a new refinery at Leuna in a consortium with Thyssen and SB-Kauf. But the Treuhand agency, owning virtually all the east German chemicals industry, wants to privatise the chemicals side of Leuna, losing nearly DM200m a year. Mr Paul Achleitner, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank advising Treuhand on the sale, said chemical companies pledged to invest at Leuna could join the Elf-led consortium and become joint owners of the new refinery. Treuhand is negotiating with several companies, including ENI of Italy and OMV of Austria, and hopes to finalise a package by next June when the Elf contract is to be signed. BP Chemicals had also sounded out interest in building an acetic acid plant at Leuna, Treuhand said. 'BP could build it in a consortium or alone, we don't care,' Mr Klaus Schucht, in charge of the chemical industry at Treuhand, declared. Listing why Elf had clinched the Minol-Leuna refinery deal, he said that unlike BP, it had guaranteed that the highly-profitable Minol service station network would not be broken up. Elf aimed to build a new refinery at Leuna while BP wanted to refurbish the old one. The company, partly owned by the French Government, had a 'strategic' interest in moving eastwards while BP was more concerned with 'short-term returns', Mr Schucht claimed. But BP still has a say in the future of the Leuna refinery, stemming from the joint venture it set up in 1990 with Leuna and Intrac which markets 80 per cent of the refinery's petrol and diesel oil to Minol. It also invested DM60m in a filling terminal at Leuna for oil tank trucks. Under a year ago, Leuna and the two other chemicals producers, Bitterfeld and Buna, were seen as so obsolescent they could only be closed. That would have meant the end of chemicals output in east Germany. In 1989, 130,000 people were still employed as chemical workers in the Halle-Merseburg area. Aware that costs of 'de-industrialising' the region would exceed those of reviving it, Bonn backed a plan to rescue the chemicals centre which will cost Treuhand up to DM10bn in infrastructure investments. Mr Schucht expected medium-sized German companies would locate at Bitterfeld. Albright &amp; Wilson of the UK is negotiating to produce plant protection agents on part of the site. He hoped enough companies would be attracted over the next five years for the old loss-making Bitterfeld AG to be greatly reduced.</p>

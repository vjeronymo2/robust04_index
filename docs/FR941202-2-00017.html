			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The GOI's response in this investigation is consistent with the information provided in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, we preliminarily determine that this program is not limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries and, therefore, is not countervailable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. ECSC Article 54 Loans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Article 54 of the 1951 ECSC Treaty, the European Commission provides loans directly to iron and steel companies for modernization and the purchase of new equipment. The loans finance up to 50 percent of an investment project. The remaining financing needs must be met from other sources. The Article 54 loan program is financed by loans taken by the Commission, which are then re-lent to iron and steel companies in the member states at a slightly higher interest rate than that at which the Commission obtained them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the Department's finding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we preliminarily determine that this program is limited to the iron and steel industry. As a result, loans under this program are specific. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the Article 54 loans Dalmine had outstanding during the POI, some were denominated in U.S. dollars and others were in Dutch guilders (``NLG''). To determine whether the loans were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, we used benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the loans were denominated. That is, for the U.S. dollar loans we used the average interest rate on long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar loans obtained in the United States, as reported by the Federal Reserve. For the NLG denominated loan, we used the average long-term bond rate for private borrowers in the Netherlands, as reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (``OECD''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the interest rate spaid on Dalmine's Article 54 loans are higher than the benchmark interest rates, the Department preliminarily determines that loans provided under this program are not preferential and, therefore, not countervailable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. 1989 Provisional Payment in Connection With 1989 Equity Infusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In March 1989, ILVA made a payment to Dalmine in anticipation of purchasing new shares in Dalmine. The payment was provisional in nature because EC authorization of the capital increase was necessary, and if authorization was not granted, the money would have been repaid to ILVA. The capital increase was not finalized until November 1989, due to delays in EC approval. At that time, the payment became equity capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the Department's position in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Italy  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), 59 FR 18357 (April 18, 1994), we preliminarily determine that the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine are countervailable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period March&hyph;November 1989, Dalmine had use of the money and paid no interest on it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we have treated the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine as an interest-free short-term loan from March 1989 to November 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because any benefit from this interest-free loan would be allocable entirely to 1989, no benefit is attributable to the POI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be Not Used <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the information provided in the responses, we preliminarily determine that the following programs were not used.

This suspension will remain in effect until further notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> OCTG <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Country-Wide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Ad Valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Rate_1.42 percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Notification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 703(f) of the Act, we will notify the ITC of our determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC all nonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation. We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order, without the written consent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations, Import Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

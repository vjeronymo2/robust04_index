			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECORD GETS PROBATION  </P> <P> Who says our justice system doesn't work? Richard V. Winrow, convicted of  possession of 5.5 ounces of cocaine with intent to distribute, was sentenced to  life in prison without parole ("5 1/2 Ounces of Crack Brings Life Term With No  Parole," Part A, Dec. 7). Secord, on the other hand, operator of a tremendous  extra-governmental scam to make millions off U.S. taxpayers and supply arms  illegally to a murderous U.S. mercenary army, has been sentenced to two years  probation and fined $50.  </P> <P> To add further insult to this outrageous outcome, Secord is now whining that  the independent-prosecutor law cramps his style excessively, and is launching a  campaign to have it repealed!  </P> <P> The lessons of recent history are clear: If you want to be a successful  criminal, just be sure to commit large-scale crimes, be a white male and wear a  suit. It also won't hurt to cultivate some contacts in the White House.  </P> <P> JERRY B. HOLTON  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

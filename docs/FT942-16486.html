			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Fighting them on the beaches It is not often that a tiny political crisis can trigger savage reflections on one's place in the world, the structure of the state, and the reality of the recent history of the nation. The affair of the Anglo-Canadian veterans and the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings did just that in France. Not everyone will be familiar with the row which erupted when a couple of hundred old soldiers were told that their rooms, which had been booked for two years and financed from their own pockets, were being requisitioned by the French state. Hotels along the famous beaches were going to be used for visiting VIPs rather than the men who liberated them in the first place. There was outrage among the veterans when they learnt that their cherished plans were to be overturned and they were to be lodged instead with local families - even, some reports said, on the floor of the local town hall. The Quai d'Orsay, the foreign ministry, moved rapidly to rectify matters. The veterans were allowed to keep their rooms and the British tabloids hailed this as a victory almost as significant as the D-Day landings themselves. In this, they may not have been entirely wrong, although not in the way they thought. French reaction was not the xenophobic reflex many might have expected. Le Courrier de l'Ouest remarked: 'Fortunately, the Quai has just put the machine into reverse, thereby avoiding a repetition of that detestable French habit of surrendering automatically to the demands of the state.' Many will find that a curious sentiment in view of other recent events which have seen 'the state' - in the form of the prime minister, Edouard Balladur  -surrendering to pressure from the streets, whether over the price of fish or of adolesecent labour. But this only highlights the French tradition of political consultation: blind acceptance or violent revolt. There is no middle way, and few legal means of public protest against the state. This can be be advantageous if you want to build nuclear power stations, high-speed rail tracks, or vast motorways on private property. But the great re-think went beyond that. There was recognition that the commemoration of D-Day had enabled the French to annoy everybody. The Germans were upset by their exclusion from certain ceremonies and by the clumsy attempts to retrieve the situation; the Anglo-Saxons by the affair of the hotel rooms. L'Independant du Midi seemed to think both problems could have been resolved by making the British and Canadians share rooms with German veterans. But this paper from the south is far from the front line and is a bit barmy, anyway. La Presse de la Manche was involved more intimately. 'Unthinkable, impolite, inelegant to the point of caricature. The heroes of the festival are the ones we honour, our liberators. The very least we can do is to offer them the best place, 50 years after their perilous disembarkation, for they return among us as friends and benefactors. That can never be understood at the school of National Administration or Political Science.' Nor surprisingly, it was Le Monde which covered the widest panorama. In the deft hands of its leader writers, the affair became a symptom of almost everything; even Quebec got dragged into it (Quebec is French and Canadian.) 'Conforming to a certain authoritarian statist tradition, which always surprises the Anglo-Saxons and even the Quebecois, Paris simply requisitoned hotel rooms . . .' Le Monde also argued that the Gaullist version of history had to be revised. The general had convinced the French that they had won the war by their own means 'with the aid' of their allies. But the paper noted: 'Historical truth is less heroic. Beyond the Channel and the Atlantic, things are not seen quite this way. As a Canadian veteran justly remarked in a Quebec accent: 'When we came in 1944, we hadn't reserved two years in advance'.' So, the episode is something of a milestone. The French, like everybody else, rarely feel any sense of wrongdoing in their conduct of relations with peoples of other lands. They can blow up yachts in friendly foreign harbours, they can poison tranquil islands with nuclear bombs. More than anybody else, they can confuse their narrow national interests with those of civilisation and the fate of Europe if not the world. But in this small affair of the veterans' hotel rooms, there has been a universal, and engagingly frank, admission that France, in the form of the state, behaved badly. And it concedes that the Anglo-Saxons were right to be annoyed. The French press usually demonstrates a greater sense of le fair play than its counterpart across the Channel, but rarely in such a self-critical manner. Perhaps June 6 1994 will constitute a turning point in French history as dramatic as the event which it commemorates. On the other hand, maybe it will not.

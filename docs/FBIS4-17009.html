			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "Radical changes in the  Russian economy will take place only alongside the influx of  private investments, rather than credits from international  financial organisations," said Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr  Shokhin at a meeting with journalists on Wednesday. The news  conference was devoted to international economic cooperation and  investments into Russian economy.    According to the vice-premier, the International Monetary  Fund is practically prepared to grant Russia the second part of  a three- billion "system credit." At a session of the board of  IMF managers opening in Washington this week preparations will  be launched for granting a standard credit worth 4 billion  dollars, Shokhin said.    In his opinion, an annual session of EBRD managers held in  St. Petersburg last week showed a high level of Russia's  interaction with Western partners. He pointed out that Russia  would like to attract more private investments for the  development of the oil and gas sector. The government is  prepared to accept such investments on privileged terms, he  said. For instance, the value added tax, which caused great  concern of foreign and domestic investors, has been practically  lifted from foreign investments into Russia, Shokhin said.    Until recently, Russian enterprises had to pay a lot of  money  to the state for equipment it imported from abroad. Now, as  soon as the equipment is installed, the whole amount of tax  levied on the equipment will be returned. As for the imports of  material and monetary means for the formation of the fixed  stock, they are exempt from taxes altogether, Shokhin said.    The government does not forget potential domestic investors,  the vice-premier said. At present, the government is working  out a plan of making a bigger number of attractive enterprises  available for privatisation after a voucher stage is over than  their original number offered for privatisation. On the other  hand, stable inflation rates reached by the government will  inevitably bring about the reduction of bank interest rates,  which is a major condition for encouraging investments into  industry, Shokhin said.</p>

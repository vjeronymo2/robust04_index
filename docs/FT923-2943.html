			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Indian liberalisation defended MR Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister and chief architect of a far-reaching economic liberalisation plan, yesterday rejected suggestions that his programme is running out of steam. 'There is no basis in such complaints. We have done all that we promised,' said Mr Singh in an interview with the Financial Times. He was speaking on the eve of his departure on a visit to the UK and the US, during which he will take part in the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Mr Singh, a Harvard-trained economist and former bureaucrat, won widespread praise for guiding India out of a balance-of-payments crisis and into a World Bank-approved programme of radical reforms last year, including the easing of decades-old government economic controls and the partial floating of the rupee. But delays in implementing important measures, such as cutting the government's deficit, has exposed Mr Singh to growing criticism. The government has also run into trouble over the alleged involvement of some junior ministers in the Bombay stock market scandal. Only last week, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, warned Mr Singh and his ministers of the risk of the reforms getting bogged down. 'There is still a hiatus between policy formulation and implementation at the ground level,' the bank said in a report. He said implementation took time because decision-making involved consulting many different interests. Mr Singh said the economy was progressing along lines agreed with the World Bank and IMF, with growth likely to be in the 3-4 per cent range in real terms in the financial year which started in March 1992, compared with 2-2.5 per cent last year. He was disappointed that a sharp devaluation in the rupee since last year had not as yet produced a significant increase in exports. Nevertheless, Mr Singh said, export growth shortfalls had been matched by improvements in other elements in the current account, such as a sharp decline in gold smuggling. He welcomed the increase in planned foreign investment which his reforms have stimulated. The total of Dollars 1.4bn in the year to March, far exceeded the previous annual level of Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m. India opened its stock markets to approved foreign institutional investors (FIIs) yesterday, setting out rules under which they would operate, the Finance Ministry announced, Reuter reports from New Delhi. Approved FIIs will be able to buy up to 24 per cent of shares in an Indian company and repatriate profits net of concessional tax rates with no lock-in period. Investors will pay a flat rate of 20 per cent on dividend and interest income and a flat 10 per cent capital gains on shares held for more than one year.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Cadbury warns on boardroom best practice FAILURE BY companies to adopt standards of best practice in the boardroom threatened to invoke increasing pressure for statutory regulation, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee on corporate governance, said. Sir Adrian warned that the drive towards improved standards of financial reporting and accountability in the boardroom was not going to fade when the economy picked up. He added: 'Hard times have had a part to play in putting the matter on the public agenda, but the basic issue is one of trust.' Sir Adrian said the committee's proposals were aimed at raising the level of confidence in the way companies are run. He emphasised that if companies did not take action themselves, 'others who understand business less well and are more doctrinaire in their approach will surely do so'. He said the CBI's agenda for industrial recovery stressed the need to develop a more effective partnership between investors and industry, supported by clear communication. That partnership required trust and confidence in the way companies are run. The draft report calls for boards to comply with a code of best practice and for listed companies to include in their annual accounts a statement on the extent of their compliance. Other recommendations include the creation of separate audit committees and a strong, independent element on every board of directors. But Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, the conglomerate, and chairman of the CBI's companies committee, spelled out a list of reservations to the Cadbury proposals. He said the CBI objected to the proposed Stock Exchange listing obligation because it made a code of practice less capable of flexible change and interpretation. The ultimate sanction of de-listing represented a draconian measure and would prevent shareholders from selling shares. Mr Michael Harding of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, queried whether self-regulation could ever be strong enough to ensure high standards of boardroom behaviour. He said 'the present regime of self-regulation by discreet bodies with little or no contact with each other' was failing to meet public expectations.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Increased fee income helps lift Banco Exterior BANCO EXTERIOR, the flagship of the state-owned Argentaria financial group, has raised its third-quarter net profits by 11.3 per cent to Pta21bn (Dollars 188.4m) over the same period last year due to increased fee income and a stringent control of costs and of bad debts. Exterior's financial income fell by 7.1 per cent to Pta267.8bn over the first nine months, but other ordinary revenue, mainly commissions, was up by 9.5 per cent to Pta16.6bn. Operating expenditure rose by only 3.8 per cent after a 4.3 per cent reduction in overall costs. Pursuing 'a very active' strategy over insolvencies, Exterior realised Pta22.1bn in bad debts, a 136 per cent improvement on the previous year's volume. Customer loans were reduced, year-on-year, by 8.7 per cent and Pta43.7bn was put aside for doubtful debts, a 19.8 per cent rise in the provisions allocated in the first nine months of last year.</p>

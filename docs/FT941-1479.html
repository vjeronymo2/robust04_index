			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Two cities campaign for soul of Ukraine: Anger over the first two years of independence will be vented in Sunday's election A generation ago western Ukrainian partisans fought eastern Ukrainian Soviet soldiers in forests outside of Lviv (formerly the Soviet city of Lvov) during the second world war. Today they are all citizens of Ukraine. But the historical and cultural divide between Ukraine's more nationalist west and Russian-oriented east are again intensifying and threatening to sever the fragile social fabric of this two-year-old nation. As the final straight of independent Ukraine's first parliamentary elections this Sunday approaches, very different debates are shaping up in two cities, 1,200km apart, of this geographical conflict. The election's results are likely to usher new extremes into the parliament, now dominated by like-minded former communists and party bosses who have led the country to hyperinflation, a dire energy crisis and poverty. In Lviv, an Austrian-Hapsburg architectural gem 60km from the Polish border, nationalism is exploding into radicalism and fascism. 'Ukraine for Ukrainians' and other xenophobic slogans are often heard as people, especially the youth, are disillusioned with the economic results the moderate democrat-nationalists they once supported have brought them. In Donetsk, a worn-out coal-mining town 60km from the Russian border, nationalism is virtually non-existent. The people, almost entirely Russian speakers and nearly half of whom are ethnic Russians, are clamouring for a 'Union with Russia', by which they mean closer economic ties, and autonomy from mismanaged Kiev. There is great disillusionment with the first two years of Ukrainian independence in which personal fortunes have declined instead of improved. For these two border cities, the election is less about throwing out the old Soviet legacy, but is more a battle for the Ukrainian soul. Lviv wants to take over Kiev and create a unified nationalist state where everyone speaks Ukrainian. Donetsk has given up on Kiev and is holding a referendum to run their Russified region on their own and re-establish old ties with Moscow. Kiev's procurator has called this referendum illegal. A leaked US intelligence report has forecast that a violent east-west civil war could erupt as Ukraine's economy continued to collapse. In Lviv 19 nationalist parties have launched such an impressively noisy campaign of mass postering and television advertisements that 'centrist and communist voices are barely heard or seen', according to an election observer. The Social-National Party of Ukraine, whose members sport blackshirt uniforms and use a swastika-like symbol as their logo, have successfully placed a candidate on the ballot of each of Lviv region's 23 electoral districts. Three years ago, Rukh, the nationalist-democratic movement, which rallied the nation to split from the Kremlin, was the dominant political force. Now Rukh has itself splintered into two factions due to in-fighting. 'Rukh has discredited itself. They promised that we would be like Sweden in two to three years. Now we're worse off than before independence and people are looking for an alternative,' said 22-year-old Natalya Balyuk. Donetsk is in the heart of the coal and metal rich Don River basin. Less than 10 years ago, the prosperous Soviet coal mining and steel region attracted hordes of weekend shoppers from the neighbouring Russian city of Rostov. The choice cuts of meat and sausage are now gone. Today crammed busloads of Donetsk miners travel in the opposite direction, working for cut, yet rouble, wages in the Rostov coal pits. It has been a big fall from grace for a region that was once prized as an industrial centrepiece of the old Soviet Union. While a majority voted for independence in 1991, most now regret their decision. 'We had everything then. Where did it all go?' asked Yekaterina Solovyova, a Russian coal miner's wife (whose husband is Ukrainian). 'We didn't need to cut all our links and start all these troubles with Moscow. Now it's hard for me to visit my mother in the Urals (in Russia) because the aircraft don't fly there.' Ukraine's energy crisis has grounded most flights. Like many of her neighbours, Mrs Solovyova plans to vote Yes to the four questions on the ballot this Sunday: 1. Should Russian be an official language along with Ukrainian?; 2. Should Ukraine have a federal structure, where power is decentralised? 3. Should Russian be used in official documents and in education along with Ukrainian?; and 4. Should Ukraine join the CIS charter as a full member and become part of the economic union? Language, curiously, comes up twice in the questions. It is a particularly sensitive point in a region where the Ukrainian language seems foreign. In Lviv, Russian may be the language of Soviet oppressors. But in Donetsk, Russian has been their history for the last 350 years. Mrs Solovyova explains: 'Why can't Russian be an official language too? That's what we speak. You know, I used to feel that I could be part of Ukraine, but now I don't feel Ukrainian at all. I just feel Soviet.' 1917: Kiev successfully resists Bolshevik takeover 1918: Central and western Ukraine form independent Ukrainian state. It becomes the principle battleground for the Russian civil war 1920: Central and eastern Ukraine under Soviet rule. Western Ukraine is part of Poland 1932: Some 7m peasants die in artificial famine 1939: After signing of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and the USSR, Soviet armies march into western Ukraine 1945: All Ukraine becomes Soviet republic; in western Ukraine fierce partisan opposition to Russian rule is only quelled in late 1950s 1991: National-communist alliance leads breakaway from Moscow, contributing to break-up of Soviet Union. On December 1, more than 90 per cent of Ukrainians vote for independence and elect Leonid Kravchuk, a former communist ideologue, president</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Poised for the political pay-off: Brazil's rosy economic outlook is likely to carry Fernando Cardoso to victory in Monday's election Brazilians vote for a new president on Monday hoping that nearly a decade of high inflation and bad government is over and a new cycle of economic growth can begin. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former academic turned social democratic politician, is now clear favourite to win the election. If he succeeds, his popularity and the improving health of the economy will put him in a strong position to modernise Brazil's economy and political system. 'He could change the country completely and we would go back to growing at 7 per cent a year,' according to Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de Janeiro-based economist. Optimism about the country's outlook has been spreading since the introduction in July of a new currency, the Real, which led to a fall in the inflation rate from 50 per cent in June to less than 2 per cent this month. The Real's success ignited the election campaign of Mr Cardoso who, as finance minister, planned the currency before resigning to run for president. Brazil has seen false dawns before, most recently when optimism following the 1989 election of former president Fernando Collor turned to despair after he resigned amid corruption charges. And the country's social problems, including one of the biggest gaps between rich and poor in the world, will require more than one successful presidential term to solve. So Mr Cardoso's advisers are anxious that their candidate should win in the first round of voting to give him the 'flying start' needed to allow him to force urgent measures through Congress during the first three months of his presidency. In order to win on Monday, Mr Cardoso needs to poll more votes than all his competitors combined. He looks likely to do so. If not, the top two candidates contest a run-off in November. Opinion polls suggest Mr Cardoso has about 44 per cent support, well ahead of his nearest rival, the leftwinger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who has about 22 per cent. If Mr da Silva can force a run-off, polls suggest Mr Cardoso would win easily. The measures at the top of Mr Cardoso's priority list are those needed to consolidate the Real and keep inflation low. The new currency succeeded in reducing inflation partly because the government managed to keep this year's budget balanced. However, this was achieved only by emergency spending cuts and higher than expected tax revenues. Budget problems are set to return and worsen next year. Mr Cardoso is therefore likely to call for a sweeping fiscal reform to try and solve the budget difficulties. According to advisers, his priorities will be to increase the overall tax burden from the present level of 25 per cent of gross domestic product. He also wants to reduce constitutionally imposed limits which force the federal government to spend more than 70 per cent of its revenues on wage bills and transfers to states and municipalities. Increasing tax revenues will be difficult because many Brazilians have become adept at evading tax. Persuading state governments to cut spending targets will also be tricky, especially since several state governors, who also face elections on Monday, are likely to be opponents of Mr Cardoso. Urgent reform is also needed for Brazil's social security system, the bill for which has risen from Dollars 7.8bn in 1988 to Dollars 24bn this year, partly because of generous retirement provisions. The government has paid the bill by transferring money from the health service, which has declined rapidly as a result. These reforms have been discussed for some time, and were meant to have been agreed during a recent constitutional revision in Congress. But the process failed because Congressmen were not prepared to support unpopular measures such as cutting social spending in an election year. Mr Cardoso has a better chance of pushing changes through the new Congress, which will not face the same election pressures for another four years. In Congress he is supported by his small Social Democratic party (PSDB), the larger, rightwing Liberal Front (PFL), as well as several smaller parties. According to Mr Paulo Calmon, a political consultant, this should give him a majority in Congress with about 60 per cent support. He is also likely to be supported by the governors from some of Brazil's most important states, including Sao Paulo. But political ties in Brazil owe more to personal links than to party allegiance, and this could lead to problems for Mr Cardoso. The alliance between the PSDB and the PFL, for example, was a reaction to the threat of the leftwing Mr da Silva. The two parties share little common ideology. Many PFL members worked with Brazil's military governments which ruled between 1964 and 1985, leaving their democratic credentials in doubt. Others are linked with the nepotism and corruption common in Brazil's backward north-east. Mr Cardoso and other PSDB leaders, meanwhile, campaigned against the military and corruption and come from the country's south. Mr Cardoso's advisers say the alliance agrees on the main task for his presidency: the reform of the Brazilian state. Brazil's state-led development model, which was responsible for what its supporters call the 'economic miracle' of high growth in the 1970s, has since suffered from years of bad management while inflation almost bankrupted the government. 'We need a new model of development with social justice,' Mr Cardoso says. His comments on social justice are welcomed by most analysts, especially since social divisions have worsened with Brazil's economic problems. The richest 1 per cent now earn more than the poorest 50 per cent. Years of inflation and spending cuts led to under-investment in education and healthcare which will take time and money to redress. Mr Cardoso's opponents say his plans to reduce the size of the state are worrying. They say that the state provides crucial support for many poorer people in Brazil, where 20 per cent of workers earn less than Dollars 70 a month. 'Any attempt to reduce government costs will certainly worsen social problems and hurt millions of people,' says to Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, a Sao Paulo-based economist. Mr Cardoso says he wants better, rather than less, government spending and that total government investment in his four-year term would reach Dollars 100bn. About half this total is expected to come from foreign investment and the private sector - the latter including Dollars 15bn from privatisation, more than double the amount raised in the last four years. If inflation remains low, foreign investors' interest in Brazil could grow. Enthusiasm about Mr Cardoso's election chances has already led to record inflows of foreign capital. Last month there was a net inflow of Dollars 1.51bn. Most went into the stock exchange, which has risen 45 per cent since the Real's launch. Direct investment has also grown, although less rapidly. Investors are attracted by Brazil's market of 157m people and its private sector, which analysts agree is Latin America's most dynamic. Companies have restructured since 1990 as import protections fell and exports rose 24 per cent between 1990 and 1993 to reach Dollars 38.8bn. Sao Paulo state now exports more than Argentina. This growing economic strength, and the success so far of the Real, could give Mr Cardoso the best chance for many years to attack Brazil's problems. But progress will be slow because of the scale of what remains to be done, and the fact that reforms were neglected when inflation was high. 'You cannot expect to solve Brazil's problems with a few miracle measures in the first few months of a presidency,' Mr Cardoso says. 'But we do now have the conditions to confront our problems and resume economic growth.'</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Sind crackdown holds key to Sharif's reforms: Investors are growing nervous about Pakistan's immediate political future THE government of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is coming under growing pressure over its handling of violence in the southern province of Sind and as a result of a damaging split within the ruling coalition. Though it has acquiesced to army requests for wider powers in the crackdown on lawlessness in Sind, that seems unlikely to end political uncertainty. The People's Democratic Alliance (PDA), the main opposition party led by Ms Benazir Bhutto, has stepped up pressure by threatening to resign seats on national and provincial assemblies in an attempt to force elections. Some businessmen fear investment could be slowed because of nervousness at the outcome of events in Sind, which is seen as crucial to the government's future. This could put at risk the radical economic reform programme introduced by Mr Sharif. The government insists, however, that reforms and investment are on track. Yesterday troops stepped up raids in Sind during a visit to the province by Mr Sharif, in a search for suspects and illegal arms. They are operating under broader powers of search and arrest, granted last Sunday, in a drive against highway robberies and kidnappings for ransom. The powers allow the military to carry out independent operations without assistance from policemen. This follow weeks of reported deterioration in civil-military relations through the army's demand for wider powers. 'They (the army) are concerned that wide-ranging corruption in the provincial police and administration is making it difficult for them to arrest criminals,' a senior official said. Last month, a key government ally in Sind, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), a regional Moslem party and part of the ruling coalition, broke ranks from the ruling party after torture cells allegedly run by the MQM were found in an army crackdown. Twelve MQM members resigned in protest from the 217-seat National Assembly, and 23 from the 109-seat provincial assembly. Though Mr Sharif's ruling coalition, the IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance) still commands a majority in the National Assembly, the provincial Sind government of chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Shah has become vulnerable. Mr Shah turned down an opposition demand to seek a fresh vote of confidence and challenged the PDA to initiate a vote of no confidence if it wants to force him out. The opposition has set a deadline of July 30 for Mr Shah to prove his majority. At the national level, too, there have been signs of a worsening in relations between government and opposition. The PDA has said its members would resign from assemblies after consulting smaller parties outside the government, in protest against the ruling party. The resignations are being considered as one option to force President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to dissolve the assemblies and hold elections. Mr Sharif responded by saying he would call by-elections to fill the vacant seats. Both sides are aware that any action potentially leading to a dissolution of parliament carries the risk of inviting martial law, in a country which has been run by military dictators for more than half its 45-year history. Some government officials are concerned that the government is getting an image of instability. 'Even if in reality we are firmly in place, we are seen as weak and under pressure. That's not a good sign,' said one official. But precipitate action to bring down the government seems unlikely: the military wants to stay out of politics and senior army officers have repeatedly given assurances that they have no intention to introduce martial law. Government officials also discount the possibility of presidential action to dissolve parliament, on the grounds that Mr Khan and Mr Sharif share common views on politics. However the uncertainty appears to be taking its toll. 'Investors are becoming nervous over the future course of politics and want to wait and see the outcome of the latest round over Sind,' said one businessman. He added: 'We need some sense of stability to know that economic liberalisation introduced during the past two years is going to remain intact.'</p>

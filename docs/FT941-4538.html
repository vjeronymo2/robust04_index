			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond markets continue to upset share prices - Market Report Favourable news on dividends and profits proved insufficient yesterday to protect the UK stock market against another slide in US and German bond prices towards the end of the session. With British government stocks also turning off, the market slipped back sharply in the late afternoon to close with a fall of 17.7 on the FT-SE 100 Index for a final reading of 3,246.7. Equities opened firmly, encouraged by the absence of the rights issue threatened by rumour mongers at the close of the previous session. Several trading programmes, apparently weighed towards the buy side, also helped to put 6 points on the Footsie within the first half-hour of official trading. But then, as so often happens, stock index futures took a hand and London could make no further headway. The modest reduction in German money market rates at the Bundesbank repo tender, while favourable to interest rate hopes, appeared to indicate that rates in Germany will come down very slowly. Hopes of a further reduction in UK base rates were fostered by continued firmness in sterling, although market strategists showed no sign of changing their view that the next rate cut will be held back until next month, when UK consumers will be hit by higher tax and social security charges. The flat rejection of rights issue rumours by BAT Industries was accompanied by excellent profits and dividend news. The stock market, with interest excitement now subsiding, is turning its attention to dividend growth prospects, both in terms of yield comparisons between equities and bonds, and also as an underpinning of optimism on corporate earnings. RTZ, the base metals group, also increased the dividend payout, and several other leading stocks responded to good profits statements. British Land eased after announcing a Pounds 150m Eurobond issue, helping to take the steam out of fears that the stock market is threatened by a large fund-raising from a big name. Until late afternoon the Footsie held fairly steady, with the loss held to around 4 points. It was the slip in German bonds, and then in US bonds, accompanied by a 16-point fall in the Dow Average in early trade in New York, which proved the undoing of London stocks. Seaq volume increased to 730.2m shares, from 676.2m on Tuesday when retail business reached a substantial worth of Pounds 1.69bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index dipped by 10.1 to 3,913. But there was no sign of a bearish turn in the market. Legal &amp; General, one of Britain's leading life and general insurance groups, disclosed yesterday that it expects the bull market in UK equities to continue 'well into 1995' and that, given 'the current outlook of strong earnings growth', it expects to stay overweight in UK stocks for the medium term.

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE FIREBOMBED; 6 INJURED;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS WATCHING TV WITH HIS FAMILY IS SEVERELY  BURNED. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR THE ATTACK IN INGLEWOOD.  </P> <P> Several homemade firebombs were hurled by youths through a window of an  Inglewood home Wednesday night, severely burning a 12-year-old boy and injuring  a mother and her four young children who were watching television at the time,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Fire officials seeking a motive for the attack said the eight people in the  house were fortunate to survive the fiery explosion.  </P> <P> At least one of the Molotov cocktails landed in the living room, blowing a hole  in the floor and sparking the fire that engulfed the single-family home on West  103rd Street.  </P> <P> "I was sitting there with a friend and the kids and all of a sudden the room  was full of flames," said Brenda Walker, 28, who carried her month-old son to  safety. Walker's feet were singed as she ran across the burning floor. Her baby  suffered from minor smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> Terrell Mullen, the 12-year-old who suffered second- and third-degree burns on  his face, back and hands, ran out of the burning house screaming, "I'm on  fire!" said Elijah Walker Jr., 31, a brother of the boy and of Brenda Walker.  </P> <P> The older brother covered the boy with a blanket to extinguish the fire before  entering the burning house to lead the others to safety. A family friend, J.C.  Holland, who was visiting Brenda Walker at the time of the bombing, assisted  Walker.  </P> <P> "All I heard was a big bang and then all you could see was flames," Holland  said. "Everything happened so fast."  </P> <P> "If it wasn't for Elijah, we all would have died," Brenda Walker said.  </P> <P> Mullen, a sixth-grader at Lennox Middle School, was in stable condition  Thursday at the burn center at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, while three  other children, who range in age from 3 to 7, were treated and released at area  hospitals for minor burns.  </P> <P> Fire officials said they discovered a flammable liquid and pieces of glass at  the scene, indicating that a homemade firebomb was the cause of the blaze. They  estimated that the small single-family home, one of three residences on the lot  that house Walker family members, suffered $35,000 damage.  </P> <P> Inglewood Fire Battalion Chief Kenneth Mays, who called the family "lucky to be  alive," said arson investigators are approaching the incident as an attempted  murder.  </P> <P> Witnesses told investigators they saw four men in their early 20s wearing white  T-shirts running from the home shortly after the 10:30 p.m. blaze, Mays said.  The men threw as many as four fire bombs at the house and then fled without  saying a word, witnesses said.  </P> <P> "We have more evidence than we usually do for an arson investigation, so I'm  optimistic that we'll catch the suspects," Mays said.  </P> <P> Mays said the motive for the attack was unknown and there did not appear to be  any gang connection.  </P> <P> Brenda Walker and other family members said they had no idea who could have  orchestrated such an attack.  </P> <P> "Everybody likes me around here," Walker said Thursday as she surveyed the  gutted house. "I just think they got the wrong house . . . but I'm moving  anyway. It seems like somebody is trying to kill me."  </P></p>

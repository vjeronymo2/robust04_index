			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Avon improves to Dollars 137m on modest sales increase AVON Products, one of the world's biggest manufacturers of cosmetics and toiletries, yesterday unveiled an 8 per cent improvement in 1991 operating earnings on sales which rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.59bn. Net income for the three months ended December 21 rose 5 per cent to Dollars 92.6m from Dollars 88m a year earlier on flat sales of Dollars 1.23bn. Earnings per share grew 10 per cent to Dollars 1.29 from Dollars 1.17, thanks to fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter. For the year, Avon earned Dollars 135.7m or Dollars 1.89, including a one-time non-cash charge of Dollars 75m in the third quarter for discontinued operations. In 1990, Avon earned Dollars 195.3m or Dollars 2.60 a share. Income from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to Dollars 210.7m in the year and 5 per cent to Dollars 92.6m in the fourth quarter of 1991. Avon's US operations came under pressure from restrained consumer spending in the second half of last year. Softer domestic sales depressed Avon's US pre-tax income in the fourth quarter, which fell 3 per cent. This was partly off-set by the company's performance overseas, where pre-tax earnings rose 1 per cent on flat sales. More than half of Avon's sales and earnings come from foreign business. The company said a dismal US market for luxury goods cut into earnings and sales of its up-market Giorgio fragrance subsidiary, which had sharply lower pre-tax profits for the full year. Avon reduced debt to Dollars 354m in 1991 from Dollars 542m in 1990.</p>

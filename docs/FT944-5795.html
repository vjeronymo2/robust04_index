			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): What do they mean by that? - The management buy-out specialists speak a jargon that is peculiar to its industry but impenetrable to the outsider. Richard Gourlay offers a helping hand to management teams seeking membership to the club Bimbo: a deal involving existing managers with outsiders who have brought the deal to venture capitalists or who are brought in by the financiers. It stands for buy-in/management buy-out. An option increasingly favoured by venture backers. Bought deal: When a deal-maker provides all the finance for a buy-out deal, and then sells on or syndicates part of the funding to other investors later. Done by the larger providers of finance when speed is important for the deal to succeed. Bridge financing: short-term funding provided when a company is about to raise a new round of equity, or is about to go public. Caps, collars and cylinders: clauses in buy-out deals which limit the extent to which the interest rate charged on borrowed funds can rise or fall. They act as a safeguard against borrowing costs rising to the point where the company's cash flow is stretched too far. Deal flow: the rate at which investment propositions come to the deal-maker or financier. It is difficult to find any financiers who have anything but a 'very good deal flow at the moment'. The real test is the number of deals that deserve finance. Development capital: finance supplied to established companies which are profitable or nearly profitable and require capital to develop further, probably to a stage where they will be able to provide a flotation or other exit for their investors. Due diligence: detailed analysis and appraisal of the background of the entrepreneur and his business plan, often carried out in conjunction with accounting firms. Earn out: either a formula for relating the final purchase price of a company to actual future earnings, or a means of encouraging management to perform by payment on the basis of future performance. Employee buy-out: a deal involving a large proportion of employees in an organisation as well as its management. Employee share ownership plan (Esop): a trust which is established to acquire shares in a company for subsequent allocation to employees over a number of years. Exit: the point at which the financier sells his holding in the buy-out company, either through a trade sale to a larger company, by the management buying out the other investors to assume complete control, or by a flotation. Gearing, or leverage: the ratio of debt to equity in a company's capital structure. Intermediate forms of capital, such as redeemable preference shares and convertible loans, are generally regarded as debt for gearing purposes, though they very quickly look like equity if the business goes wrong. Hands on/hands off: the degree to which an investor in a buy-out becomes involved in its management. A hands-on investor would normally nominate a non-executive director to the board. Hands-off investors would have little involvement. Internal rate of return (IRR): different investors calculate this in different ways, but the term generally refers to annual compound rate of return to the investor over a given period. Returns normally include dividend distributions and profits from either disposals or a fair valuation of the buy-out company. Used as targets for investors, actual rates of return usually fall wildly short or greatly exceed initial projections. Junior debt: unsecured loans which rank after secured or senior debt for repayment in the event of a default (see senior debt). Junk bonds: high yielding, unsecured debt used in US buy-outs. In the form of a bond certificate, junk can be bought and sold more easily than the mezzanine loans used to finance UK buy-outs. Lead investor: venture capitalist (VC) that won the mandate for the deal and leads any large syndication. The lead investor does not necessarily take the largest stake. Lemons and plums: Bad deals and good. A retrospective assessment - no deal ever started as anything but a plum. Leveraged buy-out: similar to a management buy-out, though usually applied to US deals where the transaction will have been initiated by a financial group rather than by management. Increasingly deals are initiated in the UK by financiers. Living dead: a VC-backed business that is neither dead on its feet nor going anywhere very fast. The backers are usually locked in with no exit and little option but to watch the actual IRRs sink. Tend not to make it into VC's corporate brochures. Lock-out agreement: an agreement to give the buy-out team time to negotiate the purchase of their company free of pressure from other bidders. Management buy-in: an offshoot of the MBO industry. The purchase of a business by one or more outside managers with the help of a group of financial backers. Pure buy-ins are often riskier than pure buy-outs, because they involve outside management, but buy-ins, management buy-outs (Bimbos), are increasingly popular. Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its management with the help of financial backers. The managers put up a relatively small amount of the finance but gain a disproportionately large share of the equity. Mezzanine finance: loans, usually unsecured, which rank after secured or senior debt but before equity in the event of the company failing. To compensate for the greater risk, they typically carry interest one to three percentage points above secured loans, and an equity 'kicker' to give the lender a stake in the equity. Preferred ordinary shares: refers to the ordinary shares taken up by outside investors in a buy-out. They rank ahead of the plain ordinary shares owned by management in terms of dividends and the pay-out in the event of a winding-up. Ratchet: an incentive arrangement whereby managers get a bigger share of the equity if the venture performs well. These can work the other way, with managers' shares of the equity disappearing towards the venture backers. Second-round financing: sometimes needed to help buy-outs which have run short of funds. Usually leave the company in a weak negotiating position. Senior debt: secured debt which ranks first in terms of repayments in the event of a default (see also junior debt). Syndicated investment: an investment which is too large and risky to be handled by one investor and which needs to be shared among several partners. Vendor finance: finance provided by the vendor in the form of either a deferred payment or a retained minority stake in the bought-out company.</p>

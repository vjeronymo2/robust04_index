			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Wage inflation at lowest rate for 25 years WAGE INFLATION, as measured by the underlying increase in seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, decelerated sharply to 6 per cent in the year to June, the lowest such rate for 25 years. Because manufacturing productivity advanced strongly in the three months to June, the growth of wages and salaries per unit of output also declined, bringing the rate of increase in British manufacturing unit wage costs to their lowest level since October 1987. Figures released yesterday by the Department of Employment showed that the underlying annual increase in UK average earnings has fallen by 1.5 percentage points from 7.5 per cent in March, a rate of decline last seen in 1981. Officials expect the rate of wage inflation will continue to fall following a recent spate of settlements in the 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent range. The June average earnings increase was lower than most forecasts and accompanied a downward revision in the rate of increase in May to 6.25 per cent from 6.5 per cent announced last month. The Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body, reported yesterday that average earnings growth would be even lower than 6 per cent if public-sector wage inflation were not running at a high 7.3 per cent rate. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday's unit wage cost figures showed that the competitiveness of the UK economy continued to improve. In the three months to the end of June manufacturing unit wage costs were 1.7 per cent up on the same period last year, compared with 4.5 per cent in the three months to March. Productivity, although higher in June, grew less strongly than in May. Manufacturing output per head in June was 3.4 per cent higher than in June last year compared with year-on-year growth of 4.2 per cent in May. Manufacturing productivity in the second quarter was 4.2 per cent higher than in 1991, however, compared with a year-on-year increase of 3.9 per cent in the first quarter. According to Employment Department officials overtime earnings account for between 0.5 and 0.75 percentage points of average earnings growth. The latest statistics, however, showed a sharp drop in overtime working in manufacturing to 9.95m hours a week in June from 11.26m in May. The hours lost by short-time working increased to 640,000 a week from 350,000, resulting in a fall in the index of average weekly hours worked in UK manufacturing to 99.6 in June from 101 in May. Only 25,000 working days were lost through industrial disputes in June, bringing to 546,000 the number of working days lost through industrial action in the 12 months to mid 1992. This was the lowest total since 1920.</p>

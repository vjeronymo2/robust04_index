			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Bundesbank rules out changes to EMS THE BUNDESBANK yesterday ruled out modification of the European Monetary System despite the recent turmoil in the currency markets. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, in a speech due to be delivered in Gravenbruch, near Frankfurt, argued that the anchor of the EMS must remain a strong D-Mark, and any attempt to soften the EMS parameters or to relax the commitment to stability at the heart of the system would be counter-productive. The text of the speech was released to the press earlier yesterday. He added that 'recent events in the EMS have done some good. They have drawn aside a veil and revealed the realities of the situation.' Mr Tietmeyer's remarks appeared to be directed at EC members, principally Britain, who have been calling for reform of the EMS. Although Britain has been the most direct in its calls for reform, Mr John Major, the prime minister, under pressure from other EC countries, has indicated that the UK will delay pressing for EMS changes. Mr Tietmeyer said industrial countries were suffering the economic consequences of expansionary monetary policy in the second half of the 1980s. With this in mind, it would be irresponsible for Germany to abandon its anti-inflation policies now, he argued. Mr Tietmeyer, who takes over from Mr Helmut Schlesinger as the president of the German central bank in the summer of next year, rebutted suggestions that the currency market turbulence was the Bundesbank's fault. 'Some people talk about the collapse of the EMS, and in parts of the foreign press the blame is laid on 'arrogant' or at least 'egotistical' Germans,' he said, 'especially on the allegedly one-sided policies of the Bundesbank.' He argued that the real reason for the turbulence of recent weeks was that exchange rate structures had become unrealistic because of economic divergencies. This had been recognised by the serious foreign press, he said. The heavy burden of monetary policy in Germany had contributed to the tensions within the EMS, but the deciding factor was economic misalignment. It would have been better for the system and its credibility if the rules permitting realignment had been brought to bear earlier. He said it would take some time for the emotions stirred up recently to subside, since the emotional disturbance reflected 'disappointed illusions'. UK proposes relaunch to save treaty, Page 3 Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday made clear that he sees ratification of the Maastricht treaty as a vital first step to allow rapid enlargement of the European Community. At a meeting of business leaders near Bonn, he denied any intention of marginalising any member of the EC, rejected the idea of a two-speed or three-speed Europe, but insisted that the Community could not move at the pace of its 'slowest ship'. He insisted that Maastricht provided 'a secure basis for stability of the future European currency', and opposed dilution of entrance criteria for economic and monetary union.</p>

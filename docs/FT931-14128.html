			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The myth of Britain's decline Is there no limit to the British passion for self-denigration? Newspapers and magazines are filled with articles lamenting - or revelling in - the breakdown of national institutions, the demise of traditional British virtues and the weakening of the economy. After a false dawn in the 1980s, some commentators are delighted to report, Britain has regained its reputation as the sick man of Europe. This mood, spread by a coalition of frustrated anti-Thatcherites on the left and nostalgic conservatives on the right, is dangerous. By encouraging the belief in an all-encompassing British decline, it distracts attention from the piecemeal attack on specific problems which are neither insuperable in themselves nor substantially different in character and severity from those that afflict other countries. The media establishment (far more powerful than the old 'establishment' which is said to rule our lives) trots out the usual culprits - class system, public schools, anti-industrial culture and so on. Most of these gloomy diagnoses are linked, directly or indirectly, to a sense of disappointment, even despair, over Britain's economic performance since the second world war. But is this despair really justified? An understanding of Britain's postwar record is not helped by the tendency, perhaps reflecting wartime successes, to overstate the country's competitive strengths in the 1940s and 1950s. There is a widespread view that Britain, mainly through the ineptitude of businessmen, threw away opportunities for industrial leadership after the war. But it is quite unrealistic to suppose that, in the trading environment which prevailed from the 1950s and 1960s onwards, Britain could have retained industrial leadership, except in one or two sectors where domestic conditions were particularly favourable. The liberalisation of world trade posed problems of adjustment for Britain, as it did for the other advanced industrial nations. As a medium-sized industrial power Britain had to find a place in an integrated world economy in which other nations - the US and Japan in some fields, the newly industrialising countries in others - had important competitive advantages. Britain faced a number of particular obstacles in making this transition, some stemming from the legacy of the industrial revolution (outdated structures and institutions in older industries such as textiles and steel), some from post-war events (the sellers' market of 1945-51, the orientation to the Commonwealth, delayed entry into the Common Market). These and other factors made it more difficult for Britain to grow as fast as its continental neighbours in the 1950s and 1960s. It might have been better if Britain had resigned itself to slower but steadier expansion during that period, instead of trying to kick-start the economy and then, after the dash for growth had fizzled out, looking for scapegoats to explain its failure. From the early 1960s, when the habit of national self-denigration began to take hold, the search for scapegoats - and for miracle cures borrowed from other countries - has been a recurring theme in British economic comment. Viewed from today's perspective, the industrial adjustment which has taken place since 1960 can be seen as neither brilliant nor catastrophic, but a patchy outcome not hugely different from that of, say, France. Compared with the continental countries, Britain did less well in the earlier post-war period, with governments and industries fumbling for a way round the obstacles, but more respectably since the late 1970s, as companies responded to intense international competition and took advantage of the Thatcher government's reforms. None of this justifies complacency over the productivity lag which persists in many industries, or over the loss of capacity resulting from the earlier period of floundering, followed by two severe recessions. But it is not helpful to regard these problems, and more generally the serious economic difficulties which the country now faces, as symptoms of some deep-seated flaw in the system which, almost by definition, is irremediable. Constructive self-criticism is welcome, as are practical proposals for dealing with individual ailments. Exaggerated gloom about all things British is unnecessary and counter-productive.

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: General of the assembly - Klaus Hansch Mr Klaus Hansch, the new president of the European Parliament, has made a brisk start: his aim is to establish the assembly as a more powerful and more credible force in the European Union. Late last week, the parliament forced a delay in the investiture of the new Commission, due to take office on January 7, until (probably) late January. Under the Maastricht treaty, the parliament has the power to endorse or reject the entire Commission. Mr Hansch argued that parliamentarians from those states due to join the Union on January 1 - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden - must take part in the parliament's vote if their commissioners are part of the new Brussels executive. 'We must have a parliament of 16 voting on a Commission of 16,' said a senior aide to Mr Hansch. A no-nonsense German Social Democrat, Mr Hansch's ambition is clear. He wants the Strasbourg assembly to have rights in EU decisions almost equal to the Council of Ministers. This would give him a weight nearly equal to the president of the Commission, which proposes EU laws. Already there are those in Brussels who sense that Mr Hansch could become a front-rank Euro-player, particularly once presidency of the Commission has fallen from Mr Jacques Delors, a powerful proponent of EU integration, to the untested Mr Jacques Santer from Luxembourg. Leading member states, moreover, are keen to clip Brussels' wings, while Germany wants to enhance Strasbourg's powers in the course of the 1996 constitutional review of the Maastricht treaty. With this moderately fair wind behind it, the parliament has, under Mr Hansch, already seized an additional right to individual, public vetting of appointees to the Commission - by threatening not to put the endorsement of the entire Commission on its agenda. It now plans US Senate-style confirmation hearings on the 21 new commissioners. At the centre of Mr Hansch's programme is an appeal to democratic legitimacy. 'He is a conviction politician,' the aide says, as well as a pragmatic, procedurally-versed veteran who entered the parliament when it was first directly elected in 1979. Close collaborators describe him as on the right of the German Social Democratic party, in the mould of Mr Helmut Schmidt, former German chancellor. Mr Hansch says he wants 'to concentrate on legislative work and the most important priorities' and leave aside issues the parliament cannot influence, such as EU policy on Bosnia. The central idea is not an indiscriminate grab for more power but ensuring what he calls 'double legitimacy'. Euro MPs should vote on decisions which national assemblies have not examined, because they are taken without parliamentary debate by ministers, or, more frequently, by their officials meeting behind closed doors in Brussels. This is not a zero-sum competition with national legislatures, he insists, but an attempt 'to obtain control over European policy-making, to do what national parliaments can not do'. He is formalising joint committees of European and national MPs to strengthen the role of elected lawmakers in EU decision-making processes and to correct an imbalance which favours the executive.  'I don't see (national parliaments) as rivals; I see them as partners,' he says. Europe's parliament 'must have full rights of co-decision' in all laws where the Council of Ministers can reach a decision by majority voting, he argues. Maastricht partially gave the Strasbourg assembly this right of veto over the Council, but excluded a number of areas such as environmental and transport policy. Mr Hansch would not extend the parliament's blocking rights into areas in which Council decisions must be unanimous, such as on treaty, tax or nearly all foreign policy questions. But 'where governments can be outvoted, all legislation needs to be legitimised twice,' argues Mr Hansch. 'If there is no consensus' between the European Parliament and Council, he says bluntly, 'then there will be no law'. Euro-MPs have so far twice vetoed the Council, most recently over a voice telephony law, on which the issue was not proposed liberalisation but the assembly's right to detailed and early consultation on it. Yet Mr Hansch is wary of too much inter-institutional muscle-flexing. 'We have to be able to explain that there is real public interest and therefore to choose very carefully' before saying No, he cautions. He is concerned by public perception of the European Parliament as an inefficient gravy train, and intends to keep a tight rein internally. MEPs' expenses, and penchant for needless foreign travel, have been trimmed. 'The Bali express is off his agenda,' quips one European Parliament official. More quietly and importantly, Mr Hansch is insisting votes on laws take place shortly after the plenary in which they were debated, and that debates be structured so that commissioners and ministers can be scheduled to attend them and be held to account. Since September, the Commission president has attended a regular question-time. These are fairly obvious reforms, but no previous parliament leader got close to achieving them. In Commission confirmation hearings, says Mr Hansch, 'we will demonstrate that we can have a proper debate at the (parliamentary) committee appropriate to that commissioner'. He warns that 'we may find the competence and attitudes of one or two commissioners so unacceptable that we have to vote (the whole Commission) down' - but he thinks this improbable. Use of such a nuclear weapon would be uncharacteristic of a man who above all wants clear, efficient decisions, comprehensible to citizens mistrustful of Europe. The prize, and his self-appointed task, is to bring the European Parliament to the 1996 Maastricht review as an equal partner, achieved on the basis of its record, which neither Brussels nor the member states could any longer think of ignoring.</p>

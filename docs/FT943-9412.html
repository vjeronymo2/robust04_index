			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / No longer the faithful followers of the family: Hugh Carnegy finds Swedish institutions getting tough The snub dealt this week by Swedish institutions to Charter, the UK industrial group, over its bid for Esab, the world's leading supplier of welding equipment, was a strong reminder that minority shareholders in Sweden are no longer content to play the role of faithful followers to big owners such as the Wallenberg family. The rejection by five institutions of a Pounds 260m bid, recommended by the Esab board, carried echoes of the shareholder revolt which last December blocked the merger between Volvo and France's Renault - to date the most spectacular flexing of Swedish institutional muscle. This week it was the turn of the Wallenberg empire to suffer an institutional rebuff - albeit a much less violent one. Esab has been controlled by the Wallenbergs through the industrial group Incentive. In June, Incentive accepted Charter's offer of SKr345 per share for its near 50 per cent stake with alacrity to help pay for its SKr8.4bn (Pounds 700m) takeover of Cardo, an industrial investment offshoot of Volvo. But Esab's share price then shot up, wiping out the 20 per cent premium in Charter's offer. When Esab's strong half-year results sent the share price even higher this week, institutional shareholders decided the bid was underpriced. Incentive and Charter, on the other hand, still insist that the offer is fair. It was not the first time this year that institutions have held out against Incentive. In June, three Cardo shareholders objected to the original terms for the Incentive takeover of shares not held by Volvo and won a revision of the bid. A non-Swedish investment banker involved in the Volvo-Renault negotiations says the days of 'sweetheart deals done in the sauna - and never mind the other shareholders' are over. 'You have to demonstrate to shareholders that you have done everything right.' Analysts in Stockholm say the Wallenbergs have taken this on board. It would no longer be possible to push through a deal like that in 1991, when they shifted Incentive out of Asea, forcing minority shareholders to accept a dilution of their stake in the half-owner of the Swedish-Swiss combine Asea Brown Boveri. In Charter's case, the UK company appears to have miscalculated the extent to which Swedish institutions now defend their interests. Having reached agreement with the Esab board and Incentive, Charter executives proclaimed that the rising Esab share price - usually on low volumes - was nothing more than a brazen attempt to squeeze more out of the bidder. When Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chief executive, and colleagues arrived in Stockholm on Tuesday, they were met by a series of public announcements of bid rejections. This snookered Charter, which needed 90 per cent acceptances. Undoubtedly, a perception among the shareholders that Charter was behaving arrogantly did not help. This, and a trade union campaign portraying Charter as an unwelcome foreign predator, was also reminiscent of the more hysterical moments in the Volvo-Renault affair. The institutions insist their objections lie simply in the bid price. In the case of the Renault merger, the institutions did have strategic objections to the plan to shift Volvo's core car and truck making operations under the wing of a state-owned French company. 'Since then the consciousness of the ownership role we play has risen substantially,' said a senior institutional shareholder. But the new-found assertiveness of the institutions has mainly applied to deal terms, rather than seeking real influence over corporate strategy. The power exercised by the Wallenbergs over their companies - often through less than majority stakes - has not been seriously challenged.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE RECALCITRANT SHAREHOLDERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Shareholder                                         Percentage of Esab                                                         voting capital  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4th General Pension Fund                                           6.2 Wasa Insurance                                                     4.7 Foreningsbanken                                                    4.0 Skandia Insurance                                                 2.55 Kammarkollegiet (state investment fund)                            2.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

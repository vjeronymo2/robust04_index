			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Following the debacle at the  extraordinary meeting of the republican leadership of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] on Saturday [12  February], journalists were addressed in Bratislava today by  Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac, Foreign Minister Jozef  Moravcik, and HZDS deputy Vladimir Bajan. Our correspondent  Renata Havranova, editor of the daily PRACE, reports.    [Havranova] Both Kovac and Moravcik rejected Meciar's  accusation of cowardice and an attempt to break up the HZDS  behind his back. The prime minister's claim that they betrayed  him by assuring him of their loyalty before bringing in the  Alternative of Political Realism is untrue.    On the contrary, Kovac stressed that he spent three and a  half hours explaining to Meciar where the causes for the  differing views rested. Moravcik added that loyalty is  irrelevant in the process of solving a serious political crisis.  Both of them rejected the possibility of resigning and said  that their resignation would amount to admitting mistakes. But  they naturally reckon that they will be dismissed.    They said that the proposal that they should be expelled  from  the HZDS was a poor indication of the democracy existing in the  movement, which meant to represent the freedom of thought. The  verdict that they breached the [HZDS] charter is also  unsubstantiated. They did not organize the Alternative as a  faction because the charter bans factions. Deputy Bajan said  that, in order to determine what the next action in parliament  will be, he would have to establish what was happening to the  deputies who support the Alternative before and after the  leadership meeting. What he probably meant were the  so-far-unconfirmed reports that some of them--for example,  Deputies [Martin] Zingor and [Anna] Draxlerova--were even  threatened with physical violence.    Speaking about the government of broad coalition without top  political leaders, they said that, no matter how absurd this  idea appeared to be, the opposition accepted it and that this  trend would continue in Slovakia. The government posts should  be filled with real pragmatists, even unaffiliated ones, capable  of bringing stability to Slovakia. All of them said that early  elections were the best possible solution to the situation that  has arisen. The solution they proposed has only speeded up the  whole process of sorting out the problems in society. According  to Kovac and Moravcik, expectations that the government might be  dismissed as early as 16 February, at the parliament's session,  appear to be unrealistic for the time being.</p>

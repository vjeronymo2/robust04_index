			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Starmin to fight legal claim of Pounds 500,000 STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, is facing a legal claim of more than Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office from its former chief executive. Mr Osman Abdullah, whose resignation from the Pounds 160,000-a-year executive post was announced a month before the company said pre-tax losses were millions of pounds deeper than previously published, holds a stake of almost 6 per cent in the company. 'I have to protect myself. One should not confuse my shareholding, my shares in the company as opposed to my personal situation within the company', he said. Starmin said it would 'strenuously resist' the claim: 'We believe the claim is more than adequately provided for and we are confident that it will not be successful.' Mr Abdullah's two brothers hold equal stakes. One of them, Raschid, also resigned as an executive in July but was recently reappointed as a non-executive director of Starmin. The resignations by the brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates company, coincided with Starmin's announcement of a review of accounting policies which led to the company rescinding its dividend and announcing 1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m. Starmin said at the time that there was no suggestion of fraud.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Power generators under attack NATIONAL POWER and PowerGen will be unable to maintain dividend growth in the mid-1990s, according to a report published by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker. The report is one of the harshest attacks on the two electricity generators since their privatisation last March. BZW forecasts pre-tax profits of only Pounds 250m for National Power by the year ending March 1994, compared with Pounds 500m for the 12 months to March 1992. For PowerGen, the brokers anticipate a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 170m over the same period. The report expects earnings per share for both companies to almost halve over the two years, and dividends to decline from 9p to 7.2p at National Power and from 9.2p to 7.7p at PowerGen. BZW believes the main reason for the squeeze on profits will be increased competition and tighter regulation in the mid-1990s and says shares in both companies should be sold. 'The shares do not reflect the possible length or depth of a profits downturn from 1994,' BZW warns. The stockbroker believes both companies' shares are overvalued by a third relative to the market. The generators face the threat of an oversupplied market as new generators come on stream in the mid-1990s. Although they are currently protected by contracts to sell electricity put into place at privatisation, these will expire in March 1993. Then, BZW forecasts, the market will be oversupplied and returns will fall. A second threat is Offer, the electricity watchdog. 'Offer is intent on realising the benefits of competition in generation,' BZW says. The stockbrokers expect Offer to be tougher than investors anticipate, and prevent the generators from artificially boosting electricity prices by closing power stations to tighten supply. Offer will force the generators to offer these stations to their competitors, BZW believes. National Power/PowerGen: Profits Under Pressure, BZW Research.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Defence chief quits as affair is alleged Air Marshal Sir Peter Harding, chief of the Defence Staff, resigned last night after a newspaper alleged that he was having an affair with the former wife of a retired Conservative politician, Robert Corzine and Philip Stephens write. A Ministry of Defence statement said that Sir Peter had tendered his resignation with immediate effect and that Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, had accepted it. The News of the World alleged there had been an affair between Sir Peter and Lady Bienvenida Buck, ex-wife of Sir Anthony Buck, a former navy minister. Their marriage broke up last year. Sir Peter Inge, the army chief of staff and the most senior of the three service chiefs, becomes temporary chief of the Defence Staff. He will stay in the post until a permanent successor is appointed by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The resignation, which came within hours of the revelations about Sir Peter's private life, was in line with the much tougher line on personal conduct ordered by Mr Major after a spate of ministerial scandals earlier this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Beware, </F> There Are Those Who Wish To Disrupt and Gut the Hong Kong  Economy"]    [Text] My Brothers,    Li Ruihuan, chairman of National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), when  visiting CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao on 16 March,  said that we should beware of the colonialists who, while  creating chaos in politics, conduct secretive dealings with  "modern packaging" or "modernized means" to disrupt and gut the  Hong Kong economy and leave a heavy financial load on the future  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong  compatriots.    This is a timely and important reminder. His reminder  acutely lays bare an important move of the British colonialists  before they withdraw from Hong Kong, and their intentions.    You may remember that in October 1989 the British Hong Kong  Government put forward a plan entitled the "Port and Airport  Development Strategy," which was then estimated to cost 127  billion Hong Kong dollars. In addition to this, it also engaged  in a package of large-scale capital construction projects, which  will go beyond 1997, such as a drainage project, reform of road  networks, a railway development program, and so on, whereas the  British Hong Kong Government had just over 50 billion Hong Kong  dollars in its financial reserves at that time.    In managing their finances, the British Hong Kong Government  has also changed their usual practice, putting aside its  long-standing policy of a balanced budget and practicing a  deficit budget, i.e., draining the pond to get all the fish.    Hong Kong citizens are deeply worried about this, fearing  that this will exhaust the financial reserves of Hong Kong and  lead to intensified inflation.    The Chinese Government, thinking of the present and  long-term  interests of the 6 million countrymen in Hong Kong and of the  future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, has advised the  British Hong Kong Government several times in different ways.  As early as 1990, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said the  British Hong Kong Government must not do the trick of "you give  a dinner party and I pay for it," spending lots and lots of  money now but leaving a heavy burden to the future SAR  Government and adding to the burden of Hong Kong people.  Concerning the fiscal policy of the British Hong Kong  Government, Jiang said that the policy of "spending no more than  what one gets" should also be adhered to.    Especially on the issue of the new airport, the Chinese  Government upholds the Hong Kong people's interests according to  reason. The Chinese Government has made its position clear:  Hong Kong needs a new airport, but the construction of a new  airport should be in conformity with the principle of "low cost  and high efficiency." But the British Hong Kong Government has  ignored this, and has even raised the cost of the new airport a  great deal after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding.  The construction of the airport and its railway will be mainly  paid for with a huge loan of 70 billion Hong Kong dollars, and  the loan is not due for repayment until after the setting up of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997, thus  leaving a heavy economic burden on the SAR Government.    In fact, the new airport will not be ready for use until  seven or eight years later, and the British cannot wait for that  day. So why do they show such enthusiasm for the construction?  We can learn something from the fact that the British Hong Kong  Government has given most contracts for project consultation and  major contracts to British-funded companies who charge higher  fees. The truth is that, on the one hand, they are trying to  use the construction of the new airport and other projects to  spend all of the financial reserves -- and even use the revenue  of the future Special Administrative Region Government -- and,  on the other hand, using various "modern packagings," they are  putting as much money as possible into the pockets of British  businessmen. This money is the blood and sweat of the Hong Kong  people!    Colonialists have their own gangster logic. Out-and-out  invasion is claimed as help, and out-and-out plunder is claimed  as charity. The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong today  should be owed to the efforts of Hong Kong countrymen, to the  backing of the whole Chinese nation. But the British are trying  to make themselves look good. For the past 100 years or so,  they have taken away whatever they could. Who knows how much  they have robbed from Hong Kong! (The income of a Hong Kong  governor is more than that of a British prime minister -- this  is just a minor example.) Is it not clear who has fed whom  after all? Now that it is not long before their withdrawal,  they have begun to move away what they can, take away what they  can, and spend and use up what they cannot with grandiose  pretexts. Some Hong Kong people have already pointed out that  it is easy to see from the newly published "(Draft) Regulations  of the Airport Corporation" that the British Hong Kong  Government intends to keep the new airport away from government  supervision so that they can continue their influence in Hong  Kong by controlling the new airport.    Such behavior has been exposed and criticized by some wise  Hong Kong people, who pointed out that the British, especially  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, have stepped onto a road of  no-return against China, and we should guard against more of  their confrontation and chaos-making tricks in the future in the  way of finances, taxation, public construction, retirement  benefits, civil service system, people's livelihood, and so on.    Following the wind and rain in the transition period of the  past several years, the Hong Kong people now have a stronger  sense of belonging and identity with the motherland. Never  before have they linked their love of the country with their  love of Hong Kong so closely, and never before have they, as  masters of their own affairs, concerned themselves with and  taken part in the social affairs of Hong Kong and protested  against various acts of obstructing Hong Kong's return to China  and sabotaging a stable transition as they are today. More and  more people are coming together for the love of both the country  and Hong Kong. If there are people who, risking universal  condemnation, dare to cause disorder in Hong Kong in an attempt  to gut Hong Kong financially and leave Hong Kong in a mess, they  will definitely be smashed to pieces in the strong deluge of  patriotism and love for Hong Kong.    Sincerely,    [Signed] Bao Xin    [Dated] 19 March</p>

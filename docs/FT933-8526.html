			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Gardening: Eyes have it FEW PUBLIC gardens can boast that the pleasure of a visit begins in the car park. But look in any direction from the hilltop field when you arrive at Mount Ephraim gardens near Faversham, in Kent. You will find none of the disfigurements of the late 20th century: just woods, orchards and parkland. Owned by the Dawes family, which has lived there for 300 years, the gardens owe their layout to enlargements early this century. Begin by walking down the daisy-strewn slope beside the rock garden. Once overgrown by nettles and brambles, the area now has flowering shrubs, dwarf conifers, alpines and bulbs. A great bank of purple sage and a stone Japanese lantern shades the first of a series of small pools descending towards a small lake. At the bottom of the water garden is the Japanese Bridge - a photographer's dream. Beyond is a pleasant woodland area of mature trees underplanted with rhododendrons and azaleas. You emerge into meadows rising towards the house. A series of formal terraces and a tennis court evoke theatrical incarnations of the English country manor. Mount Ephraim offers no permanent attractions for children, apart from acres of space to run around in. Nor are there any bijou shops stocked with pot pourri, although you can buy the local wine and there is a small craft centre in the stable block. Specialists may find the gardens rather short on botanical labelling, but you would be hard pressed to find anywhere with such a welcoming and tranquil atmosphere barely 50 miles from London. Mount Ephraim Gardens, Hernhill, near Faversham, Kent. Open daily until end-September 11am to 6pm.</p>

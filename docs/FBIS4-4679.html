			<p>BFN     [Text] NEC Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., and Fujitsu Ltd. are  to begin developing technology for next-generation information  networks, which can send data to distant areas at  superhigh-speed, in cooperation with an auxiliary organization,  which falls under the jurisdiction of both the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]. They recently inaugurated a  research and development company to develop combined technology  for computers and communications and to build up by fiscal 1998  an information transmitting system needed for establishing the  basis of future information communications. It is expected that  Japan will promote a program to establish large-scale  information networks similar to the "information superhighway"  planned in the United States. Thus, their collaboration will  set a concrete example of cooperation between the private sector  and the government for the program.    The newly established company is named "Superhigh-Speed  Network and Computer Technology Research Institute" [SNCTRI].  The company, whose head office is in Minato-ku, Tokyo, is  capitalized at 30 million yen, 70 percent of which has been  invested by Japan Key Technology Center. The center, which is  an auxiliary organization under the jurisdiction of both MITI  and the MPT, is to give financial support to electronic  communications and machine industries. NEC, Hitachi, and  Fujitsu have invested 10 percent each. NEC Managing Director  Seijiro Yokoyama serves as the president of the new company.  The SNCTRI, which has been given five years to develop new  technology, will increase its capital to 3.5 billion yen by  fiscal 1998, the final year for the development.    Currently, a distributed processing system that uses  personal  computers and work stations to send data is popular in computer  communications. However, the system has a problem--the greater  the distance between two communicating spots, the slower the  data transmission. The SNCTRI is to develop combined technology  for computers and communications networks that makes it possible  to send data to distant areas at a superhigh-speed.    It will also establish protocol (communications procedures)  and develop technology for real time image transmission to make  it possible to send multimedia data composed of images, voice,  and text at a high speed. In fiscal 1998, it plans to develop  technology for transmitting 2.4 gigabytes (1 gigabyte is 10  million bits) of data per second.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURTLES RESCUED FROM COLD OCEAN  </P> <P> Seventy-six cold-stunned sea turtles floating helplessly were plucked Wednesday  from the chilly waters off the Canaveral National Seashore, bringing to 232 the  number of turtles picked up this week. Sixty-one of the turtles have died.  </P> <P> Twenty turtles were en route to Sea World of Florida in Orlando, where 75 were  already recovering in tanks of warm water, park curator Frank Murru said. The  others were to be trucked to Disney World in Orlando.  </P> <P> "Almost all of them are doing very well," Murru said. "They just need to be  warmed up. Quite a few of them are eating already, so that's a good sign."  </P> <P> Murru said that, after they have recovered, the turtles will be tagged and  released.  </P> <P> "(The turtles) do float with their backs up, and they try to get a little air  every now and again, but some of them get so weak they drown," Canaveral refuge  spokesman Bruce Blihovde said. "It's all cold related."  </P> <P> He said the water temperature dropped to about 46 degrees during the recent  cold snap.  </P> <P> "When the water gets around 50 degrees . . . it starts getting stressful for  turtles," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Leif Mills Leif Mills, at 58 the new president of Britain's Trades Union Congress, is also general secretary of the Banking Insurance and Finance Union. He is the first graduate from Balliol College, Oxford, to reach the heights of the TUC and he is proud of that fact. An official of the union since national service, he became general secretary in 1972 and was elected to the TUC general council in 1983. Most union leaders have been kept off public bodies over the past 15 years but not Mills. He sat on the armed forces pay review from 1980 to 1987 and was on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1982 to 1991. A member of Investors in People UK and the council of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, he is currently a trustee of the Civic Trust. Along with a phone and fax, what piece of office equipment would you need on the island? A word processor so I could write a new novel. I have already written one that is unpublished about the TUC Congress called A Week in the life of Smith, Brown and Jones. What would you take to remind yourself of early days in the union? I would take the first copy of our magazine - The Bank Clerk - which I edited. Who would you take with you besides your family? Sir Ranulph Fiennes. I would like to hear about his polar expeditions. What food would you like to eat? Big jars of prawns with mayonnaise. And to drink? A couple of hogs heads of Brakspeare brew, a local Henley beer. What would you take to read? The Worst Journey in The World by Aspley Cherry-Garrard, the story of Scott's expedition to the Antarctic. It would be a useful antidote to the heat of the desert island. But I'm a great Bertie Wooster fan so I would like to take the PG Wodehouse books. A film? Carol Reed's The Third Man with Orson Welles. I know every word of the dialogue. I would also like to take The Hill starring Sean Connery, which is about the military police. I was a second lieutenant in the Royal Military Police when I was doing my national service in Malaya. What would you most like about desert island life? Basking in the sunshine would be wonderful. What would you most miss on the desert island? The opportunity to row every week with my friends in my local rowing club. One item to preserve your sanity? I would love to take a computerised chess-set to play against. It would keep my mind active. One item to ease the strain? A pipe with plenty of Gold Block tobacco. I still find smoking a relaxation. Any regrets? That I just failed to win an Oxford rowing blue.</p>

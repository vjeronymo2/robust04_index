			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIENIEMY HAS BIG DAY AS COLORADO COLLARS GEORGE AND ILLINOIS, 38-7  </P> <P> Tailback Eric Bieniemy rushed for two touchdowns and passed for another to lead  No. 8 Colorado over No. 10 Illinois, 38-7, Saturday.  </P> <P> The Buffaloes (3-0) sacked Illinois quarterback Jeff George four times for 54  yards in losses, intercepted two of his passes, limited him to 99 yards passing  and, finally, sent him to the bench to have his slightly injured left knee  wrapped and braced.  </P> <P> Illinois (1-1) managed just 193 total yards, compared to Colorado's 475.  </P> <P> Illinois got its lone score midway through the first quarter on a two-yard run  by Howard Griffith, which capped an 80-yard drive helped by two pass  interference penalties against Colorado cornerback Dave McCloughan.  </P> <P> The Illini did not cross midfield again until midway through the final quarter.  </P> <P> Bieniemy's one-yard scoring run capped a 75-yard drive to open the game,  highlighted by a 74-yard gain on Darian Hagan's pass to Jeff Campbell.  </P> <P> After Illinois drew to a 7-7 tie, the Buffaloes went 80 yards to take the lead  for good. Bieniemy, from Bishop Amat High School, took a pitchout to the left  side, stopped and threw a 48-yard scoring strike to a wide-open M.J. Nelson  with 3:59 left in the first quarter. Nelson is from Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Moments later, cornerback David Gibbs picked off George's pass and returned it  23 yards to the Illinois 38. After a seven-yard loss on a sack, backup tailback  J.J. Flannigan bolted 45 yards off the right side for a 21-7 lead.  </P> <P> The Buffaloes padded their margin to 24-7 on a 45-yard Ken Culbertson field  goal with 1:55 left in the third period.  </P> <P> Illinois then had a fumble and interception on its next two series, giving  Colorado possession at the 34 and 22. Flannigan went nine yards up the middle  to capitalize on the first turnover, and Bieniemy scored on a four-yard run  after the second.  </P> <P> Illinois' score came after several interruptions because of crowd noise. The  Illini were assessed a delay-of-game penalty on one play after George  repeatedly backed away from center, complaining his teammates couldn't hear the  snap count.  </P> <P> McCloughan's first penalty, worth 15 yards, put the Illini at the six. He was  whistled again after a third-down pass fell incomplete, giving Illinois the  ball at the two and setting up Griffith's score.  </P> <P> Controversy also surrounded Bieniemy's touchdown pass. It was ruled valid only  after a protracted discussion by the officials. One official whistled the  Buffaloes for having an ineligible receiver downfield.  </P> <P> It was decided, however, that Colorado tackle Mark Vander Poel had blocked a  man and then fell forward across the line of scrimmage. But since he did not  regain his feet to throw another block, there was no violation and the flag was  waved off.  </P></p>

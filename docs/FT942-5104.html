			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Ferruzzi's finery goes under the hammer: Auction marks end of an era of corporate extravagance in Italy After the trials, the auctions. Today, in Milan, Sotheby's will begin a three-day sale of paintings, furniture, tapestries and ornaments which adorned the boardrooms, company flats and country residences of Ferruzzi-Montedison, before its industrial empire collapsed last year amid allegations of bribery and fraud. The items belong to the company, now going through painful restructuring, and the sale should raise between L3bn (Pounds 1.2m) and L5bn (Pounds 2.1m), making a tiny dent in the L31,000bn of debt built up at Ferruzzi-Montedison under the chairmanship of the flamboyant Mr Raul Gardini, who committed suicide last year while under investigation. The sale marks the formal end to an era of extravagant Italian corporate spending in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition - in spite of Sotheby's and Ferruzzi's attempts to play down the link - the whiff of scandal is bound to attract a few buyers on the look-out for collectable souvenirs of Italy's Tangentopoli bribery and corruption investigations. It is still only six weeks since Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial intermediary to Ferruzzi-Montedison, was jailed for corruption and false accounting, and less than a month before the trial of top politicians from the discredited old regime, many of them suspected of receiving bribes from the group. In terms of quality, the auction probably has more in common with last year's nine-day auction of items from the Thurn und Taxis estate, which raised DM31.5bn (Pounds 12.6bn) for Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis to pay inheritance taxes, than with recent British auctions of trinkets belonging to Mr Robert Maxwell, the discredited media magnate, and Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. Mr Giuseppe Ceccatelli, managing director of Sotheby's Milan office, says he is hoping for international interest in the top item in the sale, a Roman landscape by the 18th century Flemish-born artist, Jan Frans van Bloemen - guide price: L250m-L350m. On the other hand, he does not try to play down the novelty value of a 19th century games table - a cross between snooker and pin-ball - which Mr Gardini would have used when entertaining at the company's Tuscan hunting lodge. For those unable to stump up its estimated price of up to L40m, there are more modest lots made up of glass from the Ferruzzi-controlled Venini factory, which could sell for as little as L350,000. Patient collectors may yet wait for what could be even more spectacular sales as the Tangentopoli investigations run their course. Last year, for example, police seized 60 paintings, including several modern masterpieces, from the apartment of Mr Duilio Poggiolini, a senior health ministry official alleged to have taken bribes. At the time, the value of the paintings alone was estimated at L5bn. For an Italian art market now in the doldrums, the irony is that it was probably the purchase of such works which helped fuel the buoyancy of the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tripoli, 22 Jun (JANA) -- AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR,  published here today, stressed that many of the hidden aspects  of the so-called Lockerbie issue have begun to emerge, revealing  a number of those painful facts with which the peoples of the  world of delusion in capitalist society live, deceived by dozens  of false capitalist slogans.    In a lengthy article today AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR said that the  so-called Lockerbie incident was from the outset a dirty plan of  the intelligence agencies which was set up with the specific aim  of preoccupying Western public opinion with marginal issues and  distracting it from the harsh and bitter crises which they  experience in their daily life. [passage omitted]    AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR concluded at the end of its commentary  that  Lockerbie revealed that Western governments do not respect the  public opinion of our society and do not value those who  represent bodies, organizations, and humanitarian and legal  organs, and that Western governments trade with their peoples  and use them as a means of achieving their own aims. The  Western governments proved that they are backward, malicious,  and racist toward the peoples of the world and its small states  and that they do not rely on moral values in dealing with  international issues and crises.</p>

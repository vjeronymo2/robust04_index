			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Kovacs, member of the National </F> Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Gabor Lambert;  place and date not given: "We Can Envisage a Coalition-Led  Foreign Ministry"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Lambert] There is really  little difference between the foreign and security policy  programs of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Starting from this premise,  can you envisage a Foreign Ministry leadership in which  coalition factors are asserted?    [Kovacs] I could envisage such a leadership. It is true  that there are no basic differences between the two programs  regarding the main goals, the mentality, the means, or the  style. I can envisage a leadership in the Foreign Ministry in  which one party provides the minister and the other the  political state secretary, although the statements by the MSZP  so far are generally in favor of "one-colour" ministries. My  personal opinion is that in some cases dual leadership is  perhaps more comfortable, namely that the minister and the  political state secretary do not belong to the same party. One  can also envisage a solution in which one party has the position  of minister and the other party the position of chairman of  Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. I know from experience  -- because I have filled this position for the last one and a  half years -- that the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee  also has an opportunity to influence foreign policy.    [Lambert] Looking at the recent past, we can say that the  Foreign Ministry was under the strong influence of the prime  minister. Now, if we start from the premise that Gyula Horn  will be the prime minister, a politician who has serious  diplomatic experience, how will this be reflected in the  leadership of the Foreign Ministry?    [Kovacs] In most countries, the prime minister takes an  active part in shaping and implementing foreign policy. There  are a lot of summit meetings, including NATO meetings, meetings  in the NATO Cooperation Council, meetings between the European  Union and the associate members, the Western European Union, and  the CSCE, meetings in which the prime minister has to  participate. Prime ministerial meetings also represent the  summit in bilateral relations. As for Gyula Horn, he has indeed  spent most of his life in the area of foreign relations. If I  became the head of the Foreign Ministry, this would not be a  problem for me, because I have been working with Gyula Horn  together for many years, and we understand each other well, and  I think we also complement each other. [passage omitted]    [Lambert] The programs of both the SZDSZ and the MSZP carry  the proposal to incorporate the Ministry of International  Economic Relations into the organizational framework of the  Foreign Ministry. What are the chances of such a development now  when increasing exports is one of the major tasks of our  economic policy, and the aforementioned ministry could play a  role in this?    [Kovacs] Actually, in its current form, the Ministry of  International Economic Relations has become obsolete. Foreign  trade is no longer a monopoly and this ministry lost a series of  functions that used to be important in the past. Therefore, I  think it is logical to envisage the incorporation of some of the  tasks of this ministry into a future "economic top ministry,"  and some other tasks into the Industry Ministry and the Trade  Ministry, and the foreign activity should come under the  authority of the Foreign Ministry, as is the case in most  countries. In this case, the current commercial representations  abroad would be incorporated into the respective embassies.    [Lambert] If I am correct, the National Information Office  is already considering a possible halt in its activity. Could  you confirm that this is also an MSZP view?    [Kovacs] The MSZP has not yet examined the situation of  various government offices and government-affiliated offices.  My personal opinion is that the activity carried out by the  National Information Office in recent months only harmed  Hungary's international evaluation, so it is certain that this  body cannot function in its current form and with its current  personnel.    [Lambert] How do you envisage the contacts with the  Hungarians living beyond our borders?    [Kovacs] Support for the Hungarians living beyond our  borders in their endeavor to receive constitutional and legal  guarantees for their rights is one of the major directions of  activity in the foreign policy concepts of the MSZP. Thus, it  is absolutely natural that the government must be ready for  close cooperation. We must, however, develop these contacts  without discrimination, namely with all the legitimate  organizations of Hungarians in Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania,  Serbia, Vojvodina, Croatia, and Slovenia, and not only with  parties, trends, and personalities that are politically and  ideologically close to the Hungarian government. Unfortunately,  this has been the practice in the past four years. [passage  omitted]    [Lambert] As chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee, you repeatedly criticized the Foreign Ministry for  failing to provide sufficient information about the diplomatic  steps under consideration. From your own experience, how do you  envisage future parliamentary control over the Foreign Ministry?    [Kovacs] I have indeed criticized relations between the  Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Committee, but I also  recognized the fact that these relations have steadily improved  in the past four years, as we have learned the laws of a  multiparty parliamentary democracy, both government party  members and opposition members. We had to learn what it means  to be a government party member and an opposition member and how  to tolerate each other's situation and views to a certain  extent. In view of these experiences, I believe things will  work better in the next parliamentary cycle, because the MSZP  and the SZDSZ -- the two parties that will now form a government  coalition -- have opposition experience, and the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP] -- parties that will now be in the opposition --  also have governing experience. Therefore, we have a mutually  better understanding of each other's situation. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Building up a core of expertise - Case study of The large company For British Steel , the problem of responding to the new VAT regulations hinged on the scattered nature of its operations. The group had been formed from 14 separate companies, all operating independently and frequently with incompatible data collection systems. Group VAT returns are at present compiled from 31 separate 'manual' returns. With more than a quarter of British Steel's Pounds 4.6bn annual sales made to other Community members and significant volumes of raw materials and other goods coming in from continental Europe, the company clearly faced considerable changes. British Steel had a choice, explains Harvey Collyer, a manager closely involved in the project. It could get each of its operating units to provide the VAT data to Customs &amp; Excise or, alternatively, it could centralise data collection. The latter approach had its attractions but the company had never before had a central commercial data base. Despite this, British Steel opted for a centralised approach because this would allow it to build up a core of expertise in single market issues while the head office experience of VAT matters could be applied to any problems which arose. It would avoid individual businesses putting different interpretations on the reporting requirements. In addition, the company would have to maintain only one system to process data for single market requirements and if changes were made in the reporting requirements, there would only be the need to make one set of amendments to the system. Once the decision had been taken to introduce a central system, British Steel discovered other benefits, says Collyer. Not only would the information be more accurate, it would also be more timely because by avoiding the need to cross-check the data, it could set a later cut-off date. Delivery information required from national producers under early EC legislation could be provided centrally and a corporate commercial data base could be set up. Responding to the new VAT regulations has produced some valuable and unexpected benefits but it has also thrown up some tricky administrative problems. The two main ones have been obtaining the VAT numbers from its European customers and deciding on a uniform method of allocating a tariff number, which identifies a product for customs' purposes, to its purchases. At present British Steel has no need to record the tariff number, or even to note the country from which the goods have been supplied. From January 1 it will have to record this information. BS believes it will achieve its twin aims of providing the trade data required by the European Community and automating its VAT returns by January 1. This is despite the fact that the new VAT legislation is still not complete.</p>

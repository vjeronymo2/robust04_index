In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kazannik noted that, "Boris  Yeltsin perfectly correctly laid out a plan of legislative work.  Without that it will be impossible to ensure law and order".    The procurator-general said he was sure that, after the  adoption of the anti-crime programme which the Russian president  is now intensively working on, law and order bodies will find it  much easier to increase the strength of laws in the Russian  society.    The president's address emphasized that, "A law-based state  should be a strong one in order to guarantee peoples' safety,  strike out against crime, and begin an offensive against  corruption. A strong state is the basis for the continuation of  reforms, the overcoming of the country's crisis, the  establishment of basic economic restructuring, and the creation  of conditions for economic stabilisation and growth".    It was also noted in the address that, "In a law-based  state,  power is limited by the law, which is a necessary condition for  such a state. For that exact reason the development of law can  be considered a concrete policy towards the strengthening of the  Russian state".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reliable sources have told the Voice of Resistance  of the Black Cockerel that the involvement of a number of  Namibia Government circles in military and logistical assistance  to the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola was  yesterday discussed at a meeting Lopo do Nascimento [secretary  general of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]  held in Windhoek on 19 November. Lopo do Nascimento was in  Namibia to discuss military cooperation.    Last week, the governor of Jamba said the Namibian  Government  had installed a Soviet-made radar system along the border with  Angola.    Asked to comment whether those developments posed a threat  to  the region's stability, a source with the General Staff of the  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola said: We will  continue to follow a policy of good neighborliness. We will not  interfere in the domestic affairs of sovereign governments,  though provocations will never be tolerated. The source urged  the Namibian people not to allow circles in the Government of  Namibia to plunge their country into a senseless war.</p>

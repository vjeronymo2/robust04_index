			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- Parliamentary democracy  in Slovakia has shown it is viable, and this is the most  important experience from the first hundred days of existence of  the broad coalition government which replaced that of ex-premier  Vladimir Meciar in March, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told  journalists today.    He added that Slovakia did not need a greater concentration  of power in the form of a presidential system.    The most burning problem with which the cabinet had to deal  was the condition of the state budget, Moravcik said. He  rejected "the transferring of problems into the future" by  increased borrowing, saying that in addition to saving money  taxes had to be raised.    Talking about the results of his government's work, he  emphasized preparations for the acceleration of privatization,  support to small and medium-sized businesses and Slovakia's  increased credibility abroad, even though investors "were  waiting tensely for the results of the autumn elections." He  admitted that the government had not managed to deal with the  insolvency of state companies, and the practical functioning of  the screening law also remained an unanswered question.    Deputy premier Ivan Simko said that during its one hundred  days the government had given 43 bills to parliament, most of  which dealt with crime, the situation in the state  administration, the restoration of purity to political life and  bringing Slovak law closer to the requirements of the European  Union.    Asked whether Slovakia remained a legal state even without  the screening law being respected, Simko said that due to  unclear competence after the division of Czechoslovakia several  laws could not be put into practice. "We cannot observe the  screening law, because no organ exists to give out  certificates," Nonetheless, he admitted that the solution of  this technical question had come up against the political  problem of disagreement between the Democratic Left Party (SDL)  and the coalition. Unlike the premier, however, Simko considers  it possible to find a way out of the problem by the elections.  Dialogue and the attempt to find a compromise could ensure that  the present coalition continued to exist after the elections.    Moravcik also said that the differences of opinion between  the post-communist SDL and the rest of the coalition with regard  to privatization methods "do not concern ideas," and that  agreement had been reached as to the extent of coupon  privatization.    "People's security has become the number one political  problem," Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. Between the  beginning of the year and the end of May,the percentage of all  crimes solved had risen from 28.3 to 38.5 per cent, with the  success rate for solving economic crimes having almost doubled,  going from 40 per cent to nearly 80. The result was that people  had more confidence in the police, even though crime was on the  increase and drug abuse spreading, and the revelation of police  corruption remained a problem.    Moravcik confirmed that he would probably meet Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus unofficially at the Central European Initiative  meeting in Trieste. However, he believed that some of the  problems between the Czech and Slovak republics would remain  unsolved. Although he rejected opposition pressure to increase  further protectionist measures, and admitted that "the partisan  method of introducing the imports surcharge is not a good  solution," nonetheless Bratislava had managed to "smooth away"  displeasure from GATT and the imports surcharge would remain in  effect until the end of the year.</p>

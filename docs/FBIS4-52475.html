			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives today passed the 1994  draft constitutional amendment bill by a more than two-thirds  majority. The draft bill is designed to provide for the  establishment of a court of appeal and demand that the paramount  ruler and Malay rulers accept a government advice. As many as  133 of the 179 MP's voted for the draft bill. Three PAS [Pan  Malaysian Islamic Party] members and four independents were  among those voting for the draft bill. Fourteen DAP [Democratic  Action Party] members abstained and not a single member of the  Semangat 46 [Spirit of 46 Party] attended the session today.    Speaking during the debates at the committee level,  opposition leader Mr. Lim Kit Siang said that the party  abstained because the proposed amendment to Article 66 did not  get the consent of the Council of Rulers as provided for in  Article 38 (4) of the Federal Constitution.    Winding up the debates, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri  Anwar  Ibrahim said a constitutional amendment is nothing new and thus  does not need the consent of the Council of Rulers. He said the  notice regarding debates over the draft constitutional amendment  bill was considered sufficient because the matter is nothing new.    In another development, Semangat 46 President Tengku  Razaleigh Hamzah said the government should postpone the  amendment because Article 40 of the Federal Constitution  pertains to a true interpretation of a government advice to the  rulers and their subsequent consent. He said the amendment  should be studied first before being presented to the Council of  Rulers for their consent.</p>

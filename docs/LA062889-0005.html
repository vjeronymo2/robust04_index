			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS BILL TO OBTAIN DATA ON INVESTMENTS BY FOREIGNERS  </P> <P> The Senate, reflecting concern over the extent of foreign investment in the  state, voted Tuesday to require foreign businesses to disclose details of their  operations in California.  </P> <P> On a 22-6 vote, the Senate sent the bill by Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) to  the Assembly. One opponent, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), maintained that the  proposal would encourage "bashing" of investors from Japan and other nations.  </P> <P> But Montoya insisted: "We are not bashing anyone."  </P> <P> In separate actions, the upper chamber also overwhelmingly approved legislation  to toughen penalties against students who attack teachers but rejected a bill  to require fast-food operations to label the type of oil used in cooking.  </P> <P> Montoya's bill, one of the Legislature's few attempts to deal with widespread  concern that California is being bought up by wealthy foreign investors,  generated relatively little debate.  </P> <P> Under the measure, starting April 1, foreign individuals and corporate  investors in California real estate or commercial property would have to file  annual reports with the secretary of state. Failure to do so would be  punishable by a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> The reports would provide such information as interest in real estate or in  tangible property, if value exceeds $2 million or an investment represents more  than 5% of the total ownership.  </P> <P> Among other things, the investor would have to report his or her citizenship,  business ownerships, purchase prices of ownership interests, acreage and square  footage acquired and nature or percentage of ownership interests.  </P> <P> Excluded from filing would be foreigners with an interest of less than $350,000  in a business operation in California or those whose only investment is in a  single-family dwelling that the buyer occupied continuously.  </P> <P> The information would be supplied to the secretary of state, who, in turn,  would produce a report for the governor and Legislature listing aggregate data  but not identifying investors by name, address or dollar amounts.  </P> <P> Montoya said such information is needed because data "we get from the federal  Department of Commerce is 3 years old. (And) if other countries monitor  American investments, we ought to do the same thing so we can better plan what  we are going to do in the future."  </P> <P> Background material supplied to the Senate showed that investors from Canada  were the largest foreign owners of plants and equipment in California at $5.6  billion, followed by Japan at $4.6 billion and the United Kingdom at $4.3  billion.  </P> <P> The Japanese were the largest foreign employers in California at 60,900  workers, followed by West Germany at 52,550 and the United Kingdom at 51,400.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the Senate approved and sent to the Assembly on a 28-1  vote a bill to crack down on youths who attack teachers. The bill calls for  trying as adults 16- and 17-year-olds accused of first-degree murder.  </P> <P> The bill, by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), was prompted by a recent series of  violent acts against teachers, including the fatal March 24 shooting outside  his home of Hal Arthur, 60, a popular Grant High School teacher in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The bill calls for adding three years to the sentences of youths convicted of  crimes against teachers or other school employees on school-related business  either on or off campus. Such crimes would include murder, voluntary  manslaughter, rape and kidnaping.  </P> <P> Sixteen- and 17-year-olds accused of first-degree murder of school employees  would be tried as adults, unless a judge found circumstances that justified  trying them in juvenile court.  </P> <P> But Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), an opponent of the death penalty, voiced  concern that the bill could "play right into the hands" of those who favor  executing murderers under age 18. She said her fear is fueled by U.S. Supreme  Court rulings on Monday that 16- and 17-year-old murderers and slayers  afflicted by mental retardation can be put to death under certain  circumstances.  </P> <P> Robbins and others countered, however, that the bill would not change  California's prohibition against executing murderers under age 18. To change  the law would require separate legislation, they said.  </P> <P> Defeat of the bill requiring fast-food chains to label food containers to  identify the type of oils used in cooking represented a victory for the  fast-food industry. The bill was designed to help consumers avoid saturated  fats that can raise cholesterol levels, including animal fat, coconut oil and  palm oil.  </P> <P> The measure, by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), failed on an 18-15 vote, three  votes short of the 21 required. Members of the Senate came under heavy pressure  from the restaurant and grocery industries to vote against the bill, arguing  that such labeling could spread to the rest of the food industry.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard Paddock contributed to this story.  </P></p>

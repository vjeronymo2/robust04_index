			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Consultants get the thumbs down - In A Nutshell Consultants still have a poor image with small business owners despite schemes such as the government's Enterprise Initiative which attempts to break down barriers. A poll* of small firms employing between six and 50 people in and around Milton Keynes found that most were sceptical of external consultants. They saw consultants as 'far too expensive', 'not offering practical advice in layman's terms,' and 'not living in the real world'. The areas where business owners had most frequently sought help were quality (44 per cent), sales and marketing (22 per cent), staff and management development (16 per cent), finance and administration and information technology (both 13 per cent). *By Milton Keynes and North Bucks Training and Enterprise Council and Milton Keynes Business Venture.

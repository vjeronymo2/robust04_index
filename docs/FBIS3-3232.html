			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- A new flow of migrant  rural laborers to urban areas soon after the traditional Spring  Festival has caught attention from deputies to the National  People's Congress (NPC) at its current session here. They said  this major social phenomenon is becoming a historical trend for  China.    For some years, in early spring, tens of thousands of young  farmers, men and women, from land-locked provinces of Sichuan,  Hunan and Guizhou streamed into economically developed Pearl and  Chang Jiang River deltas, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities to  work, make money and learn technology. Such a grand scene in  China's economic and social arena is described vividly as a  "wave of migrating farmer-laborers."    Statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture shows that, of  China's total rural workforce of 430 million, 130 million are in  redundance. Besides the 110 million already employed by township  enterprises, 20 million are on the move every year. Guangdong,  China's showcase province in reform and opening up in the south,  leads the country in absorbing outsider farmers, which total  more than 10 million.    Sichuan, China's most populous province and leading grain  producer, is a major source of the wave. Due to its limited  farmland, 20 million farmers have become surplus. "Three months  to work in the fields, two months to spend the Spring Festival  holiday season and seven months to idle away at leisure" is a  typical style of their life.    They are eager to find jobs and fortunes in a new world. In  1989, the first groups of Sichuan farmers left their land for  jobs elsewhere. The "Sichuan armies" of migrant farmers have  since become well known throughout the country.    Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan and an NPC deputy, said that  in 1993, five million farmers from Sichuan found jobs in all the  other provinces, regions and municipalities except Taiwan.  Remittances they sent back home amounted to five billion yuan  that year.    Zuo Mingzhong, a farmer deputy, said farmers's concepts have  changed a lot. To them farmland is no longer their sole source  for subsistence. Migrant farmers have broadened their horizons,  learned skills and improved cultural and educational standards  by assimilating nutrition from modern industries and urban  civilization.    Many farmers have returned home with technology and  information procured from developed areas. They have launched  businesses in their hometowns to help their villagers get  prosperous, Zuo said.    Li Youwei, major of Shenzhen city and an NPC deputy, said  migrant farmers are a main workforce in the construction of the  special economic zone. They work mainly in labor-intensive  construction, transportation and toy industries.    In Shenzhen, they are well received since they are good  workers, Li said.    Economists and sociologists among the NPC deputies maintain  that the "wave of migrating farmer-laborers" is a historical  trend under China's fledging market economic structure and  planned allocation of production factors. The wave is, in  essence, a process of optimizing the allocation of production  factors -- a shift of rural laborers from areas with low  productivity and efficiency to areas with higher standards.    Some years ago, farmers moved locally, to non-agricultural  sectors. But now they moved to other areas and are becoming  urbanized.    This tremendous social change shows that Chinese farmers who  have relied on farming for centuries have begun to take part in  the great modernization process and share social-economic  benefits arising therefrom. "This is a historical progress,"  economists and sociologists said.    They predicted, therefore, Chinese farmers are making their  third great creation, following their first creation of the  family-based farming system and their second creation of rural  enterprises.    The "wave of migrating farmer-laborers," however, has also  become a headache for relevant authorities. For instance, the  outflow of young farmers will hamper the modernization process  in rural areas. The presence of armies of migrant farmers have  put strains on transportation departments and management of  public order in urban areas.    Experts suggested governments exercise macro-guidance and  coordination over the inter-regional flow of farmers in order to  avoid chaos and set up more employment agencies to provide job  information, training and consultation.    Towns and townships should become the main reservoir to  siphon surplus laborers in order to slow down their speedy flow  to urban areas, according to the experts.    They said that if China's existing 60 large and medium-sized  cities are set to absorb rural surplus laborers, every city will  have one million people more. So that is a choice. And there  are also potentials in this regard for 300 small cities and  2,000 county towns. In addition, about 2,000 towns and  townships out of a total 5,000 can be developed into "farmer  towns." Thus it will be possible to absorb the 100 million  surplus farmers.    Recently, officials from nine provinces and regions which  have the biggest flow of migrant farmers in and out gathered in  Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province, to explore ways to  strengthen organization and distribution of migrant farmers.  The Ministry of Labor is also planning to study how to make  rural laborers flow in an orderly way and how to get farmers  employed in non-agricultural sectors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign  Ministry Under Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza stated on 23 June  that Chile favors greater economic integration with Latin  America, and particularly with the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur).    During an interview with the TELAM news agency, the Chilean  official also made it clear that Chile is not seeking to join  NAFTA, an objective he considered "very difficult to achieve."    Insulza, who is making a two-day official visit to  Argentina,  drew a distinction between integration and free trade.    He stated that "integration is a much more complex concept;  it entails trade, investments, strategic alliances between  companies. We have assumed a commitment along these lines with  our neighbors, and especially with Mercosur member countries."    "With the United States, by contrast, we are seeking to sign  a trade agreement that will secure us markets in that country,  but we are not interested in furthering an integration process  with NAFTA or with North American countries because it would be  very difficult for us from a geographic standpoint."    Insulza is participating in the quarterly follow-up meetings  to the economic complementation agreements signed between  Argentina and Chile in 1991.    "We want to sign a free trade agreement with the United  States, but this is within the sphere of trade and investment,"  he noted.    The official said his country intends to sign free trade  agreements "with countries in the farthest corners of the world,  and not only the United States. If tomorrow the EC or Japan,  one of our most important export markets, offer us an agreement,  we will sign it enthusiastically."    Chile has recently proposed a limited integration with  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries  (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), a regional project  that will have its debut as a common market on 1 January 1995.    That scheme was defined as "four plus one" by Chilean  Foreign  Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano. Chile is reluctant to join  the initiative as a full member due to the different customs  tariffs in effect.    Insulza said: "There are two aspects or obstacles that  appear today to be insurmountable."    On the one hand we have "the tariff structure that is  expected to enter into effect as of 1995, which is not  compatible with Chile's tariff system. The other obstacle is  related to a Mercosur principle to negotiate with others as a  bloc, while Chile prefers to do its own business," Insulza  concluded.</p>

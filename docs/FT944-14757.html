			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: All hell breaks loose at the Paris 'Ring' - Covent Garden has no monopoly of booing If only Eurotunnel had started passenger services a month earlier. Then opera-goers could have amused themselves last weekend travelling back and forth between London and Paris, watching new productions of Wagner's Ring in the two cities getting booed to the rafters. There was no way that Covent Garden had a monopoly of discontent. Although the first three instalments of the Theatre du Chatelet's new Ring cycle had passed off peacefully, that was because the producer had chosen not to appear. When he did finally poke his nose out from behind the curtain at the end of Gotterdammerung on Sunday, all hell broke loose. They booed, they whistled, they screamed abuse. What it is that makes audiences at Wagner's operas want to taste blood? Leaving aside the cost of the tickets, doubtless a powerful incentive, the main problem is the impossibility of realising the composer's stage instructions. Having giving up the realistic style by the 1960s and then exhausted all manner of social and political updatings in the 1970s and 1980s, producers are looking for somewhere else to go. The Royal Opera's new Ring is cartoon-colourful and disrespectful, in a style which is starting to be accepted as 'post-modern'. Pierre Strosser, the producer in Paris, has gone to the other extreme. His stage picture is unrelievedly grey: grey costumes on a grey stage against a grey backdrop. In sweeping aside the outdated ideas of the last couple of decades, he has sought to put precisely nothing in their place. No message, no analysis or re-interpretation. Worse - there is no intelligence, no emotion, nothing to make one feel that sitting through the Ring for 16 hours should send one out a different person from when one went in. To anybody following the Chatelet Ring from the beginning, none of this should have come as a surprise. Earlier in the year Das Rheingold and Die Walkure had already set the course that the cycle - a co-production between the Chatelet and Radio France, which perhaps explains the emphasis on musical over visual values - was to follow. Although the rough and ready playing of the Orchestre National de France was not one of the cycle's strong points, Jeffrey Tate did succeed in overcoming underlying orchestral weakness to deliver performances of thoroughly Wagnerian power and grandeur. Siegfried was solid and leaden-footed in a way typical of Tate when inspiration deserts him, but Gotterdammerung revived enthusiasm with bursts of passionate energy, flushing hot and cold, now slow, now racingly fast. In Paris, Tate's appearances at the second half of this Ring have taken on a new significance. Rumour has it that he may be asked to take over the hot seat of international opera, as music director at the Bastille in succession to Myung-Whun Chung. If it comes about, his appointment would fan other flames: the Chatelet and the Bastille are firm rivals. Where the Chatelet production invested its money wisely was in its choice of singers. Presumably the logic was that if most of the audience was following the performances at home on the radio, there should be good voices to listen to. In Siegfried, Robert Hale was outstanding, a sovereign Wanderer, proudly proclaiming a noble Wagnerian bass-baritone to the world. In Gotterdammerung, Kurt Rydl made a hardly less impressive counterpart, black-voiced, burly, a Hagen born to lower-class thuggery. The Siegfried and Brunnhilde also had their vocal strengths. Heinz Kruse may be getting on for 50, short and rather podgy, but he sings as if the role holds no particular difficulties for him, as fresh at the end of Siegfried as he was at the beginning (though it is not a very heroic tenor voice). Towering above him was the 6ft Gabriele Schnaut, just as steady vocally and astonishingly loud, but not, sadly, a moving Brunnhilde, mostly because the voice is so hard and inexpressive. Much amusement was to be had during the love duet in Siegfried watching these ill-matched lovers trying to avoid standing side by side. Among the other vocal pleasures were a singularly well-sung Gunther from Eike Wilm Schulte, Franz-Josef Kappellmann as a strong Alberich and a winningly-blended trio of Rhinemaidens in Julie Kaufmann, Hanna Schaer and Dagmar Peckova. Malmfrid Sand was clearly trying to create a character out of Gutrune, which was unusual in the context of this production, where stand and sing was not just tolerated but encouraged as the way to play the Ring. In addition, the programme for Gotterdammerung listed 45 'figurants' or 'extras', who turned out to be a long crocodile of men in raincoats who filed on from one side of the stage and filed off again on the other a couple of minutes later. Nobody could explain who they were meant to be, but they must have added a penny or two to the Chatelet's production budget. It might have been more cost-effective to pay them to applaud from the stalls at the end. Sponsored by the Association Culturelle du Theatre du Chatelet.

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Probe at Johnson Space Centre Federal agents posing as corrupt contractors have begun a wide-ranging investigation into charges of fraud and kickbacks at the US space agency's Johnson Space Centre, law enforcement officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Houston. The investigation has targeted several large government contractors, employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and more than a dozen employees of private companies, the officials said. However, the officials were unable to confirm reports that the case may involve an astronaut. The FBI allegedly shot videotapes of contractors accepting cash to set up illegal deals with Nasa. According to local media reports, those caught in the scheme, in which payments reportedly amounted to tens of thousands of dollars, include contractors and vendors as well as an astronaut. The investigation was described as the biggest probe into allegations of government contract corruption since 'Operation Ill Wind', a massive FBI investigation in the late 1980s into bribery and other wrong-doing in the Pentagon's procurement system. Word of the investigation came as Nasa launched the space shuttle Endeavour yesterday on a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope - a mission that officials also hoped would improve the agency's already sagging reputation after a recent string of failed missions. The US Attorney General's office in Houston declined to comment on the investigation.</p>

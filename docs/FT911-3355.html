			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: The real roots of poverty Sir, As a former teacher in a supposedly 'ghetto' area of New York and today a social services worker in Lambeth, I recognise - and reject - the diagnosis of the underclass offered by the American academics presented in Michael Prowse's sympathetic piece, 'The underclass is no illusion' (April 22). However, if their diagnosis smacks of Thomas Malthus and Samuel Smiles, the alternative that Prowse offers, that of mass relocation of the poor, also has roots in a more repressive era. His suggestion of moving people out of the ghetto en bloc, as was also achieved in 'ghetto' parts of London in the final quarter of the last century and through urban planning in this, is merely an act of dispersal and dilution. Sprinkle the poor through those neighbourhoods with economic abundance, says this theory, and the problems would be set to right. But what is wrong with trying to redress - by economic, educationa1 and other means - the injustices to poor people in the communities in which they already live, and by activities which encourage their existing survival structures? Individuals and families do suffer damage by deprivation, but it has to be said that the problem is not fundamentally the people or even for that matter, the place. What is missing from communities afflicted by unemployment, drugs, or other perils, on either side of the Atlantic, is hope - hope that is associated with individual and group economic progress, community pride, and legitimacy of social institutions. Until American policymakers discard Dickensian fantasies about lifestyles of the poor and start dealing with poverty, they'll be as far off the mark as their Victorian forebears. Yours sincerely Geof Rayner vice-chair, The Public Health Alllance, Snow Hill House, 10-15 Livery Street, Birmingham</p>

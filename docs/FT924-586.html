			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Japanese prosecutors decide not to lay charges in shares donation case Japanese prosecutors have decided not to lay charges against 60 MPs from the ruling Liberal Democratic party who received shares in an illegal Y500m (Pounds 2.65m) donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking company, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. The prosecutors' decision appears to close the case book on the Tokyo Sagawa scandal, which has already seen the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's godfather, and highlighted the links between leading politicians and gangsters.</p>

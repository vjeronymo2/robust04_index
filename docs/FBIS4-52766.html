			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 12 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A total of  104 Vietnamese illegal immigrants from the Sungai Besi temporary  camp returned home yesterday under the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) voluntary repatriation  (Volrep) programme.    Federal Task Force principal assistant director (settlement)  Kamarulzaman Murad said all those who returned home had not been  accorded refugee status after screening.    A total of 3,054 Vietnamese illegal mmigrants had  voluntarily  returned home since the programme was started three years ago.    Kamarul said there were some 6,820 boat people at the Sungai  Besi camp and those who were not repatriated after the expiry of  the Volrep programme next year would be sent home in stages  before 1996.    Those who returned home under the programme could resettle  in  third countries like the United States and Canada under the  orderly departure programme (ODP) which is only available in  Vietnam.</p>

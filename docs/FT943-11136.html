			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Soccer's old attitudes ruled offside - Why excluding players' values may be a commercial mistake When Chris Sutton, Blackburn Rovers' new Pounds 5m signing, takes the field against Southampton on the first day of the Premier League season, most fans will probably regard him as one of the Lancashire side's prime assets. Not so the club's accountants. Blackburn is common among English football clubs in excluding players' values from the balance sheet. That policy is flawed, according to accountants, Touche Ross, and contributes to the losses which have raised serious questions about the financial strength of the national sport. By dealing with transfer fees through the profit and loss account, Touche Ross believes clubs such as Blackburn are failing to show substantial asset values in their balance sheet. 'Soccer's 'hidden assets' may put a club at a commercial disadvantage when trying to raise finance or convey a message to investors or financial analysts,' says Mr Gerry Boon, co-author of Touche Ross's annual survey of football club accounts. The survey, published today, warns that by not declaring player values in the balance sheet, clubs fail to show an objective return on assets and capital employed; expose themselves to large and unpredictable swings in profits; and cannot give a realistic picture of their 'worth as a company'. The cost to Blackburn has been high. It spent Pounds 13.1m on new players in the 1991-92 and the 1992-93 seasons, resulting in pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.92m and Pounds 6.34m respectively. Its spending spree helped lift the estimated value of the Premier League's players to Pounds 250m. Fortunately for the club, it can rely on the deep pockets of Mr Jack Walker, the businessman who sold his steel stockholding business to British Steel for Pounds 330m and has since acted as Blackburn's benefactor. Most clubs do not have such backers. So why do they not embrace Touche Ross's recommendations? The answer may be simple: tax. By building up accumulated losses, clubs can reduce their liability to corporation tax should they have a windfall on the sale of a star player or on a cup run. But such practices may soon attract the attention of the Inland Revenue, according to Mr Colin Sandy, finance director at Tottenham Hotspur. He believes that the Revenue's Special Compliance Office, which is currently examining payments to players, could 'extend its inquiry to look at other matters'. Their attention may focus on the two thirds of clubs in the Premier League which reported a profit in their last financial statements, but avoided corporation tax through losses carried forward from previous years. Newcastle United, one of the seven sides to include player values in the balance sheet, says clubs must now face up to the challenge of introducing efficient management. The club changed its accounting policies after it was rescued by Sir John Hall, the north east property entrepreneur. Mr Freddie Fletcher, chief executive, says it was completely revamped after accountants at Cameron Hall Developments, Sir John's private company, drew up a new financial strategy. 'This club was in a mess,' he adds. The Football Association, however, is reluctant to endorse common accounting standards for all clubs. Mr Mark Day, the FA's chief accountant, says there is no proof that one accounting system is better than another. 'As long as clubs are operating within accountancy rules, then we wouldn't seek a set format.' Nevertheless, Mr Boon at Touche Ross says clubs should shrug off their old attitudes. If they don't, he warns, they may not be able to afford new players or invest adequate sums in their stadiums. 'In order to secure the finance for such developments, clubs need to present themselves to banks, shareholders and investors as well-managed businesses,' he says. 'The financial manager is very much part of the squad.' The Touche Ross Survey of Football Club Accounts. Pounds 20.

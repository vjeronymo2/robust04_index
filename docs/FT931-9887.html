			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Personal View: Absence of road pricing takes its toll Would the British electorate rather pay road tolls or medical bills? Astonishingly, this basic question is not being asked in the government's new review of public spending priorities, which covers only health, education, social security and the Home Office. Road tolls are being eased on to the political agenda, but as a separate item promoted by the Transport Department. Yet the provision of roads is as much part of the welfare state as the provision of state pensions and schools. And although public expenditure on roads is modest compared with the health bill, the yield from tolls could easily be more than Pounds 10bn. There could be even a bigger effect on the public sector borrowing requirement if roads were privatised. The German government has recognised the benefit of such a move, having just approved plans to privatise its autobahns and impose an annual fee. Resource allocation on Britain's road system is one of the last outposts of Soviet-style economics. Road usage in big cities and on many inter-city routes is limited by queueing rather than pricing, as used to happen in Moscow's food stores. No attempt is made to charge for factors such as vehicle emissions, congestion or accidents, echoing the practice applied to East Germany's chemicals plants. There is a strong economic case for sweeping all this away and replacing it with electronic road pricing, especially in urban areas, with premium rates for the rush hour and discounts after midnight. For users concerned that the system might allow their movements to be tracked, technology exists for them to be charged anonymously. By contrast, the market for healthcare is bedevilled with information problems, as US medical services demonstrate. Doctors know much more than their patients, which allows them to charge for unnecessary tasks. The threat of negligence suits helps to institutionalise this over-provision. Private health insurance suffers from market failure owing to 'too much information': there can be no insurance for chronic conditions where it is known that treatment has to be provided, nor can hereditary conditions be covered. Recent studies of road pricing do not give figures of probable revenues, so we have made tentative estimates. We reckon the annual toll revenues at Pounds 11.5bn, assuming a rate of 3p a kilometre for cars on motorways and trunk roads, close to the French level, and 8p in towns. This also assumes that tolls cut traffic volumes by one-fifth. Experience of tolls on UK river crossings and Continental motorways suggests that a substantial net income would remain after collection charges. Moreover, the flotation value of the railway companies should be increased. If the entire road network were privatised, the private sector would raise the capital to develop and install the toll collection systems and to fund the existing road building programme. The flotation value would be very roughly Pounds 75bn, at a price/earnings ratio of 12, neglecting tax, if annual collection costs were 10 per cent of revenues, and if creation of the toll systems cost one year's revenue. The German government estimates that its autobahn network is worth DM120bn-DM130bn (more than Pounds 50bn). The effect on the PSBR would be significant. If these proceeds were spread over five years, the PSBR would be cut by Pounds 18bn initially (Pounds 15bn from the flotation, plus Pounds 3bn saving on road expenditure), and by more as the savings on debt interest built up. After five years, there would still be an annual saving of some Pounds 9.5bn (Pounds 6.5bn from lower interest payments, plus the Pounds 3bn). The exact figures would of course depend on many items, including the treatment of local authority spending and on whether the road fund licence was retained. This privatisation would create a series of companies with good potential to develop new technologies and services for sale on domestic and international markets. At home, they could sell real-time traffic information systems to drivers and, eventually, road guidance systems to take over control of vehicles on the motorways. Abroad, they could sell their expertise in electronic toll collection and guidance systems into what looks set to be a rapidly developing market. Road pricing offers a way of slashing the PSBR, while reducing congestion and pollution, and creating the base for a world-class high-technology industry in the UK. The economic arguments in its favour seem almost overwhelming compared with those for charges in other areas of the welfare state. Yet it is not even on the agenda. Something is wrong.

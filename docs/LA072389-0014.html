			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO THEATER  </P> <P> As a Latina actress, I read with interest the views of Jose Armand on Latin  theater in Los Angeles ("Paving the Way for Festival Latino," by Douglas  Sadownick, July 9). However, I was dismayed at his comment that the Bilingual  Foundation for the Arts is the only group that offers Latin theater on a  regular basis.  </P> <P> I am part of a theater ensemble named Sinergia and am appearing in an  all-Spanish play, "Una Familia Tipo" ("A Family Type"), directed by Anibal  Aprile, who last year won a Cesar Award for his play "Entre Las Redes" ("Caught  in a Web"). The Cesar Award is presented to Latin theater actors, directors,  authors, etc., by the Panamerican Theatrical Assn.  </P> <P> I point out the Cesar Awards to Mr. Armand, who said in his interview that  "there's no Latino theater award. . . . "  </P> <P> TINA D'MARCO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

Last year the province generated 1.9 billion  kwh, an increase of 33.4 percent over the previous year. The  gross output value amounted to more than 500 million yuan, an  increase of 63.1 percent over the previous year. Last year  electric power departments in the province made great efforts to  increase electric power generation. [words indistinct] Since  funding is guaranteed, the Nanshan electric power station can  smoothly proceed with all its construction projects. Its first  generating unit is expected to go into operation at the end of  this February.    To guarantee the fulfillment of state key construction  projects in the province, the Dagongba hydropower station has  gone into operation earlier than scheduled. Electric power  departments in the province have opened up all avenues to ensure  power supply. The Xiubian electric power project, with a total  investment of 73.95 million yuan, was completed and put into  operation last October after one year of efforts. [words  indistinct]</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (23): The press goes private - Publishing By a quirk of politics and history, newspaper publishing has become the most fully privatised Polish industry. Newspaper publishing, not steel or glass or cement, is an industry where all the principal companies already possess a foreign shareholder. It is also an influential industry. In a survey of reading habits, 90 per cent of Poles claimed that they read a daily newspaper at least some of the time, and 68 per cent claimed that they bought at least one weekly. The explanation for the print media's high level of privatisation can be traced to 1990, when Poland's first non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, signed a law dissolving RSW Prasa, the press monopoly which controlled the printing and the content of Polish newspapers. The law was passed quickly, for political reasons: RSW Prasa was a hated symbol of the old regime. The RSW liquidation law was much criticised at the time, since it did not always change the ownership of newspapers fairly or successfully. Most provincial newspapers were quickly signed over to 'worker-management' groups made up of journalists and editors; other papers were sold by auction to the highest bidder. Robert Hersant, the French owner of Le Figaro, bought shares in seven provincial titles, and paid Dollars 2m for a 49 per cent stake in Rzeczpospolita, one of the two quality dailies with a national circulation. Other foreign investors include Swiss, Swedish, and American companies. Nikola Grauso, a Sardinian entrepreneur, bought 55 per cent of Zycie Warszawy, a Warsaw regional daily. German companies such as Heinrich Bauer Verlag and Jahr Verlag have entered magazine publishing, and the former tennis star and entrepreneur, Wojciech Fibak, owns shares in several provincial papers and magazines. Since then, only one national newspaper start-up has been significantly successful - Gazeta Wyborcza, a daily which claims a circulation of 400,000. Its roots lie in the former dissident movement and its founding editor, Adam Michnik, was a corruscating critic of the old regime. One or two regional start-ups, including the right-of-centre Czas, a Krakow paper, have also proved successful. So has Nie, a satirical weekly whose editor, Jerzy Urban, is a former communist party spokesman. With these exceptions, Polish readers have proved remarkably conservative, preferring to buy familiar titles rather than new ones. A series of spectacular failures have deterred others. These include an unsuccessful attempt, backed by the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, to publish a daily along the lines of USA Today. This conservatism has until now mostly worked in favour of the provincial press. Grzegorsz Lindenberg, the former publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza who now edits and publishes a tabloid, Super Express, estimates that 2.5m Poles buy regional newspapers every day. 'Most journalists who work for local papers are connected to the old regime,' he said. Some speculate that the influence of the provincial press may have helped bring to power the present government, whose leaders come from the former communist party and its allies. Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita, the two quality dailies with a large national circulation, have quite different political orientations. Gazeta Wyborcza is closely linked to the group of centre-left dissidents who helped to form the first post-communist government. One of the first newspapers in Poland to start aggressively pursuing advertisers and to include attractions such as a weekend colour supplement, Gazeta Wyborcza has in the past year lost about 10 per cent of its circulation. Many of its readers defected to Rzeczpospolita, whose circulation has jumped from 250,000 at the start of 1993 to 324,000 in February 1994, and which cleared about Dollars 3m profit last year. The paper's editor, Dariusz Fikus, attributes this jump to a more efficient regional distribution network, and to the rapid rise of Warsaw's stock market. 'With up to 400,000 people now playing the stock market, more people want to read our financial and economic supplements,' he said. Others believe Poles are now more attracted by the impression of neutrality and solidity, and are less interested in reading an overtly politicised newspaper. If newspapers are heading towards greater objectivity in Poland, they are also heading towards higher technology. Both national papers have also been the beneficiaries of a technological revolution. Four years ago, Polish journalists wrote on typewriters. Now, with the help of capital coming from foreign investors, Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita have skipped intermediate stages, and moved on to very advanced computer systems. At Rzeczpospolita, all reporters have laptop computers and modems, which is more than many of their counterparts in western Europe are given. Gazeta Wyborcza has 1,015 computers, 350 of which are linked in a network. Most of the leading newspapers have also purchased or leased new printing plants, and some are planning to move into colour printing. What none of the Polish newspapers yet has is the kind of clout enjoyed by the western press. 'The Polish press is still not in the position to force the political class to do anything,' said Mr Lindenberg. Much of the political weakness of the press is blamed on journalists trained in the communist era, not all of whom have been certain of the difference between rumour and news. Because the press is not thought to tell the truth, press revelations of bribery scandals and financial skulduggery have yet to force a politician to resign. 'Not all of us have learned that we must always write what is true, and that if we do not, we must pay high costs,' said Mr Fikus. The Polish libel law is still weak; although there have been several high-profile libel cases, no leading newspaper has yet been forced to make a large payment to a victim of libel. Until that happens, an air of mistrust will continue to hang over the journalistic profession in Poland.</p>

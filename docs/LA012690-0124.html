			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FIRE SEASON CLOSED, SO AREAS REOPENED  </P> <P> The Orange County Fire Department this month officially closed fire season and  reopened four previously hazardous fire areas.  </P> <P> "We've had sufficient rainfall and conditions look good," said department  spokeswoman Kathleen Cha.  </P> <P> "But that doesn't mean we wouldn't close them again if things change. Hot, dry  Santa Ana winds could cause closure at any time."  </P> <P> The areas, which total about 97,000 acres, include unincorporated land and  eastern Yorba Linda property between the Los Angeles County line and the  Riverside Freeway, the unincorporated and wild-land areas between the Riverside  Freeway and the San Diego County line, the unincorporated Irvine Coast area  between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach and the unincorporated South Coast area  bounded by Laguna Hills on the north and Laguna Niguel on the south.  </P> <P> The four areas are closed each year when fire season begins, usually in May,  Cha said.  </P> <P> "The timing all depends on a combination of factors such as weather and fuel  moisture, meaning moisture at the root level, not just what you see with the  naked eye," Cha said.  </P> <P> "Fire season goes as long as there is hazard."  </P> <P> Other areas, such as pockets in Cleveland National Forest, are restricted  year-round and are marked as such, he said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Militant Comment" column: "Robert Lamb"] </F>   [Text] It has been reported that a replacement has been  found for Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue. He is John Kornblum, the U.S.  delegate to the CSCE.    We do not know the new coordinator, but we do hope that he  will look at the Cyprus issue through a very different lens than  his predecessor. Lamb repeatedly proved to be dishonest,  unreliable, dishonorable, misleading, and deceitful. He has  served in the position of coordinator for six months. During  this period not only did he not help Cyprus, but on the contrary  he harmed it.    Very justifiably, the Cypriot Government is strongly  dissatisfied with Lamb's role in the Cyprus issue. In Vienna  recently, Lamb dishonestly and deceitfully tried to make changes  to the 21 March UN document. Therefore, we hope that the new  U.S. coordinator will carry out his mission honestly and really  help Cyprus resolve its persistent problem in a just manner.</p>

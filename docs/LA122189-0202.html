			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY 1990;  </P> <P> CHALLENGES;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY LEADERS PROJECT THE BIG ISSUES FACING THE COUNTY  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Edition asked about 200 community leaders -- from  government, business, entertainment and charitable organizations -- what they  think will be the single biggest challenge that Orange County faces in the  1990s, either in their area of expertise or in general. Here are some of their  responses.  </P> <P> Jack W. Peltason, chancellor of UCI  </P> <P> "One might expect the biggest challenge in Orange County, from the perspective  of a university chancellor, to deal with education. And indeed it does. The  challenge will be to educate our community to understand and assist with the  grave crisis in our county health-care system. The crisis affects not only the  poor and indigent residents of our community. Every single person who may be  the victim of an accident or in need of emergency services is endangered when  emergency rooms are forced to close their doors due to inadequate cost  reimbursements from government agencies."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Health care  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Changing demographics  </P> <P> * Support for all segments of education  </P> <P> * Ensuring a well-educated electorate  </P> <P> Ernie Schneider, county administrative officer  </P> <P> "Transportation, beyond a doubt, is the single most challenging issue of the  1990s. Without adequate transportation infrastructure, this county will not  grow to its fullest potential. An inadequate transportation system will affect  every aspect of our lives, including air quality, housing, economic well-being  and ability to enjoy the county's recreational opportunities."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Housing  </P> <P> * Air quality  </P> <P> * Criminal justice (jails and courts)  </P> <P> * Local government financing  </P> <P> Rusty Kennedy, executive director, Orange County Human Relations Commission  </P> <P> Biggest challenge: "Intolerance towards the poor. Whether it is anger at  Hispanic day laborers, hostility towards social services in neighborhoods,  opposition to housing affordable to very low-income workers or opposition to  jails being built even in remote canyons. As the county grows richer as a whole  I see a dangerous slide towards intolerance, the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard)  syndrome. Can we build a county where rich and poor can live together is the  challenge."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Intolerance towards the poor -- NIMBY syndrome  </P> <P> * Transportation versus slow growth  </P> <P> * Wage polarization -- growth at the high and low ends of the wage scale  </P> <P> * Housing for very low-income workers  </P> <P> * Intergroup conflict  </P> <P> James Enright, chief deputy district attorney  </P> <P> "While it would be easy to focus in on the drugs-equals-crime equation, I don't  believe that is our overall biggest challenge in the county (because we have  public awareness and support in this area).  </P> <P> "There is no question in my mind the major problem facing the county in the  '90s will be in the area of transportation. At the close of the '80s we are  almost at gridlock. If we leave the planning to the builders and the recipients  of their largess we will have a traffic nightmare by the end of the century."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> Brad Gates, Orange County sheriff-coroner  </P> <P> Biggest challenge: "Leadership. This county has not had the political  leadership to solve the problems during the '80s and it does not appear we will  have any leaders with the will to solve the problems in the '90s. We are  lacking leadership from the business community to solve the major issues. The  business leaders must stand up and be counted and quit waiting for someone else  to do the job. The leadership in the development-builders area have tried to do  their part, but they have acquired a reputation of self-interest that, in my  opinion, they do not deserve. They have put back into the community and made  Orange County a better place to live. Just look at the charity donation lists,  Boy Scouts, etc. They at least have tried to provide leadership from their  area, even though sadly they have been rejected by the community."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Drugs  </P> <P> * Political leadership  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Jail facilities  </P> <P> * Revenue for government services  </P> <P> The Most Reverend Norman F. McFarland, Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange  </P> <P> "The biggest single challenge facing Orange County for the 1990s consists in  changing demographic, economic and social trends having significantly  unfavorable impact on our families, the basic foundation of our society. No  agency or program can supplant the family and replace it if it falters."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Chemical and alcohol abuse and its consequences  </P> <P> * Accessibility to basic health care for all our people  </P> <P> * Abortion and the depth of the moral crisis this manifests  </P> <P> * Availability of affordable housing  </P> <P> * Recognition and assimilation of, and reverence for, true spiritual values  </P> <P> Professor Mark P. Petracca, UCI assistant professor of political science and  member of various community groups  </P> <P> "I think that the biggest challenge facing Orange County in the 1990s is  whether we can create and nurture a political system that is up to the task of  meeting the public policy challenges that lie ahead. The process of governance  in Orange County and in many localities has not changed much from the days when  Orange County was far more rural, much less urbane, andsignificantly less  diverse. Officials in this county and in many localities are trying to govern a  high-tech economic infrastructure, an increasingly sophisticated and  emotionally charged electorate, and a socio-economically diverse population  with "horse and buggy" institutions and politics. The tension between the  demands on governance and our current capabilities to govern well cannot (and  should not) be sustained throughout the next decade.  </P> <P> "Institutional political reforms should be considered (e.g., moving the Board  of Supervisors to a variant of at-large elections; probably moving some  at-large city councils to district elections; the increased use of county  districts to deal with problems that do not mind city boundaries, such as  pollution, water usage, etc.) as well as changes in our political and  educational infrastructures (e.g., enhanced use of cable as a mechanism of  political and general education; increased competition among the local media;  greater attention to culture as a determinant of daily life)."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Political reform  </P> <P> * Preservation of the environment  </P> <P> * Greater attention to proximity between workplace and home  </P> <P> * Social values. The "values police" are not going to disappear overnight  </P> <P> * Cultural assimilation  </P> <P> Ray Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> Biggest challenge: "Rebuilding confidence in government. The horrendous  problems this county (and others) face -- roads, housing, jails, crime, health  care, etc. -- will continue to grow until the public (out of desperation) again  has faith in the only institutions that can deal with these problems.  Consumerism, Populism, environmentalism, managed growthism, etc. are  public-awakening but not capable of solving anything."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Roads  </P> <P> * Housing for middle-class (Poor will be allocated housing, rich always can buy  in. But with public pressure to retard housing supply, the losers are the  middle-class.)  </P> <P> * Cost of health care  </P> <P> Tom Mays, mayor of Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Biggest challenge: "Maintaining our job base in Orange County. Due to an  increase in traffic congestion, high cost of housing and high labor rates,  large corporations will be looking outside Southern California, probably in  other states, to relocate. Young people can not afford Orange County and  corporations are having a harder time placing people. When jobs start going  elsewhere, there won't be a housing shortage any longer."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Quality of life issues  </P> <P> * Jobs  </P> <P> * Traffic  </P> <P> * High cost of housing  </P> <P> * Air quality and other environmental issues  </P> <P> Phillip E. Cox, presiding judge, Orange County Superior Court  </P> <P> "The infrastructure of Orange County is the largest single challenge facing  Orange County for the 1990s. Orange County has failed, because of lack of  funds, to keep pace with the needs of the increasing population. At the present  rate of growth, Orange County citizens may very well see their sewers running  at capacity or even overflowing, the potholes in the roads will become as big  as manholes, brownouts may become a reality and one may find that it takes half  an hour just to have a break in traffic so he can back out of his driveway."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Drug abuse  </P> <P> * Transportation  </P> <P> * Gangs  </P> <P> * Housing  </P> <P> * Capital improvements -- airport, courts, jails  </P> <P> Donald M. Koll, chairman and chief executive officer, The Koll Company  </P> <P> "Surface transportation will continue to be Orange County's biggest single  challenge during the 1990s as our population increases from 2.3 million to 2.6  million and as our job base grows from 1.3 million to 1.6 million. Widening of  existing freeways and roads, improvement of key interchanges, creation of super  streets and the addition of the San Joaquin Hills, Foothill and Eastern  Transportation Corridors will be vital. Our key challenge will be to obtain the  funds for these mitigation measures."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Surface transportation  </P> <P> * Affordable housing  </P> <P> * Air quality  </P> <P> * Growth control  </P> <P> * Changing ethnic mix  </P> <P> Thomas F. Bradac, producing artistic Director of the Grove Shakespeare  Festival, Garden Grove  </P> <P> "The theater both reflects and comments on society. I believe that violence  (gang-related, domestic, drug-related and random) will continue to increase in  our community. The theater, as other agencies and arts organizations, will need  to address itself to providing opportunities for those who are disenfranchised  within our society. As an artist, the theater has the ability to communicate  human hopes and aspirations, to provide thought and reflection, to inspire and  through reflection to comment on our lives -- to see how violence is affecting  each one of us."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES (artistically)  </P> <P> * Government censorship of controversial topics and ideas  </P> <P> * Lack of adequate funding for the arts by government, corporations and  individuals  </P> <P> * Arts education in the public schools  </P> <P> * Support of artists within the community  </P> <P> * Art as a necessity for society as opposed to a frill  </P> <P> Roger D. Slates, Orange County planning commissioner  </P> <P> Biggest challenge:  </P> <P> "TRANSPORTATION -- ROADS -- FREEWAYS.  </P> <P> "TRANSPORTATION -- ROADS -- FREEWAYS.  </P> <P> "TRANSPORTATION -- ROADS -- FREEWAYS.  </P> <P> "ENOUGH SAID."  </P> <P> TOP ISSUES  </P> <P> * Transportation -- roads -- freeways  </P> <P> * Adequate public facilities in an era of shrinking government revenues  </P> <P> * Drugs and drug education  </P> <P> * Affordable housing  </P> <P> * Quality education  </P></p>

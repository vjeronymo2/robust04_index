			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / GPA faces borrowing talks after fundraising effort fails GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing group which aborted its international public flotation in June, has been forced to begin negotiations with banks on its borrowing arrangements after failing to raise new funds from the sale of 18 aircraft leases. This latest failure to raise money has caused the unravelling of the financial strategy that the group put together with its shareholders, lenders and aircraft suppliers in the aftermath of its shelved Dollars 800m (Pounds 490m) flotation. Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder, said: 'We are conducting a matrix of wide-ranging negotiations with a significant level of interdependence and this will take time to complete.' GPA faces heavy financial commitments on aircraft that it has ordered. Its debt is believed to have risen significantly since it issued its prospectus for its failed flotation when it had borrowings of Dollars 2.7bn against shareholders' funds of Dollars 1.2bn. Its latest fund-raising efforts have been hit by investor fears that it might breach its banking covenants, and negative comments about the group published in the US. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US investment rating agency, yesterday lowered its rating on GPA's commercial paper to A-3 from A-2 and placed the rating on credit watch with negative implications, suggesting a further downgrade is possible. These factors led GPA yesterday to postpone its plans to raise Dollars 752m this month from its second issue of securitised aircraft leases, known as ALPS. This in turn has delayed the group's Dollars 350m convertible preference share issue which GPA had hoped to complete by the end of the year. GPA confirmed it was renegotiating its borrowing facilities but declined to give details.</p>

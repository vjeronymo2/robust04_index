			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Pain fears over new mobile phones PEOPLE wearing hearing aids or listening to personal stereo players risk exposure to painful noise levels when the latest generation of portable telephones is launched this year. The warning, from the European Hearing Instrument Manufacturers Association, is backed up by research carried out by Jydsk Telefon which runs one of two Danish laboratories qualified to test for 'electromagnetic compatibility', or radio interference. The studies showed that the sound level generated in a hearing aid at a distance of 1.5m from a cellular telephone handset was 130 decibels - equivalent to standing behind the engines of a jet aircraft. The studies, reported in today's issue of Microwave Engineering Europe, showed that the telephone could interfere with other electronic apparatus at distances of up to 90 metres. Television remote controls could be affected, for example, causing channels to switch unexpectedly. The new telephone systems transmit digital signals rather than the analogue radio waves used in current cellular and cordless phones. The publication said the Nice-based European telecommunications standards body ETSI has known of the problem for more than two years but has been slow to create new standards. Simple modifications to hearing aid circuitry will remove the risk, experts say, but there is no agreement on who will pay.</p>

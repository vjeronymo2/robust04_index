			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINEMAN ERIC BANDUCCI IS LATEST IN A FAMILY OF BLOCKBUSTERS  </P> <P> Three generations of Banduccis have put their shoulders to the blocking sled as  football linemen. Though they keep injuring their shoulders by blocking and  tackling, they have kept on playing -- and playing well.  </P> <P> The first of the line was the late Bruno Banducci, who played with legendary  quarterback Frankie Albert on Stanford's 1941 Rose Bowl champions. He played a  couple of years with the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL and later blocked for  Albert with the San Francisco 49ers in the early years of the All-America  Conference.  </P> <P> Bruno's son, Russ, also played for a Rose Bowl winner. He blocked for another  star quarterback, Garry Beban, when Coach Tommy Prothro's "gutty, little  Bruins" upset powerful Michigan State, 14-12, at Pasadena in 1966.  </P> <P> The latest Banducci to carry on the family tradition is Russ' son, Eric, who  starred as an offensive and defensive lineman at Santa Monica High. He hopes to  emulate his father and grandfather by playing for at least one Rose Bowl winner  after he enrolls at UCLA this fall.  </P> <P> Eric will emulate his father when he plays in the 39th Shrine All-Star Football  Game Saturday in the Rose Bowl. Russ played in the 1962 Shrine game.  </P> <P> But Eric hopes the Banducci tradition of dislocating shoulders on the football  field came to an end when he suffered such an injury as a sophomore lineman on  the Santa Monica varsity.  </P> <P> Russ Banducci said shoulder injuries are "a family trait. My father had three  operations for dislocations and had scars you wouldn't believe; they were an  inch-and-a-half wide. I dislocated my shoulder at Menlo Atherton High School."  </P> <P> Eric, The Times Westside prep lineman of the year in 1989, said he hurt his  right shoulder when he collided with a couple of opposing linemen in his team's  first league game of his sophomore season.  </P> <P> Although surgery was prescribed, he missed only one game that year, electing to  have an operation at the end of the season. He continued to play both offense  and defense with his shoulder in a harness. He learned to center the ball with  his left arm because his right arm and shoulder were tightly strapped and  immobile.  </P> <P> His days as a center will be over if he makes his mark at UCLA at defensive  guard, the position that the Bruin coaches want him to play. He said that he  has always preferred defense to offense and was able to show UCLA Coach Terry  Donahue and his staff that he can play defense when he attended Donahue's  summer camp after his junior year in high school.  </P> <P> "My real love is defense," he said. "It fits my temperament and attitude. In  the first half of (Donahue's) camp I played offensive line, and in the second  half I played defensive line. They really liked what they saw."  </P> <P> Liked it well enough to offer a scholarship to Banducci as a defensive guard,  which he quickly accepted.  </P> <P> He had narrowed down his list of schools to those in the Pacific 10 Conference,  but his first choice was always UCLA.  </P> <P> "Both my parents went to UCLA, and I was raised on UCLA football," he said. "My  mom (Sandy) and dad didn't push me, though. I loved UCLA and wanted to play for  the Bruins."  </P> <P> Banducci made an oral commitment to UCLA in December, long before the period in  which football players are allowed to sign national letters of intent.  </P> <P> Russ Banducci said that he thinks his son "was almost dangerously set on UCLA.  It's been his goal for a long time."  </P> <P> He said that he took Eric on trips to the universities of Oregon and Washington  in an attempt to "expand his horizons," but that his mind wasn't changed by  scholarship offers from those schools.  </P> <P> Russ Banducci said that he doesn't think that Donahue was influenced to give  Eric a scholarship because he and Donahue were teammates at UCLA and roomed  together briefly.  </P> <P> "It didn't help, believe me," he said. "UCLA is all business in its  recruiting."  </P> <P> Eric said that the relationship between his father and Donahue "didn't have any  impact on the situation at all. (In a UCLA dormitory), he just happened to get  stuck with my dad -- unfortunately for him."  </P> <P> He is eager to take on college offensive linemen and ballcarriers when he plays  defense for the Bruins. "Defense gives me an advantage; I can hit rather than  be hit," he said. "I feel a higher intensity when I'm on defense; I can use  more of my natural ability."  </P> <P> He was the leading tackler on the Santa Monica defensive line last season, with  42. He also had six quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. He was Santa  Monica Coach Tebb Kusserow's top nomination for The Times All-Westside prep  football team, and Kusserow said that Banducci was "an excellent blocker (with)  great strength and quickness."  </P> <P> Kusserow said he thinks that Eric "certainly has the mental attitude to play  defense; you sort of have to get yourself motivated to be a defensive lineman.  I would not be surprised if he gave a good showing of himself at UCLA. On  defense you can be a little bit more reckless; you don't have to be quite as  precise as on offense. The younger player can play more and sooner on defense  than on offense."  </P> <P> Eric said he thinks he acquired the tools necessary to play defense when he got  involved as a youngster in a wrestling program run by the late Fred Jackson,  whose sons Lawrence and Greg won several CIF-Southern Section wrestling  championships when they competed for Santa Monica. Lawrence also won three  state wrestling titles.  </P> <P> Wrestling, he said, "gave me the athletic skills for the defensive side:  balance, body control and strength. Wrestling teaches you what comes naturally,  and a lot of defense is second nature. When you don't have to think on the  football field, that's when you know you've got it right."  </P> <P> He said that he is eager to play in the Shrine game, not only because he will  be associating with the best performers in California but also because of the  opportunity to see the crippled children whom the game benefits.  </P> <P> Playing in the game, he said, will be "a big challenge. It will be a lot of  fun, and I'll be able to challenge myself at the same time. I can't wait. It  will be the experience of a lifetime."  </P> <P> "It will also be great because you get to visit the children in the hospital.  I'm really looking forward to it."  </P></p>

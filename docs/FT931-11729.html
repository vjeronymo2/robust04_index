			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: DnB considers setting up separate units DEN norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, is considering a sweeping reorganisation of its corporate structure to strengthen its healthier operations which have been weakened by five years of massive credit losses and mounting non-performing loans. The bank is considering establishing a holding company structure under which a so-called 'good bank,' its healthy operations, would be established. A 'project bank' would also be established. This would hold non-performing loans, high-risk loans and property acquired by the bank which served as collateral for loans which became non-performing. DnB has acquired property valued at an estimated NKr3bn (Dollars 437m) and owns property worth another NKr3bn. The bank also has about NKr10bn in non-performing loans. These three portfolios accounted for nearly 10 per cent of its assets at the end of last year. In November, DnB said it would establish DnB Eiendom, a separate unit under the bank's current structure, comprising real estate commitments stemming from the bank's own property, property acquired as collateral from customers unable to fulfil commitments and a substantial number of property loans which require 'special' competence. DnB Eiendom is expected to be operating this year, and if successful DnB could take a further step by reorganising into a holding company structure, but it does not expect this to happen in 1993. Although finance ministry officials have so far rejected a scheme to help revive the banks in which their bad loans would be transferred to a bank established by the state - a so-called 'bad loan' bank - the government has said it might consider proposals by individual banks to establish their own subsidiaries into which they could off-load non-performing loans. The ministry is expected this spring to present a paper on the future of the banking sector and which may provide an indication of the government's position on bad loan bank subsidiaries. The state currently owns about 70 per cent of DnB's share capital after last year providing the bank with NKr1.5bn in preference capital and a NKr600m state guarantee.</p>

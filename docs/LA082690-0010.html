			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> *** 1/2 "THE VALUE OF IGNORANCE" SINEAD O'CONNOR, POLYGRAM MUSIC VIDEO  ($19.95): ITEMS IN THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES  AND LASER DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> O'Connor and director John Maybury avoid the most obvious -- and ignorant --  approaches to filming music in this 35-minute video of a 1988 London concert.  </P> <P> Nearly all camera angles are close-ups of her famous profile; though a backing  band and crowd noise are heard, one fleeting look at the drummer is the only  non-O'Connor shot. Sound static? Hardly. All sorts of colorful, abstract visual  overlays add to and play with the black-and-white footage, somehow never  distracting from the intimate tone the Irish singer strikes on stage; it  remains baldly emotional. Johnny-come-lately fans take note: Seven of the eight  songs come from her first album, not its current successor. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

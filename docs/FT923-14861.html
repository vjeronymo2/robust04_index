			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Mandela rejects offer of talks: De Klerk accused of ignoring ANC demands on violence MR NELSON MANDELA, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday ruled out an emergency meeting offered by President FW de Klerk, saying he wanted the government first to meet ANC demands on violence. 'De Klerk has completely evaded all our demands and adopted a very negative tone which puts us in a worse position than before,' Mr Mandela said in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, after meeting President Ibrahim Babangida. 'We will only go to an emergency summit meeting if he complies with the demands we have presented.' The ANC is seeking an international inquiry into the massacre of 42 people at Boipatong near Johannesburg last month. It broke off talks in protest against government intransigence at negotiations and ongoing violence in the country. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Nigerian leader of the Commonwealth, yesterday held talks in South Africa with political leaders, signalling the prospect of increased international efforts to help resolve the deadlock. His visit follows the announcement by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, that the UN was prepared to mediate in South Africa, and talk of a visit by a troika of European Community foreign ministers. Chief Anyaoku met Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party following earlier meetings with Mr de Klerk, and with Mr Mandela, whom he saw in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, during the Organisation of African Unity summit. A delegation of business leaders yesterday also met Chief Buthelezi as part of a programme to visit all the main political leaders to encourage a quick resolution of the impasse. The South African Chamber of Business has also announced that businessmen across the country will make themselves available to monitor police responses to violence. But Mr De Klerk's strongly-worded attack on the ANC this week, in which he accused it of being an unreliable negotiating partner, leaves the two main political players set on a confrontation course. The ANC remains committed to mass action to try to hasten the transition to democracy, while the government says it will not tolerate ANC attempts to seize power. Mr Mandela said yesterday that these allegations were 'utterly false' and also rejected charges that the ANC stand on township violence was 'hard line', adding 'people must use mass action and the power they have when discussions with the authorities have become futile'. Despite the confrontational tone of government comments, contained in a letter to Mr Mandela, the path back to the negotiating table has not been shut off. An appendix to the letter sets out a number of proposed government concessions. The gulf widens, Page 6</p>

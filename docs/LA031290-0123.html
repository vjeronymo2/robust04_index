			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> W.VA. TEACHERS IGNORE GOV.'S CALL  </P> <P> Hundreds of striking teachers ignored Gov. Gaston Caperton's request to return  to the classroom today and called for direct talks with the governor.  </P> <P> The strike over pay began last Wednesday and by today had spread to 46 of the  state's 55 counties.  </P> <P> Classes were canceled in at least 27 counties for more than 150,000 pupils,  about half the state's enrollment.  </P> <P> A proposed settlement of the state's first teacher walkout collapsed over the  weekend. The largest teachers union says West Virginia has the second-lowest  teachers' salaries in the nation.  </P> <P> Leaders of the 16,000-member West Virginia Education Assn. recommended  continuing the strike until Caperton promises to call a special legislative  session to consider pay raises. But the governor said he won't consider calling  a special session until the teachers go back to work.  </P> <P> Last week, Atty. Gen. Roger Tompkins declared the strike illegal and said any  teachers who walk off the job can be suspended, fired, barred from teaching for  a year and charged with misdemeanors.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / New skills, new challenges as former miners seek work: The future outside the coalfields FITTER Peter Lawson and electrician Davy Owens were hard at work a few weeks ago at Easington colliery's G10 face, 2 1/2 miles out under the North Sea. Yesterday, the former workmates were searching for a future, leafing through the 'companies open to CVs' file at British Coal Enterprise's Job Shop in Dawdon, near Seaham, Co Durham. They are family men in their mid-30s who have worked since leaving school for British Coal in the Durham coalfield. Both say they wanted to stay in the industry all their working lives. Their pit, Easington, is one of 21 given at least a temporary reprieve by the government's promise of an independent review following the October 13 closure announcement. Yet Mr Lawson and Mr Owens are among 4,600 miners who, according to British Coal, have volunteered for redundancy since October 13 and left the industry, reducing its workforce to 46,400. 'I always said I'd be the last to leave,' says Mr Owens. So why did he volunteer now? 'It's just the fact I know it's definitely going to close.' Mr Lawson says: 'There's this air of depression going through the colliery; the men know it's going to happen.' Mr Owens decided it was best not to delay job-hunting. Hoping for work offshore, he has already spent Pounds 500 of his Pounds 27,000 redundancy money on an offshore survival course. Mr Lawson was worried the redundancy payment, normally calculated on the previous 13 weeks' earnings, might be lower if he stayed. Constant rumours of the pit's imminent demise and low morale sapped his confidence in its future. One Friday last month he asked about redundancy and was told the pit wanted to lose 15 fitters; six had so far gone. He telephoned his wife, and then, on the spur of the moment, volunteered. He left with a Pounds 25,000 payment. Now, 'mortgaged up to the hilt', with a wife, two small daughters, and another baby on the way, he is thinking of retraining as a teacher or selling insurance. Since two pits closed in East Durham since mid-1991, the Dawdon Job Shop had helped 1,200 ex-miners before the latest closures. Half are thought to have found permanent jobs. Scanning the boards yesterday, Mr Lawson and Mr Owens were optimistic, even though Mr Lawson said Job Shop counsellors had told them they would need interview skills 'for the rest of your life'. Meanwhile, miners still at work set a new productivity record - an average 6.72 tonnes of coal per man per shift last week, 16 per cent higher than the level a year ago. Productivity in the Selby Group of eight pits in Yorkshire was a national record of 12.25 tonnes a manshift and night workers at Prince of Wales colliery in Yorkshire set a European record by cutting 5,647 cubic yards of coal in a shift. The pit, which employs 700 miners, is due to be mothballed by March under British Coal's original closure plans.

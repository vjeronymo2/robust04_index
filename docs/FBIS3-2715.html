Sun made the statement while briefing reporters on the March  21- 25 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks  between Taiwan and South Africa, New Zealand, Australia,  Hungary, Chile and South Korea in Geneva.    Sun noted that the countries had long expressed their  concern  about Taiwan's prohibitions on agricultural imports from their  countries.    As a result, the COA has agreed to remove the prohibitions  within six years to facilitate its entrance into the world trade  body.    Currently, Taiwan allows the import of bananas, pineapples,  guavas, mangoes, oranges, mandarin oranges, lemons, grapefruit,  grapes, lichee, papaya, plums and longan from the US as well as  peach and persimmon imports from Europe and the US.    Taiwan also allows imports of apples from the US and Canada,  but prohibits apple imports from Japan and limits apple imports  from other countries.    The restriction has triggered protests from New Zealand and  Australia.</p>

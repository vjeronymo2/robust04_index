			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'HOLDUP,' CARSON'S LAWYERS SAY  </P> <P> Attorneys for "Tonight Show" host Johnny Carson on Tuesday called the demand  for more alimony by his first wife Joan a "baldfaced holdup."  </P> <P> "It is a vehicle to generate unfavorable and misleading publicity in an attempt  to extort money from (Carson)," attorney Stanley Arkin said in court papers  filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The papers were filed in response to Joan Carson's motions, filed last month,  for a nine-fold increase in her alimony, from $13,500 a year to $120,000 a  year.  </P> <P> Arkin said in court papers that Joan and Johnny, who met in college at the  University of Nebraska, have had virtually no contact for years. They were  married in 1949, separated in 1959 and divorced in 1963. Carson, who is in his  28th year of hosting the highly successful late-night talk show, is reportedly  paid more than $6 million a year by NBC. Divorced three times, Carson currently  is married.  </P> <P> According to court papers, Joan Carson, 61, lives at the Surrey Hotel on  Manhattan's Upper East Side and can't afford to buy a home, although she puts  her cash net worth at $388,000. "I don't have a home. I can't afford to buy a  home. I can't live on this, and I've put this off much too long," she said.  </P></p>

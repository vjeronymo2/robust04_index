			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO OFFICIALS' 'FIGHT FOR THE SPOILS'  </P> <P> Acuna's long article regarding the historic Los Angeles County redistricting  case contained a reference to a recent recall against our councilman, Richard  Alatorre.  </P> <P> There's just not much to it.  </P> <P> Acuna probably didn't have time to learn that the effort is an oddly timed,  strange and mean-spirited attack by a few people who seem to have political  aspirations themselves. But those of us who work daily in the community,  particularly with its youth, know that it's Richard Alatorre who rolls up his  sleeves to help and be of service, not the people with loud voices and selfish  interests.  </P> <P> SISTER EMMANUEL BARRAGAN  </P> <P> Barrio Action Group  </P> <P> El Sereno  </P></p>

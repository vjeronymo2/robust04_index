			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Public and private meet at the Hub: A pioneering project-finance deal in Pakistan After six gruelling years of preparation, it is finally done. The completion this weekend of a Dollars 30m share issue in Karachi effectively means the last piece of financing has fallen into place for Pakistan's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) Hub power project which will add 13 per cent to the country's generating capacity by 1997. The project, in which Britain's National Power invested Dollars 100m for a 25 per cent equity stake, will almost certainly go down as a landmark in the private sector financing of infrastructure development in the third world. Negotiated through eight changes of government in Pakistan, it required legal documentation weighing 28kg a set. So large was the cast involved that at one stage new participants found it virtually impossible to find a lawyer in London who was not constrained by conflict of interest. Out of all this has come what National Power describes as a 'trail-blazing' deal for financing private sector infrastructure projects that pioneers the use of World Bank resources. Traditionally it lends only to governments. According to Mr Patrick Crawford of Morgan Grenfell, which advised on the deal, it has also involved the first successful international equity offer for a power station which had yet to be built. Last but not least, the sponsors, including National Power and Xenel, a Saudi company which originally conceived the project, have had to reconcile awkward clashes between western banking and Islamic law which bars interest-bearing transactions. The deal was born out of the need to increase electricity supply in a country whose development has been impeded by chronic shortages of power but whose government lacks the funds to develop new generating capacity. It provides for a consortium led by Mitsui and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries to build an oil-powered thermal power station with a gross capacity of 1,292MW. It will be operated by National Power. Assembling the finance at a time when banks were unwilling to lend large amounts to developing countries was an awesome task. Essentially the structure involves a complex allocation of risk that prevents equity investors and lending banks having to shoulder too much of the burden. Of the Dollars 1.78bn raised for the project, including Dollars 220m in standby credit, only Dollars 175m has been raised from international and local equity investors and Dollars 686m from international banks. Thanks to guarantees provided by the World Bank, as well as France, Italy and Japan, the banks were spared the need to take on the political risk of default stemming from actions by the government. They have only taken on the commercial risk of the project itself. Despite its complexity, the 12-year credit proved popular and was more than twice subscribed, according to Citibank which led the syndication. A further buffer was provided through a Dollars 582m subordinated loan from World Bank's private sector energy development fund. Money from this fund is lent first to the government of Pakistan and then passed on to the project in a back-to-back transaction to get round the constraint on private sector lending by the bank. That also helped reduce the need for outside equity. The international offer was about two times subscribed and traded at the end of last week at a premium of more than 10 per cent above its issue price, according to Mr Ric Haller of Morgan Grenfell which handled the sale. Two years ago, he says, it would have been difficult to place the equity because of the troubled economic and political situation in Pakistan and because the fashion for emerging market issues had not developed. As it is, the company was able to offer the shares on a projected net real earnings yield of 17.3 per cent in dollar terms, thanks to the intricate web of operating arrangements struck by the project sponsors with suppliers and customers. 'We had to make sure that National Power was going to be able to manage the plant within the parameters that were predicted and that the government of Pakistan, no matter what its hue, would live up to its commitments,' he said. 'Where we are sitting today, we are sitting on a success story,' says Mr Daniel Woodroffe, the project's chief executive. Bankers say it nearly foundered after Pakistan's Islamic sharia court ruled in 1990 that all interest-bearing transactions must stop. That called in question the participation of local banks who were due to contribute a rupee loan for the equivalent of Dollars 100m. The then government of Mr Nawaz Sharif appealed against the judgment to the supreme court but, although the appeal has not been heard, investors have been given assurances that foreign private investors will not be affected by any change in the law. Bankers say the willingness of National Power to invest as much as Dollars 100m helped boost confidence. 'When we started, we did not have a remit to invest overseas,' says Mr Graham Hadley, National Power executive director. 'We looked at Hub as we started to move more overseas and decided that this was a project where the investment would prove attractive.' Perhaps the most daunting task of all was to assemble the various inter-dependent agreements in such a way that they would become operative at once. 'The debt was conditional on the equity and the equity was conditional on the debt, and everything was conditional on the World Bank and the sponsors. Someone had to blink first,' says Mr Haller. What unlocked the bank loan in the end was Morgan Grenfell's decision, together with its parent Deutsche Bank, to underwrite the international equity issue instead of using the more conventional book-building approach. Nonetheless the project remains a bold one. Up to 33 per cent of the power generated by Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation is lost in transmission line failures and power thefts. and many consumers have not paid their bills for years. Since coming to office last year, the government of Mrs Benazir Bhutto has promised to press ahead with new laws to punish offenders and improve the quality of transmission facilities. Investors in Hub will now wait to see whether the risk pays off. But, unlike Eurotunnel, that celebrated first-world project, Hub is running on schedule and within budget. There is every chance that Mr Hadley will be proved right when he says 'the essence of what has been done here is eminently transferable. We will get this kind of package being put together again in Pakistan and other countries as well.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] [Announcer] It seems to be the case that events  in and around Bosnia regularly reach a peak at the weekend.  Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, observer for our program and for the  INTERFAX agency, who discussed matters earlier with Russia's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, now talks about where things  have got to this time. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] There will be no air strikes  whatsoever as long as the basic reasonable demands for  safeguarding security in the zones long declared by the United  Nations -- six towns in all -- are met. Neither the Bosnian  Serbs nor the Serbs of Yugoslavia have raised objections to this.    [Voskoboynikov] There is frequent talk of lack of agreement  among Russia, the USA, and the European Union [EU] and at the  United Nations on how a settlement of the Bosnian crisis is to  be reached. Can it now be said that, following yesterday's NATO  decision, the positions of all parties regarding the way to an  agreement have somehow suddenly come closer?    [Kozyrev] No, I do not believe it should be put like that.  The fact is that it has become quite clear of late; there are  two directions for action. The first is the military one -- how  to stop the Serb fighters and what will most effectively stop  them, and what is the limit beyond which they may not be allowed  to go. But there is a second direction too -- the working-out  of a joint position by Russia, the EU, the United Nations, and  the USA. In other words, you see, it has to be clear that the  military option will lead to military disaster; whereas the  peaceful option which also exists, is no less clear and is just  as precisely coordinated by the international community. The  situation to date has been that we and the EU have taken  approaches to this matter that have been very close, in fact  almost identical. The USA, on the other hand, has up to now  been, as it were, out on its own. What we have managed to do  during this time is get the USA, too, to declare that it is  joining in the practical work. [end recording]    [Voskoboynikov] It would appear that Kozyrev is to meet U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva on 26 April, but  before that Kozyrev's deputy, Vitaliy Churkin, is to have talks  in London with his British opposite number and the U.S. special  representative [Charles] Redman. On the following day, also in  London, multilateral international consultations on Bosnia are  to be held.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                     In a clear effort to nudge Washington toward resuming dialogue,  Pyongyang has hinted at a willingness to accept additional  international nuclear inspections if they were to take place  simultaneously with the resumption of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.  Pyongyang's veiled call was accompanied by relatively muted  criticism of the arrival of U.S. Patriot missiles in the South  and Defense Secretary Perry's visit to Seoul.                                     END SUMMARY      Pyongyang used a 20 April Foreign Ministry memorandum--a vehicle  sometimes employed to stake out the DPRK's initial negotiating  position--to suggest a way out of the current nuclear impasse.  The key passage in the memorandum called for the "gradual  rebuilding" of mutual confidence through "inspections to ensure  the continuity of [nuclear] safeguards" and, "simultaneously,"  the "tackling" of DPRK-U.S. nuclear talks "with sincerity."  In  this way, the memorandum went on, Pyongyang's full return to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) will be worked out "in due  course" and the nuclear issue "can be completely resolved."  In a  conciliatory note, the memorandum also expressed "wholehearted  hope" that the issue will be settled "at an early date."  Despite its conciliatory elements, the memorandum also indicated  that Pyongyang is poised for hard bargaining.  The bulk of the  memorandum reiterated the standard North Korean argument for  Pyongyang's "special status" with regard to the NPT and attempted  to portray North Korea as a victim of an international conspiracy  led by Washington and the secretariat of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).  For example, the memorandum contended that  because Pyongyang is in a state of having temporarily suspended  withdrawal from the NPT, it is under no obligation to accept  full-scope IAEA inspections, and that North Korea's return to the  NPT and full-scope safeguards obligations are possible only after  the United States has discontinued its "policy of hostility" and  the IAEA has restored its "impartiality."      Perry Visit, Patriot Missile     Clearly attempting to avoid  further complicating the chances of resuming dialogue with  Washington, Pyongyang has so far limited its criticism of Defense  Secretary Perry's visit to Seoul and the introduction of Patriot  missiles in the South.  Monitored Pyongyang media have so far  withheld authoritative comment on these developments and low-  level media commentary has also been restrained.  Coverage of  Secretary Perry's visit that has appeared included a 19 April  commentary in the party paper Nodong Sinmun, carried by Pyongyang  radio the same day, that attempted to assign financial motives to  Secretary Perry's visit, rather than depicting it in terms of  perennial U.S. attempts to "crush" the DPRK.  The secretary, the  commentary said, is trying to find an outlet for the U.S.  "munitions industrial complex," which, it said, is facing  shrinking markets as a result of the end of the Cold War.      Similarly, in repeating the familiar argument that the Patriot  can be turned into an offensive weapon simply by switching its  warhead, KCNA on 19 April avoided using the pejorative term "U.S.  imperialists" --normal for criticism of this kind--and simply used  the designation "the United States," as did Pyongyang radio on 20  April.  By contrast, both KCNA and the radio referred to Seoul as  a "puppet clique."   (AUTHOR:  YIM.  QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENT, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, ASIA  DIVISION ANALYSIS TEAM, (703) 733-6534.)

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N poised to sell Goetze elastomers side T&amp;N, the automotive components and engineering group, is this week expected to raise more than Pounds 20m from the disposal of part of Goetze, the German piston ring producer acquired last year for DM250m (Pounds 102m). The deal is expected to involve Goetze's elastomers business, which manufactures rubber and metal bonded components. A senior official at T&amp;N indicated this could be the first of a series of non-core disposals aimed at reducing the group's Pounds 362.6m net borrowings, equivalent to gearing of 60 per cent. Such sales and improved second-half cash flow could cut gearing to about 50 per cent by the year end, the official predicted. The strategy is designed to give the group additional borrowing resources should it decide to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading German motor components producer. T&amp;N announced last month that it had agreed to acquire options on a 52.2 per cent stake in the piston and bearings company. The acquisition opportunity arose after Metallgesellschaft - the troubled German metals, mining and engineering group - decided to sell its 47 per cent holding, while Magna International, the Canadian automotive components group, is to reduce its stake from 12.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. If T&amp;N exercises its options, it would greatly strengthen its position in the German pistons market, the largest in Europe.</p>

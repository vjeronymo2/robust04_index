As is well known, a governmental delegation from  Ukraine composed of Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, Deputy  Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk, National Space  Agency General Director Volodymyr Horbulin and Deputy Minister  of Machine Building, VPK [the Military-Industrial Complex] and  Conversion Valeriy Kazakov, has returned from Washington.    Meetings were held at the Pentagon with U.S. Secretary of  Defense William Perry, at the State Department and at the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Consultations were held pertaining to the fulfillment of the  trilateral agreements among Ukraine, the United States and  Russia, cooperation between Ukraine and the United States in  conversion programs for the defense industry, the monitoring of  missile and space technologies, power engineering and the safety  of nuclear reactors.    Questions associated with the early deactivation of missile  complexes in Ukraine, among other things, were explored during  the meetings with the head of the Defense Department of the  United States, W. Perry.    American strategic missiles, as journalists were informed at  a recent press conference by Valeriy Shmarov, will no longer be  "looking" in the direction of Ukraine. A joint statement of the  governments of both countries was adopted in which their  devotion to relations of partnership, mutual trust, respect and  the development of relations in the realm of security and  defense was affirmed. The government of the United States  announced that American strategic missiles will no longer be  targeted either at Ukraine or the territory of any other  countries as of 30 May 1994.    Ukraine, in the words of U.S. Vice President Gore, has  proved  that it is a reliable and responsible partner, especially in  matters of arms control and the non-proliferation of nuclear  weapons.    Valeriy Shmarov called question number one the negotiations  on Ukraine's joining with the control regime for the  proliferation of missile technology and equipment for its  production.    The idea that Ukraine has somehow refused to participate in  that prospective area thus does not conform to reality.    A memorandum of understanding between the governments of  Ukraine and the United States was adopted on the transfer of  missile equipment and technology. This document, signed by Vice  Prime Minister Shmarov and U.S. Vice President Gore, provides  for strict monitoring of the proliferation of nuclear  technologies, the performance of joint inspections, and  consultations and an exchange of information in the event of the  transfer of missile equipment and technology. It was emphasized  that this missile technology control regime rules out the  creation of impediments to the development of the Ukrainian  national space program, or to cooperation with other missile and  space powers in that sphere.    The United States has thus de facto recognized the  right of Ukraine not only to preserve, but also to develop  further its own scientific, technological and production  potential in the missile and space field. Our country has also  been recognized as a full-fledged participant in international  cooperation and a participant in the world aerospace market.    Common missile-engineering interests exist, by the way,  between Ukraine and Russia as well. Valeriy Shmarov, answering a  question about this, stated that Russia is ordering missiles and  satellites from Ukraine. And we are ordering missile engines.    As concerns the prospects for the existence of "Ukrainian  space" programs and the participation of our state in the space  market, Ukraine will "go in" for that if it has something to go  with, and if there is a consumer for our goods... The legal  support exists today. A harsh market fight is expected. We are  already feeling pressure on the part of the American firms that  dominate the space field today, said Valeriy Shmarov.    But the Americans acknowledge today, as they have before,  that we have one of the best and cheapest launch vehicles,  especially the Zenit-3, a modification of the well-known series.  There is also a place for them in the Freedom-Mir program. It is  acknowledged that our space components have "substantial weight"  in that program. They are talking about systems for guidance,  docking, on-board systems etc. There is interest in the United  States in our developments in the field of space welding, and  problems of the effects of gravity on the person. The general  director of NASA acknowledged, during a meeting with Valeriy  Shmarov, that the United States is prepared to cooperate with  Ukraine in the world space field.    The utilization of converted launch stages is a very  attractive project. The placement of a satellite in orbit using  the launch stage of the SS-24 missile is entirely possible. The  more so as we already have a legal basis for the activity in the  missile and space sphere.    It was indicated that the Americans are implementing  conversion programs somewhat slowly. A corresponding discussion  pertained to this. The so-called "List No. 1" exists in the  United States, on which there are 35 Ukrainian enterprises that  are subject to conversion. The corresponding partners for them  are already being sought in the United States. There is also a  project being carried out by the American firm of Westinghouse  and the Ukrainian firm of Khartron (Kharkiv)--the installation  of an ASU [automated control system] for operation in  nuclear-power plants and other power-engineering projects. The  Nunn-Lugar fund allocates five million dollars, with another 20  million from Westinghouse...    We will hope that the partnership of the two nations in  conversion programs will develop in the future as well.</p>

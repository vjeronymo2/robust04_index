The conference was organized by the Washington-based  Center for Strategic and International Studies.    "In the wake of the recent successful NATO summit, the  Alliance must follow a magnanimous strategy of integration and  cooperation. The NATO summit set in motion an irreversible  process aimed at reorganizing European security," continued the  defense minister. In his opinion, for historical reasons Poland  is strongly pushing for accession to all Western institutions.    "Germany's neighbors in the East need a political shield  that  offers them security and stability. Germany fully supports the  integration process," said Ruehe.</p>

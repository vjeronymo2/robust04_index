			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LIFE AFTER DEATH;  </P> <P> FIVE SEASONS A NOVEL BY A. B. YEHOSHUA; TRANSLATED FROM THE HEBREW BY HILLEL  HALKIN (DOUBLEDAY: $19.95; 359 PP.; 0-385-23130-X)  </P> <P> Molko, the protagonist of A. B. Yehoshua's "Five Seasons," is a 50-year-old  accountant in Israel's Ministry of the Interior in Haifa who has watched his  wife die of cancer after a long, unrelieved struggle. Because his life has been  centered in the sick room for the better part of a decade, his wife's death is,  inevitably, a release, but Molko is like a trout put back into the water after  being hooked. Before swimming again, he remains immobile for a while, breathing  in and breathing out his old element, as if trying to recover a long lost  impulse.  </P> <P> So begins this extraordinary novel which tracks -- in a fluent, highly  intimate, third-person narrative -- the year in Molko's life that follows his  beloved wife's passing. The father of three children, all of them grown but the  last (a sulky high school boy who is close to being left back a grade), his  daily round includes his apartment and his job; the old people's home where his  mother-in-law (a delightfully lucid German Jew in her 80s) resides; and an  occasional visit to his mother in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Unlike his late wife, Molko has roots in Israel going back five generations in  his Sephardi family. Passive, a little overweight, a compulsive penny-counter  not above small irritations, and an innocent before getting married 30 years  earlier, he is a perfect, permeable center for a novel that begins in a dark  room and, as Molko gains confidence and autonomy, goes on to explore Paris,  West Germany, the Galilee Heights, Jerusalem, and even, in a second trip to  Germany, crosses the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> Along the way, there is much memorable evocation of land and cityscape and  attendant weather of all varieties; of opera, Tolstoy, and, most important, a  number of women. Of the latter, an old crush of Molko's Jerusalem boyhood, a  beauty who went off with a charismatic truth-seeker, and who at 50 is sadly  childless and still unformed, is, along with Molko's polar-opposite  mother-in-law, an unforgettable portrait.  </P> <P> What is the central pleasure of a good novel? Jack Kerouac, who could claim at  least one classic ("On the Road") for his authority on the subject, said it was  good companionship. By this standard, among others, "Five Seasons" is as  satisfying and rewarding a novel as I've encountered in a long time. Here is  Molko with his old crush, the tall Ya'ara who refuses to wear makeup and now  has a little pot belly that makes her resemble a question mark. Molko has  driven her to a settlement in Yodfat so she can visit the house she once lived  in with her truth-seeker, Molko's boyhood camp counselor. Standing on some  crates, Ya'ara peers in a window at the house, the scene of at least one of her  miscarriages and a long convalescence:  </P> <P> " 'But why not go inside?' he suggested. She threw him a grateful look, stepped  down from the crates, circled the house to a locked door, and groped for a  rusty key above the lintel. With a squeak, it turned in the lock. Pushing the  door open with her little belly, she stepped unhesitatingly inside. Molko  remained in the doorway, peering curiously into the house, which looked  surprisingly tidy, with its plain furniture, straw mats, and shelves full of  books and clay figurines. Who last had lived here? he wondered. Had they had  children? Ya'ara stood looking around her, tall against the low ceiling. She  looks best in this gray light, he thought as she led him to her old room,  though I'll never know her if I don't make love to her. If she would only cry  now, it would melt me so fast that sex would be no problem. Yet, though he  waited patiently, she did not. Eagerly she prowled about the room, handling  things, forgetting she was not in her own house, even opening an old closet as  if hoping to find her dead babies there."  </P> <P> The beautifully observed, transparent tenderness of this passage is one of the  hallmarks of "Five Seasons," along with virtually hundreds of small felicities  in the prose of Hillel Halkin's fine translation. The five seasons provide the  book's primary divisions, from one "Autumn" through the next one. Within these  major sections, there are frequent numbered divisions, which serve to ventilate  and pace the narrative.  </P> <P> T. S. Eliot once remarked admiringly of Henry James that he had a mind so fine  that it was unblemished by even a single idea. He was speaking, I think, of the  novelist as literature's supreme expositor of the fullest possible  moment-to-moment play of the human being, in which ideas per se can only be  another element, not a ruling design. In an age of meta-fiction, super-realism,  and all the other current strategies, Yehoshua, in his third novel, with its  shy, unassuming protagonist, has returned us to such a standard. In the opinion  of one grateful reader, he has written a masterpiece.  </P></p>

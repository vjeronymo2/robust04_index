			<p>BFN     [Text] Last year our country has traded weapons worth 12.5  billion francs. This was mentioned in a first report on arms  trade. According to a new law, every year the Belgian Government  should present a report on arms trade in our country. Only a  small part of the weapons was exported from Flanders -- the  southern part of Belgium -- Wallonia -- clearly remains the  largest weapon exporter.    A controversy on weapon deliveries to the Middle East led to  the collapse of the last Martens government. Shortly after that  the law on arms trade became stricter. Exports of weapons to  countries violating human rights or to countries where a civil  war is going on are no longer allowed. Also deliveries to  transit countries or countries involved in terrorist actions and  drugs trade are no longer possible.    The present report on arms export gives very few details,  which makes it difficult to check all the deliveries. It is,  however, sure that most of the weapons continue to go to the  Near and Middle East.    Senator of the moderate nationalist party Volksunie, Willy  Kuijpers, has said that the new law on arms trade hasn't changed  anything. Kuijpers is closely watching arms exports to Turkey  where their Army is fighting the Kurds. The senator says it is  impossible to find out whether deliveries to Turkey were  extended or not. A member of the Turkish Embassy wanted to  attend the discussion of the report in the senate, but he was  refused admittance.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: France and Germany seal deals just in time - Two financial services links TWO related Franco-German financial services deals have come to fruition at a symbolic moment: just in time to catch the opening of Europe's single market. On December 30, shareholders in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second biggest insurance group, finally approved the DM1.9bn (Pounds 780m) sale of a majority stake in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth biggest bank, to France's Credit Lyonnais. At the same time, they voted to allow Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the large French state-owned insurance company, to have full voting rights over its 25 per cent stake in AMB. The timing of the vote - reached only after last-minute uncertainties threatened to unhinge the transactions - was highly appropriate. These interlinked cross-border deals are flavoured with a dash of opportunism. But they are driven fundamentally by the opportunities provided by the single market. AGF will be able to participate in the reshaping of the German insurance market. And Credit Lyonnais will become the only foreign institution to own a large commercial bank in Germany, fulfilling a long-standing ambition to break into Europe's largest market for financial services. Significantly, international jostling to take advantage of forthcoming German liberalisation has been almost exclusively a Franco-German affair. Despite the UK's pretensions to pre-eminence in financial services, British banks and insurance companies have been on the sidelines. Germany's insurance market, Europe's biggest, with annual premiums worth DM180bn is set for considerable changes from 1994 onwards as European Community directives take effect. The directives will free commission structures in many hitherto protected sectors. Domestic institutions have already started taking positions in anticipation of these changes. Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, has bought large stakes in two insurance companies. Allianz, the market leader, is in the process of restructuring its domestic operations. Liberalisation should in theory provide opportunities for other European insurance companies. Building operations from nothing is difficult, however, mainly because establishing a distribution network is prohibitively expensive. The most reasonable approach is thus to buy - or wield influence over - an existing insurance company. Opportunities here are limited and AGF's deal with AMB - expected by analysts to lead eventually to full control - will give it the biggest stake in the German insurance market of any foreign company. If the deal between the insurance companies ended harmoniously, the path to completion was paved with confrontation. Until last summer, AMB regarded AGF's stake-building as hostile. The German company's strategy for Europe centred on a loose cross-marketing agreement with Fondiaria of Italy and Royal Insurance of the UK, from which AGF was excluded. The basis for the two insurance companies' reconciliation was that AGF would help find a buyer for BfG. This it did, by bringing in state-owned Credit Lyonnais. The transaction thus closed an important chapter in AMB's troubled venture into banking, which started with the purchase of a majority stake in BfG Bank over five years ago. The BfG purchase gives Credit Lyonnais around 200 branches in the east and west of Germany. Credit Lyonnais shares the BfG management's view that BfG is leaner and fitter than many of its domestic competitors after drastic rationalisation. AGF's tactics in its battle for AMB are being adopted by Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), another state-controlled company which is AGF's arch-rival in France. UAP is fighting for control of Colonia, one of the largest German insurers, and also recently took a 37.4 per cent stake in Nordstern, another large German insurance company. In this tussling for market share on the continent, British insurance companies are playing a much more low-profile role. However one senior French insurance executive believes the basic reason may be cultural. 'It is difficult to imagine any co-operation with a British company,' he says dismissively. 'It is a question of mentality. The British are convinced they are better than the continental Europeans, and simply cannot work with them.'</p>

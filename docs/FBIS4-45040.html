			<p>Unemployment   Statistics   <F P=102> 94AF0200E Algiers LIBERTE in French 24 Apr 94 p 9 </F> <F P=103> 94AF0200E </F> <F P=104>  Algiers LIBERTE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Oum El-Bouaghi: Specter of Unemployment"] </F>   [Text] What sort of employment policy is needed when 78.57  percent of job seekers are between the ages of 16 and 30?    The population of the wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is close to  500,000, and the growth rate is 3.06 percent, which far  outstrips the national rate (2.72 percent). As of 1993, the  labor pool was about 111,380 (including active job seekers),  which means actual jobholders in the various sectors number only  85,844.    The number of unemployed in the wilaya is 25,496 (official  figure), which means an unemployment rate of 22.08 by  conventional calculations; it also means that 5.27 percent of  the total population of the wilaya are without jobs, and only  one out of every 6 people is working, so the dependency ratio is  6 to 1.    According to the manpower office, there are 1,890 persons  seeking jobs. This figure breaks down by dairas as follows: 810  people in the daira of Ain Beida, 283 in Meskiana, 452 in Ain  M'lila, 385 in Oum El-Bouaghi (we note that the highest figure  is for Ain Beida, which is not realistic).    The actual number of job seekers is much greater. For  example, the number of youths dropped from the 3 AS high-school  rolls is 2,029--all of them good prospects for joblessness.  Young people aged 16-30 account for 78.57 percent of the  unemployment (a veritable social disaster, compared to other  wilayas in the country).    The job market for the entire wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is  about 43,000, a figure that reflects the nonexistence of statal  or private productive investment, as well as the almost total  absence of employment policy at the governmental or wilaya level.    The supply of unfilled jobs breaks down by daira as follows:  182 for Ain Beida, 96 for Meskiana, 109 for Ain M'lila, 87 for  Oum El-Bouaghi. Is this enough to resorb all the unemployment in  the wilaya? Sectorally, employment in the wilaya breaks down as  follows: 26,750 jobs in agriculture (31.14 percent), 11,256 in  construction and water works (13.10 percent), 7,282 in industry  (8.47 percent, which reflects the weakness of the industrial  sector and its marginality), and 40,596 in the tertiary sector  (which does not create jobs and economic growth).  Administration, commerce, and services account for 47.26 percent  of employment. These figures suggest there is a total lack of  industrial investments to remedy the unemployment problem.    In the face of these statistics, would it not be a good time  to give new impetus to agriculture and construction, the biggest  users of manpower? Recovery in these two sectors could alleviate  unemployment at least to some extent.    "You cannot talk philosophy with starving people. We want  something concrete," quipped one unemployed youth. An outburst  that captures well the current attitudes of youth.</p>

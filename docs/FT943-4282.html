			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Gas maintains dividend at 6.4p - Sharp drop in oil prices and lower UK gas sales contribute to fall to Pounds 630m British Gas yesterday announced that it was holding its interim dividend at 6.4p, ending, at least temporarily, speculation that it was about to cut the dividend in response to growing domestic competition and regulatory uncertainty. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the company would clarify its longer-term dividend policy on September 29, when it would disclose details of the strategic direction of the company. Analysts had suggested that British Gas might use the excuse of regulatory pressure to correct what some see as the company's over distribution. The company pays about Pounds 700m a year in dividends. Mr Brown made his comments after the company reported a reduced second quarter net loss on an historical cost basis of Pounds 4m, against Pounds 16m last time. Losses per share were 0.1p (0.4p). Second quarter figures are usually distorted by a seasonal downturn in demand. Half-year profits fell to Pounds 630m (Pounds 634m) because of lower UK gas sales and the sharp fall in oil prices in the first quarter. Earnings per share were 14.5p (14.7p) Although cold weather boosted gas sales in the company's remaining monopoly markets by 1 per cent, volumes in the competitive markets fell by 20 per cent. This was offset by a Pounds 80m increase in transportation income as TransCo, the monopoly pipeline division, benefited from increased volumes from independent gas marketing companies. Profits from exploration and production were down sharply from Pounds 196m to Pounds 138m. This was because of low oil prices and the temporary closure of the Morecambe Bay gas field, one of the company's lowest-cost reserves. The figures also include a Pounds 10m loss from Bow Valley, the Canadian subsidiary whose sale was finalised in August. Capital expenditure was Pounds 150m lower than in the first half of 1993, and would be probably be lower for the full year, according to Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director. Cash flow was boosted by disposal proceeds from the Pounds 609m sale of Consumers Gas in Canada.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- The Council for Economic  Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday [15 May] announced an  eight-point plan to help the government develop Taiwan into an  Asia-Pacific regional operations center.    If the proposals are not implemented in time, a CEPD  official  said, Taiwan will waste its "blue chips," which are integral to  Taiwan's regional operations center bid.    The "blue chips" include an exceptionally good geographical  position, a lively and diversified domestic market, and an  industrious and capable labor force, the official said.    In its plan, the CEPD said Taiwan should focus on becoming a  regional air transport hub to promote its regional operations  center bid.    The CEPD added that the ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung and  Taichung should be refurbished and an island-wide transportation  system should be developed. The government should also work to  improve Taiwan's Postal and Telecommunication Systems, as well  as living standards, the plan said.    The CEPD further recommended the government reassess its  land  policy, and accelerate development of high technology industries.    Rounding out the plan are calls to boost cultural and  recreational development, the official said.</p>

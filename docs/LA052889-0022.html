			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: BOWIE'S MACHINE: THE RETURN OF THE CHAMELEON;  </P> <P> TIN MACHINE "TIN MACHINE." EMI ****: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR  (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes. This is not the latest David Bowie album, but rather the  first LP from a new quartet of which rock's eternal chameleon is merely the  most famous member. Right.  </P> <P> Either way, this is one crushing record, recorded mostly live in the studio  with a minimum of overdubs and bristling with a cold fury. If it were a movie  it'd be titled something like "The Attack of the Giant Ice Crusher."  </P> <P> Anchored by Bowie's impassioned singing and minimal rhythm guitar work, lead  guitarist Reeves Gabriels stomps out a wailing maelstrom of white noise that's  matched by the hard-charging rhythm section of drummer Hunt Sales and his  brother bassist Tony.  </P> <P> While all 12 songs are solid (the CD and cassette contain two extra tracks),  the best moments come on a rolling, bluesy paean to the pleasures of the flesh  called "Heaven's in Here," the anti-drug "Wild Thing" knock-off "Crack City,"  and the R&amp;B rave-up "Pretty Thing," which is ostensibly about a girl but  winds up sounding like a tribute to the legendary '60s punk-blues group of that  name.  </P> <P> Then there's the anti-fascist riffslinging of "Under the God," the brutal  rearrangement of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero," the biting, "chop-it-up"  chorus of "Video Crime," and the unnerving tale-told-by-an-idiot titled "I  Can't Read." Think Kinks, think Who, Yardbirds 'n' Hendrix too. Think great  stuff.  </P> <P> A little shy on melody to go POP! perhaps, but a couple of these tunes are  destined to be classic additions to Bowie's already formidable catalogue.

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Eastern conflict IN THE EYE OF THE SUN by Ahdaf Soueif Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 791 pages THE ARAB novel in English, unlike that in French, is a rarity. This one by Ahdaf Soueif, an Egyptian who studied English literature in Cairo and Britain and lives in London, offers some intimate glimpses of Egyptian society and family life without the sometimes distorting mediation of translation. Set in Egypt and England, it makes constant reference to the ways in which the Arab world and the West perceive and misunderstand each other. Over 800 pages, In The Eye of the Sun charts the growth to maturity of its heroine, Asya, from school and student days in Cairo in the late sixties and seventies, through six years in London and at an unspecified northern English university, where Asya studies for a grindingly dull PhD, towards a final homecoming. Punctuating the life of even Asya's privileged circle are the wars and coups which accompany the reality of political repression. Meanwhile, the narrative shifts to encompass family members, as well as poorer Cairenes, from 'Am Salih, a soft-drink kiosk-owner in Giza, to Sayyida, the family servant. Despite these - sometimes moving, sometimes dutiful - gestures towards the social and political concerns characteristic of the Arabic fictional tradition, the heart of the novel lies in the relationship between Asya and a fellow-student, Saif. Its propulsion is the long-drawn-out disintegration of their marriage, which is exacerbated by Asya's own sense of cultural dislocation in England. Soueif depicts the stifling conservatism of even the most 'liberal' families with regard to their daughters' freedom: Asya's 7pm 'curfew' as a student in Cairo; her friend's suspension from college by her father for being seen walking in the street with a man. The couple conforms with a protracted engagement during which Asya's virginity is scrupulously - and against her own inclination - preserved. It is this quelling of spontaneity and passion, in favour of the postponed 'duties' of the marriage bed, to which Asya attributes her resistance to sex and the failure of her marriage, which remains unconsummated for its seven-year duration. From Cairo and Alexandria, to the freedom of Italy and the loneliness of England, Asya wrestles with the vacuity of her marriage and her desire for other men. An affair with a ludicrously overbearing and self-pitying English student, Gerald, both 'liberates' her sexually and precipitates the break with Saif. With this in some ways conventional theme of feminist 'awakening', Soueif joins other Arab women writers, including Nawal El Saadawi, Hanan al-Shaykh and Alifa Rifaat, in challenging the denial and circumscription of female sexuality. Saif, at first indulgent and affectionate, emerges as patronising and violently possessive. Tolerant of Asya's fears when he sees her as a virginal ingenue, he refuses to allow her to take the sexual initiative, leading Asya to view herself as trapped in the role of unresponsive statue. While Asya's 'infidelity' brings out Saif's patriarchal attitudes (to the extent of his beating and raping her), it is the knowledge that she initiated her affair that prompts him to leave. Like the fundamentalist student whom Asya briefly counsels in England, who thinks all women whores because they are capable of desiring men not their husbands, Saif can conceive of no woman who expresses desire who is not in his eyes indiscriminate and 'abnormal' in her lusts. Yet, for all its insights and the clarity of Soueif's prose, the novel is flawed by almost obsessive, extraneous detail and a rambling, repetitious plot, littered with false clues and lost threads. The initial promise of a broad political canvas seems forgotten until an epilogue revives some of the concerns of the novel's first 300 pages. This is a pity, since within this unsuccessfully integrated novel seem to be several more focused ones struggling for a deserved attention.</p>

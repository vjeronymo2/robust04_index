			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / NatWest wants DTI to reopen Blue Arrow case NATIONAL Westminster Bank last night made a highly unusual request that the Department of Trade and Industry should reopen its investigation into the bank's role in the 1987 Blue Arrow share issue. Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, said he wanted a new DTI inquiry into allegations, made last week in The Economist magazine, that the bank and its chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, 'misled the DTI inspectors (in the original investigation) and . . . deliberately concealed from them contemporaneous documents'. He made the request in a letter to Mr Peter Lilley, the trade secretary. A DTI official said it was too early at the moment to say whether his department would take the decision to reopen the case. He added that it was probably unprecedented for an investigation to start again: 'It has never happened in my time.' Lord Alexander said his bank found it 'difficult publicly to refute the allegations in detail'. There are a number of court cases pending on the Blue Arrow affair and the bank has been advised that 'the doctrine of contempt of court makes it inadvisable for us to argue the facts publicly'. When the DTI's original report was published, in July 1989, Lord Boardman, then chairman of NatWest, and three executive directors resigned. They went after the bank was criticised for failing for several months to disclose that it had acquired a huge exposure to Blue Arrow in September 1987, following the refusal of Blue Arrow's shareholders to take up all their rights to new shares. The DTI report implied that Mr Frost was less implicated in the affair than these other directors so he stayed on. Mr Frost said yesterday that he 'utterly rejected' suggestions that he 'knew more about the events concerning Blue Arrow in 1987 and 1988 than was disclosed to the DTI inspectors'. Allegations that Mr Frost had concealed information from the DTI inspectors were first made during the initial Blue Arrow trial, in June 1991. The barrister acting for one of the defendants, Mr Jonathan Cohen, said that a draft memo on the history of NatWest's involvement in the Blue Arrow deal, containing hand-written notes made by Mr Frost, had not been submitted to the DTI inspectors. In that trial, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, NatWest Investment Bank, County NatWest and seven individuals were accused of conspiring to mislead the stock market over the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow share issue. Three former County employees and one former P&amp;D employee were convicted, but the firms and the other individuals were acquitted. Tough line over pay, Page 9</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Merged ITV group to shed 292 jobs THE MERGED ITV company Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television yesterday announced the loss of 292 jobs, nearly a quarter of the combined workforce of the two north-east of England television companies. The company, formed in a merger earlier this year, said the job losses - spread among engineering, administrative, facilities, programme-making and house-services staff - would eliminate duplication of functions at its Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne bases. Mr Ian Ritchie, deputy group chief executive and managing director of Tyne Tees, said the 292 redundancies comprised 174 at Yorkshire, 115 at Tyne Tees and three among sales staff in London. He added that the job cuts were 'the end of it' as far as the restructuring was concerned. 'The sole reason for this particular situation was the merger,' he said. However, he could not promise that there would be no further job losses among the 947 remaining employees. The joint shop stewards committee at Yorkshire TV said: 'We are bitterly disappointed that the company sees the need to reduce staff by so many at a time when its order books are full, and at a time when YTV-made programmes are enjoying very successful runs on the network.' Yorkshire TV's agreed Pounds 30.4m takeover of Tyne Tees was approved by the Office of Fair Trading and by shareholders in August. This created the third-largest independent television company, after Thames and Central. Yesterday's job cuts should save more than Pounds 8m a year, leaving aside the one-off costs of redundancies. Although 25 programme-making jobs will go, the company insisted that safeguarding programme quality was a prime consideration. It said it was investing Pounds 10m in new transmission arrangements, programme development and enhancement of news, and would also boost its network programme development budget. The rationalisation includes the introduction of single transmission arrangements, based in Leeds, for commercials. A single facilities division and network programme operation will be created. Casualties include the Yorkshire props department and Newcastle upon Tyne canteen staff. A total of 150 jobs are to go at Lonrho Textiles plant at Cramlington, Northumberland, it was confirmed yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The company said the job cuts were being made to maximise the benefits of a Pounds 24m investment over the last four years in new technology and equipment. The Cramlington site, a wholly owned Lonrho subsidiary employs 950 people and specialises in production of household linens.</p>

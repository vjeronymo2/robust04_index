P. </F> Kolenenkov; UDC 550.4:546.7:796(476)]    [Abstract] While areas of primary introduction of  radioactive materials have been studied, secondary regions  (where radioactive material has been introduced by geological  and geochemical processes) have not. Studies of the rivers of  southeast Belarus revealed the collection of radioactive  material in sedimentation of terrigenic material, from organic  and clay formations, and in soils in the humus, ortstein, and  illuvial layers, as well as in various alluvial facies.    Channel central, and terrace flood plains were studied, as  well as terraces above the flood plain. A table lists the  location (geological formation), facies conditions,  precipitation, the isotope and concentration, and examples of  specific locations in Belarus. The ratio of present  radioactivity to the 1986 and 1989 background is 2-5, and more  rarely, 10. However, higher levels may be found along  shorelines. Wind and water drive dust particles and aerosols to  shorelines where they accumulate. It is recommended that  radiometric surveying be done every 5-7 years.

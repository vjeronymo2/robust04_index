			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jolanta Koral: "Trilateral Dispute Over </F> Popiwek"]    [Text] The government, trade unions, and employers failed  to come to an agreement yesterday on lifting the neopopiwek  [enterprise tax on above-normative pay]. Trade unions and  employers do not want the neopopiwek to be reinstated, whereas  the government insists that the neopopiwek be in force until the  end of the year.    Abandonment of the neopopiwek is one of the main demands put  forward by Solidarity during its strikes. The All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement [OPZZ] and other trade union centers also agree  with the demand.  <H5>  Strikes Continue </H5>   Solidarity is dissatisfied with the results of talks within  the trilateral commission. "There is no reason to stop the  strike action," Ewa Lewicka of Solidarity told GAZETA WYBORCZA.  "There is almost nothing we have managed to resolve completely,  the government failed to come up with specific solutions, and a  time schedule for meeting the demands of Solidarity, on which  stopping the strike action depends, has not been agreed upon."    "Strikes as an invitation to talks place the government in a  very difficult situation," Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor  minister and the commission's chief, told journalists.  <H5>  OPZZ Will See To It? </H5>   The government insists that the popiwek be reinstated now so  as to prevent an eruption of inflation. It will be possible to  lift the popiwek no sooner than the beginning of next year.    But employers and trade unionists do not fear excessive  increases in salaries. OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej Manicki has  told GAZETA WYBORCZA that, if the popiwek becomes law, the OPZZ  will file a lawsuit with the Constitutional Tribunal. "We will  see to it that salaries do not rise by more than the 27 percent  contained in the budget. Other trade unions should also reduce  employee appetites for the popiwek," Manicki declared during the  commission's session.    "Over 200 trade unions are active in Poland, but there are  only a few talking in this meeting hall," replied Deputy Finance  Minister Waldemar Manugiewicz. "How does the OPZZ plan to go  about managing the salary situation in all of the enterprises?"  <H5>  Flexible Abandonment of the Popiwek </H5>   Despite this lack of agreement over the popiwek, Solidarity  will talk within the commission about abandoning it, by, among  other means, introducing a regulation of salaries through  collective agreements and through commercialization of  state-owned enterprises.    The commission determined that the government will address  the Sejm Presidium to have parliament adopt the so-called  Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code as soon as possible (this is  provided for by the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises). The  chapter provides that the most important employee issues--such  as salaries, working conditions, and so forth--should be decided  jointly by employers and employee representations.    Adopting the law is indispensable for a lifting of popiwek.  Then salary increases would no longer be directed centrally but,  instead, would depend on collective agreements within  enterprises.    What would also happen is that the current automatic  dependence of salary increases in the production sector on such  increases in the budget sector would be eliminated. Solidarity  wants salaries for budget sector employees to be dependent on  increases in the GDP.    In addition, valorizations of retirement and other kinds of  pensions would be based not on increases in average salaries the  way they are now but, instead, on increases in prices and in  living expenses. (The government is supposed to present its  proposals on this issue as soon as possible.)  <H5>  Companies Full Speed Ahead! </H5>   According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister  Andrzej Zebrowski, a commercialization of state-owned  enterprises is a precondition for a lifting of the popiwek (the  government has preliminarily approved of a draft law). The  commercialization would be about gradually transforming the  enterprises into companies of Commercial Law--for instance, into  share companies--in which the state would participate.    The government would start with the most efficient  enterprises first. Those enterprises that have economic losses  would be subjected to supervision by contract managers before  they are commercialized, which would make it possible to improve  their financial results. The worst enterprises would simply be  dissolved, but only after a plan for a further management of  their wealth is prepared.    In the companies, supervisory boards would be set up, which  would conclude collective agreements. A decision was made that  the government is supposed to come up with proposals concerning  the commercialization of enterprises by 15 June.    On 16 May, in turn, the commission will be dealing with a  draft law on the privatization of state-owned enterprises (this  is one of the laws making up the Agreement on State-Owned  Enterprises). Among other things, the draft law describes the  principles of employee participation in the privatization of an  enterprise.  <H5>  A Time Schedule? Not Yet </H5>   According to Solidarity, commercialization will go on for  years, whereas salaries should be shaped through collective  agreements and not through the popiwek. That is why Solidarity  wants the popiwek to be lifted as soon as possible through the  adoption of Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code.    When asked about the impact of talks within the trilateral  commission on the strikes, Longin Komolowski, a member of the  Solidarity National Commission and of the strike headquarters,  replied: "We have not reached the stage yet where we would be  ready to accept a time schedule for working on the trade union's  demands."    Let us recall that Solidarity has been making the end to the  strike action dependent on approving such a time schedule and on  the government's specific proposals and measures.  <H5>  What They Managed To Agree Upon </H5>   The government agreed to meeting the demand by Solidarity  that people who compute their taxes along with their spouses be  able to make the lowest amount of advance tax payment. Deputy  [Finance] Minister Manugiewicz reported that the Finance  Ministry has already prepared a legal measure regarding the  issue, and the commission is due to debate it on 16 May. The  government also approves of the idea that, effective in 1995,  tax breaks be introduced that would take into account the cost  of commuting to work (the government is to submit its proposals  soon.)    On 16 May, the commission is also scheduled to deal with a  second batch of demands by Solidarity: a popular enfranchisement  of citizens, reducing the workweek to 40 hours, social support  for the poorest families, and salaries for budget-sector  employees.    Solidarity initially refused to agree to the 16 May date.  "It is too late," the trade unionists said. They insisted that  this amounts to a violation of the Konin agreement. They made  it clear that the strike may spread even further by 16 May. The  government was trying to convince the trade unionists that it  needs the time to prepare its proposals. But, in the end,  Solidarity was outvoted on the issue.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Car sales could rise by 70,000, says industry - New car tax halved to 5 per cent - Car excise duty up to Pounds 110 NEW CAR sales could jump by about 70,000 a year as a result of yesterday's Budget which cut the rate of car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, the motor industry forecast yesterday. The Budget was warmly welcomed by carmakers and dealers, who have suffered in the past two years as new vehicle sales have plunged during the recession. The halving of special car tax is expected to cut the cost of a Pounds 10,000 family car by about Pounds 400, and will reduce the total tax rate on new cars (including value added tax) to 22.4 per cent from 27.3 per cent. Mr Geoffrey Pelling, general manager of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'We welcome the fact that the chancellor has recognised the importance of the sector and the need to give it a positive boost.' Last night Ford, the UK new car market leader, signalled the possible start of another price war by announcing price cuts over and above the cut in special car tax. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said 'radical action' on the part of manufacturers and dealers was needed to encourage consumer confidence. 'The measures the chancellor has proposed are welcome, but we decided that further action was needed by us to stimulate the new car market in Britain.' New car sales last month were 12 per cent lower than in the same month a year ago and have plunged by 42.4 per cent in the past three years. Ford had a record loss last year and has suffered a steady erosion of its market share. It said it was cutting the price of about 30 per cent of its range. The list price of the Fiesta base model will be cut by 10.5 per cent while the price of several other Fiesta and Escort models will be cut by about 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent. Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said the Budget measures could add 60,000 new car sales in the UK this year. The company raised its forecast for UK new car sales this year to 1.73m from 1.67m. In addition to the halving of special car tax, which is effective from today, other measures were welcomed by carmakers in the most positive Budget for the motor industry in years. These include: the raising of company car taxation scale charges only by the rate of inflation, the introduction of company car tax scales based on price rather than engine size 'as soon as practicable', the capital allowances available for business cars are to be raised from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 12,000, taxi, car hire companies and driving schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on their cars. The green lobby and public transport groups reacted with astonishment to some of the changes, saying they seemed designed to encourage more use of the roads at the expense of public transport. The main surprise was the increase to Pounds 110 of vehicle excise duty which had been Pounds 100 since 1985.</p>

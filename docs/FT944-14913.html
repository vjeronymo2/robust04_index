			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Watch out for the garlic - Innovation in the UK food sector Garlic growers of France, beware. Consumption of the pungent bulb in southern England has overtaken that of northern France, largely thanks to one enthusiastic grower on the Isle of Wight. Mr Colin Boswell has turned his Mersley Farms into one of the biggest garlic producers in northern Europe in the 15 years since he diversified out of sweetcorn. Britain's first indigenous garlic grower, he is now the country's leading supplier of fresh and prepared garlic products. His innovative approach - which includes his own brand of Smoked Garlic Butter - won him a national award for food marketing this week. British farmers are much criticised for failing to market their produce successfully, and the awards are designed to raise standards and help reduce the UK's food and drink trade deficit of nearly Pounds 6bn (Dollars 8bn). 'Mersley Farms is a clear example of a producer who has become simply the best in his field,' said Mr Colin Smith, fresh produce trading director at Tesco, the supermarket group which sponsored the food awards. 'Not only is Colin Boswell wholly committed to his exceptional product, but he has shown clear marketing expertise in creating a range of added-value garlic products.' Beating the French at their own game proved a winner for two other British producers. Mr Julian Temperley, owner of a large area of cider orchards in Somerset, wanted to add value to his product because of increasing competition in cider production. So he created the first commercially produced cider brandy in Britain for three centuries. The Somerset Cider Brandy Company makes 15,000 bottles a year of Somerset Royal, which is similar to Normandy Calvados but has the distinctive flavour of Somerset apples. Tuddenham Hall Foods of Suffolk decided there was a market for tender English asparagus that could be eaten from tip to base and they managed to double turnover of their pre-packed delicacy in two years. Food buyers agree that British farm produce is of a high quality but complain they cannot always obtain the quantity they need when they need it. Mr Mike Bunney of Adas, the government's agricultural advisory service which sponsored the awards, said: 'Marketing is not strong among quite a chunk of the industry, who fail to differentiate their product from their competitors.' But he added that more farmers and processors were tailoring their product to their customers' needs. One Somerset meat producer, Peninsular Pigs, received an award for its successful collaboration with Marks &amp; Spencer, supplying the retailer with all the fresh pork it sells. 'Peninsular Pigs had clearly thought very hard about their market, and, by talking to the retailer, spotted an opportunity for meat of a superior eating quality, reared outdoors under a strictly controlled, welfare-friendly system,' said Mr Jeremy Finnis of the ministry of agriculture, which sponsored the award.</p>

The reason for the postponement was to brief lawyers about  the case before the hearing.    The court met under the chairmanship of Judge Salah al-Fahd  and listened to the witness Abd al-Hamid al-Shatti, a Kuwaiti  national who works at the Ministry of Interior. The witness  said that when one of the accused was arrested he confessed that  he was trained by Iraqi intelligence to assassinate Bush and  blow up vital and crowded Kuwaiti locations.    He stressed that after the investigations and interrogations  it became clear that Iraqi intelligence had provided the two  main suspects: Wali al-Ghazali and Salim Nasir, with what was  needed, referring to their confession that they were Iraqi  intelligence personnel.</p>

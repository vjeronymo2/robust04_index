			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Relief for home owners welcome HOUSEBUILDERS, mortgage lenders and estate agents welcomed yesterday's cut in interest rates - but warned that it was only a small step in the right direction. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said that it would take much more than 1 point or 2 points off interest rates to stimulate a recovery in Britain's depressed housing market. Tarmac, which yesterday announced a Pounds 15m first-half pre-tax loss, said it planned to cut the number of homes it builds by up to a fifth next year. 'Interest rate cuts, although important, will not on their own encourage people to rush out and buy homes when they are concerned about whether they might have a job in six months' time,' Mr Simms said. 'The government will need to introduce measures other than just interest rate cuts if it wants to get confidence back in the housing market and economy as a whole.' The Building Employers Confederation said it was looking for a further cut of 1 percentage point in base rates as soon as possible. It said: 'Having freed itself from the ERM straitjacket, the government should seize the opportunity of taking bold and positive steps to stimulate the economy, beginning with the housing and construction sector.' The confederation wants the government to raise the ceiling for mortgage tax relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000 and remove stamp duty from house purchases. Housebuilders have pointed out that the US housing market remains very weak even though US interest rates have been cut to 3 per cent and mortgage rates to 6 per cent. Mortgage lenders, although encouraged by yesterday's reduction in interest rates, also remain cautious about prospects of an early revival of the housing market. They say prices are likely to stay depressed even when sales pick up - such is the overhang of properties waiting to come on the market. At least 70,000 repossessions are expected next year, in addition to 40,000 unsold repossessed homes on the books of the mortgage lenders. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'The best that can be expected is that house prices may stabilise next year. 'People are not going to rush back into the market.' Leeds Permanent, one of only two societies that pressed ahead with mortgage rate cuts of 0.75 per cent yesterday, nonetheless described the cuts as great news for borrowers and the housing market. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is due tomorrow to publish a survey of estate agents which will show that the depression in the housing market is deeper than ever. It said: 'The cut in base rates will help relieve the pain for hundreds of thousands of mortgage payers. 'It is a step in the right direction which we hope, as soon as ant-inflationary policy allows, will be followed by further cuts.' Lex, Page 20 Tarmac results, Page 21</p>

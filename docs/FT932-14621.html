			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Inflation rises to 1.9% as retailers lift prices THE rate of UK inflation nudged higher last month, buoyed by food, clothing and shoe price increases. Economists, however, believe the introduction of the council tax this month will have a downward influence on the retail prices index. Prices rose by 0.4 per cent in March, compared with February, taking the annual rate to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent. The underlying measure, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose to 3.5 per cent in the year to March, from 3.4 per cent. The latest figures indicate that retailers are more confident about raising their prices as consumer confidence recovers. Clothing and footwear prices, for example, rose by 1.9 per cent last month compared with February, and by 0.3 per cent year-on-year, the first increase in the annual rate for four months. Sharper food price rises than a year ago also affected the index. The rise in inflation led dealers in the money markets to take the view that the UK government would not cut interest rates below the present 6 per cent. For the first time since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, prices in the sterling cash and futures markets implied that base rates would move upwards from their present levels. Three-month interest rates in the sterling cash market - often seen as a bellwether of future rate movements - rose more than   1/16 of a percentage point to close at 6 1/16 per cent. The cost of borrowing sterling for one year moved up even more sharply, to 6 3/16 per cent, from a previous close of 5 7/8 per cent. The gilt-edged market also reacted badly to the news, with long-dated gilts shedding a point on the day. The Treasury said it was 'unconcerned' at the official figures from the Central Statistical Office. 'We have said all along that there will be a slight rise in the underlying rate as a result of the devaluation of the pound, but there is still downward pressure on inflation,' it said. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said inflation had started to rise. 'By the end of the year it will be considerably higher than that of most other major industrialised countries.' Although prices often rise in April, it is possible that the annual inflation rate will drop back this month as the council tax replaces the poll tax. Council taxes are generally expected to be lower than the poll tax and statisticians said its introduction would exert a downward influence on the index. Some economists, however, said the sharp increase in clothing and footwear prices heralded renewed inflationary pressures. Mr Leo Doyle, of Kleinwort Benson, said: 'As the economy gathers strength, it is going to be harder to repress the inflationary potential that devaluation entails.' The official figures add to evidence that the UK economy is recovering. They come after a sharp monthly increase in manufacturing output, and a big rise in house sales in the first quarter of the year.

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> GROUPS SUE TO BLOCK 1,800-HOME PROJECT  </P> <P> Homeowners who filed suit against the city this week to stop an 1,800-home  development hope a precedent set in Los Angeles will help save 727 acres of  rolling hills in northeast Orange.  </P> <P> In July, Altadena residents won a suit against Los Angeles County and halted a  272-home project in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. A judge ruled  that the environmental impact report for the project was invalid because the  county had allowed the developer to conduct the environmental review.  </P> <P> Attorney Deborah S. Bucksbaum, who represents the Mabury Ranch Homeowners Assn.  and the Peralta Hills Alliance in their suit against the city, also represented  the Altadena residents.  </P> <P> Bucksbaum said the Los Angeles court determined that state regulations require  environmental studies to be prepared "directly by or under contract to" the  city or county agency.  </P> <P> The homeowners' effort to reverse City Council approval of the Serrano Heights  project is similar to the Los Angeles suit, Bucksbaum said, because the city  allowed the Woodcrest Development Co. to hire a consultant to prepare the  environmental impact report.  </P> <P> "The city is relying on someone who has a financial stake in the project to  determine what the environmental hazards are," Bucksbaum said.  </P> <P> But Frank Elfend, president of Elfend &amp; Associates, the consulting firm  that conducted the environmental review, said it is not unusual for a city to  allow a developer hire the consultant to conduct preliminary environmental  studies.  </P> <P> Elfend said his company drafted only an initial report and then turned the  information over to the city for changes, in accordance with state regulations.  </P> <P> City Atty. Furman B. Roberts said late Thursday that his office still had not  reviewed the homeowners' suit.  </P> <P> Members of the homeowner groups said the lawsuit is a way to draw attention to  their concerns about preserving wildlife and one of the city's last remaining  ridgelines.  </P> <P> "Despite all the opposition (to the project), the City Council still voted for  this," said Lisa Lewis, whose Anaheim Hills home is near the development site.  "So this was the next logical step. Had they given credence to what we had to  say, we maybe wouldn't be here now."  </P> <P> The plan, years in development, calls for massive grading of a ridge north of  Mabury Ranch and south of Anaheim Hills and would require moving some 12  million cubic yards of earth, according to planning reports. Some hills may be  cut by up to 150 feet, while canyons may be filled up to 170 feet, according to  planning reports.  </P> <P> The project also guarantees 476 acres of permanent open space, a fully  developed four-acre park and the extension of Serrano Avenue, providing a  four-lane street connecting Orange and Anaheim.

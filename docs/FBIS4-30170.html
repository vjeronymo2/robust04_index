A meeting of activists of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters  of Chongnyon was held at the Korean Hall in Kyoto on June 18.    The meeting made a mid-term review of the struggle of the  Chongnyon officials and compatriots to frustrate the Japanese  reactionaries' suppression of Chongnyon and discussed measures  to invigorate the patriotic work of Chongnyon on the basis of  the achievements and experience of the "three-month movement for  defending the rights of compatriots."

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Groupe Fournier in talks to buy laboratory Groupe Fournier, the French pharmaceuticals, chemicals and adhesives group, yesterday said that it was in an advanced stage of negotiations concerning the acquisition of some of the pharmaceuticals activities of Pharmacia of Sweden. The negotiations involve the purchase of the pharmaceuticals operations of Pierrel Pharma Laboratories, a division of Pharmacia, which was formerly part of Sweden's Procordia group. Groupe Fournier said the planned acquisition was aimed at strengthening its position in the Italian pharmaceuticals market. Pierrel Pharma is based in Milan and would be linked with Groupe Fournier's existing Italian interests, including Farmasister. A statement from Groupe Fournier said that it was under-represented in Italy, Europe's third largest drugs market. It said the company regarded Italy as an important strategic market in spite of the introduction of health care reforms aimed at reducing the level of health and pharmaceuticals expenditure. Groupe Fournier achieved sales of about FFr2.9bn (Dollars 491.5m) last year, about one third of which came from its pharmaceuticals businesses.</p>

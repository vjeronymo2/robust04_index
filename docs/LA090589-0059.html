			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICE, MCA PLAN STAMP-MOVIE PROMOTION;  </P> <P> ADS FOR DINOSAUR ISSUE WILL MENTION 1988 FEATURE FILM 'LAND BEFORE TIME'  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service will help a movie company push sales of its latest  video release by offering its newest series of stamps as a promotional tool.  </P> <P> In the first marketing venture between the post office and a private company,  the agency will mount a multimillion-dollar ad campaign that simultaneously  promotes the stamps depicting dinosaurs and MCA Inc.'s video release of "Land  Before Time," a 1988 feature film about a dinosaur. In turn, the home-video  division of MCA, the parent of Universal Pictures, will promote the movie and  the stamps in its own ads  </P> <P> The four new dinosaur stamps themselves won't carry advertising for the movie;  they were created before the Postal Service and MCA agreed to the  cross-promotion this summer. But the agency will tell consumers about the movie  in its television and magazine ads and has given MCA permission to use its  eagle logo and facsimiles of the stamps in MCA's advertising for "Land Before  Time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase Stamp Sales  </P> <P> In addition, MCA will provide buttons to Postal Service employees that show the  stamps with the movie's main character, an animated dinosaur named Littlefoot,  and will place promotional material in about 30,000 post offices around the  country.  </P> <P> The Postal Service won't receive any of the proceeds from sales of the  videocassettes or from MCA's use of its stamps and logo, said a spokesman.  Instead, the tie-in is designed to increase sales of the dinosaur series during  National Stamp Collecting Month.  </P> <P> "The idea is, the more stamps we sell the longer we can go between rate  increases," said Peggy Grant, general manager of the service's philatelic  marketing division. Postmaster General Anthony Frank said recently that  first-class postage could be raised to as much as 32 cents to cover a projected  $1.5-billion deficit next year.  </P> <P> The Postal Service's recent efforts to engage the private sector to help it cut  costs has met with controversy. In June, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. kicked the  Postal Service out of 11 Sears stores in the Midwest after the American Postal  Workers Union charged that Sears employees were running "mini-post offices" in  the stores. And earlier this year, several companies complained that the  service violated federal contract-bidding procedures by hiring Texas  billionaire H. Ross Perot as a consultant. The contract with Perot was  eventually nullified.  </P> <P> A congressional staff member familiar with the Postal Service's operation said  the MCA advertising tie-in raised questions about the service. "I don't know  how or where they're going to draw the line on something like this," said the  staff member, who asked not to be identified. "The Postal Service issued a Lou  Gehrig stamp; does that mean someone marketing a baseball movie is going to get  a tie-in too? I don't know whether deals like this make sense."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Formal Guidelines  </P> <P> But Michael Laurence, an editor of Linn's Stamp News, a stamp collectors'  publication, said: "Anything that brings stamp collecting to the attention of a  broader audience is a good thing. Everyone in the stamp collecting community  wants to sell his stamp collection eventually."  </P> <P> Grant said the Postal Service has no formal guidelines for establishing  commercial tie-ins and is considering other ventures. "We just thought (the  movie) had a nice appeal and it was a good fit" with the dinosaur stamps. She  added that there has been very little criticism for the MCA venture so far.  </P></p>

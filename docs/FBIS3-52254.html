			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 1 Jan (INA)--Reports from the Kurdistan  Autonomous Region in northern Iraq say more than 110 persons  have been killed in the ongoing battles between the group of  agent Jalal al-Talabani, agents of America and Britain, and the  group of Khalid 'Uthman Barzani, agents of Iran. Hundreds of  civilians have been wounded in this fighting.    In a report published here today, AL-JUMHURIYAH's  correspondent in Ninawa quotes these reports and people coming  from al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil Governorates as saying that more  than 56 people were killed in these battles over the past week.  AL-JUMHURIYAH's report adds that the number of those killed  over the past week is more than those killed over the past two  months, that is, since the beginning of the fighting between the  two agent groups.    AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the agent groups -- which control  the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq under the protection of  the allied forces and aircraft that take off from southern  Anatolia -- are hiding the number of civilian casualites. It is  believed, the paper adds, that the number of victims is  increasing now that the fighting has extended from the military  areas, which are under the control of the two groups, to  villages and subdistricts in al- Sulaymaniyah and Irbil  Governorate.    The reports added that over the past two weeks  al-Sulaymaniyah was the target of arbitrary shelling from  launchers and mortar guns. The reports said the shelling, which  lasted for more than 10 straight days, resulted in the killing  and wounding of hundreds of people and the destruction of houses  and mosques.    AL-JUMHURIYAH's correspondent noted that Irbil's streets are  full of bodies and burned vehicles. He added that shops and  markets were looted during the barbaric shelling.</p>

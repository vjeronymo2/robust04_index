			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / West gives ex-Soviet republics respite on Dollars 3.2bn debt WESTERN creditor nations have agreed to give the republics of the former Soviet Union breathing space to the end of this year to repay loans totalling Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.75bn), Reuter reports from Paris. The agreement by 17 rich industrial nations at the weekend confirmed in detail an earlier accord struck at the end of November by the Group of Seven industrialised countries. 'The participating countries decided. . . to grant a deferral of payments on principal only, on medium- and long-term external debts contracted before January 1 1991, falling due from December 5 1991 to the end of 1992,' a statement said. The creditors said they would review at the end of March whether the former Soviet republics were implementing economic reforms drawn up with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The deferral would continue if they met conditions which included keeping up to date with the repayment of debts excluded from the agreement. A senior French official said the group estimated that the former Soviet Union owes Dollars 65bn, considerably below earlier public estimates of Dollars 80bn, to the outside world in debts. Of the Dollars 65bn, about Dollars 32bn is owed to the 17 nations that agreed to the deferral, the official said. The basis for the agreement was a pledge by eight of the republics to accept shared responsibility for Soviet debt. The agreement, which does not apply to short-term loans, follows a similar one reached last month by commercial banks. The western creditors urged other republics to follow suit. 'The participating countries (in the Paris meeting) expect that all other successors in the former USSR will rapidly join in this memorandum,' the Paris statement said. It made clear that if they do not agree to share the responsibility, they risk being cut off from vital western trade credits they need to revive their shattered economies. 'The countries stated that when considering whether to provide additional export credits to the republics, they would take into account whether the republics' had agreed to help shoulder the debt, the statement added. A senior French official said the group of creditors did not expect the former Soviet Union to need a full-blown rescheduling of its debt because it was manageable, considering the potential wealth of the country. The political significance of the accord dwarfed important debt reschedulings in the past such as those for Mexico and Brazil, the official added. 'In many respects, it's the most important we've ever had.'</p>

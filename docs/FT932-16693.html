			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / UK brewers top list for dear beer THE LIST prices which British brewers charge trade customers are the highest in Europe, while the UK is the only country whose brewing industry has failed to improve its productivity in recent years, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers. The UK trade price of canned and bottled standard lager, at Pounds 117 per hectolitre (hundred litres) is twice the level in France and the Netherlands, the two cheapest countries, according to a study by the broker. The UK list price of draught lager, at Pounds 85 per hectolitre, compares with prices as low as Pounds 47 in France and Pounds 56 in Spain. The study, based on exchange rates prevailing in the middle of last month, compares prices of popular lagers of similar quality and alcohol content, including Heineken, Stella Artois and Holsten. The prices exclude tax and do not take account of discounts, which have recently widened in the UK to as much as 65 per cent. However, Mr John Wakely, author of the study, says special deals for trade customers are common in most of Europe. The study says German brewers cite a list price of Pounds 115 per hectolitre for draught and packaged lager supplied direct to trade customers - the same as charged by their wholesalers. However, it says the prices which the wholesalers pay the brewers are much lower. The study finds that brewers' productivity increases, measured by hectolitres per employee, ranged from 3 per cent in Norway to 23 per cent in Ireland between 1989 and 1991. However, it fell 11 per cent in Britain, the only European country to suffer a decline. High transport costs have limited beer imports to less than 10 per cent of total consumption in most European countries. But Mr Wakely argues that cross-frontier competition is set to grow, and will be encouraged by large price differentials between countries. He says these are so large at present that Bavaria, a Dutch brewer, finds it profitable to ship inexpensive private-label beer in volume to retail customers in Spain. He forecasts that declining beer consumption, due to changing demographic trends, health concerns and tighter regulation, will lead to steadily increased pressure on European brewers to look beyond their national markets. The study expects some of the most aggressive cross-border competition to come from Germany.</p>

"Realising that the ardent desire of journalists to cover  the  work of our parliament reflects the Russian society's interest  in its proceedings, we are doing our best to create proper  conditions for the press," she stressed, adding that "this task  is far from easy so far".    The duty of the Russian parliament's press service "is to  provide journalists, in keeping with the press law, with all the  information they need". "The Press Centre has been provided with  several rooms within the building of the former Council of  Mutual Economic Assistance, where the State Duma will be housed,  including the smaller conference hall, which will be switched on  to the television and radio relaying systems," Lantseva said.  "However, these premises will hardly be sufficient, especially  for the work of news services," she added.    "The question of whether or not meetings of the parliament  will be shown on TV and broadcast across the country, as it was  the case with the former Supreme Soviet, is to be decided by the  MPs themselves," Lantseva noted. The Press Centre is drawing up  proposals for contacts with the "Ostankino" TV company and the  Russian Television. Today, the press service, which consists of  less than ten officials, is preparing equipment and other  facilities for the future Press Centre. Accreditation cards  have been ordered and will soon be received in Moscow. The  Press Centre plans to issue a reference book, listing parliament  members with their photographs and other information, including  political likings and number of children, similar to the  reference manual used in the German Bundestag.    "The question of premises for journalists at the Council of  the Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament has  not been settled yet," Lantseva said. She said it could be  raised only after the press building is transferred to the upper  chamber of the Federal Assembly.</p>

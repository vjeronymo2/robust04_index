			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission requests comment concerning the proposed treatment of investee pools. In particular, commenters are invited to address any special public policy or disclosure considerations presented by tiered investment structures by means of which a commodity pool can, in effect, appropriate the value of a second fund's management by investing all or a portion of its funds in the second fund. The Commission also requests comment concerning whether any additional protections, other than disclosure of applicable fees, are appropriate in light of the ``layering'' of fees that typically occurs at each level of a fund of funds structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Risk Disclosure Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 4.21 currently requires that disclosure documents include a prescribed bold-face statement alerting prospective pool participants to the risks involved in participating in a pool. This statement does not specifically address the risks of trading foreign futures or foreign option contracts. The risks attributable to foreign futures and foreign options were originally required to be addressed by a special disclosure statement, set forth in part 30 of the Commission's regulations, which generally governs transactions in foreign futures and foreign options. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, a CPO offering a pool expected to trade foreign and domestic futures or options was required to include in the disclosure document the Rule 4.21 risk disclosure statement, which does not refer to foreign futures or options, and the Rule 30.6 foreign futures and options risk disclosure statement. However, Rule 1.55, the basic risk disclosure requirement applicable to FCMs and IBs opening accounts for domestic futures and option contracts, was recently amended to consolidate the required disclosures concerning foreign futures and options into the domestic risk disclosure statement, and the separate Rule 30.6(a) disclosure statement was eliminated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consequently, under the revised Rules 1.55 and 30.6, CPOs and CTAs offering pools and accounts, respectively, which may engage in foreign futures and option transactions would be required to include the new consolidated Rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement as well as the part 4 risk disclosure statement in the disclosure document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Rule 30.6(a) statement was required to be provided by FCMs and IBs to clients opening foreign futures or foreign option accounts and, pursuant to Rule 30.6(b), by CPOs and CTAs trading foreign contracts for their pool or clients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 17495 (April 5, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is proposing to address the potential for duplicative disclosure created by the recent rule revisions and to eliminate the necessity for providing two prescribed risk disclosure statements by revising the part 4 risk disclosure statements for CPOs and CTAs to address the risks of foreign as well as domestic transactions. Rule 30.6(b) would be revised to cross-reference the part 4 statement. In addition, the terms ``domestic'' and ``foreign'' previously used to refer to contract markets or exchanges in foreign jurisdictions are proposed to be replaced with the terms ``United States'' and ``non-United States'' to avoid confusion in the context of offerings in non-United States jurisdictions to non-United States participants for whom the term ``foreign'' does not mean ``non-United States''. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rule 1.55 would also be amended to provide that pools need not be treated as customers for the purposes of delivery of the risk disclosure statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 54 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This discussion also applies generally to CTA disclosure documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

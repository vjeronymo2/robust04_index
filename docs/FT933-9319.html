			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Tandy disappoints with fall in income TANDY Corporation, one of the largest US consumer electronics retailers and manufacturers, yesterday disappointed Wall Street by reporting second-quarter income from continuing operations of Dollars 31.7m, or 38 cents a share. A year earlier, it recorded earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 42.7m, or 52 cents a share. Sales and revenues rose to Dollars 843.1m in the 1993 quarter from Dollars 801.9m last year. Most analysts had expected the company to post profits of 43 cents a share in the latest quarter, although some estimates were as low as 35 cents. At the close in New York, shares in Tandy had fallen Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 . Tandy's results were muddied in both years by one-time items. In the 1993 quarter, it suffered a loss from discontinued operations of Dollars 109.1m. A year earlier, one-time gains of Dollars 19m from the sale of a Japanese subsidiary were partly offset by a loss from discontinued operations of Dollars 14.6m. Including these items, Tandy posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 77.3m, or Dollars 1.01, compared with net income of Dollars 28.1m, or 34 cents a year earlier. For the first half, income from continuing operations slipped to Dollars 72.5m, or 88 cents, from Dollars 82m, or 97 cents the previous year.</p>

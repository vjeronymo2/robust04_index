			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union It was understandable that CU should sing sweet lullabies to the market following the screaming that accompanied GRE's warnings of softening rates. But it is doubtful that CU's reassurances will be enough to reverse the sector's weakness. CU's figures confirm that private motor insurance may have peaked. But at least CU is in the enviable position that having gained market share in the upswing it can afford to lose volumes when rates turn down. The 18 per cent decline in fourth-quarter private motor premium income shows how quickly it has reacted. In past cycles, weakness in one market has quickly spilled into others as insurers have sought to offset market share losses. CU suggests the motor sector is driving down its own by-way this time and that rates are still firming elsewhere. If so, it is difficult to believe that composite insurers are not undervalued. Motor insurance is a small proportion of overall business. CU is well capitalised following its rights issue, yields more than 5 per cent and has scope to maintain a progressive dividend policy. A strong life business adds another defensive dimension. But such theoretical considerations will carry little weight with anyone other than value funds. The market's fears may be premature but they are not wrong. Even if it is shown that the market has over-reacted, it is unclear that CU will benefit. Legislative changes in the US are beginning to cast a worrying shadow.</p>

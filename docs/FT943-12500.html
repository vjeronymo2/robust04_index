			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sid could help Germany develop 'equity culture' Sir, David Waller's report ('Resisting the bait of equity ownership', July 14) misses two points when he lists actions to overcome the lack of an 'equity culture' in Germany. First, the leading German banks must create incentives for young people to become involved in stock exchanges. For decades these banks have erected ever higher barriers for young newcomers to these exciting markets. I imagine the bankers consider the short-term costs too high and they have failed to recognise their primary long-term responsibility. Without a broadly based participation, starting with the young, I cannot see an 'equity culture' developing in Germany. Second, several decades ago the German government created the Volksaktie when selling, for example, Volkswagen. If the government decides again to sell off state enterprises such as Lufthansa and Telekom, I hope it will look to the UK and learn from its series of successful privatisation programmes. Sid could be very useful in helping the German government and banks to develop an 'equity culture' in Germany. E H Clausson, The Penthouse, 176 Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2RF</p>

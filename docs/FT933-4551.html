			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Volvo emerges playing new role - The Renault deal has transformed the group Shares in Volvo fell sharply on the Stockholm stock market yesterday as investors contemplated the company's future after the merger of its car and truck manufacturing operations with Renault, the state-controlled French automotive group. Volvo's most-traded B sharesclosed at SKr458, down SKr25 from the close on Monday of SKr483. Before the merger was announced, the shares stood at SKr490. Analysts said the tumble was partly due to worries about the complexity of the deal, which would leave Volvo with a 35 per cent share of a new Renault-Volvo company and the French government with 65 per cent until a planned privatisation issue. 'It is the old story of buy on the rumour and sell on the fact,' said one analyst. A more significant concern, however, was over the shape of the Volvo parent group after the merger is completed early next year. By placing its core motor industry operations into a junior partnership with Renault, Volvo has in effect transformed itself into a kind of holding group with a large number of diverse interests. 'A lot of people are looking at Volvo now as an investment company that will trade at a discount to its net asset value,' said Stefan Hansson of Enskilda Research. Post-merger Volvo will certainly play a different role to its traditional one as Sweden's best-known industrial concern focused on motor manufacturing. Aside from the 35 per cent stake in Renault-Volvo, its main interests will, by next year, be a 100 per cent share in Branded Consumer Products (BCP), and a 25 to 35 per cent share in Pharmacia, the respective food and pharmaceutical offshoots of the soon-to-be-split Procordia. 'The motor company Volvo has, in point of fact, suddenly become an investment company in which the biggest subsidiary makes cigarettes, beer and food,' said Svenska Dagbladet, the conservative Swedish newspaper, on its front page yesterday. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, prepared the way for this when he struck a deal earlier this year with the Swedish government on the break up of Procordia, which is controlled jointly by Volvo and the state. The government is to hand over its share in BCP direct to Volvo and is committed, when it privatises Pharmacia next year, to leaving Volvo as the biggest shareholder. Last year Mr Gyllenhammar also appointed as Volvo chief executive Mr Soren Gyll, hitherto Procordia's chief executive. When the Renault and Procordia deals are complete, Mr Gyll will again find himself largely concerned with his old companies as day-to-day control of Renault-Volvo will be held in Paris. Volvo will also wholly own Volvo Penta and Volvo Flygmotor, the marine and aero engine companies excluded from the Renault merger agreement. In addition, it will have eight further interests ranging from 100 per cent of the brokers Alfred Berg, through shareholdings in Custos and Cardo, two investment companies, and a 25 per cent stake in a property company. Most analysts expect Volvo to seek to rationalise its holdings around the Renault-Volvo and Procordia holdings, easily the biggest and most valuable of its interests. 'I believe we will see a lot of divestments in the next couple of years. The main task for Soren Gyll is to see that Volvo gets a clearer structure. There may even be some new investments made,' said Bo Engstrom of James Capel. Eventually, some believe, BCP - the Procordia food unit whose principal attraction to Volvo at present is strong cash flow - will be sold. That would leave Volvo's central interests in Renault-Volvo, Europe's second largest automotive company, and Pharmacia, Europe's eighth largest pharmaceutical company.</p>

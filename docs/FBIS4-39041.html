The main event of the coming trip  is the signing of a contract on June 7 to sell Malaysia 18  Russian MiG-29 fighters.    The Russian delegation will discuss a package of bilateral  economic issues with Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamed and his  cabinet members in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. It is  also planned that the delegation will be received by the  Malaysian supreme head of state.    ITAR-TASS learnt at the Russian Government's office that the  above-mentioned contract has been agreed upon. It is worth 615  million U.S. dollars. According to Malaysian representatives,  20- 25 per cent of the sum will be paid with palm oil, necessary  for various industries.    The first fighter will be delivered next April. The  implementation of the entire project is planned for a 25-year  period and provides for creating infrastructure in Malaysia,  necessary for the operation of MiG fighters.

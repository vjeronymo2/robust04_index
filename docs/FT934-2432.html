			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Right diagnosis, wrong remedy for Maastricht fatigue Sir, Edward Mortimer is right in his diagnosis of post-Maastricht fatigue in Europe but wrong to look to the European Constitutional Group's 'constitution' for a cure (December 8), particularly in advance of the next enlargement of the Union planned for 1995. Behind this initiative is nothing less than a mischievous attempt to unravel decades of slow and painful constitutional development that has successfully provided for peace and an expansion of trade in the relations between an ever-increasing number of member countries. This achievement has been based on the very principles that the ECG seek to undermine: the supremacy of Community (now Union) law refereed by an independent court; the ability of the Commission to make legislative proposals independently of particular national interests; the possibility of majority votes in the council of ministers, so that one recalcitrant country cannot veto the progress of others; and the ability of a directly-elected European parliament to offer the democratic scrutiny of what goes on in Brussels that one national parliament cannot hope to provide alone. There can be no doubt that, without these principles, however imperfectly they have been applied, we would not have had the single market or the prospect of monetary union. A constitution could bring the present Union closer to its citizens and make its institutional machinery more open and comprehensible. But it will not do so by ignoring these tried and tested principles. For example, the ECG's proposal to add another parliamentary chamber composed of national representatives to the Brussels ensemble will just confuse the public even further and render an already cumbersome decision-making process unworkable. For a remedy to the malady he identifies, Mr Mortimer would do better to look to the draft constitution for the Union which has been drawn up in the past few weeks by the European parliament. This will probably be presented to national parliaments in current and potential member countries for consideration before the 1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty.

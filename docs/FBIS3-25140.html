			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Angola, both UNITA and the government are  questioning the validity of the Lusaka talks. Rui Oliveira, the  UNITA representative in Lisbon, has said that the government has  returned to a strategy of war, and he cites Luanda's armament  effort as an example.    [Begin Oliveira recording] It is the MPLA that is practicing  a strategy of war. It is buying war materiel from Brazil,  Russia, and Spain; buying materiel in North Korea. Portugal is  also involved. As we all know, as it is generally known,  Portugal is giving the MPLA, the Luanda government military aid.  [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Rui Oliveira of UNITA in Lisbon, the  spokesman for the accusations that do not even spare Portugal.  The Angolan Government says it is only defending itself.    [Begin David Mendes, Angolan secretary of state for the  environment, recording] UNITA is not passive, it is using force.  And [words indistinct] control the use of force, then we also  defend ourselves with force. The government's purchase of war  materiel was not part of its plan. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was David Mendes, Angolan secretary of  state  for the environment, who is currently in Lisbon. In Angola the  military conflict is being intensified. There are reports of  air raids on Huambo. Both the government and UNITA claim to  control 85 percent of Cuito.</p>

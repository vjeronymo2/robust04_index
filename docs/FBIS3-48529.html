The first prime minister talked about the efforts of the  Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] to search for peace, national  reconciliation, and particularly in national rehabilitation and  reconstruction, under the correct leadership of his majesty the  king. Prince Krompreah further said that the RGC has four goals  for the investment sector, namely political stability, higher  wages, identifying land for leasing, and lower taxes.    Concerning the Khmer Rouge issue, Prince Krompreah said that  this cannot be considered a big issue. Furthermore, the RGC  will make Sihanoukville a duty-free zone for investment. He  further said that as for agriculture, the royal government has  paid great attention to vigorously promoting the standard of  living by paying attention to clearing networks of canals,  planting trees and other crops, and ending the clearing of  forests.    Schallenberg expressed profound thanks for Cambodian efforts  to rehabilitate and rebuild the country. He further said that  along with providing assistance to rebuild the hydropower  station at Kirirom, the Austrian Government will continue to  contribute to assisting the Cambodian Government and people  within the lofty Austrian-Cambodian ties of friendship.</p>

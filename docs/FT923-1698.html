			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: Wagner/London Classical Players Wagnerians have been left parched and thirsty by our major opera companies in the South-East, so it was no surprise that the Festival Hall was close to full on Sunday night. Giuseppe Sinopoli was conducting the Philharmonia in the first act of Die Walkure, with an excellent second-rank principal pair, and the usual bleeding chunks from Gotterdammerung, with the 'Immolation' to close. Without penetrating insights, the performances were sound enough. Neither the Siegmund nor his Sieglinde wielded a particularly beautiful instrument  - Robert Schunk's well-schooled tenor is on the dry side (unfettered rapture is not his line), and in low-lying recitative Sabine Hass's pitch was rough and approximate; but both of them offered clear, crunchy diction and an exact appreciation of their words, and both voices found their best lusty focus in the upper register where it matters most. The brute Hunding was the imposing, ever-reliable bass Kurt Rydl. At the crucial moments, there were honest thrills. Sinopoli obviously knows the score very well and did nothing eccentric  - though the Walkure act passed rudely from some dubiously slow tempi in the first scenes, without sufficiently heartfelt playing to justify them, to a manically up-tempo Lenzlied and a coda like tearaway Rossini. As usual with live, on-the-spot Sinopoli, when he doesn't have recording engineers to sort things out (or a Bayreuth band who can do that unaided), the orchestral tuttis were ill-balanced. In ff passages he again let everybody play at an unmitigated ff, and vital thematic stuff was submerged. Some eight years ago, I observed sourly that his left hand seems to enjoy no functional independence from his right, which beats time assiduously while his left merely mirrors it; that is still true. He owes it to himself, and his repertoire, to acquire a better technique. Programme books at the Festival Hall nowadays are never cheap. The Philharmonia ones promised the complete Wagner texts but stopped short of Brunnhilde's last thirty-odd lines, the climax of the 'Immolation' (which Miss Hass delivered with full-voiced power and dignity), along with the stage-directions which the late William Mann's recycled programme-notes assured us 'describe with perfect accuracy what happens in the music, but is almost never to be seen on the stage'. Nobody apologised or explained, nor offered refunds. The concert was sponsored by the Automotive &amp; Financial Group                            *       *      * The bulk of Roger Norrington's programme with his orchestra on Sunday was Brahms  - the Tragic Overture and the Second Symphony, played on instruments of the late 19th century. But there was also Beethoven's Second Symphony, performed on the same Brahmsian scale, filtering one composer through the sound world of one of his heirs. It is difficult to distinguish genuine music exploration from expediency in such a venture. Presenting a Beethoven symphony as Brahms would have heard it might be just a handy novelty that enables the London Classical Players to mix their programmes and still retain their period credibility, but it could be a valid attempt to widen the horizons of period performance, to demonstrate how orchestral textures are just as important a component of music history as harmony or form. The reality is probably a mixture of practicality and curiousity, for Beethoven played by Brahms's orchestra sounds distinctly odd now  - neither lean, early 19th-century fish, nor sleek, overweight 20th-century fowl  - muscular in its figuration, yet a shade bombastic in its wind. Norrington's performance was certainly couched in his Beethovenian terms, propelled by snapping rhythms, sharp sforzandi and hard-edged wind solos. Yet it led on naturally from the Tragic Overture, which became a much punchier and more angry piece than modern instruments construe it, so that one started to believe in Norrington's declared intention to make Brahms 'sparkle'. The sound was based on modest string forces with the double basses arrayed along the back of the wind, and double woodwind. It managed to combine sinewy clarity with enough expressive weight and flexibility to make the great paragraphs of the slow movement tell. It was all welded together by Norrington with irrepressible vigour and panache, crowning the symphony with exuberance and affirmation; the corporate sense of discovery that he generates in his players gave every section of the orchestra a sense of separate identity and purpose.</p>

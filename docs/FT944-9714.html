			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Bankers Trust moves derivatives staff Bankers Trust, the US bank that faces two lawsuits over derivative instruments it sold, has moved six executives out of their jobs after the discovery of apparent irregularities in its derivatives operations. They include three managing directors, among them Mr Jack Lavin, one of the bank's most senior executives and the head of its corporate derivatives business. All six have been put on 'special assignment' while an internal investigation continues. The actions, taken on Thursday but not announced, were prompted by the findings of an internal review the bank launched after it came under attack this year from two customers, Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greetings. Both companies have since launched legal actions against Bankers Trust, saying they were misled about the real risks involved in the derivatives they bought. The bank has strongly denied both claims. Bankers Trust's investigation is believed to have uncovered breaches of its record-keeping regulations, as well as sales methods that did not meet its rules. The discovery of those apparent internal irregularities will come as a serious setback for the bank, which has been a pioneer in the development of the fast-growing derivatives markets. It will also add to the pressure on it to settle the lawsuits quickly. All the apparent breaches are believed to involve leveraged swaps, the type of instruments sold to P&amp;G and Gibson. Under a normal swap, the bank and its customer agree to exchange payments in the future based on the level of interest rates. Such instruments are used by companies as protection against changes in interest rates, or to lower their borrowing costs. In a leveraged transaction, interest rate changes are magnified, making such instruments far more volatile when rates move. Procter &amp; Gamble is suing Bankers Trust for Dollars 130m (Pounds 81.5m) after losses this year after US interest rates started to rise. In an interview last week before the executives were relieved of their responsibilities, Mr Brian Walsh, head of derivatives, said the bank had sold leveraged swaps to 'less than a dozen' companies, all of them in the US. The bank refused to say how many possible breaches of its rules it had uncovered. Five of the people moved worked on the bank's corporate derivatives desk, which sold these financial instruments to companies, while the sixth was in a support area. In a further move, Bankers Trust has merged the corporate desk, which had employed around 20 people, with its institutional derivatives operation, which sells derivatives to investors and financial institutions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule includes a provision that allows a refiner to petition for a waiver from special blendstock accounting in a case where the volume of blendstock produced is the result of extreme or unusual circumstances which are clearly outside the control of the refiner and could not have been avoided, such as fire, accident, or natural disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blendstock tracking is limited under the final rule. Refiners with an annual compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio of three percent or less are exempt from special blendstock accounting, regardless of how the compliance period ratio compares with the baseline ratio. This exemption is included because, in such a circumstance, there are limited environmental effects, and the party has a limited ability to gain economic advantage from transferring production to a less rigorous baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule also excludes from the blendstock tracking and accounting requirements blendstocks that are exported, transferred to a refiner for use as a refinery feedstock, or are transferred between refineries that have been aggregated under a common baseline. Also excluded are transfers for other than gasoline blending purposes, e.g., transfers of product for use in a chemical process, because such other-than-gasoline-blending use renders the product non-blendstock by definition. Such transactions are not indicative of an attempt by a refiner to gain an improper baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Blendstock Accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's 1991 Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking for the anti-dumping program proposed compliance based on the properties of finished gasoline only and did not address accounting for blendstocks. Commenters on this Notice stated that the proposed anti-dumping regulations would create the opportunity for certain refiners to avoid the normally-applicable baseline through the transfer of gasoline blendstocks to another refiner with a more lenient baseline. This opportunity derives from the fact that the 1990 individual baseline for a large percentage of the refiners is more stringent than the 1990 average. According to the commenters, a refiner who operates a refinery with such a more-stringent-than-average baseline could effectively achieve an easier baseline by shifting blendstocks produced at that refinery to another refinery with a less stringent baseline. Gasoline could then be ``produced'' at the blendstock-transferee refinery using blendstocks produced at the blendstock-transferor refinery. This strategy could be accomplished, for example, through the transfer of blendstocks to a refiner-blender who would use the statutory average baseline, such as a new business. Commenters stated concern that refiners using this strategy would achieve a significant competitive advantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agreed with these concerns, and in the 1992 Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed requirements on the methods of accounting for gasoline blendstocks. This blendstock accounting proposal was included to limit the adverse environmental effects of such production transfers, by ensuring that each refiner meets the anti-dumping standards using the baseline that properly applies to the refiner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to avoid the baseline-shifting possibility, EPA proposed that refiners would be required to either include in the refinery compliance calculations all blendstocks produced at a refinery, or the products would be prohibited for subsequent use in blending gasoline. Under this proposal, refiners would be required, with certain exceptions, to chemically mark un-accounted-for products to ensure they are not used by downstream parties for gasoline blending. This proposal included provisions intended to ensure that blendstock would be included in anti-dumping compliance calculations by only one refiner, and prohibitions intended to prevent the use of marked petroleum products in gasoline production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters on the 1992 proposal objected to the blendstock accounting/marking scheme because of its impact on the refining industry. Commenters raised concerns regarding the liability scheme and the paperwork requirements associated with the accounting and the marking of blendstocks. Commenters also contended that the marking of blendstocks would be disruptive to the chemical industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to these comments, EPA proposed a significantly revised blendstock accounting mechanism in the 1993 Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This proposal eliminated the requirement that refiners account-for or mark blendstocks and eliminated the prohibitions and liabilities associated with the use of marked blendstock. Under this revised mechanism, refiners would be required to monitor the volume of certain blendstocks produced at each refinery relative to the volume of gasoline produced. If for any year the proportion of a refinery's production that is blendstock (the ``blendstock-to-gasoline ratio'') increased relative to the refinery's baseline blendstock-to-gasoline ratio by ten percent or more, with certain exceptions the refinery would be required to account for all blendstocks produced at the refinery during the year of the failure, or in the alternative any blender-recipient of blendstock produced at that refinery would be required to use the refinery's baseline when accounting for such blendstock during the year of the failure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

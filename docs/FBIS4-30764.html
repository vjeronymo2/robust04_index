			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jiri Kubik: "The Privatization Ministry Has Paid </F> Out Millions Wrongly"]    [Text] Prague -- According to Supreme Inspection Office  [NKU] findings, the Ministry for the Administration and  Privatization of National Property used money from the state  budget and the state funds improvidently -- amounting to 71.7  million korunas [Kc]. For example, according to the Inspection  Office, it paid its U.S. advisers in a manner at variance with  its regulations and, despite its directives, it paid bonuses to  its staff. Embezzlement is not involved, however.    Zdenek Smelik, a member of the inspection unit that  supervised the inspection at the Ministry, described these  shortcomings as a failure to comply fully with the regulations  and administrative obligations. On the other hand, Lubomir  Netolicky, the head of the Ministry's Office, said that he  considers the proceedings instituted by the NKU to be the  mechanical application of generally binding legal regulations  and the one-sided interpretation of the stipulations of certain  laws.    The NKU report described as the biggest mistake the fact  that  the Ministry used more than Kc0.5 million from the National  Property Fund. The fund's Presidium had transferred the money  to the Privatization Ministry in the years 1991-93, despite the  fact that the law does not permit such transactions.    According to the Inspection Office, the Ministry paid its 80  staff a total of Kc700,000 in the form of personal bonuses from  the funds that the government had allocated to Skalicky's  ministry. "A personal bonus should be paid from this money to  the 16 members of staff who are entrusted with the most  demanding tasks, who compile and evaluate the materials, and who  achieve excellent results," said Smelik. By using the money for  a different purpose, the Ministry has violated the decree on  managing resources from the state budget. Netolicky said,  however, that the details about assigning the money for 16  members of staff had been laid down only tentatively.</p>

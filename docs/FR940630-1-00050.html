			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The head of each Federal agency is authorized by regulation (which, in the case of agencies in the Executive Branch, shall be as uniform as practicable and subject to such policies as the President may prescribe) to prescribe therefore such fee, charge, or price, if any, as he shall determine, in case none exists, or redetermine, in case of any existing one, to be fair and equitable taking into consideration direct and indirect cost to the Government, value to the recipient, public policy or interest served, and other pertinent facts *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, in 1980, Congress passed the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (hereinafter ``IATC Act'') giving the FAA authority to establish fee schedules for airmen and repair station certification services provided outside the U.S. Section 28 of the IATC Act amended Section 45 of the Airline Deregulation Act to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Secretary of Transportation or the Administrator from collecting a fee, charge, or price for any test, authorization, certificate, permit, or rating, administered or issued outside the United States, relating to any airman or repair station. (49 U.S.C. 334, second sentence). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amounts collected shall be paid to the Federal Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To aid in establishing fee schedules, OMB has prescribed in Circular No. A&hyph;25 the general guidelines to be used in developing an equitable and reasonable uniform system of charges for certain government services and property. The circular provides that ``where a service (or privilege) provides special benefits to an identifiable recipient above and beyond those that accrue to the public at large, a charge should be imposed to receive the full cost to the Federal Government of rendering that service.'' Circular No. A&hyph;25 specifies the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A special benefit will be considered to accrue and a charge should be imposed when a Government-rendered service: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable in monetary terms) than those which accrue to the general public (for example, receiving a patent, crop insurance, or license to carry on a specific business), or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Provides business stability or assures public confidence in the business activity of the beneficiary (for example, certificates of necessity and convenience [sic: convenience and necessity] for airline routes, or safety inspections of craft); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Is performed at the request of the recipient and is above and beyond the services regularly received by other members of the same industry or group, or of the general public (for example, receiving passport visa, airman's certificate, or an inspection after regular duty hours). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Discussion of the Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice proposes that the fee schedule in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A, be amended to provide the methodology for computing user fees that permit full recovery of the FAA costs incurred in performing these services authorized by legislation and to develop a timetable for updating fees. The method of payment of fees prescribed in 14 CFR 187.15 would also be amended to take advantage of some additionally available banking services, that is, wire transfers and payment by credit card, that would expedite deposit of funds to the U.S. Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with the authority granted under the IATC Act, this notice would establish the schedule of fees that would be published in an FAA Advisory Circular on inspector fees. Under this proposal, hourly rates for repair station certifications, and fixed fees for each airman certificate issued would be derived from total costs to the FAA of providing the services and have been computed using direct and indirect labor costs (excluding holiday, Sunday, and overtime costs), and overhead costs. Fees for transportation and subsistence expenses associated with the issuance of certificates have not been included in the computation of hourly fees and fixed fees. Fees covering those expenses would be charged to applicants in addition to the specified fee whenever such expenses are incurred by the FAA in providing the requested service. Consistent with OMB Circular A&hyph;25, under this NPRM the FAA would recover all costs incurred for performing the above-described certification services outside the U.S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Airman Certifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are 55 categories of airman certification actions for which fees are prescribed under the Appendix A at the present time. These were the only categories of airman certification actions being administered by the FAA outside the United States at the time of the original fees rulemaking in 1982. Since that time, demand for airman certification services outside the U.S. has increased, and the FAA now administers airman tests, approvals, and ratings for which fees have not been established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are 96 categories of FAA airman tests, approvals, or ratings that currently may be performed outside the U.S. This proposal would update existing fees for the 55 types of airman tests, approvals, and ratings listed in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A, and would also establish fees for the 41 other types of airman tests, approvals and ratings that the FAA may administer outside the United States. Thus, the proposed rule would prescribe fees for all tests, renewals, authorizations, or approvals relating to airman certification outside the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

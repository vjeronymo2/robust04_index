			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Conran comes to Paris FOR YEARS the Conran Shop has towered over the London design scene. There are other shops selling contemporary furniture in the city. But it is the only place where you can buy virtually everything, from a sofa to a soap dish, and where you are tempted into spending more than you had expected. The Conran Shop yesterday opened for business in Paris in a fin de siecle building on the corner of rue du Bac and rue de Baylone in Saint Germain. Sir Terence Conran, who created the original Conran Shop in 1973 and bought it back two years ago when he left the Storehouse group, has been planning the Paris opening for five years. 'We've opened the Conran Shop in Paris for exactly the same reason that we opened in London,' says Sir Terence. 'There are lots of good, small, interesting shops in Paris selling similar sorts of things but nowhere can you find it all under the same roof." Sir Terence is probably right. Paris is wonderful for antiques thanks to the Marches aux Puces and the specialist dealers straggling the tiny streets between Boulevard Saint Germain and the Seine and there are also many more shops selling 20th century classics such as a Le Corbusier chaise longue or an Arne Jacobsen Swan chair, than in London. But it is difficult to find the classic Conran Shop style of quirkily classic contemporary furniture design in Paris. The range for the Conran Shop in Paris, which stretches over three floors in the Bon Marches old storage depot now renovated at a cost of Pounds 3.6m, is almost the same as in London. There is the same mix of the store's own furniture (which will be shipped over to French customers from the British factories) with classics, such as Joe Columbo's 1960s Boby trolley, and cheaper treats, Czech &amp; Speake toiletries and hand-made chocolates. The French like their sofas smaller and firmer than do the British, so some Conran Shop classics, such as Odeon, a best seller in the London store, were rejected as too big and squashy. The French also have different taste in beds, so a special range has been commissioned in France. The critical question is whether the French, who are notoriously chauvinistic about anything to do with style, can be persuaded to buy British for their homes. There is the great advantage that Sir Terence already has a high profile in France as the founder of Habitat, which has recently been conspicuously more successful in the French market than the British. Sir Terence is also known as an ardent francophile - one of the few traits that the French consider to be redeeming in foreigners. Sir Terence envisages 'very gentle, very modest' expansion for the Conran Shop into other cities. But his plans depend on the progress of the new Paris store and whether the French design cognoscenti take to Conran Shop sofas and soap dishes as enthusiastically as their counterparts across the English Channel.</p>

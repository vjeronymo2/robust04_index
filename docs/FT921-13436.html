			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Textron wins Cessna with bid of Dollars 600m TEXTRON, the Rhode Island-based aerospace and financial services group, announced last night that it had won the auction for Cessna Aircraft Company, which manufactures business jets and cargo planes and is currently owned by General Dynamics. General Dynamics, the second largest US defence group, has been shrinking its operations recently and concentrating on core businesses. It put Cessna up for sale last October, and only last week Dassault Aviation, the French maker of business and military jets, announced that it would be making an offer for the General Dynamics subsidiary. Textron has agreed to pay Dollars 600m in cash for Cessna, whichGeneral Dynamics bought for Dollars 660m 1985. Cessna, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, had sales last year of around Dollars 820m. It has produced general aviation aircraft for much of its history but, in the early 1980s, refocused operations on its Citation business jet and Caravan utility turboprop aircraft. The latter is used for both cargo and passenger service, finding customers amongst the express package delivery companies, such as Federal Express.</p>

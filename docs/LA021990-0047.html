			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST;  </P> <P> RAIN-SWOLLEN RIVERS ROUT MORE FAMILIES  </P> <P> Rain-swollen rivers chased dozens of Alabama families from their homes and  threatened a new round of destruction in Georgia.  </P> <P> Five people have been killed in those two states since the flooding began late  last week. Extensive flooding was reported along Alabama's Coosa, Black Warrior  and Tallapoosa rivers, where dozens of families were forced to evacuate. The  National Weather Service warned that 3 inches of rain could fall on  already-soggy northwestern Georgia, where flooding has forced more than 1,000  from their homes. Meteorologist Gary Beeley warned that residents might be  fooled by lighter rains and fail to take precautions, but that larger rivers  often flood days after heavy rains.  </P></p>

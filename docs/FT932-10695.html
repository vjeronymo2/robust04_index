			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / French audit shows rising deficit in public finances A SPECIAL audit ordered by France's new Conservative government yesterday confirmed the gaping hole in the country's public finances ahead of the budget next week which is expected to raise taxes and cut spending. The audit, conducted by Mr Jean Raynaud, a senior official of the state accounting body, shows overall accumulated deficits in the budget and the social security system rising to an estimated FFr475bn (Pounds 57.09bn) by the end of this year. Most of the social security system is funded outside the budget by contributions from employers and employees. The audit assumes that the economy could contract by up to 1 per cent this year. Basing itself on a median forecast of a 0.4 per cent drop in gross domestic product, it says the recession's effect in depressing tax receipts and raising social spending could increase the budget deficit from FFr226bn last year to FFr341bn this year. Such a deficit would amount to 4.8 per cent of France's national output, well above the 3 per cent guideline in the Maastricht treaty on monetary union. This in turn explains prime minister Edouard Balladur's recent comment that any talk of accelerating the Maastricht currency union timetable was a 'pious wish', given the state of public finance in France and many other EC countries. He said his aim was to cut France's deficit to less than 3 per cent by 1996-97. Mr Raynaud, a long-time friend of the new prime minister, denied his report sought to pin blame on the previous Socialist government. Nevertheless, one Socialist MP accused the government of 'polemicising' the country's financial problems. This year's still-larger budget deficit will be the result of reduced tax revenue (FFr120bn lower than first forecast) and higher spending (an extra FFr55bn, much of it on temporary work schemes), the report calculates. The Raynaud audit says the deficit in France's social security system was 'unprecedented'. The accumulated deficit of the pension, health and family allowances funds will rise to nearly FFr100bn by the end of 1993. In addition, the unemployment insurance scheme could go bankrupt next month unless the state tops up it up. French rates cut, Page 3</p>

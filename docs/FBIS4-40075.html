			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- "As a result of personal efforts  by the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, there is a now a unique  chance for you to make the correct choice," Andrey Kozyrev  declared here today when opening talks with the leader of the  Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic. According to the Russian  Federation foreign minister, the first meeting about Bosnia  between the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and  five European Union countries, which was held in Geneva on 13  May, "created a good foundation for peace." This foundation is,  first and foremost, "full equality of rights for the peoples of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and full equality of choice for the Bosnian  Serbs." In the near future "We intend to attempt to hold a  second ministerial meeting which will provide an opportunity to  reach a very important agreement on this basis, precisely within  this framework."    By opting for peace, A. Kozyrev continued, the Bosnian Serbs  will be able to count on Russia's most resolute support. Among  other things, Russia believes that when the territorial issue is  decided the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should hold 49  percent of the territory. History has decreed that although the  Serbs form only around 33 percent of the Bosnian population,  they are entitled to claim a large and fair slice of territory.  When peace is restored, sanctions will be lifted, Yugoslavia  will rejoin the "family of nations," and assistance will be  given with the rehabilitation of the war-damaged economy.    In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Russian minister  went on to say, I would also like to issue a clear warning.  There is another option, leading to war -- unwillingness to  accept reasonable compromises and an intention to hold on to 70  percent of the territory which is now being held by the Bosnian  Serb as a result of the war. If you do opt for war -- and we  believe that this will not happen -- we must state just as  firmly that you will not, in that case, be able to count on  Russia. "As real friends, we only support fair play," A. Kozyrev  stressed. "Russia will not support injustice."</p>

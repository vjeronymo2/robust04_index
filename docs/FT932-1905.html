			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Insurance rates likely to rise INSURERS warned yesterday that further increases in rates for home and motor insurance policies are likely as the industry claws its way back to profitability. Provisional figures show that insurers virtually broke even last year, with expenses and claims exceeding premium and investment income by only 0.2 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1991. Mr Ian Rushton, outgoing chairman of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'Declining investment returns in the future means the industry must significantly reduce underwriting losses over the coming year.' UK general business premium income rose by 12.5 per cent last year to Pounds 18.9bn, with worldwide premiums increasing by 13.9 per cent to Pounds 31.1bn. Most main classes of business saw a fall in claims. Motor insurers benefited from a decline in the frequency of claims, and there was a significant fall in fire and property claims. The value of surrendered policies increased from Pounds 4.9bn in 1991 to Pounds 5.3bn last year. Maturities rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn (Pounds 3.9bn). Payouts due to fatalities rose from Pounds 1.4bn to Pounds 1.5bn. Total payments to policyholders rose by 16.5 per cent to reach a record Pounds 27.7bn. Life premium income in the UK increased by 8.9 per cent to Pounds 43.1bn. Mr Rushton said the ABI's support for the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new regulator for financial services, was 'strong but remains conditional on the whole retail financial sector joining from the outset'.</p>

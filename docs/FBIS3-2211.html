The State Administration of State Property said some  appraisals given by Chinese organizations last year without  approval from authorities were dishonest and must not be  accepted by the government or the public.    Such appraisals may be deceiving said Wang Baoku, Deputy  Director of the Assets Appraisal Administrative Centre under the  administration.    In any event, he added, appraisals of intangible assets have  limited value since they need not be demonstrated before trading  the enterprises' property rights.    Intangible assets may include trademarks, patents,  copyrights  and credibility. Their value depends on investors' confidence  in the specific enterprises, market demand for the property  rights, and other economic factors at the time of the  transaction.    Wang said the assessments taken last year will become  invalid  one year after the authorities' approval, according to the  State's Regulations on State Property Appraisals, issued by the  State Council in 1991.    While these appraisal results may help promote the  enterprises, they also may mislead the public if the results do  not correspond with the assets' real value.    For example, enterprises running in the red may use tricks  to  have their intangible assets appraised higher than their real  value.    Such unauthorized activities must be prevented, or they may  disturb the economic order and affect investors' benefits, Wang  said.</p>

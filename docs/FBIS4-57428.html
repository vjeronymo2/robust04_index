			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] We are still in contact with Jesus Casasola, who  this morning covered a number of military maneuvers and  activities carried out by the National Defense Secretariat in  the presence of journalists. During the activities, Division  General Antonio Riviello Bazan, Mexican national defense  secretary, said the Mexican State does not intend to repress  public demonstrations with the newly purchased water cannons,  referring to the famous Cobra vehicles that have been so  severely criticized. Defense Secretary Riviello Bazan said that  if public peace is threatened, this equipment will be used. Go  ahead, Jesus, we are listening.    [Casasola] Here again, Pepe, I want to mention that it is  not  the government's decision to suppress any public demonstration.  If the social well-being is threatened by the presence of  violent groups, however, the riot equipment recently purchased  by the National Defense Secretariat will be used. This is the  warning National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan made  today. In a news conference held in the San Miguel de los  (Agueyes) Military Base in Huehuetoca Muncipality, Mexico State,  he pointed out that the 24 armored vehicles cost $100,000 each.  He added that they will be used only when state officials who  are confronted by violent groups require their use. Here are  the defense secretary's words:    [Begin Riviello Bazan recording] If we had to intervene,  this  equipment causes no more harm than getting wet. Anyway, we feel  it has not been well received by the public, but the Army has to  take precautions. This is a precaution. If the public,  however, wants us to remove the water cannons and replace them  with 105mm cannons, then we will replace them. [laughter] Yes,  there are two; we are talking about two different types. One is  the riot cannon, the other is not precisely for that purpose.  You can see the government does not intend to prevent any  public demonstration. It is not up to the National Defense  Secretariat. It is up to the proper civilian authorities to  make a request through the Government Secretariat and, in the  last instance, the president gives the authorization. We are  not autonomous. [end recording]    [Casasola] Antonio Riviello Bazan reiterated that the  purchase of the riot equipment is part of a plan to upgrade the  Army's equipment, since it has equipment which dates back to  1942. Jokingly, he said: This is a good opportunity for anyone  who wants to buy antique cars.    He also spoke about the State of Chiapas case, indicating  that the National Defense Secretariat is currently analyzing two  recommendations made by the National Human Rights Commission.  Concerning the current conflict in this state, he added:    [Begin Riviello Bazan recording, in progress] ...in a state  of alert by the Armed Forces. We are determined to continue  supporting the government's efforts. [end recording]    [Casasola] As for the elections, the national defense  secretary said the Mexican Army will participate in the security  and transportation of the electoral ballots. On the recent  creation of the National Commission of Public Security, he said  his department is not subordinate to anyone.    After the news conference some members of the media were  invited to a military demonstration in which live ammunition was  used.</p>

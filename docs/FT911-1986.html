			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian government has come to a decision on the future of the wool industry, the stockpile, the debt and future administration. The main recommendations by the Vines committee have been accepted with modest adjustments. The one of most concern to the industry is that relating to the stockpile. There is no ban on disposal at the discretion of the committee to be in control, in the rest of this year; nor is there a trigger point in prices to permit release or not. The market meanwhile continues to strengthen in Australia, and a record offering of British wool sold at auction in Bradford at appreciably higher prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second of two-part "exclusive" interview with UN Secretary </F> General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Jacques  Jacquet-Francillon, and Charles Lambroschini; place and date not  given: "Butrus-Ghali Denounces Bad Payers"]    [Text] [LE FIGARO] What are you most proud of since you  took over the post of secretary general of the United Nations  two years ago?    [Butrus-Ghali] We were successful in Cambodia and in El  Salvador. The fact that we could offer aid to millions of  Somalis is also a success. There is no longer famine in  Somalia. This is to the credit of the United Nations. We are  also helping two million Yugoslavian refugees. Two million is  nothing to sneeze at. We brought 360,000 refugees back to  Cambodia. That is something. We successfully kept the peace in  Mozambique, where we obtained major results. Elections are to  be held on 27 April in South Africa. You might say: "You had  nothing to do with that," but that is simply not true. We  contributed a lot to this operation by sending observers there.  We are going to send another 1,700 in the coming weeks. These  are positive elements that you can see on the ground.    [LE FIGARO] Very well. So what was your big failure?    [Butrus-Ghali] The thing I am least proud about is the fact  that I have not managed to attract greater attention -- in the  philosophic sense of the word -- from the member states as to  the importance of the United Nations. The United Nations is a  tool which they still hesitate to use. They say all the right  things, and they make a lot of promises, but when the time comes  to face up to reality, they hesitate....    [LE FIGARO] Out of all the UN member states, how many do not  pay their dues?    [Butrus-Ghali] At the end of last year, only 60 out of 184  had paid their contribution to the ordinary budget.    [LE FIGARO] And the preceding years too?    [Butrus-Ghali] It was even worse.    [LE FIGARO] What about the peacekeeping operations?    [Butrus-Ghali] We must owe about $1.2 billion out of a total  of $3.6 billion.    [LE FIGARO] Are there any bad payers on the Security  Council?    [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly, the United States and Russia. The  United States is late, and Russia does not pay. This means that  the good pupils, the ones who send us troops, are punished  indirectly because we cannot pay them what we owe them for their  contribution to the peacekeeping forces.    [LE FIGARO] You cannot reimburse France?    [Butrus-Ghali] We reimburse France with a delay of one year.  We reimburse Sweden with a delay of two years. I have received  complaints from Tunisia, Egypt, Uruguay, and Jordan, all of whom  want to withdraw their troops. Just yesterday morning, I  received telegrams from two countries which have not received  their contribution to the operations in Cambodia that ended last  September. As a result, these two countries -- Tunisia and  Bangladesh -- are refusing to send additional troops to Somalia.  We are going to end up with insurmountable problems on our  hands because of this financial crisis.    [LE FIGARO] One of the reforms of the UN Charter, which you  mention often during your trips around the world, is the reform  of the composition of the Security Council. This would  essentially be a new allocation of permanent seats. How do you  see things? How many new permanent members do you envisage?  How would the veto right be allocated differently?    [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, this is a decision which, in  accordance with Article 108 of the Charter, must be made by the  General Assembly. I play no role in it.    [LE FIGARO] Really?    [Butrus-Ghali] Following the initiative taken by the General  Assembly, I sent a questionnaire to all the member states, to  which I have received already some 70 replies. A consensus has  emerged from these replies in favor of increasing the number of  members on the Security Council, since when the United Nations  was founded, it consisted of only 50 states, whereas it now has  184. It has also been emphasized that the expansion of the  Security Council must be limited so that it can continue to  operate well.  <H5>  General Relaxation </H5>   [Butrus-Ghali continues] There is also emphasis on the fact  that we should move quickly in order to take advantage of the  celebration of the United Nations' 50th anniversary in 1995, and  to carry out the reform. However, that is where the consensus  ends. So we risk opening a Pandora's box, in that some 30 member  states feel -- rightly or not -- that they deserve a permanent  seat on the Security Council. From there we can indulge in  academic exercises: We could envisage new permanent members  which do not have the veto right, etc.    [LE FIGARO] The same names always come up: Germany and  Japan. In order to have the rest of the world better  represented, are there any other countries, like India, Brazil,  Argentina, Nigeria, etc.?    [Butrus-Ghali] I do not want to make any comment regarding  any of these countries. I do not wish to create problems for  myself.    [LE FIGARO] Surely India is pretty inevitable?    [Butrus-Ghali] Everything depends on the vote, you know.  There will be a political debate in the General Assembly, whose  members are going to vote. However, do not forget that in the  final analysis, we will still have to have the agreement of the  five permanent members. Any revision of the Charter will only  be valid after it has been ratified by the five permanent  members of the Security Council -- all of whom have the veto  right -- even if the resolution has been passed by a national  assembly in which there is no veto right.    [LE FIGARO] So...?    [Butrus-Ghali] To my mind, what counts is not so much the  reform, but the fact that via this reform I can attain greater  participation by the most important member states in the role of  the United Nations.    [LE FIGARO] So now we are coming back to your initial  remarks.    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, the lack of political will on the part  of  the large countries.    [LE FIGARO] The lack of leadership...American leadership.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not agree with you on that. American  leadership used to be counterbalanced by another leadership. We  had a bilateral system, bipolarism. Once one of the leaderships  disappeared and collapsed, we emerged into a system which we  cannot control. Nobody knows what has to be done anymore. The  fact is that the very big member states are not up to their  importance. Whether in Latin America or Asia, member states are  not playing the role they should be playing -- a role they could  afford to play if they had the political will to do so.    [LE FIGARO] In more general terms, do you mean that all the  nations are less interested today than before in the affairs of  the rest of the world? That everyone is withdrawing into their  own problems?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I repeat: There is a kind of laxness.    [LE FIGARO] How do you explain it?    [Butrus-Ghali] The end of the Cold War created a general  relaxation. We are confronted with new phenomena.    [LE FIGARO] With a confirmed political will and a clearer  vision of what we could have done, do you think that we could  have stopped the escalation of hostilities in Yugoslavia by  intervening just after the first confrontations between Croats  and Serbs?    [Butrus-Ghali] It is very difficult to answer that question.  A political will must not be expressed just at the beginning.  It must be constant. That is the true lesson. The problem of  peace is like the problem of health. You cannot allow yourself  to go on a diet for two weeks. If you stop, you will get sick  again. There must be continuity in peacekeeping operations:  before, during the conflict, and afterwards. You must not stop  checking up on the patient. There must be permanent attention.  It is like cleaning the streets of Paris.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Wei (1728 5633): "Invigorating Large and </F> Medium-Sized Enterprises Is an Important Task of the Entire  Province"]    [Excerpts] On the morning of 1 May, Gu Jinchi, secretary of  the provincial party committee; Wen Shizhen, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee and executive vice governor; and  other leaders of the provincial departments concerned went to  Benxi Iron and Steel Company to salute workers on the forefront  of production and to inspect the cold rolling project with a  total investment of 2.5 billion yuan and the construction site  of 800 bloomers for producing special steel.    As soon as they got out of the car, Gu Jinchi and Wen  Shizhen  put on working clothes and safety helmets and went directly to  the No. 2 steelmaking furnace to cordially shake hands with  workers on the forefront of production and ask them about their  production and living conditions. They also traveled to the  control room and to the cold rolling project design and  construction site to examine the installation of the 800  bloomers for producing special steel. In the afternoon, Gu  Jinchi and Wen Shizhen listened to a briefing given by Zhang  Wenda, chief manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. After  listening to the briefing, Wen Shizhen said: Although the  industrial output value of Benxi Iron and Steel Company  increased by 5.2 percent during this year's first quarter  compared with the corresponding period last year, and the  profits and taxes dropped by a large margin compared with the  same period last year, its situation is quite grim. At present,  invigorating state-owned enterprises, particularly state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises, is an important task facing  the entire province. [passage omitted]    In his summing-up speech, Gu Jinchi expressed the hope that  Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which is a "pillar" enterprise,  should change its planned economic system into the market  economic system as quickly as possible, regard the study of  market situation as the basis of all work and let the domestic  and foreign markets decide the categories and quantity of  products it should produce. He said: We should define the  product orientation through the study of markets and determine  the technical transformation targets in line with the product  orientation. He pointed out: The key to carrying out our  province's "second pioneering program" lies in two points.  First, we must see whether enterprises can successfully change  from the planned economy into the market economy; and second, we  must use high and new technology to transform traditional  industries. We can gain a firm footing and give play to our  advantages only when we are able to produce products which other  medium and small enterprises as well as township enterprises  cannot produce.    Gu Jinchi stressed: Enterprises should clearly understand  that they should regard economic efficiency as the central task.  He said: Our province once had the splendor of being placed  among the front rank of the country in economic returns. At  present, the efficiency norms are not worth mentioning.  Regardless of what project we carry out, it will not do if we  can only make over 10 percent of profits from it because this  can only allow us to barely repay the bank interest.    Gu Jinchi pointed out: Enterprise management must be strict.  Over the past few years, there were many new terms for  enterprise management. Actually, how much have we enhanced the  level of enterprise management? At present, the phenomenon of  lax management is quite serious in some enterprises. If we  allow this situation to continue, we will have endless trouble  in the future.    Gu Jinchi reaffirmed: Enterprises must persist in regarding  personnel as the foundation. It is necessary to strengthen  cadres' ideological work, establish a strong rank of workers and  staff members, and turn them into the main forces for realizing  all targets of enterprises. He hoped that Benxi Iron and Steel  Company, which once made major contributions to the development  of the country, will continue to take the lead in today's  process of building the socialist market economic structure and  will provide good experiences for the entire province.</p>

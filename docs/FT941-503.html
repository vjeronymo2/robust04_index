			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Japan acts to open markets to imports: Measures sought to ease tensions with US over trade imbalance Japan yesterday unveiled a market-opening package intended to increase imports and reduce its record current account surplus with the aim of reducing tension with the US. The announcement followed US threats to impose trade sanctions after Japan, during talks in Washington last month, rejected US calls to accept numerical targets for imports. Japanese officials said they had conceded most demands made in previous trade negotiations except for setting such targets. The programme aimed to boost the domestic economy and open Japan's markets by deregulation and enhancing competition. It laid particular stress on four sectors: telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance and motor parts, which the US made priorities during talks in recent months. Japan is to review past government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, and the motor industry's purchases of parts from foreign groups. US calls for deregulation of the insurance industry, including easier access to licences, freeing of rates and lifting of restrictions on broking, were also accommodated. Standards, certification and inspection procedures on imported products such as consumer electronics, foods, cars, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics will be streamlined, while the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly watchdog, will be strengthened with the addition of further staff. 'A lot of it was pretty much expected, but it looks like it has some positive aspects,' said Mr Bill Farrell, director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo. The Japanese government wants to cut its current account surplus to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product in the year to March 1995 from 3.1 per cent the preceding year. Details of the macroeconomic measures, which include the extension of income tax cuts and an increase in public expenditure, will be announced in June before Premier Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Bill Clinton in Naples for the Group of Seven summit. In spite of enthusiasm among Japanese bureaucrats over the package, Tokyo's financial markets reflected disappointment among investors. The yen jumped on fears, later confirmed, that the US would not be satisfied, closing up Y0.94 to Y103.80 against the dollar; the Tokyo stock market fell 1.2 per cent to 19,709.74. Paul Abrahams adds: Honda and Mazda yesterday followed the example of their three main competitors when they announced plans to increase use of locally made components at their American factories. The companies also promised to increase imports into Japan. Separately, the ministry of international trade and industry said it was ending its voluntary limit on car exports to the US. The ministry said the limits were no longer relevant since Japanese exports had been under the ceilings set by the agreement since 1987. The cap was introduced in 1981 to protect the US motor industry. About 1.54m vehicles will be built by Japanese manufacturers in the US in 1994, the first year they will exceed exports to the US of cars produced in Japan. The announcements come as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said Japan's motor exports in February had fallen 23.5 per cent in unit terms compared with the same month last year. The figure was down 2.6 per cent on the preceding month. The car makers' undertakings follow sustained pressure from Washington on Japan to increase use of US vehicle components to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Only 2 per cent of motor parts are imported. The Japanese government insists it is unable to interfere in private business. Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi have recently revealed similar programmes, committing themselves to increasing US parts purchases by more than Dollars 5.3bn by the financial year ending March 1998.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Air Strikes Are </F> Detrimental to the Peace Process"]    [Text] The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina has become the  focus of attention once again. On the evening of 10 April and  the afternoon of 11 April, as demanded by Yasushi Akashi, UN  special envoy to former Yugoslavia, U.S. fighter planes carried  out air strikes against Serbian military positions around  Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were the first NATO air  strikes against Serbian ground military targets since the  outbreak of the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina two years ago, and  they were important NATO military operations.    Gorazde was one of the six Muslim "protection zones"  declared  by the UN Security Council last year. The UN peace-keeping  force maintains that it has the right to protect these zones so  that "they will not come under armed attack by any side." This  time NATO carried out air strikes against Serbian positions on  these grounds.    After the air strikes, the Bosnian Serbs accused the UN  peacekeeping force of "opposing the Serbs," announced the  suspension of all their contacts with the UN peacekeepers, and  canceled their prescheduled meeting with the U.S. special  envoys. People fear that this NATO move will affect the UN  peacekeeping force's neutral position in the Bosnian war and  produce an unfavorable impact on the UN role in mediating the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    Russian President Yeltsin has criticized the United States,  saying that it had no right to unilaterally decide on the air  strikes and that this should have been submitted to the Security  Council for discussion. U.S. President Clinton has said that  U.S. planes would carry out air strikes again if necessary. The  dissensions between the United States and Russia on the Bosnia-  Herzegovina issue have worsened further. People have noted  that, over the last two months, due to Russian mediation, NATO  delayed the plan on bombing Sarajevo, and the Serbs opened the  Tuzla airport. So Russia's right to speak on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue had grown markedly stronger.  Evidently, NATO's current air strikes possibly have more  political than military significance. These air strikes seemed  to send out a dual signal: One is that "bombardment" will be  used to bring about talks and force the Serbs to make  concessions on the territorial issue; the other suggests to  Russia that the United States and NATO are keeping the  initiative in the Bosnian situation.    After the outbreak of the Sarajevo crisis in February, a new  trend appeared in the peace talks on the Bosnian issue and some  hope for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina glimmered in people's  minds. In this situation, NATO's current "bombardment" is  unlikely to bring about peace; instead, they will possibly  affect the peace process. In addition, various foreign powers  are coming onto the stage from behind the scenes on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. On the one hand, this will help  encourage the conflicting parties to participate in the peace  talks; on the other, as their dissensions and contradictions  become apparent, Bosnia-Herzegovina's peace process may become  more complicated.</p>

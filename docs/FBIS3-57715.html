			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputies Vasil Chepik, Viktar </F> Alampiyew, and Alyaksandr Lyadko, by Mikhail Rudkowki; place and  date not given -- recorded; passages in boldface are in Russian]    [Text] [Rudkowski] What is your opinion of the dismissal  of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, and who is  your choice to replace him in this high state post?    [Chepik] First of all, I want this interview to be  transmitted to our radio listeners in its full extent. I think  that last night's session was nothing out of ordinary. It is a  normal course of developments. I only regret that it occurred  so late. In confirmation of this, I can say that the situation  in the Republic of Belarus -- especially in the economic arena  -- has become extremely difficult during the period we were  under the leadership of Stanislav Stanislavovich [Shushkevich];  it has reached a critical point. The work of the Supreme Soviet  was paralyzed. Practically, we were concerned more with demagogy  than concrete legislative work. The work of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium was also paralyzed. As a result -- we have all those  negative phenomena within society. Therefore, I see that a  normal process has begun at last.    [Rudkowski] You did not answer the second question -- who is  your choice to assume this post?    [Chepik] I cannot specify names today. However, I see  many talented candidates, including deputies as well, who are  qualified to deal with this task more successfully than our  former speaker did.    [Rudkowski] Whom do you have in mind?    [Chepik] I have in mind chairmen of the oblast  executive committees, chairmen of various [Supreme Soviet]  commissions, and other people's deputies. I cannot answer this  question right now, because we are now conducting political  consultations.    [Rudkowski] I have also invited People's Deputy Viktar  Alampiyew to speak. The question I asked earlier is now  directed to you.    [Alampiyew] I will use the words of Vladimir Ilyich  [Lenin]: A Bolsheviks' dream, which was nourished by them over  the last two years, has come true. At last, they decided to  throw out the umbrella, under which they were staying all the  time -- that is to say, Stanislav Shushkevich, a sole democrat  in power. Now they took the lead in their own hands. With  respect to a new Supreme Soviet chairman, I can say frankly that  I do not see any candidate among the current Supreme Soviet  body. It would be better to leave this choice to either a newly  elected Supreme Soviet or a direct general ballot. In the latter  case, none of political factions in the parliament will be able  to [word indistinct] the speaker, as was done by the Belarus  faction with regard to Mr. Shushkevich.    [Rudkowski] I also pose the same question to People's Deputy  Alyaksandr Lyadko.    [Lyadko] I regret very much that the people's deputies voted  against Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich last  night. The Belarusian nation is one, and we all have to live and  work in this nation. There must be accord between communists  and Belarusian Popular Movement adherents. I would hope that  this post is given to someone with Shushkevich's political  views; I also wish that there were peace in Belarus, and that we  were able to work for the welfare of Belarus.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Efta set to flower, then fade away THESE are uncertain times for the secretariat of the seven-nation European Free Trade Association (Efta). With the giant west European free trade zone known as the European Economic Area (EEA) starting in January, Efta will acquire hitherto undreamed-of powers over its members. Its 150-strong staff and SFr50m (Pounds 19m)-a-year budget will double. Yet within three to four years it may shrink to two tiny members, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and possibly Norway, desert to the European Community. Efta's machinery will include a surveillance authority, its powers equal to those of the EC to regulate competition, subsidies and government procurement within Efta countries, and a court of justice to ensure Efta nations comply with EEA law. Each will have seven members, and their own secretariats. The court will be based in Geneva, where Efta has its headquarters, but the competition section of the surveillance authority and some other Efta staff will be in Brussels, better to swap notes with the European Commission on applying EEA rules. Under the EEA accord of last May, these are basically EC rules Efta countries are to adopt en bloc, except the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition to the SFr100m a year for the expanded Efta organisation, Efta members are expected to spend another SFr600m in 1993 for the privilege of joining a free trade area of 380m people. Some SFr400m of this will go on EC programmes in which Efta countries will share, such as research and development. A further SFr200m will go to fund aid for poorer EC regions. Those countries aspiring to EC membership expect the expense and upheaval entailed in implementing the EEA to pay off in a shorter period of accession negotiations with Brussels, because 80 per cent of EC legislation will have already been adopted. The stage could then be set for Efta and the EEA to act as a 'training ground' for other EC hopefuls from eastern Europe. Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia all hope to join. But Efta officials point out that joining the EEA could prove almost as hard as negotiating EC entry. Meanwhile, Efta's future beyond the mid-1990s must remain in doubt.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Service views not on parade - Ballot Box One group of electors for which there are no available polls is the armed forces. They were not polled in 1945 either when pre-election opinion soundings - just among civilians - underestimated the swing to Labour. Postal votes from overseas servicemen are reckoned to have clinched that election. But, however bitterly today's servicemen may resent cuts, nothing of the sort can be expected this time for three good reasons. First, the forces, at 294,000 and declining, are smaller than at any time since the war. Second, although they are encouraged to vote, many do not. Army officials say arrangements for proxy and postal votes 'just don't work terribly well'. Third, unlike the civilians in khaki who voted in 1945, today's all-professional services are a bastion of conservatism with a small 'c' and probably a big one as well. Historically, Labour defence secretaries have been relatively kind to the forces. But distrust of Labour is ingrained among officers and, even more, senior NCOs. 'Socialism is anathema,' says one former cavalry officer. 'From the early stages it's drilled into people.' But just how dominant rightwing sympathies are, who knows? John Elliott, editor of Soldier magazine, says he has never come across any information about the service vote in 15 years' association with the Army and Navy. No such poll has been heard of at NOP, Gallup or Mori. 'I suspect you would never get permission to do it,' ventured one pollster. A fair indication might be service-dominated constituencies like Aldershot, where Julian Critchley is defending a Tory majority of nearly 18,000, or neighbouring Gosport, which in spite of being largely working-class is one of the safest Tory seats in the country.</p>

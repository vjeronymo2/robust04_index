			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mahmud 'Umarah, head of Society of Businessmen: </F> "Exporting Is Solution--Our Exports From 2 to 10 Billion  (Dollars): Reality or Illusion?"]    [Text] Paris--What a coincidence! One week after we write  about how exporting is the solution, the government comes out  with a decision to raise Egyptian exports to 10 billion  [dollars] in five years--a 500-percent increase in our exports  over their current value! Is it possible, or just an illusion?  Is it a dream that can be realized?    I immediately say yes. It is no exaggeration to say it is a  modest figure, compared to what Tunisia, Morocco, and other even  more backward African countries are realizing. A yield of $10  billion for Egypt's exports to all the world's markets, while  Turkey, with a population about equal to Egypt's, exports $16  billion! Israel, with 5 million people, exports at the rate of  $12 billion. Singapore, with fewer than 3 million people,  exported at the rate of $59 billion in 1991. In short, an  Egyptian citizen exports the equivalent of $72; an Israeli  citizen 30 times as much, or $2,160; and a citizen of Singapore  359 times as much, or $25,848. Today we dream of a yield of  $10.15 billion from Egypt's agricultural, industrial, and  mineral exports. It must become a reality, for we have no  choice. All the opportunities and circumstances are favorable  for us. The markets of the world are around us. Where is the  problem?    What is the solution, so that the dream may become reality,  not fantasy?    First, a ministry for exports, instead of a ministry for  emigration! If we are serious about the economic reform process,  want equilibrium in our balance of payments, and are honest in  what we say about exporting, we must find unconventional  solutions and apply them quickly. An export ministry in a period  of five years would create a revolution in thinking and  procedures. It would present exhaustive studies of all foreign  markets, their specific requirements, and the taste of consumers  in them. It would be a ministry to coordinate between those in  charge of production policies and marketing. It would be a  budgeted ministry to promote Egyptian products abroad with good  advertising, elegant catalogues, and participation in all  international exhibitions. It would even hold its own  international exhibition, to which it would invite all the  countries of the world every year. It would be a ministry over  all our trade offices. Our embassies would assist it with all  their facilities. Today's wars and tomorrow's policies are  economic wars and policies. The Egyptian producer abroad is our  roving ambassador who enters every house. What one export dollar  can accomplish is hundreds of times more than can be achieved by  spending on propaganda for Egypt. It would be a ministry with a  single goal: at least $10 billion a year!    Second, production policy and marketing policy! Production  is  the starting point. The agencies in charge of agricultural or  industrial production operate at a distance from those that  serve exports; there is a complete separation between them. From  now on there must be coordination between the two policies: for  production for the domestic market is completely different in  its specifications and schedules and even in its taste in  agricultural products.    We must produce what foreign markets need on schedules that  suit those markets and to their specifications and tastes.    In the production process one must attend to quality and  again quality. Quality is the pillar of export and the real  primary weapon for invading international markets.    In short, production policy and export policy must  complement  each other. They are two sides of one coin.    Third, land, sea, and air transportation! The most important  problem that faces export in Egypt is finding an appropriate,  cheap means of transportation--especially air freight.    Here the government can play a role in encouraging our  exports. It can do what Tunisia and Jordan have done by  subsidizing the transportation process, so that costs can be  reduced and the Egyptian product can successfully compete in the  face of other competing products subsidized by their governments.    For example, it is proposed that two of Egypt Air's old  Airbus planes be earmarked for conversion into cargo airplanes.  Freight charges should not exceed $500 a ton, rather than the  current $1,000 a ton, for a five-year transition period to  support exports.    As for sea transport, the problem is that all the existing  companies belong to the public works sector. There is no  significant competition from private companies that would allow  the exporter to obtain better prices. Companies in the public  works sector monopolize the market and impose their own prices,  which are utterly out of line with their services and  international market prices that are set by competition and by  supply and demand--not to mention that there are no regular  lines to Europe!    As for the problem of land transportation, has no one found  a  solution for it? Egyptian exporters and products need coolers  that come from Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; yet we find that all  the agencies in Egypt are fighting them! So the freight charge  for a single cooler from Egypt to Saudi Arabia has risen from  5,000 riyals to 11,000 riyals, at a time when we are in need of  a land transportation fleet.    The importance of a land transportation fleet will become  apparent when the internal Middle East market emerges. Everyone  around us is preparing himself for the wrestling match. Do we  have to remain spectators and wake up after the last round to  regret that it is too late and that we have missed another  opportunity?    Fourth, fees and taxes! Exports are more important than the  investment companies and new development schemes that are given  a 10-year tax exemption. Export activity should be given a  five-year exemption from fees or taxes of any kind, except the  commercial profits tax. The latter is the right of the state and  country: every citizen who realizes net profits at the end of  the year must pay the treasury part of his profits for services  and security.    Exempting export activity from the remaining other fees and  taxes will enable it to compete and enter new markets  monopolized by countries that are professional at exporting. The  government takes in no more than 30 million pounds a year from  all these various fees and taxes. It is a paltry amount in the  budget, but it affects the competitiveness of companies and  causes them to waste time dealing with all these  agencies--particularly the Tax Department!    Fifth, the export register! The foundation is the exporter  himself, with good preparation. There are 20,000 registers that  have been recorded for exporters; yet only 1,000 exporters are  active in exporting. The export profession in the past became  the profession of those who had no profession.    Retired senior state employees over 60 and many young people  who dream of quick wealth imagine they have succeeded simply by  obtaining an export register. Many of them, one discovers, have  no experience in any market. One always finds some of them  venturing to ship products without knowing the risk involved;  and if one does not know the specifications of the market there,  or if one has no information and facts about the customer, one  will waste the expense of the deal and lose everything--and find  oneself involved with courts and lawyers' offices. How many  professional swindlers there are in the international markets!  Their victims are usually from the Third World.    Sixth, insurance! This is the role of the Federation of  Chambers of Commerce in protecting exporters from themselves,  first, and from professional nonpayers in foreign markets. The  federation should find a solution with one of the specialized  insurance companies. It could study drawing up a single policy  for all exporters recognized by the association. Each exporter  might pay 1 percent of the volume of his yearly business. The  exporter would become more courageous and at the same time could  devote himself to quality, packaging, and marketing.    Seventh, financing! Where are the inexpensive sources of  financing for export activity? As everyone knows, an exporter  does not collect the price of a deal until one or two months  after the shipping date.    Where is the Exports Bank [Egyptian Export Development Bank]  headed by Dr. Hazim al-Bablawi, who is an expert of recognized  ability in the problems of exporters?    Finally, we note that during the past seven years the value  of exports of goods not traditionally exported has increased by  150 percent. This is a leap and an asset to be credited to  official and government effort and to businessmen. But by the  criteria of the challenge, we must achieve the target. The  government, exporters, other official bodies, as well as  Egyptian importers overseas must unite their efforts toward this  goal, so that Egypt can flourish under a bold liberalization  policy.</p>

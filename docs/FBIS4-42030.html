			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Semenov by correspondent O. Sigacheva; </F> place and date not given: "...Is Not Moscow on Our Side? The  Sevastopol-Russia Common Economic Space Is Already Taking Shape"]    [Text] At the time of Moscow's May Day anniversary  festivities Moscow City Hall allocated for the social needs of  Sevastopol a tidy sum--R500 million. This was the result of a  trip to the Russian capital by V. Semenov, chairman of the city  council. The polemic over this fact continues. Some people  consider the Russian money a gift (handout) for the Ukrainian  city, others, an important event in the history of Sevastopol  and the start of the real integration of the capital of the  Russian fleet in Russia.    [Sigacheva] Viktor Mikhaylovich, who is right? And how,  generally, did this idea arise?    [Semenov] Life itself dictates the need to create a common  union of Slav states since the latter-day sovereign borders run  primarily through the fate of ordinary people. I began to think  that the prototype of a future common economic space and the  first component of revival could be a union of hero-cities for  they are located only in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The idea  of a union of hero-cities arose at public organization level  last year, and an executive committee of the union headed by  Admiral A. Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, was  created. But I wanted to expand the framework of  military-patriotic education and to raise the concord to a  higher, practical level. My proposal concerning the organization  of economic ties found a response with A. Sobchak, mayor of St.  Petersburg, when, in January, I was there for the celebration of  the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the city. I negotiated  on economic collaboration specifically with Krasnogvardeyskiy  Rayon, which has "defense" enterprises related to ours. E.  Shatberger, first deputy chief of the rayon administration, and  his deputy, A. Kushchak (a native Sevastopolian, incidentally),  have already been to Sevastopol to conclude a more specific  agreement.    Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov came on 23 February, visited the  cruiser Moskva, and "blessed" the laying of the foundation stone  of a home for families of the crew, and we had a chance to talk  only in the Officers' House, in the interval at the concert. He  liked the idea, and I received an invitation to Moscow for  future negotiations.    [Sigacheva] But you did not go immediately....    [Semenov] What can you do if Sevastopol has become the most  "political" city in the CIS: 20 planning sessions, and there  was, in addition, a special, emergency, session in connection  with the aggravated economic situation. It was this that  commissioned me to meet with the Russian and Ukrainian  leadership. Whereas last year the immense budget deficit was  closed within the framework of the stabilization program, this  time L. Kravchuk was unable to say anything reassuring, and when  the conversation came around to the funding of the fleet, he  said, approximately: This is your problem, go to Moscow, and  resolve it there.... It was this "instruction" together with the  decision of the session and Luzhkov's invitation that compelled  my trip to Moscow.    [Sigacheva] As a suppliant?    [Semenov] No. The main purpose was to show at all levels (in  the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the presidential  structures) the need for the partial funding of the  infrastructure and social sphere of city. Some 35,500 of our  inhabitants are the families of servicemen, and the families of  workers and employees of naval enterprises constitute more than  75,000--this is just under one-fourth of the population of the  city. I had attempted to raise this matter last year during my  hour-long interview with B. Yeltsin, but the Mukhalatka accords  on the division of the Black Sea Fleet were all the rage at that  time, and Boris Nikolayevich believed that economic matters  should be decided simultaneously with political matters. But  time was on our side, and the Massandra Protocol was signed, and  a consensus of the branches of power had, in addition, begun to  emerge in Russia. And I decided to initiate a decision on the  question of the inclusion of the funding of Sevastopol in the  Russian budget.    [Sigacheva] The president agreed with you on this occasion?    [Semenov] On the basis of my letter containing calculations  he wrote out a resolution: "To Chernomyrdin, Shumeyko, Rybkin. I  request consideration of Semenov's appeal in the work on the  1994 budget." This showed once again that Russia is being true  to the protocol of the Massandra meeting.    [Sigacheva] You met with the same understanding among other  Russian leaders also?    [Semenov] And what I remember particularly is that all of  them, despite the pressure of work, were able to find the time  for a comprehensive conversation. The Federal Assembly was at  that time considering the important question of the Russian  procurator general, and in the break (from 1400 to 1600 hours)  Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, snatching a bite to eat literally  on the run, spent the whole of the rest of the time talking with  me. The conversation with Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was held  immediately following a sitting of the Duma. And at what time do  you think I met with Konstantin Fedorovich Zatulin? At nine in  the evening, immediately following his return from Sochi from  negotiations with Ardzinba. I also met with important  entrepreneurs and enterprise leaders, and I had a useful  conversation (it is already bearing fruit) with the chairman of  the board of directors of a Russian bank.    [Sigacheva] You did not forget about Luzhkov?    [Semenov] It was hardest of all for him to find the time,  and  we met almost on the eve of my departure, late in the evening.  He issued a command to his deputies immediately, evidently,  because it turned out the next day that many questions had  already been decided: concerning prescription drugs, textbooks  in Russian, gifts for war veterans (and there are in Sevastopol  8,500 who took part in the defense and liberation of the city  alone). In the afternoon a session of the Moscow government  decided to allocate Sevastopol those same R500 million. In  addition, at my request Luzhkov gave instructions for the  preparation of a directive that Sevastopolians coming to Moscow  not be required to register as "foreigners" and that they pay in  the hotels the same as Russian citizens. I negotiated on  specific economic cooperation with V. Shantsev, leader of a  prefecture of the Yuzhnyy Administrative District. This district  has many "defense" enterprises and the ZIL, Dinamo, and Ilich  plant giants (an assassination attempt on the leader of the  revolution was made at the last named). As we were driving past  this plant, I remembered familiar words from the school history  textbook: "We will go another way." And thought: In our time  this "other way" can only be that of direct, interbusiness  ties--at enterprise level--and the creation of joint works  without a backward glance at both the republic and local  authorities. It would then be immaterial whether this leader or  the other remained in office--an agreement would not lapse with  his departure. And the strengthening ties would afford people an  opportunity to live better--as they deserve.    Many candidates for mayor of Sevastopol have now taken up  the  idea of a union of Slav states. Viktor Mikhaylovich Semenov is  already doing everything to ensure that the formation of a  common economic space already begins....</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Pollution liability 'threatens financing' FLOWS OF capital to industry could be 'seriously impeded' because bankers and insurers are afraid of future environmental costs, a government advisory committee warned yesterday. Changes in the laws on environmental liability 'could have profound and adverse consequences for business across all sectors', the working group said in a report to the trade and industry and environment departments. One banker said yesterday: 'The critical issue is whether banks who take property or land as security could be held to be liable for its pollution. It could be something a sensible bit of due diligence can deal with, or it could be a time bomb; it's too early to know.' Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said: 'Recent legal trends are hastening the day when insurers will be unable to offer pollution cover as a part of standard policies.' It amended its recommended policy wordings restricting coverage to sudden and accidental pollution in 1990. Companies have become increasingly concerned that they could be liable for damages and clean-up costs under recent UK and EC environmental legislation. UK court cases have raised questions of whether the principle of 'retrospective liability' for past pollution that met the environmental standards of the day would become widely applied. The 14-strong group, which is chaired by Mr Derek Wanless of National Westminster Bank, also criticises recent government proposals for a register of contaminated land for assessing only the past use of land and not the degree of pollution. The Financial Sector Working Group produced the report for the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment, which is a group of senior businesspeople set up to advise the trade and industry and environment departments on environmental issues from a business perspective. Bankers and insurers welcomed the report. Lloyds Bank said: 'We endorse the committee's comments and are looking at the issue seriously.' Mr Tom Symes, head of the environmental department at Nabarro Nathanson, the solicitors, said 'Insurers will certainly welcome the conclusions of the report. What they need is to have the position of potential retrospective liability clarified, particularly if any strict liability wordings are agreed by the EC.' However, others warned that such fears may be overblown - at least until there is a longer record of court cases or changes in legislation. A director of the credit rating department of a City merchant bank said: 'We have been unable to complete some transactions because of unresolved environmental problems, mainly to do with land, but the banking world has sometimes got a bit paranoid about the issue. Just because there is pollution doesn't mean there will be huge claims.' Ms Sarah Gooden, of Gouldens, the firm of solicitors, said: 'It is a big issue, but it is possible the banks are more worried than they need to be: they sometimes fix on potential problems and take some time to get comfortable with them.'</p>

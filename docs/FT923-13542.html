			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Ulster weighs its balancing act: The recurring charges of human rights abuse AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, last week again documented lengthy allegations of abuse in Northern Ireland. It is a perennial charge against the UK government which has to tackle, in the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, some of the world's most experienced terrorists. This year, though, there is perhaps more reason to suggest that tougher measures to prevent abuse may be implemented. All the Northern Ireland parties taking part in 'round-table' talks on the province's future support a bill of rights, or incorporation of the European convention on human rights into UK law. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said he would not oppose such a move. If the talks collapse, it is one element that might be salvaged. Allegations of the sort listed by Amnesty International are common in the republican heartlands and Roman Catholic-dominated towns of Northern Ireland. But unionists are also worried about possible abuse. Few argue that abuse is avoidable in an undeclared war against paramilitaries. The worst atrocities are committed by terrorists; ministers' prime concern has to be preserving the right to life of the province's population. It is a difficult balance, but the security forces are often distrusted by the minority nationalist population - and sometimes by unionists as well. There is a widespread perception that checks on the security forces are inadequate. 'There is no law here,' says Father Denis Faul, principal of St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and persistent campaigner for human rights. 'The British give us money for leisure centres, they give us the small liberties but they will keep all the big ones. They are a bit inclined to be bullies.' Allegations of human rights abuse lowers Britain's esteem abroad, adding to Northern Ireland's grim image in the eyes of possible investors. 'In Northern Ireland you have much greater pressure on human rights but the pressure takes place in the part of Europe which has the least safeguards,' says Mr Colm Campbell, chairman of the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of Justice. Particular anxiety has arisen in the past year over the treatment of suspects at the RUC's Castlereagh holding centre in Belfast. The Northern Ireland emergency provisions acts allow suspects to be held for up to seven days without being charged. Access to a solicitor can be delayed for 48 hours after arrest. Amnesty International last week detailed allegations of confessions obtained under duress and of physical intimidation of suspects. Last year it complained to the United Nations' Committee against Torture. The RUC says there is no policy of abusing prisoners and its investigations rarely find conclusive evidence to substantiate the allegations. An independent commissioner for holding centres is to be appointed but complaints will continue to be investigated by the RUC itself - either under the supervision of the new commissioner or the existing Northern Ireland Independent Commission for Police Complaints. Lack of adequate safeguards is a recurrent theme of the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights (SACHR) - an independent body set up by the government in 1973. Sir Oliver Napier, who stood down as chairman of the SACHR at the end of last month, says the government is extremely slow to accept its recommendations. The Northern Ireland Office argues that it strikes the right balance between tackling terrorism and protecting human rights. But, as has become apparent during the inter-party talks, unionists and nationalists accept that a formal mechanism for ensuring a proper balance may be needed.</p>

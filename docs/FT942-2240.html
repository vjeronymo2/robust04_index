			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ICL to spread the load of its pc distribution Sluggish sales and frustration among customers have forced ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer owned by Fujitsu of Japan, to abandon a controversial personal computer marketing strategy which left responsibility for pc distribution throughout Britain in the hands of one company. Technology, a wholly owned ICL subsidiary, has been relieved of its responsibility for UK-wide pc distribution. A new sales and marketing organisation, ICL Client-Server Systems Trading, is being established to supply ICL pcs and servers (medium power computers) to distributors, dealers and systems houses. The abrupt change of strategy underlines the difficulties faced by full-line computer manufacturers as they struggle with the economics of a market dominated by inexpensive, low profit margin personal computers. Given adequate technology, success in this market is tied to low cost distribution to retailers, dealers and value-added resellers who add software and services to the basic hardware. ICL's answer was the purchase two years ago of Technology, then one of the UK's largest pc distributors. It was a controversial decision because it meant Technology would be distributing ICL pcs alongside competitive products from International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, Compaq and Sun. IBM, for a time, terminated its distribution contract. ICL's UK pc market share, however, has remained stubbornly stagnant at about 5 per cent. Mr Nigel Croisdale, who has been appointed to run the new distribution company, believes it has to double its UK market share to be a credible performer. Giving Technology exclusive distribution rights put intolerable strains on the company's physical ability to handle the volume of business. 'Frequently, we did not have enough inventory to meet demand. We were failing to meet delivery dates and this upset customers,' Mr Croisdale said. Technology took on the roles of agent, reseller and distributor which significantly reduced the amount of credit in the system. This is important for many resellers who depend on credit from their distributor.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> More on Buchwald Trial: When the second phase of the Buchwald vs. Paramount  Pictures trial begins later this year, the studio can be held liable for  punitive damages should Buchwald's attorneys prove impropriety in Paramount's  bookkeeping for "Coming to America."  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider added the punitive damages ruling to his  original verdict in the case, handed down last month, in which Buchwald and  co-plaintiff Alain Bernheim were awarded 19% of the net profits of the Eddie  Murphy hit. Paramount maintains that the movie, which has taken in an estimated  $350 million, has earned no net profits. Paramount is to begin turning over  documents to Buchwald's auditors during the discovery portion of the accounting  phase beginning next month. Attorneys expect to go to trial by early summer.

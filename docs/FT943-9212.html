			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Dividends on Offer There was nothing remotely shocking in yesterday's review of distribution prices by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator. By demanding one-off price cuts in distribution ranging from 11 to 17 per cent, Prof Littlechild has reduced the companies' rate of return. By running down dividend cover, releasing provisions and finding additional efficiencies, though, the regional electricity companies should be able to deliver real dividend growth of at least 5 per cent - and probably more - until the end of the decade. While utilities are always prone to political interference, this looks like a more than adequate return, given the level of risk. Exactly how well shareholders are rewarded now depends on the ability of individual companies to manage costs and cash. Offer's annual efficiency target for operating costs of 3 per cent is higher than that imposed on the water companies by their regulator a fortnight ago. But the Recs are quietly confident. And while the water companies will have to borrow to bridge the gap between cash flow and capital spending, most of the Recs will enjoy positive cash flow. All 12 companies have authorisation from shareholders to buy back shares: their timing could separate leaders from laggards. Whether the prospect of five years of positive cash flow is enough to flush out potential bidders is less certain. A predator able to cut costs faster than the incumbent management and invest surplus cash to the benefit of shareholders would certainly deserve a hearing. Given Prof Littlechild's faith in the power of market forces, it is difficult to imagine the regulator instinctively siding with the defence.</p>

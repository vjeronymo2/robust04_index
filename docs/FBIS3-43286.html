			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today a demonstration was held by the Front for  Democracy in Burundi [FRODEBU] Party and parties allied to that  of the president, namely the People's Party, Burundi People's  Rally, and Liberal Party. For two full hours they marched  through the streets of Bujumbura.    The demonstrators had only one goal on their banners and in  their slogans: Support the arrival of the Mission for  Protection and Restoration of trust in Burundi -- Miprobu, in  short. Christopher Nkurunziza followed the march. [passage  omitted]    All along the streets of the city center the placards and  slogans were more than clear. For the demonstrators, Miprobu is  a shield of democracy and no durable peace can come to Burundi  without the coming of this international force. According to  the demonstrators, the 180 soldiers of the Miprobu are  insufficient and the government should request that the number  of Miprobu troops be multiplied by 10.    The militants of the ruling party and its allies marched for  more than 15 km in light rain before reaching the Football  Federation Club stadium in front of the Source of the Nile  Hotel. [passage omitted]    In the speech he delivered on the occasion, Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, speaker of the National Assembly and interim  chairman of the FRODEBU party, noted the power of last 1 June  emanates from the people's will. The latter is sovereign.  Thus, according to him, it was legitimate that the ruling  party, the president of the Republic, the National Assembly and  the government control all the organs of the country. The  speaker of the Burundi National Assembly said that when the  government calls on Africans to provide the security of the  government, no contrary decision can be taken. The Army will  have to cooperate with the Miprobu which, according to Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, is not coming to plunge the country back into  chaos.</p>

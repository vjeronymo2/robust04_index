			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Gilts' poor response to Tuesday's base rate cut has put the Bank of England into a quandary. Normally it would be expected to announce an auction today. But with sterling weaker and the March future down almost two points over the past week, it cannot be certain how well the announcement would be received. Since it has virtually completed this year's funding programme, it could skip this month's auction. But this could be perceived as an admission that the market was too weak to absorb new paper. That would only drive prices lower. A better approach might be to launch an auction of short-dated paper, which has proved less vulnerable than long gilts to swings in sentiment. With five-year yields of around 6 per cent and base rates at 5.25 per cent, there is limited downside risk and some chance of capital gain if the authorities do move to cut interest rates again. The short end of the market also attracts a broad range of buyers including banks and securities houses involved in the swaps market. Yet the Bank also needs to find a way of resuming its borrowing at the long end of the market. It has avoided doing so for a long time for fear of being seen to pay high real rates for 20- to 30-year money when inflation is supposed to remain low. The weakness of long gilts in recent days might suggest it has missed the boat altogether, but there is still a chance that confidence will return once world markets have adjusted to the Fed's new policy stance. If so, present market weakness would present a buying opportunity the Bank could exploit with a long-dated auction in March or April.</p>

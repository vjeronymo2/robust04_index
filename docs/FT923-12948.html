			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: CAE settles US military contract suit CAE Industries of Canada has settled for USDollars 55.9m a USDollars 231m action filed by the US government against its CAE-Link subsidiary. CAE-Link will pay USDollars 22.5m. BiCoastal of the US is responsible for the balance. CAE Industries, the world's leading commercial flight simulator builder, did not admit liability in the case. The US Department of Justice claimed CAE-Link, which specialises in military systems and training, overcharged the government on contracts carried out between 1983 and 1988, and sought triple damages. Link was owned by the former Singer Corp at the time of the alleged offences. CAE Industries bought Link in August 1988 and, in November 1989, Singer filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and became BiCoastal. CAE maintained it did not know of any pending lawsuits when it bought Link. The Justice Department, as part of the settlement, agreed CAE-Link did not admit liability, legal fault or responsibility for the alleged offences. Senior creditors led by the Royal Bank of Canada, and owed about CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m), have agreed to exchange debt for stock in a new company emerging from the restructuring of Central Capital, a fast-growing financial services group.</p>

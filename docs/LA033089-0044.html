			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SCULPTOR AGAIN AT WORK ON LOY STATUE  </P> <P> Despite an incurable illness, sculptor William Van Orden is back at work, once  again restoring Venice High School's famous statue of actress Myrna Loy and two  other figures that were damaged by vandals. Van Orden has repaired the statues  12 times over the last decade, replacing arms and heads that were broken off  and once even dynamited.  </P> <P> Van Orden had thought he would not be able to repair the statue after the most  recent attack by vandals, because he has cancer. Doctors say he may live only  another two months.  </P> <P> However, after a recent Times story about the statue and Van Orden, he received  nearly $600 in donations. The support persuaded him to repair Loy's statue one  more time.  </P> <P> "I decided I couldn't abandon her," he said. "I had to return one more time,  this is my life's work and after I finish this job, I feel I can pass the job  on to someone else."  </P></p>

The clerks sat  on the sidelines, under arrest.  </P> <P> The scene was repeated at three other sites in Diamond Bar, Encino and Marina  del Rey as the sheriff's vice bureau raided bookmaking sites run by three  networks that together control an estimated 45% to 50% of the county's illegal  gambling, authorities said.  </P> <P> Eight clerks were arrested and about $1.25 million worth of wagers -- one day's  take -- were disrupted, said Lt. David Kading of the vice bureau.  </P> <P> It is the height of the bookie season -- which, not coincidentally, parallels  the pro football season, the biggest lure for sports gamblers.  </P> <P> In October, law enforcement officers in three Southern California counties  dismantled a $1-million-a-week operation. In November, a separate series of  arrests broke up a $2-million-a-week ring.  </P> <P> Sunday's raids dismantled business at offices that took in about $3.5 million a  week, but deputies did not lodge fatal blows against the organizations that run  them.  </P> <P> On Nov. 3, deputies arrested nine others at five other sites run by the same  groups, stopping $1 million in bets. The three networks have about 10 sites  apiece, Kading said, and probably bring in a total of $15 to $20 million a  week. He would not provide details about the suspected leaders or further  characterize the organizations because the investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> The raids pointed up the newly decentralized nature of bookmaking, a  development helped along by telephone technology such as call-forwarding and  toll-free 800 numbers.  </P> <P> "In the old days -- the old days being not so long ago -- there would be one  room, with 20 or 30 clerks and a switchboard that looked like a police phone  room," Kading said. "This way, they don't lose everything if one location is  shut down."  </P> <P> Indeed, at four other places searched by deputies Sunday, phones were on  call-forward and authorities could not determine where wagers were actually  being recorded. Warrants could not be served and the action apparently  proceeded -- somewhere.  </P> <P> In East Los Angeles alone, Kading said, $500,000 in bets would have been placed  on Sunday had business not been interrupted.  </P> <P> When deputies broke in the door of a room on the second floor of a Whittier  Boulevard medical building, they surprised two women and a man sitting around  four folding tables that formed a rectangle. Each clerk had a four-line phone,  wager forms, odds sheets and an adding machine.  </P> <P> A television was tuned to the station that would carry the Los Angeles Rams vs.  the Cleveland Browns. The clerks were set to pass a pleasant morning, with  bottles of soda, cups of carry-out coffee, a paperback novel and a box of  crayons littering the table tops.  </P> <P> "We brought tamales. Can we eat them?" joked Ventura Aguayo, 49, of Los  Angeles. Like her colleagues, Louise Marie Lopez, 38, of West Covina and Juan  Jorge Menriquez, 43, of Los Angeles, she was booked on suspicion of felony  bookmaking.  </P> <P> Lopez said the clerks had operated out of the room "for just a few months." The  target organizations routinely shut down locations and open new ones, Kading  said.  </P> <P> Aguayo's name provided the office password. "Aguayo Appraisal," the clerks said  when they answered the phone.  </P> <P> The deputies said the same thing when they sat down as replacements to gather  evidence. In the space of 15 minutes, they took several hundred calls from the  likes of "449 Joe" and "Tracy for Augie." The bets ranged from $50 to $1,000.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a Marina del Rey apartment, Earl Balos, 70, was arrested. At  another apartment in Encino, Douglas Dimock, 41, William Anderson, 33, and  Richard Anderson, 41, were taken into custody. Authorities also found a  false-top desk there where bookmaking paraphernalia could be secreted. In a  Diamond Bar house, Rex Tidd, 71, was arrested.  </P></p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi charts a curious course in Milan A WEAKER dollar affected some of the continent's bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN took the government approval of the 1994 budget in its stride, and shares finished marginally ahead as the market wound down ahead of next Wednesday's close of the September account. The Comit index rose 4.87 to 597.51, for a 5 per cent decline on the week. Ferruzzi continued to chart a curious course, the share opening 10 per cent higher before the price turned turtle later in the morning and finished L49.75 or 10 per cent lower on the day at L448. Volume was a very heavy 40.7m shares. Dealers were at a loss to explain the turnaround: on each of the first four days of the week, the shares rose by their maximum permissible 10 per cent limit. One dealer suggested that the exchange authorities could not delay much longer an inquiry into the stock's recent volatility. Telecommunications shares made a firm start in the wake of government approval of the sector's reorganisation next year. But gains were subsequently trimmed to leave Sip L11 higher at L3,311 and Italcable L52 ahead at L9,281. FRANKFURT eased further, its sixth consecutive decline, as the market continued to be affected by the weaker dollar. The DAX index ended down 19.37 or 1 per cent at 1,861.44, a fall on the week of 3.3 per cent. While there was disappointment at the limited cut in the the repo on Thursday, some analysts remained confident that after a period of consolidation the market would again move ahead. Viag and Linde featured among the day's heaviest losers, with respective falls of DM15 and DM11 to DM436 and DM770. Among the car makers, much in the news this week, BMW lost DM6 to DM553 and Volkswagen DM6.30 to DM354.50 while Daimler was off DM8.50 at DM710. Schering was the only bright spot, rising DM5.50 to DM962.50. PARIS was little changed on the day but down 2.2 per cent on the week. The CAC-40 index lost 0.37 to 2,108.38 after a high of 2,117 and a low of 2,094. Turnover dropped back to FFr3.1bn from FFr4.6bn. Carrefour, which had attracted some interest earlier in the week, lost FFr11 to FFr3,173. Hoare Govett commented that the shares look fully valued and recommended a holding only to maintain a sector weighting. Bouygues, which announced the award of a new contract on Wednesday, added FFr7 to FFr674. ZURICH edged lower in thin trading ahead of a long holiday weekend. The SMI index shed 18.5 to 2,363.6, down 3.1 per cent on the week. Nestle led the market lower on further consideration of Thursday's first half results, the registered shares shedding SFr17 to SFr1,053. ATHENS rebounded after a 2.6 per cent drop at the opening, as institutional investors were attracted back by lower prices. The general index finished 4.37 higher at 806.22 having dropped below 780 points at midday on pre-election jitters. ISTANBUL finished at a fourth record high this week, but retreated from early gains. The composite index ended 110.1 higher at 12,948.9, 11 per cent higher on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- September 10                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1269.67   1269.90   1268.02   1265.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1360.28   1358.63   1359.46   1359.26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1265.25   1263.98   1262.95   1263.72 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1358.09   1356.17   1353.78   1355.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 9     Sep 8     Sep 7     Sep 6     Sep 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1265.95   1266.53   1277.38   1284.01   1293.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1362.52   1363.68   1365.81   1371.90   1384.27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1271.00 ; 200 - 1361.98 Low/day: 100 - 1262.30  200 - 1352.04.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Cox] </F>   [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 1 Feb, CANA -- Although the  global recession appears to be ending, Caribbean economies did  not perform satisfactorily last year mainly because the region's  major countries had a less than spectacular performance. This  assessment came Tuesday from president of the Barbados-based  Caribbean Development Bank [CDB], Sir Neville Nicholls, who said  the impact of the minimal progress of the larger economies will  be felt by the whole region.    Sir Neville said: "With regard to the actual economic  outturn in the 17 borrowing member countries, the Gross Domestic  Product of seven of these was higher than in 1992. In five  others, there was positive growth of the GDP, although less than  in 1992 and mainly marginally so. Three countries registered no  change from the previous year; and in the last two, there was no  growth, only declines in 1993 GDP." The CDB president suggested  that a return to buoyancy by the main economies would have  considerable meaning to the region as their markets were  critical to the restoration of some prosperity to intra-regional  trade.    Trinidad and Tobago retreated from very marginal growth in  1992 to a negative position in 1993 with a - 1-percent growth  rate. The Bahamas stagnated at the 1992 level which was itself  half a percentage point below the level attained in 1991.  Jamaica recorded a 1.5-percent growth which, while better than  the 1.2-percent in 1992, was still extremely low; and Barbados,  after three years of significant decline, turned itself around  with just a 1-percent growth.    Sir Neville revealed: "The information available so far  shows  the year's top performers to have been Anguilla with 7.5-percent  growth; Guyana, between 7 and 8 percent; Cayman Islands, 4  percent; St. Kitts and Nevis, 4 percent; Belize, 3.9 percent,  which is a substantial drop from the 7.4-percent of 1992, and  the British Virgin Islands, 3.5 percent." The CDB president  offered a number of reasons for the less than stellar  performance of the Borrowing Member Countries (BMC's), which did  little to offer any relief for the 200,000 thousand unemployed  in the region.    He said: "With the exception of Guyana and Trinidad and  Tobago, the others are fairly strong tourist-oriented economies.  And last year, the region, insofar as tourism is concerned,  continued to suffer from the slow recovery from the recession in  North America." In addition, many of the European countries,  because of the depreciation of their currencies in relation to  the United States dollar, and their own problems with the global  recession, did not provide the Caribbean with many visitors.    As well, Sir Neville explained that "some of the countries  in  the region, particularly Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and  Tobago, are suffering from what can best be termed as  foreign-debt overhang." A substantial proportion of their  financial resources, especially with their earnings of foreign  currency, continues to be spent on servicing foreign  indebtedness. Another problem for these countries is that  manufacturing entities are beginning to feel the effects of  trade liberalisation. This in turn has resulted in reduced  output and increased unemployment.    "This is in many respects an inevitable process that is  taking place. The trend towards liberalisation of trade is a  worldwide one and our countries, this region, is finding it  increasingly difficult to protect their industries, particularly  manufacturing industries, from competition from outside," Sir  Neville told reporters at a news conference. The overall  position with most of the major economies of the Caribbean is a  relative shortage of foreign exchange. "Once you have that  situation," Sir neville said, "governments find it virtually  impossible to stimulate the economy because of the shortage of  foreign exchange."    An analysis of the main performing sectors of the region's  economy offers some hope contingent upon a resumption of  sustained growth in the global economy, and on restructuring of  individual economies to enable them to respond competitively to  the new situation they face. In tourism, for example, figures  show that the number of stopover arrivals and cruiseship  visitors in the tourism- oriented BMC's increased in 1993. Sir  Neville explained that "as would be expected, consequent upon  the recovery in North America, tourism growth was strongest in  those economies which traditionally get the overwhelming  majority of their tourists from North America." As far as the  banana industry was concerned in 1993, a number of factors  adversely affected it. Principal among these was the exchange  rate of sterling which depreciated, giving producers less in  domestic currency for every pound sterling earned.    The bank president said: "Moreover, uncertainty about the  future deepened as a result of significant changes in the  arrangements for marketing Caribbean bananas in the European  Union." Belize and Jamaica had offsetting effects of the lower  prices by expanding output through production efficiencies.  Although like Jamaica, Belize experienced a fall in unit  earnings, it nonetheless was able to increase total earnings.  For St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, there were  substantial declines in both production volumes and export  earnings.    Sugar production dipped by about 3 per cent from 732,000  tonnes produced in 1992, with St. Kitts and Nevis alone  recording an increase in production by about 4 percent, while  Barbados suffered a falloff of approximately 10 percent,  continuing the slide in the industry for this island over the  past few years. Jamaica's production was 7,000 tonnes less than  in 1992. As far as Guyana was concerned, production fell  slightly compared with previous years, but was still 50 percent  above the 1991 level. Belize also recorded a drop in sugar  production, but this was deliberate since a greater percentage  of its increased output in sugarcane was used for the production  of molasses. And in Trinidad and Tobago, sugar production was  estimated at 4 percent less, although there were quite  remarkable increases in other areas of export agriculture, such  as cocoa and citrus.    With regard to bauxite production, figures up to the end of  September suggest that the decline was about 1.2 percent. Guyana  recorded a slight increase, but this was offset by the decline  in Jamaica, which is the bigger producer. The industry's  prospects continued to be affected by weak international markets  although the CDB approved a U.S.16.5 million dollar loan for the  industry in Jamaica. There were also disappointing performances  in the region's petroleum industry. The decline continued in  Trinidad and Tobago during 1993 with output falling by about 8  percent. In Barbados as well, there was a decline of 4 percent  to nearly 460,000 barrels.</p>

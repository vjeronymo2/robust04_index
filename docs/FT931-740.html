			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Australian bonds: Budget deficit worries bolster yields A BOUT of nervousness struck the Australian government bond market last week as it became clear that the re-elected Labor administration and the Reserve Bank are heading for a disagreement about the growing federal budget deficit. The unease sparked a wave of selling on Friday which raised yields across the board. The yield on the October 2002 Treasury bond rose 20 basis points to 7.93 per cent, that on the September 1995 bond increased by 10 basis points to 6.38 per cent, and 90-day bank bills finished two points higher at 5.34 per cent. The sell-off interrupted a sustained rally which had cut the yield on the 10-year bond from around 9 per cent in mid-January to just over 7.5 per cent on March 19. The rally was triggered by a catalogue of factors, including a reduction in inflation to an OECD low of 0.3 per cent; signs that economic growth is beginning to pick up; receding prospects of a balance of payments crisis; and a firmer Australian dollar following cuts in overseas interest rates. The announcement of an early election, subsequently won by the incumbent Labor Party, also helped by eliminating political uncertainty and increasing the prospects of a cut in official rates, which eventually materialised last Tuesday. In the event, the Reserve Bank restricted the easing to half a percentage point, disappointing the equities market, but in line with expectations in the bond market which had marked down the yield on 90-day bills to 5.26 per cent before the announcement. The rosy outlook dimmed on Friday, after Mr John Dawkins, the finance minister let it be known that he regarded the budget deficit as a less important issue than the need for growth to reduce unemployment from its near record level of 11.1 per cent. Mr Dawkins' view was in stark contrast to a warning issued earlier in the week by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, that the deficit must be reduced over the medium term to provide room for an increase in private investment. The finance minister was presumably aware of the impact his reported views were likely to have on the bond market, since a similar outbreak of concern about perceived fiscal laxity after his August 1992 budget pushed the 10-year bond yield from about 8.3 per cent to more than 9 per cent. This time round, the market wanted rapid confirmation from the government that it remains determined to reduce the deficit, which is forecast at ADollars 15.9bn in the year to June. 'An explanation is needed,' said one trader. 'If this guy is serious, then bonds should not be at current levels.' However, Mr Dawkins failed to clarify his reported views, leaving the market stewing over forecasts by business economists that the deficit could rise to ADollars 20bn next year unless urgent action is taken. Ms Ivana Bottini, an economist at Citibank in Sydney, says the market's main fear is that an expansionary fiscal policy risks triggering a sharp rise in domestic consumption, a current account crisis and a rebirth of inflation. Ms Bottini believes these fears are exaggerated in view of the sluggishness of Australia's recovery from the 1990-91 recession. However, they raise the prospect that Mr Fraser might feel constrained to raise interest rates to keep inflation low and head off overseas pressure on the Australian dollar. The optimistic view is that Mr Dawkins will take sufficient action in his August budget to convince the markets that the government is serious about restraining inflation and balancing the federal books. That would lay the groundwork for a further rally across the board. But the finance minister's lack of concern suggests that he intends to stand by his view that the deficit will disappear as growth accelerates. Friday's events suggest that the market does not believe him.</p>

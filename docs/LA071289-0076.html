			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghan President Najibullah directed his troops to lay down their arms for four  days in observance of a Muslim holy period coinciding with the hajj pilgrimage  to Mecca. Guerrillas rejected the four-day cease-fire, saying their "Eid  (feast) will be when an Islamic government replaces Najibullah." The guerrillas  are keeping Kabul, the capital, under sustained rocket attack, and they  launched a counterattack on the military base of Samarkhel, near Jalalabad in  eastern Afghanistan, which was captured by the government last week.  </P></p>

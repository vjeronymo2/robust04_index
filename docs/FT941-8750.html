			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Insurers back policy data drive The Association of British Insurers yesterday backed a drive to examine selling practices in the financial services industry by finding a common basis for assessing how many policies lapse soon after they are bought. It has suggested to Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, that it might develop a method and agreed definitions for collecting data about 'persistency'. It also proposed that such information should cover products sold through independent financial advisers as well as through life companies.</p>

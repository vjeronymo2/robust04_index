			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Consumer credit drop may be obscuring trend Consumer credit figures for November last year, published by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, give mixed signals about the recent trends in consumer spending. Seasonally adjusted net lending to consumers in November was Pounds 290m, down from Pounds 312m in October and below analysts' expectations. The main culprit was finance houses' net lending, which was down to Pounds 262m from Pounds 349m in October. However, this contradicts figures from the Finance and Leasing Association, published at the weekend, which showed an 8 per cent increase in lending between the October and November figures. Monthly statistics are always subject to distortion and, if one aggregates the last three months' figures, the trend in the CSO statistics is positive. Net lending in the three months to November was Pounds 1.09bn, up from Pounds 642m in the three months to August and the highest three-monthly figure since 1989. The prospect of the November 30 Budget may have temporarily lessened consumers' desire to spend. Figures for M0, usually a good indicator of activity in the retail sector, have pointed to a pick-up in spending in late December. Figures for finance-house lending show that consumers were prepared to spend on cars in November. New vehicle-related lending was Pounds 905m, up from Pounds 758m in October. November's credit figures show that net lending on bank credit cards picked up, to Pounds 36m, after consumers repaid Pounds 31m of credit card debt in October. New credit advanced on bank credit cards in November was a record of Pounds 2.99bn.</p>

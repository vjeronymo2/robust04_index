			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Rally in bonds brings solid rise in blue chips Wall Street BUOYED by a rally in the bond market - even though it was inspired by bearish news from the nation's purchasing managers - US share prices posted solid gains in moderate trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.99 at 3,581.11. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.35 firmer at 461.28, while the Amex composite finished up 1.20 at 461.59, a new record high, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.45 at 763.23. Trading volume on the New York SE was 258m shares. Prices opened modestly firmer, although the gains were not spread across the board - secondary stocks, particularly those listed on the Nasdaq market, were weak from the start. Blue-chips, however, began inching higher mid-morning as soon as the bond market, which posted early losses, turned around sharply, following the release of the September National Association of Purchasing Management's report. It showed that the NAPM's index of nationwide manufacturing activity rose from 49.3 per cent in August to 49.7 per cent - a smaller increase than Wall Street had expected. The news, while not positive for stocks, buoyed fixed-income investors, and helped bond prices stage a big rally. By early afternoon the 30-year bond, which had been down half a point at one stage, was up  19/32 at 103, and the yield was down to 5.979 per cent. Stock market investors chose to focus on falling bond yields, and not the weak NAPM report, and share prices moved steadily higher for the rest of the day. Equity market sentiment was probably also helped by the day's other economic figures - on August factory orders and leading indicators - which were both better than expected. Among individual stocks, cyclicals were in demand. International Paper climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 61 1/4 in early trading, before dropping back to end up Dollars  1/4 , Caterpillar added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 80 1/4 , General Motors firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 1/2 , and General Electric rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 95 7/8 . By early afternoon Morgan Stanley's Cyclical Index was up 2.52 at 283.74. Higher oil prices boosted oil company shares. Texaco rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 68 7/8 , Chevron put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 98 3/8 , Phillips Petroleum added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 35 1/8 and British Petroleum rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60. Declining interest rates lifted bank stocks. BankAmerica rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 45, Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 3/8 , Chemical firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 , and Citicorp rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 . Profit-takers moved into Paramount Communications, down Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 7/8 before the next move in the bid battle. Canada TORONTO ended the week on a losing note, falling slightly in quiet trading. The composite index fell 2.39 points, or 0.06%, to 3,988.22. The index was up about 6 points on the week.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Contracting out could mean pensions burden Sir, Robert Rice's article 'Strings attached to contracting out' (Business and the Law, February 22), illustrates the problems contractors face in market testing exercises in dealing with the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations. The latest particular problem is the attorney-general's advice that contractors must offer comparable pensions to those enjoyed in the public sector. You state contractors may wish to challenge this view. In fact we are doing so. At a consultation meeting with contractors last month, Mr Tony Baldry, the junior local government minister, agreed to withdraw such advice to local authorities, pending resolution of the matter, after a unanimous protest that this advice is wrong in law. For market testing in central government, however, the advice from the Cabinet Office still stands. Through the Confederation of British Industry, contractor organisations have since taken counsel's opinion which confirms that the government's advice is incorrect. Even if the government adheres to its view, because the interpretation is quite independent of the Acquired Rights Directive, it would be free to introduce the necessary legislation to remove any entitlement. This issue has now become central to the success of the government's market testing policy. Actuarial calculations suggest that matching the index-linked pensions of the public sector would require private sector employers to make contributions of up to 25 per cent of salary. Such a burden would force many contractors out of the game altogether, and render many innovative private sector bids uncompetitive. If the government wishes to maximise the benefits of its market testing programme, it must now act swiftly at least to reverse its advice on pension benefits.

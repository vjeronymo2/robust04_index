			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.A. Anfimov, I.V. Yershov, Ye.I. Ruzavin, S.S. </F> Semenov, S.K. Shimarev, Moscow; UDC 533.6.071.8]    [Abstract] The urgency of studying shock tubes for  simulating hypersonic flows and examining aerophysical processes  which accompany the movement of flying vehicles and meteorite  bodies in the earth's and other planets' atmosphere,  particularly large-scale shock tubes capable of obtaining  extended quasistatic high-temperature gas flows whose duration  is sufficient for taking various measurements on models of  winged vehicles, prompted an investigation into hypersonic flows  in such tubes with multiple diaphragms. In particular, the flow  structure in such tubes at various operating conditions and  regimes is examined; in so doing, the shape and structure of the  shock wave front are determined, the quality and duration of  working flows are evaluated, and the shock wave parameters are  measured in order to use large-scale shock tubes in hypersonic  aerodynamic and aerophysical research. In addition, the shock  wave interaction with various models, e.g., spacecraft and  aircraft, their components and modular configurations,  terrestrial structure elements, etc., is also studied using the  installation. The study made it possible to obtain data on the  fundamental physical and chemical properties of air at high  temperatures and pressures. The installation developed by the  Central Scientific Research Institute of Mechanical Engineering  has a channel with a 0.5 m diameter, a close to 200 m length,  and a gas holder with a 3 m diameter and 23 m length. The  findings have been implemented in the development of such  delivery vehicles as Vostok and Proton, Soyuz reentry modules,  Luna, Venera, and Mars descent modules, and Energiya-Buran  complex.

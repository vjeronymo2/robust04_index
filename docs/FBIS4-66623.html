			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mouloud Benmohamed: "The Hunt for the Escapees" </F> -- first two paragraphs are EL MOUDJAHID introduction]    [Text] With the arrest of "Echanfara," fugitives are  becoming prisoners.    Like bread rolls when they cost 1 Algerian dinar, the daily  national newspapers are much in demand by residents of Batna,  who want to know more about the prisoner escape at the Tazoult  prison.    For the time being, they make do with the little information  that has been published, with the grapevine, and comments made  by young people and the unemployeed who spend their time  watching the military roadblock set up on the road to Khenchela,  about 4 km from the main gate at the Lambese prison.    They are credulous and hope they will witness the arrest of  escapees. Any one of the latter who would venture to return to  the scene of the crime, the most spectacular that Batna has had  to experience in ages, would be very naive.    Often their eyes as well as those of the majority of  citizens  are glued to the skies watching the National People's Army's  MI-8 helicopters searching for the escaped prisoners. For some,  the bird has flown the coop while for others it is certain that  the escaped prisoners--particularly the last ones who got out of  Lambese who fled across the fields on foot--are still hiding in  town. Neither is entirely wrong. Why?    First, because it has been confirmed by the escaped and  ultimately arrested prisoners that trucks and light vehicles  awaited the most important among the escapees (those sentenced  to death by the special courts) so as to provide them with quick  transportation. The other prisoners (common criminals and  special courts) skedaddled with the help of their legs. The  revelations of those arrested, which we will publish in our next  issue, do show that according to "rank," i.e., the sentence,  each escapee was accorded special treatment by the attackers.    Next, because the search operations carried out by the  combined police forces on the outskirts of Batna made it  possible to state that the attackers and the escapees--at least  some of them--are not far, but they are reported to have  dispersed: on Monday, at their 500 residential unit building in  downtown Batna, security forces received information on the  presence of one--"very dangerous"--of the escapees; the  following day (that is, yesterday), the famous "Echanfara,"  sentenced to 77 years in prison in connection with several  cases, returned to his cell.    We should add that there exists a second "Echanfara" who was  sentenced to death and is--still--incarcerated in...Berrouaghia.  On the subject of cells, let us point out that those in bloc 12  in the Lambese prison were completely torn up (bedding, etc.) by  both prisoners and those who escaped. Everywhere there are signs  of bullets. On the walls, on the ground, on the gates, the  attackers were sufficiently armed, especially with munitions.  The majority were young men--aged 20 to 22--supervised by even  better armed "individuals." One of them had an RPJ. We will come  back to this.    Whether it be at the staff management or the prison guard  level, everyone is deeply affected by this "catastrophe" that  has befallen the Lambese prison, which had the reputation of  being a citadel. Everyone says that accomplices inside the  prison had a fatal influence. Some guards were not expecting  such "treason" on the part of colleagues whom they had rubbed  shoulders with for years, whereas others believe that "hardship  is good for something," inasmuch as today all the authorities  are being careful.    The commission of inquiry that has been set up spent  yesterday at the site of the breakout, where it listened to  evidence and statements by prison staff.    We shall return to this.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE  </P> <P> It's obvious that you have never seen a Democrat you didn't like. Your latest  atrocity concerns the Tower nomination "Tower's Alamo" (March 10) where you  paper over the complete and total destruction of a man and his reputation. John  Tower was not rejected as secretary of defense because of his ethics or  temperament, but because Senate Democrats were going to prove to President  George Bush, very early on, who was really in charge.  </P> <P> When Bush extended his hand to the Democrats earlier this year in a spirit of  bipartisanship, the Democrats were all smiles and friendly nods. They were  still smiling and nodding when they used Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the human  butcher knife, to chop Bush's hand off.  </P> <P> The Senate Democrats are not interested in bipartisanship, they are interested  in power. After destroying Tower, they have that power.  </P> <P> Once again, President Bush is calling for bipartisanship, and once again those  Democrats are smiling and nodding.  </P> <P> JERRY WEDDLE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

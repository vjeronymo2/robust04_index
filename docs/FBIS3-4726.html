			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign  minister, asked Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri, in his capacity as the chairman of the ASEAN Standing  Committee, to use last November's Seattle meeting of the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] as a model for an APEC  meeting to be held in Bangkok next year. The Chinese Government  is satisfied with this although Taiwan sent an economic affairs  official to participate.    Qian Qichen and his delegation left Don Muang Airport at  1600  yesterday for Sri Lanka. After seeing Qian off at the airport,  Foreign Minister Prasong briefed reporters on their talks.  [passage omitted]    The Thai foreign minister said that he had asked Qian to  repeat the House Foreign Affairs Committee's invitation for the  Chinese National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee to  send a delegation to Thailand at an appropriate time. The  Chinese delegation postponed its trip to Thailand following  Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. Foreign  Minister Prasong also asked Qian to convey a repeated invitation  by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for Chinese President Jiang  Zemin to visit Thailand at an appropriate time. Foreign  Minister Qian said that he will pass Thailand's goodwill to  relevant authorities.    Prasong also said that he will send an official invitation  to  Qian and his wife Zhou Hanqiong to attend the annual ASEAN  foreign ministerial meeting in Bangkok in July.    Prasong said that although Qian's stopover in Bangkok was  short and there was a problem concerning the Taiwan president's  visit, the two sides had reached a good understanding following  a frank exchange of views. The Chinese did not see the issue as  obstructing good relations between the two countries. This is  only a phenomenon in the long-standing good relations between  the two countries. Thai-Chinese cooperation in the political,  economic, and trade fields will be further developed.</p>

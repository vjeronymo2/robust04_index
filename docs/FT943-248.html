			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Brown champions 'fair rewards': Conservatives branded as the party of economic privilege and greed Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday sought to flesh out Labour's vision of a fair market economy by depicting the party as defender of the 'decent majority' against Conservative privilege and greed. Mr Brown's comments, which will set the tone for the economic debate at Labour's conference in Blackpool on Monday, coincided with two opinion polls confirming Labour's strong lead since Mr Tony Blair's election as leader in July. Officials said the contrast between Labour's commitment to fair rewards and the Tories' sponsorship of the 'undeserving rich' would be a key part of Mr Blair's first conference speech as leader, on Tuesday. However, Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, accused Labour's leaders of using 'jargon and gobbledegook' to cover up the party's continuing attachment to taxation and spending. Launching a pamphlet called Rhetoric and Reality, Mr Hanley said the Labour leader was 'a dedicated follower of fashion' who had 'failed to stand up for his convictions' when Labour was controlled by the left in the early 1980s. Mr Brown told the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in Newcastle that Labour would end the accumulation of unjustified privilege that had happened under 15 years of Conservative government. He said that deserving businessmen who generated ideas, jobs and wealth should be properly rewarded as long as they paid their fair share of taxes. 'But there is an undeserving rich, the enemies of opportunity, the something-for-nothing elite, who have let the country down,' he said. Mr Brown accused the government of allowing a proliferation of patronage through quangos, together with insider dealing and the misuse of executive share options which allowed millionaires to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. A MORI poll in today's Times puts Labour 29 points ahead of the Conservatives on 54 per cent of the vote, down from 56 per cent in late August. The Tories are on 25 per cent (23) and the Liberal Democrats on 17 per cent (18). A MORI poll for the Economist puts Labour on 52 per cent (47 per cent in April) with the Conservatives on 25 per cent (26) and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent (23).</p>

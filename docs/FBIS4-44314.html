			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France called for political  dialogue in Algeria and elections as soon as possible, as  Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi held a second day of talks  with French officials on Thursday [23 June].    Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France considered a  political dialogue with "all those who agree to put their knives  and Kalashnikovs on one side" was "indispensable".    Speaking after a meeting with Sifi, Juppe said France hoped  the dialogue would culminate in legislative elections "at the  earliest possible date." [passage omitted]    On Thursday, Juppe said political stabilisation in Algeria  would depend on the success of its economic recovery programme,  notably in improving housing and cutting unemployment. [passage  omitted]    Sifi also met with National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin  on Thursday.</p>

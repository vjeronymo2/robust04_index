			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP)--Three Russians and a  Ukrainian have been given prison sentences ranging from five to  16 years for armed robbery by a court in the northeastern  Chinese city of Harbin, the Heilonjiang Legal daily said  Thursday [21 April]. The four were accused of stealing 40,200  yuan (4,620 dollars) from two Chinese on February 24 in a Harbin  hotel after threatening them with a knife.    They were arrested several days later in the neighbouring  province of Liaoning. One of the Russians managed to escape but  was recaptured a short time later in the eastern city of  Nanjing. The escapee was given 16 years in jail March 22, while  his accomplices received terms ranging from five to 10 years, it  said. The sentences were particularly heavy given the  relatively small amount of money involved and the fact that  neither victim was injured, observers said.</p>

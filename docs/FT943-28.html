			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (42): Brighter future ahead - Benelux countries The faster-than-expected recovery in Germany is having a locomotive effect on the economies of Belgium, the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Pulled along by their powerful neighbour, the Benelux countries are looking at a brighter future based on low inflation and solid growth. The recovery - coupled with relative currency stability since the upheavals of 1992/93 - has rekindled hopes of a European monetary union taking shape before the end of the century. No one should underestimate the technical and political difficulties which lie ahead; but the Benelux countries, traditionally the most integrationist-minded in Europe, can reasonably expect to be in the vanguard of a hard core of committed countries intent on creating a single currency and able to do so. The blackest cloud on the horizon is unemployment. Without annual growth reaching between 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, there is little prospect of creating the new jobs to reduce the length of the dole queues. Without new jobs, especially for young people, the prospect looms of expensive subsidised work programmes, lost employment revenues, pressure on public deficits, perhaps even social unrest. Starting with the European Commission's White Paper on jobs, competitiveness and growth, a series of official studies have argued that a cyclical recovery alone will not be enough to reduce unemployment in Europe. As the latest report by the Paris-based Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development makes clear, this economics lesson applies just as much to the traditionally virtuous Benelux countries as it does to their laxer EU partners. The OECD remedy is an assault on 'structural unemployment'. In effect, this means dismantling rigidities in the labour market, as well as reductions in the minimum wage and welfare benefits to prod people into looking for work. What makes these measures so painful in the Benelux countries is that they challenge the post-second world war model of the social market economy and welfare state which lies at the core of their political identity. By the Netherlands' own narrow definition of unemployment, only about 7 per cent of the labour force is out of work. But the more telling figures are contained in the OECD's broader definition which takes in all people of working age receiving disability and other types of social security benefits, as well as people enrolled in special job creation programmes. By this measure, unemployment in the Netherlands stands at 25 per cent. How does the new Dutch coalition government headed by Prime Minister Wim Kok intend to grapple with this challenge? The first move will be to reduce taxes and social premiums to encourage employers to hire job-seekers. Second, the government will examine whether some sectors in the economy may warrant exemption from the minimum wage laws so as to generate more entry-level jobs. Third, the state is likely to create an estimated 40,000 jobs in areas such as home help for the elderly, child care, public safety and security. The one area which seems certain to remain taboo is unemployment benefit. No one is talking about reducing unemployment benefit to put pressure on people out of work to leave the dole. Perhaps that is inevitable given Mr Kok's Labour party background. But the coalition government knows that even if economic growth creates, say, 230,000 jobs over the next four years, it will not be enough to compensate for the 300,000 expected to enter the workforce over the same period. In Belgium, similar worries about unemployment cloud the economic debate. This year, the number out of work is likely to be just over 10 per cent. With growth likely to be marginally under the Netherlands' projection of around 2.5 per cent, there is little prospect of reducing unemployment. The coalition government led by Jean-Luc Dehaene is setting great store by the 'global pact' concluded with employers last year which amounts to the most ambitious attempt to curb social spending since the second world war. As part of the package, new energy taxes should be recycled into the tradeable goods sector to reduce employers' payroll taxes. According to Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian national bank, this could create 50,000 new jobs On the brighter side, the Belgium and Luxembourg economic union is likely to show a handsome surplus in the current account this year of BFr400 bn, or 5 per cent of GDP. This figure is double the average surpluses of the second half of the 1980s. Most important, the mix has changed, with about half of the surplus ending up on the trade account. What is striking is that three-fifths of this surplus comes from Belgium, whereas the banking centre of Luxembourg traditionally accounted for around three-quarters. So why are Belgian exports rising so fast when Belgian wages are marginally higher than in neighbouring markets and Belgium is paying a competitive price for its hard franc policy?. The suspicion, says Phillipe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, is that the adjustment is taking place through higher unemployment. The Netherlands and Belgium face stiff challenges to restore public finances after the recession. But both realise that this is the precondition for EMU which sets targets of 3 per cent of GDP for the annual budget deficit and 60 per cent of GDP for accumulated government debt. After several years of steady, albeit small falls, the annual budget deficit in the Netherlands in 1995 and 1996 is expected to be static at 3.3 per cent of GDP. It is then expected to fall to 3.1 per cent in 1997 and 2.9 per cent in 1998. In Belgium, the government is forecasting that the annual budget deficit is likely to be an uncomfortably high 5.3 per cent in 1994; but thereafter officials are confident that it will drop sharply to 4.3 per cent in 1995 and 3 per cent in 1996 (which just happens to be the year when the Maastrict review of early candidates for EMU will take place). In the short-term, the Benelux countries must hold their nerve. Having survived a traumatic recession, the governments need to continue the painful reforms in labour markets and to contain budget deficits. EMU is both the incentive and the prize.</p>

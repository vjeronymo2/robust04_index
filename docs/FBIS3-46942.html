Senior officials and reporters  of Russian newspapers and broadcasting stations were invited to  the meeting.    Ambassador Son Song-pil spoke at the meeting. He said that  during the New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song summed up the brilliant achievements which the Korean  people brought about in economic construction last year under  the party's wise leadership and presented tasks for our party  and people for the new year.    He pointed out that during the New Year address, the  respected and beloved leader had given a programmatic teaching  on the fatherland's reunification and declared that our nuclear  issue which the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are  babbling about must be resolved only through DPRK-U.S. talks  because it was raised when the United States brought nuclear  weapons into South Korea.    He also stressed that the respected and beloved leader had  said that pressure or threats will not resolve the nuclear  issue, that pressure, threats, or so-called sanctions will not  work on us, and that the United States must clearly see the  reality and act with discretion.    The participants in the meeting congratulated the Korean  people for their great achievements in socialist construction  last year and wholeheartedly supported the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song's plan for the fatherland's reunification.</p>

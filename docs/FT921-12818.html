			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Boldly go but get the right guide - Emerging markets look tempting, and a trust can cut the risk A STRIKING feature of the 1991 investment trust league tables was the strong performance of funds based in emerging markets. The best trust of the year was Latin American, and emerging markets funds from Templeton and Beta Global were in fourth and sixth place respectively. The argument in favour of investing in emerging markets is simply put. Economic growth rates in such countries are higher, and this should translate into higher corporate earnings growth rates. In addition, the underdevelopment of stock markets in such countries can offer greater opportunity for picking 'bargain' stocks - since fewer analysts are looking at the markets. The risks involved are likely to be substantial, however. Many emerging markets owe their prosperity to a limited number of commodities or industries - and thus can be vulnerable to a sudden downturn in demand in that sector. In addition, the number of companies available for investment is limited, as is the liquidity in those companies' shares. Investment trust managers have two counter-arguments. The first is that their closed-end structure gives them protection from a sudden downturn. If share prices fall suddenly, an open-ended fund, such as a unit trust, would face redemptions from investors trying to cut their losses. To meet these redemptions, the managers would have to sell shares; in illiquid emerging markets, that would mean accepting rock-bottom prices. An investment trust can simply sit tight through a downturn; if shareholders want to realise their investments, they must find another buyer. The result is that unit trusts shrink in bear markets; investment trust shares simply sink to a discount. This should make it easier for investment trust managers to outperform over the long term; although shareholders who buy when trusts are at a premium and then sell when the discount is widest will not see the benefit. The second argument is that, while individual emerging markets may be risky, trusts can reduce the dangers by investing across a range of countries. Mark Mobius, the manager of Templeton Emerging Markets, says the trust is already invested in 18 countries and is interested in backing many more over the long term. A global recession could affect a large number of emerging countries at the same time - as was illustrated in the early 1980s by the international debt crisis. But Mr Mobius reckons that his trust can still pick individual stocks which will prosper. That said, the success of many of these funds may depend on the asset allocation skills of the managers - those that picked Latin America last year did very well; those with a large exposure to, say, Thailand, will not have prospered so much. Picking the right manager could therefore be even more important than in most sectors.</p>

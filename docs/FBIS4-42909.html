			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["vwd"-attributed report: "Escape Routes to Europe Should </F> Be Blocked"]    [Excerpt] During the forthcoming European Parliament  consultations, Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to attain  political agreement on the gradual attainment of a joint  European tax rate on interest rates during Germany's duty  presidency of the European Union [EU]. Only with a coordinated  tax rate can the outflow of German capital to other countries be  prevented, a phenomenon that has been observed ever since the  introduction of tax on interest rates in Germany.    In an interview with this writer, Waigel said the subject  will not be finally settled while Germany holds the presidency,  "but we will probably reach political decisions that can be  implemented. One cannot place excess demands on others.  Negotiations on this matter can be continued under France's EU  presidency."    Waigel spoke out in favor of pursuing the principle of  subsidiarity. He said there is a compulsory tax on interest  rates in every EU country, but each country applies a different  tax system. "Things should remain that way," said Waigel. "All  we are concerned with is preventing a citizen of one country  from evading this tax by going to another country. Such an  evasion would not lie in any country's interests." The finance  minister spoke out in favor of including as many OECD countries  as possible in a suitable agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

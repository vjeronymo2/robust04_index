It is well-known that  a divorce is inevitable; the question is what side will get most  of the inheritance -- the property and constituency of the SDS.    At the present stage of the divorce proceedings it appears  that Filip Dimitrov and other leaders affiliated with him have  the upper hand. They will probably succeed in establishing the  blue [SDS] party, which many people have wanted for a long time.  It is precisely this side to the divorce that is pressing for  an extraordinary national conference, because they know that the  delegates from the local branches will demand new elections,  hoping to become parliament members.    Naturally, this variant does not excite the Democratic and  Radical-Democratic Parties. The result will probably be an even  greater emancipation of the SDS parliamentary faction vis-a-vis  the SDS National Coordinating Council, which claims to lead it.  This is the reason that the Radical-Democratic Party launched  the idea of holding a "national meeting," rather than a  conference. Such a meeting will be attended by elected  officials (mostly National Assembly members and mayors, in other  words, people who are not in a hurry to part with their  mandates).    Against this background it appears that the talks proposed  by  the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] would be impossible  or at least, certainly futile. On the other hand, one could not  exclude the possibility of "separate" agreements between the DPS  and certain more moderate SDS leaders and parties.</p>

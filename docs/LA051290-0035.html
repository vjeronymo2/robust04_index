			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VETERANS GROUP RECEIVES $250,000 COUNSELING GRANT  </P> <P> Vietnam Veterans of San Diego has received the first in what it hopes will be  an annual $250,000 family counseling grant, the group announced this week. The  grant comes out of a trust fund established by chemical companies that  manufactured herbicides used during the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Vietnam Veterans of San Diego will use its grant to provide counseling  services, with a special focus on children born with physical disabilities and  developmental disorders, said Robert Van Keuren, the group's executive  director.  </P> <P> "Our primary mission is to provide direct counseling to veterans and case  management for the children of veterans," said Dr. Marc Gotbaum, director of  the new Vietnam Veterans Family Assistance Program. The project will help  families through the maze of governmental programs offering help for their  children, Gotbaum said.  </P> <P> "We are initiating a program designed to identify disabled children of Vietnam  veterans and potentially heal the entire family," said Dr. Jon Nachison,  clinical supervisor for the program.  </P> <P> The $240-million nationwide trust fund was created in 1984 as an out-of-court  settlement of a class-action suit filed by Vietnam veterans who claimed that  exposure to the plant defoliant known as Agent Orange resulted in medical  problems for them and genetic defects in their children.  </P> <P> In addition to cash awards to individual veterans, more than $7 million in  grant money has been awarded to assistance programs for veterans and their  children, according to Dennis K. Rhoades, executive director of the private  Agent Orange Class Assistance Program, which administers the fund.  </P> <P> Vietnam Veterans of San Diego was founded in 1981.  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Saudi economy records 6.6% growth SAUDI ARABIA'S economy grew by 6.6 per cent last year, Sheikh Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail, the finance minister, has disclosed to a local newspaper. Sheikh Mohammed did not specify if the figures, the first official estimates for growth in 1991, represented real or nominal growth, nor did he quote a figure for gross domestic product. But economists in the kingdom said the minister's figure is in line with their own estimates of real GDP growth for the year. The estimates for 1991 output show a sharp fall from the economy's 18 per cent real GDP growth in 1990. However, during 1990 the economy benefited from higher oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and from the boost to the private sector from supplying US forces during Desert Shield. Sheikh Mohammed said in Okaz newspaper that the kingdom's industrial sector had grown by 9.1 per cent in 1991, against a 8.9 per cent growth the previous year. Much of the growth is attributable to a rise in the kingdom's petrochemicals output. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is pumping at least 8.45m barrels of crude a day. The kingdom recently denied reports that it was raising production to 8.8m b/d for November. More detailed figures on the Saudi economy's 1991 performance are expected later next month in preparation for the kingdom's 1993 budget, expected around New Year. Mr Henry Azzam, chief economist at National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest, said he expected the government then to announce an expansionary budget and a continued public sector deficit. The kingdom forecast a Dollars 8bn deficit in its 1992 budget, which economists say is being easily covered by domestic financing. Mr Azzam said he expects the economy to show real growth of around 6 per cent for 1992 given the relative stability of oil prices.</p>

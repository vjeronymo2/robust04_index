			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 11 March, the government decided to discontinue  Japan's voluntary restrictions on auto exports to the United  States, which will expire in the end of this month. Japanese  automakers are expected to announce their programs to expand  their purchases of foreign-made automobile and auto parts later  this month. Following these announcements, the abolishment of  restrictions on auto exports will be formally declared. The  control of auto exports, which has been being criticized as a  symbol of managed trade between Japan and the United States  since its implementation in 1981, is about to end.    The decision to abolish voluntary restrictions was reached  mainly for the following reasons: 1) Japan's auto exports to  the United States are unlikely to grow drastically because  Japanese automakers already have a considerable amount of  production in the United States; and 2) according to the  agreement at the GATT Uruguay Round last year, the voluntary  restriction of exports is not a clear violation of GATT rules,  but as it is considered a questionable practice, it should be  discontinued. Both the U.S. Government and the Big Three  automakers have informally conveyed to the Japanese Government  their position not to "welcome further renewals of voluntary  export restrictions," noting that Japan's controls on auto  exports have already lost their significance.    The restrictions on auto exports to the United States have  been voluntarily determined by Japan at the end of every fiscal  year. The policy began in fiscal year 1981, when a rapid  increase in the Japanese share of the U.S. auto market became  the focal point of trade disputes between the two nations. The  annual export quota was set at 1.68 million units in the  beginning, but was expanded to 2.3 million in 1985. After this,  however, Japanese automakers began to expand their production in  the United States to cope with the drastic appreciation of the  yen. Since 1987, Japan's auto exports to the United States have  not reached the annual export ceilings. The government lowered  the quota to 1.65 million in fiscal 1992, but actual exports  were even lower for that year. The export level for fiscal 1993  is estimated to be about 1.5 million units. In addition, the  Uruguay Round accord is urging abolishment of questionable  export control measures for a four-year period starting in 1995.  Under such circumstances, Japan has been clarifying its  intention to discontinue some export control measures following  the expiration of such measures.</p>

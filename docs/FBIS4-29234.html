			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["'Civilian Defense Training' in S. Korea" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The puppets staged a  large-scale "civilian defense training" all over South Korea  Wednesday by mobilising a great number of people, according to  radio reports from Seoul.    They kicked up a dust with training of taking shelter and  training under simulated conditions of "chemical, biological and  radioactive attack" under an imaginary "emergency state."    The South Korean bellicose elements blared that it was a  training of taking shelter in the wartime "to be prepared  against the situation caused by the 'nuclear issue' of the  North."    Earlier, the puppets announced that a massive military  exercise will be staged involving various means of war, with 6.5  million men of the "civilian defense" forces and even U.S.  troops present in South Korea participating in the training in  the future.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  frequently staging war drills with increasing intensity, driving  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of  strain. This indicates that their war hysterics to stifle the  North has reached a very reckless stage.</p>

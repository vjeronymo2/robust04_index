			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Bach cantatas - Concert It is a matter of constant concern that not enough people, not even dedicated music-lovers, know about the riches of Bach's cantatas. More than two hundred cantatas, in the accepted numeration] (which is neither chronological nor ordered in any other way, except that the 'secular' cantatas are catalogued last.) Though a few of them are patchworks, fragments or single numbers, or dubiously attributed to Bach, such worries are only the business of musicologists. Stravinsky made the essential point. Asked whether any music ought to count as 'basic' in the Western concert-repertoire, he voted for Bach's cantatas. His grounds, I imagine, went something like this: the cantatas exemplify at once - and magisterially - the possibilities of Western tonal construction, and the range of (spiritual) music-drama it affords, but without any narrow attachment either to Viennese symphonism or to Romantic theatre. Those great subsequent traditions may be viewed as historical and special. For all his Lutheran commitments, it was Bach who spelled out the definitive means in a timeless way. The title of the South Bank series that Sir William Glock has devised for the Orchestra and Chorus of the Age of Enlightenment - 'Bach: The Colourful Dramatist' - underlines the point. Though Bach's period-pious texts may seem quaint now, their sense is completely rendered in his music; by comparison, some of Mozart's best effects sound like extra-musical theatre. On Monday the OAE's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert, the fourth in their series of six, ranged from the almost private soprano-meditation 'Mein Herze schwimmt in Blut' (Cantata no. 199, delivered with bell-like sweetness by Nancy Argenta) to the grand choral fervour of no. 79, 'Gott der Herr ist Sonn' und Schild'. Even in the latter, rapt interjections by soprano (Argenta again) and bass (the hugely promising Gerald Finley) supplied a close-up personal dimension. The young German counter-tenor Andreas Scholl - only a decade ago, he was singing one of the Three Boys in Zauberflote - was both agile and subtle. Martyn Hill's tenor contributed stylishly to no. 73, 'Herr, wie du willt'. Here and there I had unenlightened reactions to the 'authentic' playing-style: did 'period' violins (lively as they were here) so often peck at their music, where unabashedly modern performers sculpt broad lines? What, exactly, is the virtue of renting natural-horn devotees who keep 'splitting' on their notes, when they could deliver the music on valve-horns with cool facility? Still, one mustn't look this period gift-horse in the mouth. It does bear unfamiliar subtleties of balance - and a musical democracy-of-parts that is too often sacrificed now to the fashion for star soloists with faceless accompaniment. The conductor of this concert was Rene Jacobs; the last two, on June 17 and 23, will be conducted by Barthold Kuijken.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wardle decline to Pounds 3m lops 27p off share price Adverse currency movements and lower interest rates knocked more than Pounds 1m from interim profits at Wardle Storeys, the cash-rich plastics and safety equipment company. The shares fell 27p to 435p yesterday as the group announced a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.04m to Pounds 3.1m, for the six months to end-February. Turnover was flat at Pounds 38.2m. Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said he was confident for the outlook in the second half and the following year. Operating profits at the technical products division, which makes specialised plastic sheet and coated fabrics, fell from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 1.09m on turnover just ahead at Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 26.3m). The figures concealed a strong performance by the division, Mr Taylor said. Over the last four years the group had invested some Pounds 14m in new machinery, resulting in significant cost savings in both manpower and raw material usage. But the benefits had been more than offset by a Pounds 535,000 adverse movement in the lira against sterling. The division makes about 20 per cent of its sales in Italy, where main customers include Fiat and Zanussi. Operating profits at the safety and survival equipment division fell from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.26m on turnover of Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m). Mr Taylor described the market for inflatable life rafts and other marine safety equipment as tough. The Pounds 345,000 profits downturn to Pounds 548,000 in the parachute business had been expected, but significant orders, including one from the French defence ministry, had been won. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 757,000. The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 26m (Pounds 23m). Earnings per share were down from 10.9p to 8.3p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 5p. The group is expecting an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.5m in the second half from the sale of land.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / How to learn from the debt delusion: Martin Wolf argues that government attempts to avoid a depression must not lead to another damaging bout of inflation The public psychology of going into debt for gain passes through several . . . phases: (a) the lure of big prospective dividends or gains in income in the remote future; (b) the hope of selling at a profit, and realising a capital gain in the immediate future; (c) the vogue of restless promotions . . . ; (d) the development of downright fraud. Ending with the BCCI, Maxwell and Polly Peck frauds, the boom of the 1980s has lovingly retraced the course mapped out by the celebrated American economist, Irving Fisher, in an article occasioned by the great depression. 1 If the indebtedness of the 1980s had such similarities with that of the 1920s, must the 1990s be like the 1930s? Are the sluggishness of the American economy and last month's cut in the Discount Rate, to just 3.5 per cent, a harbinger of a new great depression? Is the tight-money European block centred on Germany an echo of the gold-block of the 1930s? Would the collapse of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations inflict the same damage as the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930? The answer should be no. In the path from debt-deflation (a downturn in spending caused by the servicing of high levels of debt) to depression one essential step - a general price collapse - should now be absent. Price deflation can occur - indeed, is occurring - in some markets, such as those for property. But declines in one market, however important, should not precipitate a general depression, providing governments do not permit any consequent collapse of the financial system, as happened in the 1930s. The immediate danger is not a general depression. It is, if anything, its opposite: that attempts to avoid a depression, shown already in the accelerating growth of narrow money in the US and Japan, will rekindle inflation. The facts of rising overall indebtedness in the 1980s, notably in the US, are clear. As is shown in the chart, the ratio of debt to gross national product in the US rose between 1980 and 1990 at a rate not seen since the early 1930s, to reach levels also not seen since that unhappy time. In the US indebtedness increased within all the main sectors of the economy: government, corporate and household. In the UK, by contrast, it was the household sector whose indebtedness increased most sharply (as is also shown in the chart). Similar increases in household indebtedness have occurred in Japan, but not in those of other members of the group of seven industrial countries, according to the the OECD Economic Outlook published last month. The public sectors of both Japan and the UK enjoy strong financial positions. In addition, in neither case is the corporate sector as a whole in serious difficulty. Yet where debt is accumulated may matter less than its overall level. The fundamental feature of these three economies has been excess growth of credit in relation to GNP. Between 1982 and 1988, for example, real non-financial debt (nominal debt, adjusted by the consumer price index) grew by 57.3 per cent in real terms in the US, while GNP grew by 26.9 per cent; for Japan real domestic credit rose by 55.9 per cent, while GNP rose by 28.3 per cent; for the UK, real bank and building society lending rose by 117.4 per cent, while GNP rose by no more than 24.1 per cent. Why should such huge increases in indebtedness matter? After all, every debtor has a corresponding creditor. The reason is that both creditors and debtors will feel poorer than they expected if their borrowing and lending turns out to be based on unrealistically optimistic assumptions. Suppose that, at a time of optimism like the late-1980s, someone borrowed Pounds 100,000 at a nominal rate of interest of 10 per cent in the conviction that the asset he intended to purchase would increase in value by 20 per cent. If the calculation were correct, the asset could be sold (or refinanced) a year hence for Pounds 120,000, so paying the interest of Pounds 10,000 and clearing a profit of the same amount. If no gain were to occur, however, the asset could be sold for only Pounds 100,000. The debtor must pay the interest from elsewhere and would then be forced at best to retrenchment and at worst into bankruptcy. Meanwhile if creditors' belief in the solvency of their debtors were to be ill-founded, their wealth would be less secure than supposed. They would feel obliged to reduce their spending. That the net asset position of the household sectors of the US, UK and Japan did not deteriorate in the 1980s provides little comfort, the mistake being that of false aggregation. If many debtors are in serious trouble and much debt is insecure as a result, the apparently comfortable position of many others is irrelevant. A net contraction in spending will ensue. Fisher himself detailed nine stages on the path to depression: debt liquidation, leading to distress selling; contraction of deposit currency; a fall in the level of prices; a still greater fall in the net worth of business; a like fall in profits; a reduction in output, in trade, and in employment of labour; pessimism and loss of confidence; hoarding and slowing down still more of the velocity of circulation; a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity, rates of interest. An essential element in Fisher's story is the fall in prices. 'It is always economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression,' he said, 'simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which outstanding debts were contracted . . . and then maintaining that level unchanged'. Since all modern economies possess central banks determined to secure positive commodity inflation, a general depression would seem to be ruled out. Is this view correct? That depends on why the general fall in prices matters. Falling prices in the 1930s reflected the banking collapses in the US and the resulting decline in the money supply, which shrank by a third. 2 But the falling price level also had a causal role, because it raised the real rate of interest. The real rate of interest (the nominal rate adjusted for price inflation) plays a fundamental role in both the build-up and subsequent liquidation of debt, as has been stressed by Tim Congdon, now at Gerrard and National. 3 In 1931, for example, the average treasury bill rate in the UK was 3.6 per cent; in the US the corresponding rate was 1.4 per cent. These may appear to be comfortably low rates of interest. But, adjusted for the falling overall price level, real rates of interest were over 10 per cent in both countries. In these circumstances, debtors found themselves getting deeper into debt however hard they tried to pay off their debts. The nominal rate of interest on money can never be below zero (since there is always the alternative of cash). Thus, a falling price level guarantees positive real rates of interest, and the more rapidly the price level falls, the higher will be the real rate of interest. The effect on the real rate of interest is the reason why Fisher was right to stress the causal role of falling prices in the debt-deflation of the 1930s. But this suggests that problems can arise, even though nominal prices are not falling, if real rates of interest are high (as was true throughout the 1980s and early 1990s). High nominal rates of interest tend to lower the amount of debt in an economy, because of the high carrying costs they impose. But, for debtors, the combination of high nominal interest rates with high real rates of interest may be worst of all, as borrowers discovered in many Latin American countries in the 1980s. The real rate of interest then is the key. Here the current picture is good only in part. Defined in relation to changes in the general price level, real rates of interest no longer look high in the US, where they have been reduced to little more than 1 per cent. In Europe, by contrast, short-term real rates of interest - not far from 7 per cent in France, Italy and the UK  -look cripplingly high for this stage of the cycle. Japanese real rates fall between those of the US and Europe, but have been moving towards the American end of the spectrum. Unfortunately, even this picture may flatter to deceive. Recent increases in indebtedness have largely been the counterpart of borrowing to purchase assets whose prices were expected to rise at least as fast as the rate of interest. For much of the 1980s, real rates of interest for the purchase of many assets were negative, even though real rates of interest defined in relation to consumer prices were positive (see chart). No wonder borrowing seemed a good idea. But with falling nominal asset prices, the relevant real rates of interest have become exceptionally high. Those who borrowed to acquire property, for example, are running to stand still. The conclusion seems to be that governments might be forced to stabilise not prices in general, but asset prices in particular. The conclusion is unwarranted, partly because there is a limit to how far asset prices can fall if commodity prices are stabilised. But the main reason is that the debt purge, however painful, is needed. The question, after all, is why such a huge run-up in private debt occurred during a decade when real rates of interest appeared to be highly positive. The short answer is that opportunities appeared exceptional, for three reasons: the buoyancy of economic activity; the low initial level of asset prices, a result of the stagflation of the 1970s; the tendency to assume that low nominal rate of interest were an opportunity to borrow assets whose prices would then rise faster than prices in general. The legacy of the 1980s is a delicate balancing act for governments in the 1990s. They must prevent the debt-deflation from inflicting irreparable damage on the financial system, so causing a true depression. For that purpose they will need to provide liquidity. They may even find themselves assuming parts of the private indebtedness, so turning the immediate problem of private debt into an aggravation of the long-term difficulties over public debt (as is already happening in the case of the savings and loans institutions in the US). At the same time, they must avoid validating the most perverse legacy of the 1960s and 1970s, the assumption that one can never be too indebted. For just as the general assumption that prices would tend to be stable underpinned the stable growth of the 1950s and 1960s; so the assumption that inflation is always around the corner has increased economic instability in the 1970s and 1980s. The real rates of interest of the 1980s were too high for comfort and have now to be lowered by changes in monetary and, still more, fiscal policies. But the lesson they are belatedly teaching must not be wasted. A stable market economy is incompatible with the belief that one can never borrow too much. That lesson is being relearned. Perhaps it will endure another 60 years. 1 Irving Fisher, 'The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions,' Econometrica, 1933, 337-57. 2 Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963). 3 Tim Congdon, The Debt Threat: the Dangers of High Real Interest Rates for the World Economy (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988).</p>

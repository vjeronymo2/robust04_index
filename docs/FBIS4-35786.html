			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arab League today condemned Israel's hostile  military operations against Israel, which claimed the lives of  scores of innocent civilians. Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the  Arab League's assistant secretary general for political affairs,  has told our radio correspondent that Israel seeks from these  hostile operations to obstruct the peace process on all tracks,  particularly the Lebanese track. He added that Israel believes  that striking at the Lebanese national resistance is a step in  that direction. He stressed that national resistance is a  legitimate right for the Lebanese that will not stop before  Israel withdraws from every inch of the Lebanese occupied  territories.    Ambassador 'Imran noted that the more Israeli aggressions  against the Lebanese people there are, the more determined they  will be to continue the struggle to expel Israel from south  Lebanon, in implementation of UN Resolution 425, which the  Security Council and the major states have thus far failed to  implement.</p>

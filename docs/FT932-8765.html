			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Hungary set for austerity before election HUNGARY'S beleaguered and unpopular conservative government has defied conventional political logic by unveiling an austerity budget plan just a year before elections. Mr Ivan Szabo, the finance minister, yesterday steeled the public and his own fractious MPs for painful tax increases and spending cuts to restrain a surging budget deficit. 'We have reached a point where we face a huge rock and we have to decide whether we climb it or not,' the minister said. Mr Szabo's parliamentary preview of a supplementary budget prepared the way for deep cuts in real public sector pay and an increase in value-added tax. The finance minister said tough measures were necessary to bring the public sector deficit, which climbed to 7.3 per cent in 1992, down to 6.8 per cent of GDP this year and 5.6 per cent in 1994. Only by reducing the shortfall can Hungary realise a draft 18-month credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund which would return the country to financial respectability. In proposals submitted to the IMF, the government has outlined an increase in the lower rate of VAT from 6 to 10 per cent and the abolition of zero-rating, to raise an extra Ft40bn (Pounds 296m), or 1 per cent of GDP, for next year's budget. The increase will hit Hungary's poor the hardest and is bound to enrage a public whose anger at this January's VAT increase - which led dozens of people to mount hunger strikes - is only now dying down. The government also envisages a narrowing of tax exemptions, a clawback of income-tax exemptions on higher earners, and the imposition of additional fees for a wide range of public services. To restrain expenditure the authorities have put forward deep real cuts in public sector pay, subsidies and transfers to local authorities.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                       Amid foreign media reports of IAEA inspectors departing North  Korea after encountering difficulties, Pyongyang on 15 March used  the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement to demand that Washington proceed with the 21 March  DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva as scheduled.  Reinforcing  earlier warnings against the imposition of preconditions for the  talks, the spokesman threatened that North Korea would call off  the meeting and refuse future nuclear inspections.  Pyongyang  radio at the same time issued an oblique threat to proceed with a  nuclear arms development program.                                   END SUMMARY      Seeking to place Washington on the defensive, the Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement, carried by Pyongyang radio on 15  March, declared that North Korea has "completely fulfilled" its  obligations under the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement and called  on the United States to do its part without setting "unreasonable  preconditions."  Repeating the familiar refrain on the 25  February accord, the spokesman said that the accord set forth  "simultaneous" action by both sides, namely 1)"resumption" of  inter-Korean contacts for exchanging special envoys and 2)IAEA  inspections for ensuring continuity of safeguards on Pyongyang's  part, in return for 1)suspension of Team Spirit and 2)resumption  of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March.  Now that  "several rounds" of inter-Korean talks have been held and IAEA  inspections "enough for continuity of safeguards" have been  completed, he warned, any U.S. failure to fulfill its obligations  will "automatically" render the 25 February accord "invalid."  If  Washington persists in its "unreasonable" insistence that nuclear  inspections must be proven "satisfactory" to the IAEA and that  special envoys must be exchanged by the North and the South  before Team Spirit can be cancelled or the bilateral talks can  take place, the spokesman warned, Pyongyang will consider DPRK-  U.S. negotiations to have ended in a "rupture" and will take  unspecified "unilateral" and "appropriate" action.      Ominous Threat     Clearly seeking to add weight to its threats,  Pyongyang seems to be preparing a public fallback position in  case of failure of its nuclear talks with Washington by hinting  at a readiness to proceed with a nuclear weapons program.  In the  latest variant of this threat, Pyongyang radio on 15 March  reiterated North Korea's profession of concern for alleged  Japanese plans to develop a nuclear capability.  After  criticizing Japanese Foreign Minister Hata's alleged statement on  "countermeasures" in case of North Korean intransigence on the  nuclear issue, the radio declared that Pyongyang "may face a  situation of having no choice but to reconsider [its] position  regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."      IAEA Inspections     The 15 March statement comes amid reporting  of the departure of a group of IAEA inspectors from Pyongyang  (KCNA, 15 March) and speculation that the IAEA may hold a special  Board of Governors meetings to address difficulties encountered  by the inspectors (Yonhap, 15 March).  Giving credence to foreign  media accounts of disputes between Pyongyang and IAEA inspectors,  Seoul's KBS-1 radio carried a report of a North Korean Embassy  official in Beijing saying that Pyongyang had rejected a request  by IAEA inspectors to extract samples from "one facility,"  regarding it as an "unjust demand" (15 March).  The councillor,  Choe Han-chun, was depicted as playing down the significance of  the dispute, claiming that it was "not a serious problem" and can  be resolved through future dialogue between North Korean and the  IAEA.      Implications     Pyongyang is clearly moving to forestall any  IAEA move to convene a special meeting of the Board of Governors-  -a predecessor to possible referral of the North Korean nuclear  issue to the UN Security Council.  By assuming a tough position  and emphasizing the gravity of the situation, the North Korean  leadership seems to hope that Washington will propose a  compromise solution.  (AUTHOR:  YIM.

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (5): Inroads to new markets - Europe's economic centre of gravity is rapidly moving eastward / Looking East AFTER a decade when the inclusion of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the European Community pulled investment southward, the 1990s will be the decade of rapid growth and fundamental structural changes in the former centrally-planned economies of central Europe and beyond. This eastward shift, and the prospect of decades of rapid economic growth similar to that experienced in most of western Europe during the 20-year post-war reconstruction boom, has profound implications for the future location of management offices and factories. Berlin, for example, will once again be the capital of united Germany, although there are signs of a growing reluctance to accelerate the expensive removal from Bonn. This reflects the unexpected cost and difficulty of re-incorporating the five eastern provinces into the mainstream German economy. The problems have arisen mainly because of the artificially high wage and other costs which followed the decision to exchange the East German mark for D-marks at par three years ago, and the drive to equalise wages although east German productivity remains far lower. Under these circumstances the prospects for long-term economic growth in the region are probably highest in Poland, where wages are low and whose population of 39m ensures the largest single market in the post-communist central and south eastern European region. This area encompasses 105m potential consumers, if Slovenia, the Baltic states, and the Balkan states of Romania and Bulgaria are included. Poland will probably have the fastest growing economy in the whole of Europe this year after a 31 per cent decline in industrial production since 1989. The rise in industrial output exceeded 7 per cent over the first half of the year with labour productivity rising 11-13 per cent. Hungary and the Czech republic will also resume economic growth this year after a hiccup caused by two years of drought in Hungary and dislocation stemming from their January divorce which has retarded growth in the Czech republic and Slovakia. Throughout the region, the locations which are showing the fastest economic growth and the greatest attraction for foreign investors, are those which are closest to Germany and other European Community markets. For example, Szceszin, which as the former German city of Stettin, was developed as Berlin's main outlet to the sea, is rapidly developing as a regional centre for the western Baltic. It is attracting investment from Germany and the Scandinavian countries with whom it is linked by fast and frequent roll-on-roll-off ferries. THE Gdansk-Gdynia port complex is another focus of rapidly increasing cross-Baltic trade with good prospects for benefiting from the eventual revival of trade with the Baltic republics and St Petersburg. But the most important factor likely to affect future location decisions is the speed with which Poland's ambitious motorway building plans are implemented. Already, the bulk of German investment in Poland has been concentrated in towns like Poznan and Wroclaw. Both are to be found along the axis of the two new east-west motorways which will make Poland a cross-roads of east-west and north-south traffic in the early years of the 21st century. Longer term, such highways will dramatically improve the economic prospects of towns like Lodz. This depressed textile town, south west of Warsaw, will soon find itself at the junction of the main east-west motorway and the north south route from Gdansk to Czechoslovakia and beyond. Meanwhile the divorce from Slovakia has underlined the westerly location of the Czech republic which juts like a wedge into prosperous Germany and Austria where wages are up to ten times higher than Czech rates. With its low foreign debt and long industrial traditions, within a decade the Czech republic will become as closely linked to the German economy as Austria and Switzerland. Longer term, the core central European economies of the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, together with the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia will also play a key role in extending the market-orientated, consumer-led transformation of the former communist world further east. Initially, the experience of economic transformation in central Europe will help speed the development of Romania and Bulgaria, whose future economic health is also linked to the growth of trade and investment in the Black Sea region. Here, Turkey is carving out an important role for itself. Indeed, Istanbul and Ankara are rapidly becoming key locations for those interested in developing trade and investment in the oil and resource-rich central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. Strategic investors in central Europe such as ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power engineering company, Siemens and AEG, are planning to use their new Hungarian, Czech and Polish acquisitions to supply markets further east which were formerly part of the now disbanded Comecon market. In the case of Yugoslavia, Slovenia will have a particularly important role in helping the reconstruction of the war-torn Croatian and Serbian economies. For western companies, this will increase the attractiveness of Ljubliana, the Slovene capital. Until now, however, Hungary, which began tinkering with market reforms in the 1960s and enjoys close historical links with Austria, has been the main recipient of inward foreign investment. It has attracted over Dollars 5bn of the Dollars 9-Dollars 12bn of foreign equity investment which has flowed into central Europe over the last four years. Most of this foreign investment, including the new car and engine plants put up by General Motors, Audi/Volkswagen and Suzuki of Japan, has been located either in the Budapest area or inside Hungary's so-called 'golden corridor.' This corridor runs westward out of the capital along the main rail and motorway links to the Austrian border, encompassing industrial cities like Gyor and Esztergom. Budapest, which straddles the Danube as it passes the wooded Buda hills, vies with Prague for the title of most beautiful capital in central Europe, and the most expensive. It shares the universal regional problem of poor telecommunications. But the telephones are particularly bad in Prague, despite the fact that the Czech capital is 200kms further west than Budapest or indeed Vienna. This handicap will disappear as the projected heavy investment in telecommunications bears fruit.</p>

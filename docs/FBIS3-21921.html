			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>   [Excerpts] Claiming that there are no privileges nor  distinctions at the Almoloya de Juarez federal maximum security  prison, and that all inmates have the same rights and  obligations, this incarceration center's director, Juan Pablo de  Tavira, emphasized: "It is quite likely that the campaign  against this prison center is being financed by the leading drug  trafficking `capos' held there, such as Miguel Angel Felix  Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, and Rafael Caro Quintero, among  others."    During a press conference held at the Government  Secretariat's headquarters, De Tavira declared that the  facilities of the "Number One Federal High Security Center," as  the Almoloya federal prison is officially called, serve the  purpose for which they were created. [passage omitted].    The Almoloya de Juarez federal prison director commented on  the press campaign conducted during recent weeks, with the  publication of notices and the organization of informational  events. He indicated that members of the Inter-American Human  Rights Committee in Defense of Prison Inmates (CIDH-DIP),  defense attorneys, and relatives of those held in the  aforementioned prison, located in Mexico State, have taken part  in these activities.    He remarked: "It is quite likely that this campaign against  the operation of the Number One Federal High Security Center is  being financed by the leading drug trafficking `capos.' They  include, among others, persons such as Miguel Angel Felix  Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael  Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Gilberto Ontiveros  Lucero. They are living at Almoloya under conditions far  different from those that they had been enjoying at the centers  from which they came, since there are no privileges nor  distinctions here. All inmates have the same rights and  obligations." [passage omitted]    The official noted that the one who has represented the  inmates at the press conferences held at a capital hotel and at  his office is the litigator, Efrain Garcia Ramirez. "He is an  accredited attorney in the case records of the drug traffickers  Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca  Carrillo, and Marcio Alvarez. The latter was also tried for the  murder of the Jalisco prison director."    Furthermore, he stressed that the press conferences have  been  attended by the wives of the inmates Rafael Caro Quintero, Felix  Gallardo, and Rafael Pardo Cardona, the latter "a Colombian  associated with the Medellin Cartel." He added: "These subjects,  with Garcia Ramirez, have been the only ones making statements."  <H5>  CNDH Investigating Complaints </H5>   He reported that the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH],  the only constitutionally established agency, has conducted  several investigations at that prison center, prompted by the  large number of inmate complaints, "basically because of their  transfers." He observed: "It has not made recommendations  regarding any of the complaints. In fact, in two years and three  months of operation with inmates, the prison has not had any  human rights violations proven against it." [passage omitted]    He continued: "The required searches of relatives visiting  inmates prevent the entry of drugs in the Almoloya Number One  Center. Obviously, this situation is annoying, especially to  inmates held here who are highly dangerous and financially  powerful."    He explained that the searches are applied to the  institution's personnel with the same stringency and, as a  result, in two years and three months, there has not been a  single case of drugs being brought into the prison.    He stated in conclusion that high security federal centers  are a necessity in present-day Mexico, and in the battle against  the drug traffic. "The drug trafficking inmates with great  financial power will seek all means to hurt these institutions,  by using associations without representative status, and  lawyers. The presence of their relatives is understandable, but  not justifiable."</p>

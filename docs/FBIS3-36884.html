Yet the start of the year has already been marked  by soaring prices, inflation, and a decline in the tenge  exchange rate. In speaking of imminent economic stabilization,  what are you relying on -- specific calculations and reassuring  figures on the course of economic reform, or your intuition as a  politician?    [Nazarbayev] I am sure that this year will be a turning  point  for Kazakhstan. This is no prediction caused by some flash of  illumination. It is based primarily on the real advances  achieved in the course of economic reforms. Despite many  difficulties and stoppages and even setbacks, the reforms are  proceeding and are producing tangible results. The main thing  is that the structure of our economy is being restricted on the  move. Last year, with an overall decline in industrial  production, three-fourths of all enterprises nonetheless found a  way out of the labyrinth of the crisis and ensured an increase  in physical volumes...in the majority of cases, by developing  new commodities: ferromanganese, arc-welded pipes, welding  rods, dozens of types of equipment, chemical output, structural  and construction materials, television sets, refrigerators,  vacuum cleaners, and audio and video equipment. We have even  begun the production of Kazakhstani automobiles, albeit only in  small batches for the time being.    So, while the production of weapons--in which the Soviet  Union used to trade--or other output for which there is no  market is being wound down, we do not greatly regret it. We  will give our attention and support to those who, working for  Kazakhstan's needs, consistently restructure themselves and  adapt to market conditions.    Of course, all this still does not attest to the existence  of  a mixed economy. But for Kazakhstan, where only yesterday the  public consciousness did not even allow the idea that we could  produce complex electronically based equipment for ourselves and  where even people of the older generation, in contrast, for  instance, to the Baltic countries, had no idea of what private  ownership was, taking such a step forward in less than two years  is undoubtedly an achievement.    As for inflation and a certain decline in the tenge exchange  rate, we did take all that into account beforehand. It would be  naive to say that we can immediately acquire a very hard  currency. After all, the same thing is happening with the ruble  and the currencies of the other CIS countries.    [Dotsuk] You have always said that sovereignty is not an end  in itself, that the main thing is a real improvement in people's  lives. Tell me, Nursultan Abishevich, have you even once  regretted that the Kazakhstan Government did not agree to  Russia's "constraining" terms and decided to leave the ruble  zone?    [Nazarbayev] Any state signing particular interstate  agreements assumes the determination of the obligations to the  other side. Part of its sovereignty is thus delegated to it.  Many conditions, including "constraining" ones, as you call  them, can be accepted if they will bring prosperity and help to  introduce new technology and so forth. If it were Japan, for  instance, why should we not waive some principles for the sake  of the people's welfare. But Russia itself is having a hard  time right now, and it can hardly consider Kazakhstan's  interests in some way. The conditions set by A. Shokhin were  unacceptable to us. He openly asked us to leave the ruble zone,  and we knew that this was an IMF recommendation. In brief, we  have no claims against Russia. Ultimately, every state must  decide its own financial problems freely and independently.    Ultimately, the CIS countries should reach a supranational  currency that will circulate in the CIS. I would very much like  this to take less than 30 years, as it did in West Europe.    [Dotsuk] Nursultan Abishevich, the "Russian theme" has  become more acute in the Republic now....    [Nazarbayev] I will be frank: This subject is artificially  being made acute.    I will immediately note that I do not accept a concept like  the "Russian-speaking population." Who among us is not a  Russian speaker? After all, all Kazakhstan speaks Russian,  including 99 percent of Kazakhs. And if we do accept this term  willy nilly, then we have to include in it representatives of  the more than 100 ethnic groups living in Kazakhstan -- Germans,  Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greek, Koreans, Dungane.... And the  context in which this term has usually been used recently in no  way reflects their national interests.    They say that the Kazakh language is driving out Russian,  primarily in the educational system. But is that the case?  Right now, 270,000 students are studying in Russian in  Kazakhstan, which is 78 percent of the total number. More than  57 percent of the schoolchildren learn only in Russian in  Kazakhstan--and that is all with Kazakh as the official language  in the Republic. You must realize that the relevant  constitutional norm was introduced by no means as a formal sign  of statehood but primarily because the language of the Kazakhs  in their motherland was on the verge of disappearing. The  state's duty and our human duty is to prevent that.    Before speaking of migration, let's make a small digression  into the history of this question. The point is that the  Kazakhs' ancient land has always received for various reasons --  historical, political and social -- representatives of various  peoples, mainly from the European part of Russia. Since the  days of Ivan the Terrible and Petr I "fugitives" appeared in our  land. Later migration began to acquire the nature of Russian  state policy connected with the creation of a convenient  bridgehead for military and economic penetration to the East.  The first mass wave of migrants included peasants from every  corner of Russia -- victims of land repartition, cossacks called  to defend the frontiers of the empire. It was then that the  "Cossack lines" -- the Ural, Siberian, and Gorkiy lines passing  across the Kazakhs' land -- emerged. The second large wave of  Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Polish immigrants was caused  by Stolypin's land reforms and the desire to drag our  territories into this overall repartitioning. At that time  nearly 2 million people moved to Kazakhstan. And finally just  recently masses of volunteers poured into Kazakhstan to develop  the virgin lands and to work at the "construction sites of the  century." That was in fact the third and largest stage in  migration to Kazakhstan. It was then that the demographic  situation which in principle has persisted to this day was  determined.    Naturally, people came to us with different aims and  feelings. Whereas the settlers of the first waves tried above  all to attach themselves to the land and to farm, the latter  came with a purely worldly aim -- earning money and going back  home. Naturally, for the deported peoples the desire to return  home was generally foremost. But irrespective of whom cam here  and how, by no means the least and perhaps even the first part  in determining that Kazakhstan became their home was played by  the Kazakh nation and its traditional qualities like openness,  hospitality, and good-neighborliness. What, ultimately, is the  crime of the Kazakhs, more than one-third of whom died during  the enforced collectivization and who have remained a minority  in their own motherland? Is it worth mentioning that the  majority of those who came to Kazakhstan left they were the  "masters of their lives" here since for them the entire Soviet  Union (read -- Russia) was their home. But with the enormous  country's collapse many stereotypes began to change. And  naturally, many people began to feel they were abroad. There  was a revival of the view that their stay on our land was  temporary and there was a desire to return. But has this  phenomenon--which is entirely natural, given all our  upheavals--become a massive and overwhelming one? I shall cite  figures on this score which are by no means exhaustive. Last  year, more than 200,000 Russians left Kazakhstan. That is  undoubtedly a lot and was a great loss for Kazakhstan. But we  must also mention something else: Migration flows in both  directions have never ceased. Even in the "prosperous" 1980's,  80,000 to 100,000 people left Kazakhstan every year and slightly  more came. Last year, too, nearly 160,000 Russians moved  permanently to the Republic. And they were Russians! And only  about 60,000 of them were from regions that, to put it mildly,  are not distinguished by their stability. We must also consider  that after the creation of Kazakhstan's own armed forces a large  number of servicemen left Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's army is  small and officers together with their units naturally left the  Republic.    But it is wrong to speak of some gigantic flow of refugees  from Kazakhstan unless, of course, you are setting yourself a  particular aim. There are no refugees at all, there is freedom  for each person to choose his place of residence. Those are two  different things. And we receive openly those who come to us.  The amendments which I recently made to the law on citizenship,  taking advantage of my additional powers, were indeed connected  with simplifying the procedure for taking citizenship when  members of the families of Kazakhstanis move to the republic,  and not only for them.    Of course, I do not say that there are no problems in this  matter, particularly problems connected with the tyranny of  bureaucrats who, incidentally, forget their national feelings  when there is extortion and bribery (a Kazakh takes money from a  Kazakh, a Russian from a Russian). Russian citizens probably  are also aware of this.    I am very worried by the departure of Germans. More Germans  than Russians have left the republic. I understand the feelings  of people seeking to return to their historical homeland,  especially as the majority did not come to Kazakhstan at their  own wish. But in talks with Germany's leaders I always raise  questions of expanding the presence of German business in  Kazakhstan. We have plenty of land. You only have to work, to  raise children, to make your family's life a prosperous one.  And do you need dual citizenship under these conditions? You  ask what danger it presents to Kazakhstan. It does not present  a danger to the Kazakhs! You cannot split the multinational  Kazakhstan society into two parts. You cannot have "ours" and  "theirs."    I suggested and continue to suggest a simple and feasible  way  out of the situation: When he moves to Russia let a person  freely acquire its citizenship. If you come to live in  Kazakhstan, you acquire Kazakhstan citizenship. And even  better, introduce within the CIS framework a common document  enabling people to live wherever they like irrespective of  citizenship. And then the question of "dual citizenship" will  disappear of its own accord.    [Dotsuk] How is the situation with the CIS taking shape  today? Do you believe that formation is still promising?    [Nazarbayev] I have never considered it unpromising,  otherwise I would not have put forward so many initiatives for  the integration, primarily the economic integration, of our  states. The recent meeting in Ashgabat confirmed that the  further we go in different directions the more rapidly we will  feel the need to unite. It seems to me that there are enough  signed documents regulating work and mutual cooperation within  the CIS to see us through to the end of the century and it is  now time to fill work with specific content, unraveling, albeit  slowly, but nonetheless painstakingly, the knots of  contradictions which emerged largely artificially over the past  two years.    I do not know, perhaps someone does not like talk of a  single  economic area but I have long been suggesting to all neighbors  that they remove all customs barriers and open up their borders.  By all means, let us sign a treaty.    [Dotsuk] Previously, when the officials of two governments  could not agree on particular issues, you and Yeltsin would  intervene and the problems would be resolved. Recently, Yeltsin  does not seem to be "playing up" to Kazakhstan very much. Should  we think that your personal relations with him have cooled?    [Nazarbayev] I am surprised, although I can imagine why you  reached that conclusion. Boris Nikolayevich complained that, in  terms of resolving mutual economic problems unskillfully, our  governments, ministries, and departments were putting us in an  awkward position, and he was right. After all, how many  meetings, talks, and agreements there have been. We met six  times last year just to discuss the ruble zone! We still did  not achieve anything. And the heads of state seemed to be  guilty here. In general, the bureaucrats have not resolved  anything, not even after our summit meetings, when we reached  the same opinion on many issues. And the economy is starting to  live increasingly by market rules and not by orders from above.    We maintain relations constantly and consult each other on a  very broad range of problems. Only for some reason the press  has stopped reporting that a telephone conversation has taken  place between the presidents on a particular topic.    [Dotsuk] In connection with the abolition of the ruble zone  can it be said that Russian-Kazakhstani relations have  nonetheless become more complex?    [Nazarbayev] I would not draw that conclusion. It has  already been reported that we and Russia have concluded a treaty  on mutual payments in the fuel and energy complex. None of us  owes anyone anything. We and Russia are equally interested in  strictly observing our treaty commitments. There are also other  mutual decisions -- treaties are being prepared on military  cooperation and joint space projects. Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin's visit to Kazakhstan was fruitful. The talks on  the ruble zone belong to yesterday.    [Dotsuk] A few words about Russian-Kazakh relations in the  sphere of military cooperation. The situation is obvious:  Unless Kazakhstan and Russia sign a treaty on military-political  cooperation and documents on the joint use of former strategic  projects, both sides will lose out -- Russia is deprived of  bases for scientific and military tests and for Kazakhstan these  test ranges become a heavy burden since the republic cannot cope  with them alone. Is Kazakhstan prepared for serious compromise  steps to preserve existing unique military-technical complexes?    [Nazarbayev] Compromise presupposes mutual concessions, not  unilateral ones. Kazakhstan has always stated its readiness to  resolve all problems with Russia on mutually advantageous terms.    Of course, the military complexes that have been created  have  an enormous scientific and technical potential. And we shall  preserve it -- on an equal basis with Russia or independently.  But here we must consider that the Baykonur test ranges and  cosmodrome in Kazakhstan occupy enormous territories.  Approximately as much territory as the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary, and the former GDR taken together -- over 13  million hectares of land artificially removed from economic  circulation. In addition the military regularly occupied a  further 3.5 million hectares of agricultural land for their  experiments. And one can understand people's attitude toward  these mostly lethal establishments. We know that the fuel for  the "Proton" booster rocket contains a highly toxic component  like heptyl, which is in the top danger category. So after  launching, the missile's separated stages with this heptyl  simply fall from the sky onto the ground and are no birthday  present to the local inhabitants. We must calculate the size of  the territories polluted by this poison.    [Dotsuk] Are you not troubled that when Clinton came to the  CIS he met with all the "nuclear" presidents except the  Kazakhstan president?    [Nazarbayev] My talks with Clinton lie ahead. IN the very  near future I am to make an official visit to the United States  at the U.S. President's invitation. And I am not troubled by  this fact for the simple reason that I had a thorough discussion  of questions of nuclear arms in the CIS with Albert Gore during  his visit to Kazakhstan. We also talked of the subject of  William Clinton's talks in Moscow. In addition back in December  last year our parliament ratified the decision to accede to the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty without outside pressure. And  it was these problems that the U.S. President was discussing  with Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. There was no need for  Kazakhstan to attend.    In conclusion, I want to wish all Russians and KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA readers and journalists happiness, prosperity, and  health. I would like you always to be objective and to describe  in a balanced and well-intentioned way how people are living  throughout the world, including in our country -- the Republic  of Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BBC REPORTS CHINA JAMS BROADCASTS  </P> <P> The British Broadcasting Corp. said today its Mandarin-language broadcasts to  China are being jammed for the first time.  </P> <P> "There is no possible justification for this deliberate and systematic  interference with our broadcasts, although it clearly indicates the impact the  World Service is having inside China as far as the authorities are concerned,"  said John Tusa, managing director of the BBC World Service.  </P> <P> The BBC said the interference typically starts a few minutes before the  Mandarin transmissions begin and stops shortly after they end. It takes the  form of a steady, low-frequency noise about 25% as strong as the program signal  itself.  </P> <P> The BBC said it did not know exactly how long the interference had been taking  place. There has been evidence of it since June, but it was only positively  identified this week by a BBC engineer in Beijing, it said.  </P> <P> "Jamming is a practice which violates established broadcasting relations," Tusa  said. "This latest instance is particularly regrettable at a time when jamming  from all other Communist countries has ceased."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union stopped jamming BBC Russian service broadcasts in 1987 and  lifted its interference with BBC Polish broadcasts a year later.  </P> <P> The BBC said World Service broadcasts in English are not being jammed by the  Chinese, but it is still unclear whether Cantonese language broadcasts are  affected.  </P> <P> The BBC said it stepped up its Mandarin broadcasts by half an hour in early  June to a total of three hours daily in response to demands for coverage of the  student-led demonstrations in China and the government's crackdown.  </P></p>

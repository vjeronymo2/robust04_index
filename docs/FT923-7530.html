			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Growth put firmly before environmental progress THE Republicans and Democrats see two very different shades of green on environmental issues, writes Matthew Kaminski in Houston. The first clear salvo in the campaign war of words on the environment came from Senator Al Gore, Governor Bill Clinton's running mate, who at a California recycling plant earlier this month mocked President George Bush's 1988 pledge to be the 'environmental president' by suggesting the alternative soubriquet 'hypocritical president'. Not to be outdone, Mr Gore's rival, Vice-President Dan Quayle, quickly labelled him 'an environmental extremist' for his best-selling book on the environment and claimed the Democrats put 'a spotted owl or a giant garter snake' ahead of economic growth and American jobs. The brief environmental plank in the Republican's platform for this week's party convention refuses to 'sacrifice' environmental progress to economic growth. In sharp contrast, the Democratic platform loftily pledged to conserve 'the critical sources of soil, water and air'. However, the Bush administration itself suffers from severe internal strains on environmental issues. Mr Quayle leads the anti-regulatory flank, where he is joined by Mr Richard Darman, the budget chief, and Mr Michael Boskin, Mr Bush's chief economic adviser, while Mr William Reilly, the Environmental Protection Agency chief, tries to advance the environmental agenda. The divisions became embarrassingly public during the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in June, when an internal leak blunted Mr Reilly's efforts to get the US to sign the biodiversity treaty. Mr Reilly likes to trumpet progress - pointing to more funding for, and fines by, his agency - but, since Rio, it appears Mr Quayle has become the environmental standard bearer for the administration. Mr Quayle has led the administration's efforts to make the important environmental laws such as the 1990 Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act friendlier to US industry and businesses, who complain about high compliance costs. This is mostly done through Mr Quayle's controversial pro-business group, the Council on Competitiveness, which in its nominally advisory role has persuaded federal agencies to dilute environmental rules. For instance, some 60 regulations in the Clean Air Act, ranging from chemical plant standards to carbon dioxide emission limits, are held up by the Office of Management and Budget, which works closely with the council. The council, which is guided by Mr William Kristol, Mr Quayle's chief of staff, estimates its efforts 'to relieve the stranglehold of burdensome regulation and excessive regulation' will save or create some 200,000 jobs. The Senate is expected this autumn to consider an amendment to erase the council's Dollars 86,000 budget from a funding bill while the House, which has already cut funding, also plans to weigh a measure that publicly exposes the council's back-room activities. The controversy is unlikely to temper Mr Quayle's tone or stop his council.</p>

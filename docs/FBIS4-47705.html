			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- If voting trends continue  to remove minor parties from the political race African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela may choose to bring some of  the parties' leaders into a government of national unity.    This was the view of senior ANC executive Mac Maharaj who  said on Sunday [1 May] the movement's concern in heading the  next government was stability. "Mr Mandela will reach out to  these minority parties and bring them into government," he  predicted.    The one condition would be that they were parties of  "substance", he said, "not like the Federal Party or KISS [Keep  It Straight and Simple Party]".    "For instance (Freedom Front leader) Constand Viljoen; he  may  only get four per cent. The law requires five per cent (to get  a cabinet post) but he will be brought in for the sake of  stability."    Other parties which may fail to make the cut-off, such as  the  Democratic Party, are certain to meet the requirement of  "substance".    It is also certain that any such inclusions would not be  agreed to by what is emerging as the ANC's only real opposition,  State President F. W. de Klerk's National Party [NP] which  appears to be exceeding intitial expectations by a large margin.    The NP is nevertheless not likely to exceed the one-third  mark by much and will jealously keep whatever cabinet posts it  is entitled to. Any "gift" cabinet posts for smaller parties  will have to be at the cost of the ANC.</p>

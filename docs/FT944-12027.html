			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Unlikely champion of free trade: Suharto's protectionist instincts make Indonesia an improbable venue for the Apec summit At first glance, Indonesia is an improbable place to celebrate the virtues of free trade. The economy has for years been one of the most protectionist in south-east Asia. The presidential palace in Bogor, near Jakarta, will nevertheless be the venue for this month's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit, to be attended by US President Bill Clinton and the leaders of 16 other Pacific nations. If free traders have their way, the November 15 summit will set a target date for free trade across the Pacific of 2020, or even 2010. Mr Suharto sees the summit as the clearest sign yet of Indonesia's growing stature on the world stage, and is determined to make it a success. He has surprised even his own cabinet ministers with vigorous endorsements of free trade in the run-up to the conference. There has been a progressive liberalisation of Indonesia's trade and investment regimes in recent years. Average tariffs, for example, have fallen from 37 per cent to 20 per cent in the last decade. But the economy remains protected with visible and invisible barriers and is ill-prepared to compete in a free market. Mr Suharto's sudden enthusiasm for free trade is typical of the enigmatic army general, who has ruled with his 'New Order' government since 1966. The president, who calls himself the 'Father of Development', has presided over average annual economic growth of 6 per cent for the last quarter of a century. Foreign investment in the world's fourth most populous nation, with 187m people, has been encouraged. Textiles, shoes and electronic goods have joined timber, oil and gas as important exports industries. The west has started to pay attention, with the US commerce department last year proclaiming Indonesia a 'big emerging market'. Tempted by Indonesian proposals to spend the equivalent of Dollars 50bn on everything from power stations to telephones under its new five-year plan, the US has chosen Jakarta as the first Asian site for a 'US Commercial Centre', to help US investors and exporters. In an Independence Day speech in August, Mr Suharto said Indonesia wanted to quadruple real per capita income (at present about Dollars 800 a year) in the next 25 years, through industrial development. 'We shall continue deregulation and de-bureaucratisation,' he said. 'The goal is to prepare for a highly competitive economy that can survive in the increasingly unified and competitive global economy.' However, he added a puzzling afterthought: 'Deregulation and de-bureaucratisation certainly do not mean setting up a liberal economic system that allows free competition.' This inability to reconcile his professed belief in free enterprise with his protectionist instincts, is one of several unresolved dilemmas in economics and politics that confront Indonesia as the president grows older and the economy larger. Another is the domination of domestic business by conglomerates with ties of blood or friendship to the Suharto family. The president has declined to curb the commercial ambitions of his children or his small coterie of ethnic Chinese business associates. Between them, they use their position to acquire lucrative stakes in almost every big investment project. Typical is the new Dollars 1.7bn Chandra Asri petrochemicals plant at Anyar, on the west coast of Java. The partners in the project include Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, one of Mr Suharto's sons, and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, one of his friends. The government has offered a 40 per cent tariff on imports to support the venture, to the fury of some businessmen who fear the higher costs will damage their competitiveness. Another example of the arbitrary way Indonesia is run came to light in July, when it emerged that Mr Suharto had decreed the transfer of Rp400bn (Pounds 113m) from a reforestation fund to IPTN, a state aircraft manufacturing venture managed by Mr BJ Habibie, the minister of research and technology and another friend of the president. Environmentalists, including a prominent group called Walhi (Indonesian Forum for the Environment), have taken the president to court, demanding the reversal of the decree and asking for Mr Suharto to be fined Rp5m. 'A lot of people warn us that, after Apec, Walhi will be harassed because of this action,' said Ms Emmy Hafild of Walhi. The acceptance by the court of the case for a hearing is attributed to the official policy of keterbukaan or openness in recent years. But after a brief period of vigorous debate in the media over politics and economics, openness is already in retreat. In June, the government banned three leading publications, apparently because they mentioned the sensitive issue of the succession to Mr Suharto - he has declined to name a successor or say if he will step down - and reported on a dispute between the armed forces and Mr Habibie over his decision to buy the 39 warships of the old East German navy. Both Mr Suharto and the armed forces say strong government is needed to control ethnic and religious conflicts and prevent the disintegration of Indonesia - a scattered archipelago extending nearly 5,000km from Sumatra in the west to Irian Jaya in the east. They do not believe a more open political system is necessary to oversee the next stage of Indonesia's industrial revolution. The army's leading role in politics was tolerated and even welcomed by Indonesians after the massacres surrounding the overthrow of President Sukarno in 1966. Army chiefs are now unwilling to accept a diminished role in an increasingly sophisticated, urbanised society. General HBL Mantiri, chief of general staff, recently said the army saw itself as the political 'shepherd' of Indonesians, and insisted it would never relinquish the political and social role it has added to its military responsibilities. 'Our dual function will last for ever and ever,' he declared. 'It is already stated in the constitution.' However, the argument that authoritarianism is necessary for stability is not as compelling as it was in the 1960s. Strikes by workers have become more frequent, and hardly a week passes without demonstrations by slum-dwellers or rice farmers against well-connected property developers who have gained control of their land. The authorities have sought to crush the independent trade union that sprang up in the past few years to represent workers in Indonesia's growing number of factories. Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Welfare Labour Union, is now on trial, accused of inciting workers to riot in Sumatra in April. Even before the trial is over, General Mantiri has said Mr Pakpahan will get six years in jail because he organised in the factories 'and we cannot tolerate such things, of course'. On Monday a fellow leader of the union, Amosi Telaumbanua, was sentenced to 15 months in jail for inciting worker riots. The urban middle-class professionals who want democracy are few and ineffective, but they grow more numerous every year as Indonesia becomes wealthier. They are no more convinced than labourers of the need for dissenting views to be silenced. As the Apec summit approaches, local human rights campaigners, journalists and environmentalists say harassment by police and military intelligence officers has increased, presumably to discourage demonstrations. Thousands of extra troops and police deployed in the capital for 'Operation Cleansing' have rounded up prostitutes and beggars before the dignitaries arrive. Brushing aside criticism of its record on human rights and the environment - in recent weeks vast fires in deforested areas of Indonesian Borneo and Sumatra have shrouded Singapore and Malaysia in smoke - the government in Jakarta portrays the Apec summit as an unambiguous sign that the country has come of age. There is a growing number of Indonesians, however, who believe that the authoritarian government and corrupt bureaucracy are out of touch with the views of ordinary Indonesians, and may prove incapable of taking the right decisions to ensure continued political stability and economic growth. 'I might have bought the argument of stability and authoritarianism in 1971 or 1972, but after all these years I don't buy it any more,' said Ms Hafild of Walhi.  ---------------------------------------------------------- INDONESIA: A BIG EMERGING MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------           Exports       Imports     Current account balance       (Dollars bn)  (Dollars bn)   (Dollars bn)   (% of GDP)  ---------------------------------------------------------- 1991         29.4          24.6           -4.1         -3.5 1992         32.5          26.5           -3.7         -2.9 1993         35.8          29.1           -3.0         -2.1 1994*        39.3          32.3           -2.9         -1.9 1995*        43.3          35.9           -2.9         -1.8  ---------------------------------------------------------- * Forecasts                                     Source: ADB  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Competitive role for mobile phones Mobile phone companies could play a critical role in boosting competition across Europe's telecommunications industry as existing monopolies are abolished, the European Commission believes. Mr Leo Koolen, a senior Commission official, told a Financial Times conference on mobile communications in London yesterday that mobile phone operators would be well placed to com-pete with existing 'fixed-wire' operators when the monopoly of national phone companies over basic phone calls is abolished in 1998. Commission projections show the number of mobile telephone subscribers in Europe rising from about 12m - three times the level of three years ago - to at least 40m by 2000 and 80m by 2010. 'We believe that the mobile and personal communications sector has the potential to grow to a size equivalent to the present fixed-wire sector in just one and a half decades,' said Mr Koolen. The mobile communications sector has been opened to competition across the European Union. Within the past two years industrial groups such as Mannesmann in Germany and Bouygues in France, with no previous telecoms business, have taken significant stakes in the cellular market, in competition with established operators Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom and As a first stage in opening up fixed-wire telecoms networks to competition, the Commission wants mobile operators to be allowed to build their own fixed links as a means of reducing their reliance on existing monopoly networks. This will be covered by a green paper on telecoms infrastructure liberalisation, to be published early next year. However, Mr Koolen said the Commission also envisaged mobile operators competing head-on with fixed-wire companies once the latter's monopoly over basic voice telephony is abolished in 1998. In the UK - the EU's most open telecoms market - Mercury Communications, the main competitor to the former monopoly British Telecommunications, is a significant operator in both the mobile and fixed-wire markets. The Commission believes a similar pattern could develop across the EU as liberalisation advances.</p>

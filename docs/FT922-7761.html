			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading TRADERS OF stock index futures reported a volatile session with Footsie futures once again failing to touch fair value, though a bounce late in the day helped the contract to close firmly, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session below the psychologically important 2,700 level at 2,695 and was traded down to 2,689 by mid-morning, which proved to be the day's low point. June was then traded down to fair value twice during the session, but was boosted in the afternoon by the firm performance in the gilts and bond markets leading traders to predict a strong performance next week. June closed at 2,699, down 11 on the previous session and around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover reached a reasonable 7,626. In traded options, turnover at 31,994 was down on Thursday's level. The FT-SE traded 9,038 lots. Among the stock options, Asda, was the busiest, trading 2,557 lots with the July 30 calls the most active. This was followed by GEC, in which a sizeable amount of stock was said to have been on offer in the equities. Some 1,928 contracts were traded in the options. Hanson was busy again, with 1,701 lots dealt.</p>

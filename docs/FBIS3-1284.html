Mr Ramodike claimed on Tuesday that  matters had worsened since the Department of Regional and Land  Affairs had assumed control of the territory. In a statement on  Wednesday, Minister of Regional and Land Affairs Andre Fourie  said he had the "fullest confidence" in the task team  controlling Lebowa's finances. "This is proved by the fact that  the task team has already evaluated the files of all Lebowa  public servants, except some cases related to the Lebowa  Department of Health, and has forwarded its recommendations to  the Lebowa Public Service Commission. Of course, this makes a  mockery of the chief minister's statement," said Mr Fourie.</p>

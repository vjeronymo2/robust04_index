			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / People: Watkins takes flight from Chrysalis Nicholas Watkins has resigned as a director of Chrysalis, the music and media group, to head a management buy-out of its multi-media and in-flight television interests. Watkins joined Chrysalis from Rank in 1989 to help it refocus its business. He has succeeded to the point where he does not feel Chrysalis has a place for him any longer. Its focus is now on the music business - which it re-entered last year - and on television broadcasting activities. Watkins believes both sides of the business require managers with a creative background. 'I'm more of a corporate suit,' he says. Chrysalis will keep 15 per cent of the company Watkins is setting up to produce material for multi-media and in-flight television companies. He is talking to another three or four potential investors.</p>

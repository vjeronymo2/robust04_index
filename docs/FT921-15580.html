			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US and EC struggle for spring accord on Gatt US and EC trade officials this week have been struggling to devise a strategy for the Uruguay Round negotiations with the objective of producing a final package this spring. This would allow Congress to vote on the package before the November presidential and Congressional elections. Both sides, however, have difficulties with the draft agreement submitted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), on December 20. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC vice president in charge of trade, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, met on Tuesday in Washington to discuss procedures and 'liked what each other had to say,' an EC spokesman said. An important stumbling block could be the meeting of the EC foreign, trade and farm ministers in Brussels on January 10-11. EC trade and farm ministers already sent a chill through the negotiating effort on December 23 in rejecting the Dunkel agriculture plan. The US difficulty is as much with agriculture as it is with the other sectors. The assumption in Washington has always been that the US would have to make concessions on the protected farm sectors and textiles in order to get the strong rules business groups want for intellectual property rights, services, investment, and market access. Many companies see the Dunkel paper as flawed and the developing countries as having gained too much. With the US recession continuing, neither Congress nor its business constituents are keen to support yielding of US trade sovereignty. But business groups have replied to Mrs Hills' request for suggestions on improvements to the Dunkel paper. The MTN Coalition, a group of companies in favour of the round, yesterday released a statement calling the Dunkel paper 'a basis for continuing intensive negotiations.' It urged Mrs Hills and the Bush Administration 'to continue the administration's relentless pursuit of a broadened strong agreement.' The International Intellectual Property Alliance issued a statement warning that 'critical improvements' need to be made in the text to protect US copyright owners. It listed as a 'critical defect ..the inclusion of an unreasonably long - and unnecessary - five-year transition period before less-developed countries would be be required to comply with the copyright provisions.'</p>

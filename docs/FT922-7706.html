			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Put your best foot forward IN 1851 there were 38,000 shoe makers in London Andrew Lawson's book, Handmade in London, tells me. Today, I would bet my shirt the numbers were well under 100. Price and the proliferation of good quality factory-made shoes has put most out of business. However, my mail, filled with the cries and whimpers of those with strange-shaped feet, with bunions and other problems, would seem to indicate that there is still a need for a hand-crafted bespoke shoe - if only it could be had at an affordable price. With that most eminent cobbler, John Lobb, charging from Pounds 995 (plus VAT) for a first pair of shoes and a usual waiting list of between three to four months, a pair of bespoke shoes has become a luxury beyond the reach of all but the few. However, at 4 Paddington Street, just off Marylebone High Street, London W1, is James Taylor &amp; Son, which has been providing hand-crafted shoes and a raft of other shoe services since 1857. Prices there are not cheap - how could they be with skilled labour and fine leathers costing what they do? - but they offer considerable value for money. Top of the James Taylor range is, of course, the made-to-measure shoe, not cheap at Pounds 595 plus VAT, but it is Pounds 400 less than Lobb's. Made on the premises by craftsmen who use individual lasts and fine leathers from goats, calves, kids, lizards and sheep, they can, within reason, make almost any style but, of course, like any fine cobbler specialise in classic brogues, Derby's and all the rest. Delivery is usually about two months. There is an intermediate service where measurements are taken and sent to a factory (John Locke) specialising in traditional fine footwear where they are made on a standard last that accommodates the measurements as nearly as possible. This is not, obviously, the same as having an individual last made to fit just your feet but they find that on the whole most feet can be happily accommodated. Delivery of these takes about two months and prices are from Pounds 350 (inc VAT) for women, and from Pounds 380 (inc VAT) for men. There are lots of useful ancillary services as well. Besides a range of ready-made shoes (Crockett &amp; Jones classic men's styles, Finn Comfort walking shoes, Status Shoes to give more height), James Taylor will alter or adapt existing shoes, whether their own make or not, and will repair and hand-sew soles or polish shoes. It will make to measure foot supports for long arches and metatarsals, raise heels to balance unequal legs and in general do anything to make your walking life more comfortable.</p>

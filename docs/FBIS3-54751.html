			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms </F> Electoral Association"]    [Text] The Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms [RMDR]  expresses sincere thanks to the voters who cast their votes for  the movement's federal list.    The RMDR thanks those independent candidates and  representatives of the Russian Free Labor Party and other public  associations and trade unions who agreed to contest the  elections together with it.    The movement expresses special gratitude to its activists  who  bore the full burden of the election campaign on their shoulders  and also to those entrepreneurs who supported the RMDR with  their financial resources.    The movement cordially congratulates all Russians whatever  their political persuasions on the new year, 1994, and sincerely  wishes them peace, harmony, happiness, and prosperity.    Russia has had a referendum and its first multiparty  elections.    We are satisfied that the voters approved the state's new  Constitution, which is what the RMDR actively urged the  country's citizens to do.    The elections to the Federal Assembly are of no less  significance. For the first time in many years the  representative power in the state has become directly dependent  on the will and opinions of millions of voters.    The historic significance of these events should not be  underestimated.    Undoubtedly, the lack of experience of multiparty elections  in society was bound to have an impact on the results of the  voting. However, this cannot be an excuse for the attacks on  democracy on the part of those political forces which were  unhappy with the election results.    Our movement assesses the results of the elections in a  balanced and sober way. By operating alone in the election  marathon the RMDR could not surmount the 5-percent barrier and  will be represented in the State Duma only by deputies elected  in single-seat districts. But the more than 2 million votes  cast for the movement's federal list are eloquent testimony to  the fact that in its less than two years' existence the RMDR has  become an influential political force in Russia.    Looking to the future with confidence, the RMDR openly and  honestly tells all the voters in the country that neither the  platforms of the progovernment election blocs nor the platforms  of the opposition forces will resolve Russia's pressing  problems. Thus the most urgent task today is to elaborate a  platform for transformations meeting the interests of the  majority of the country's citizens.    We urge all democratic forces not connected with the  government to begin talks on the coordination of a single new  reform platform -- the "Democratic Alternative."    The people must know that not all democrats see the solution  to the crisis through mass bankruptcies, unemployment, the  depreciation of savings, the selling off of plants and stores on  the cheap, disregard of the problems of preserving Russia's  scientific and technical potential and saving its culture, and  kowtowing to the West.    The people must also know that they are not rigidly  restricted in their choice solely to the following alternatives:  a futile return to the past; a set of secuctively simple but  unrealistic and often very dangerous solutions; or an improved  course of shock therapy.    Those 50 million voters who did not take part in the present  elections and whose votes may decide the outcome of future  elections must surely know that too.</p>

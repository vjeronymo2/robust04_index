			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 June  carry articles and editorials on the proposed summit talks  between ROK President Kim Yong-sam and DPRK President Kim  Il-song.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "In Not Even 24 Hours." The editorial starts  off by expressing hope that "the North Korean nuclear issue can  be resolved through dialogue and realize the South-North summit  talks" so that it will be an opportunity to further move toward  achieving reunification. The editorial criticizes the  government for hurriedly accepting President Kim Il-song's  proposal for summit talks saying that it seems that this matter  was not examined thoroughly. While urging that no decisions be  made until North Korea shows practical reliability, it says that  South-North summit talks will be welcomed with "open arms" if  North Korea truly comes forward to the arena of dialogue to  guarantee inspections and nuclear transparency. The editorial  concludes by saying that the ROK must not be "dragged along" by  North Korea.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "The Truth and Falsehood of the South-North  Summit Talks." The editorial begins by welcoming the  possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Then it  notes that "the government must prudently consider North Korea's  true intention" on holding the summit talks. The editorial  continues to point out "Kim Il-song's dualism" noting that this  proposal may only be a disguised will for peace. Noting that  originally summit talks are held when about 90 percent of the  pending issues between the countries concerned are resolved by  the high-ranking working-level officials, there are  prerequisites to be solved before holding the summit talks. It  also notes that without solving the various prerequisites, the  summit talks will only be for propaganda use and that it may  only be a "trap," thus giving disappointment to the people. The  editorial concludes by urging the government to solve  prerequisites and the United States to delay the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks until complete and thorough nuclear inspections  are carried out.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "The Anticipated South-North Summit Talks."  Noting that "a new chapter can be opened in resolving the  nuclear issue and reconciliation and cooperation between the  South and North can be achieved" if the South-North summit is  realized, the editorial elaborates on expectations for holding  the summit. The editorial notes that it welcomes the summit  talks but that at the same time it notes that this matter must  be "observed with prudence." Noting the subtle timing for the  proposal of the summit talks, the editorial points out that this  may be a "tactic" for North Korea to escape from its difficult  situation. The editorial concludes that the ROK must recognize  the true intention of Kim Il-song's proposal for the summit  talks and take prudence.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  900-word editorial entitled "Meeting Between the Summits Has a  Great Significance." The editorial starts off by welcoming the  possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting  that a working-level contact will be held soon for the summit  talks, the editorial expresses the hope that the summit talks  can be realized soon from "the level of national interest." It  continues to elaborate on why it is necessary to hold the summit  talks, emphasizing that "it will play a decisive role in  creating an atmosphere" to resolve pending issues between the  South and North. However, the editorial expresses worry over the  true intention of Kim Il-song in his proposal for the summit  talks, noting that the ROK must have a thorough understanding of  his true intention. The editorial concludes by saying that  since nuclear transparency is the most important pending issue  in South-North relations, it will be desirable to guarantee  nuclear transparency and then hold the summit talks.    SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by  reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK Government's position  regarding the possibility of holding the South-North summit  talks. The article says that if the South-North summit is  realized, it will be a decisive motive in resolving the nuclear  issue. While noting that the exchange of special envoys of the  South and North must be realized to discuss the holding of the  summit talks, officials view that if such dialogue is resumed,  it will be carried out actively to realize the summit talks.  Noting Kim Il-song's message to hold summit talks, which was  conveyed to the ROK by Former U.S. President Carter, the paper  says officials view that there is a 50-50 chance that Kim  Il-song is sincere.    The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on  page 2 a 1,000-word article by reporters Kim Se-song and Yi  Tong-chu on the significance and prospects for holding the  South-North summit talks. The article begins by saying a new  phase has opened in South-North relations due to the possibility  of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting that  Chongwadae, the presidential office, conveyed to Mr. Carter its  acceptance of the summit talks, it seems that the "Carter  channel" will be used for the time being. The article notes  that if Kim Il-song has the will to hold the summit talks, it  first means that he will face all South-North issues including  the nuclear issue "head on," and second, it may only be a  "gesture to temporarily escape the nuclear crisis." The article  notes that what cannot be overlooked is the fact that the  proposal for holding the summit talks may be an "appeasement  strategy" to "resume dialogue with the United States." The  article concludes by urging the government to examine this  matter with prudence.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial on the North-South summit talks. The  editorial appraises that the proposal evokes much expectation  particularly because the two presidents agreed to hold the talks  "anytime, anywhere, and without any conditions." The editorial  also expressed suspicion because of North Korea's past record of  breaking various promises and agreements. The editorial notes  that whether or not Kim Il-song's proposal is a strategy to  escape from the current situation should be determined by how  faithful the North Korean attitude is in the forthcoming  working-level contacts to prepare for the summit talks. The  editorial reaffirms that "the working-level contacts should not  be used to delay sanctions."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word  article by reporter Kim Chung-il on the background and prospects  of the North-South summit talks. The article analyzes that if  Kim Il-song made the proposal as an extension of his remarks  regretting the rupture of past summit talks proposals, it will  be a mere appeasement gesture. However, if Kim Il-song is  determined to hold the talks, the article analyzes that the  proposal will be based on North Korea's "political and economic  interests" because "North Korea needs South Korea's economic aid  to restructure its economy which is essential to maintaining  political stability."    Turning to the agenda of the summit talks, the article  believes the nuclear issue cannot be resolved in a single round  of talks because the North will not give up the nuclear  development at once while the South wants complete transparency  through more inspections, even though the United States might be  satisfied with North Korea's merely remaining in the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. The article further warns that the ROK  Government should be prepared to make a decision when North  Korea requests the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea  during its negotiations with the United States.    KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 1,000-word article  by  reporter Yi Sung-chol on the significance of Kim Il-song's  proposal for talks. The article finds it significant that  "North Korea recognized the ROK as a dialogue partner" making a  concession from its previous stance that the nuclear issue can  only be resolved between the North and the United States. The  article hopes that the dual communications channel will give new  possibilities of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue  because it will be easier for the United States to accept the  package deal proposed by the North if the North-South summit  talks are realized. The article anticipates that "the North  Korea-U.S. talks will still be the core channel for the nuclear  issue while the North-South summit talks could discuss mutual  inspections [sangho sachal] and the compliance of the joint  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."    The article points out that a key matter is the verification  of North Korea's past nuclear activities. The article is  concerned that the nuclear issue will again face a crisis if  North Korea refuses to discuss the assurance of transparency  during negotiations with the United States.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  900-word editorial entitled "Expecting an Honest Meeting for the  Nation." The editorial appraises the proposal as "the most  tangible possibility" different from previous official and  nonofficial North-South contacts. The editorial says that  previous dialogue proposals by both North and South Korea,  including those by President Kim Yong-sam, were political  strategies to solidify domestic positions, and hopes that "this  time, the summit talks will not be ruptured by collateral  conditions irrelevant to the essence of the talks."    HANGYORE SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,100-word  article  by reporter Chang Chong-su on the background and prospects of  the summit proposal. The editorial analyzes that Kim Il-song is  truly pursuing improved North-South relations because he  proposed the summit talks "when the communications channel with  the United States was not closed but opened by Former U.S.  President Carter's visit."    The article also analyzes that the United States pressured  both North and South Korea behind-the-scenes to improve  relations and that the North proposed the summit talks to prove  their will to ease tensions.    The article expects many obstacles on the way to realizing  the summit talks because the ROK Government has not given up on  UN sanctions and would not ignore North Korea's possession of  nuclear weapons for the sake of improved relations.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Prerequisites of North-South Summit Talks."  The editorial notes that the proposal could be a positive one  if there are no political calculations which have always been  the obstacle of North-South dialogue. The editorial also  welcomes the proposal as an opportunity for the ROK to take the  initiative in resolving the nuclear issue.    Recalling how "inefficient" previous working-level contacts  for the exchange of special envoys were, the editorial urges the  government to be fully prepared to carry out working-level  contacts for the summit talks. The editorial also warns the  government of the "strategic aspect" of the proposal. Noting  that North Korea made the proposal through a third party,  Carter, the editorial analyzes that North Korea may have made  the gesture of summit talks to expedite DPRK-U.S. contacts.    CHUNGANG ILBO also publishes on page 3 a 1,000-world article  by reporter Kim Hyon-ik on the prospects of the summit talks.  Admitting that Kim Il-song's proposal has blurred the focus of  the nuclear issue and that everything is going as Kim Il-song  intended, the article expects that tension on the Korean  peninsula will be alleviated for the time being. The article  states that if North Korea tries to make little progress during  the working-level contacts, that will prove that the proposal  was a strategy to avoid sanctions. The article reports that  "ROK specialists on North Korean affairs are expressing concerns  that the sudden variable of Carter's visit might have wasted all  the efforts to adopt UN Security Council sanctions against North  Korea."</p>

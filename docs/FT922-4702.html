			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Avonmore expands onto the Continent AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and meat processing group, yesterday announced the acquisition of Harzland Fleisch Service, a German fresh meat sales and distribution business. The purchase price is IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.48m) cash. Harzland is located close to the former East German border and is Avonmore's first acquisition on the Continent. Mr Pat O'Neill, managing director, described the move as 'an important step in our strategy to develop a manufacturing presence in continental Europe. It provides Avonmore Foods with an important base in the strongest EC economy and the major European market for pigmeat'. Harzland's turnover in 1991 was IPounds 56.5m with pre-tax profits of IPounds 1.43m. Its disclosed net assets are IPounds 1.32m. Payment for Harzland is to be phased over two years. An additional IPounds 1.59m may be paid in 1995, depending upon improved profitability targets being met up to December 1994, and 15 per cent of any profits in excess of those targets will be paid in addition, according to Mr Brendan Graham, group secretary. Avonmore has grown rapidly through acquisition since it was established in 1988, turnover increasing from IPounds 263m in 1987 to IPounds 575m last year. It recently moved into the red meat market with the acquisition of four meat processing plants in the west of Ireland. The plants were formerly owned by United Meat Packers, which went into receivership earlier this year. The four UMP plants together process 10 per cent of Ireland's cattle kill and 25 per cent of its sheep kill. Mr Graham said that the German acquisition 'is a strategic investment as a base and bridgehead for further growth in Europe and will assist in the development of our exports'.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / London rails over Tube snarl-up As crowds of commuters flowed to work yesterday on foot, the words of TS Eliot's The Waste Land came alive on London's streets. But this time it was not death but a power cut on the Underground that had undone so many under the brown fog of a winter dawn. Even by the standards Londoners are used to enduring, yesterday's snarl-up was remarkable. Across the capital hundreds of thousands of commuters found their local Tube station barricaded and bus-stops swamped by restless passengers. Ms Janet Brown, a civil servant, was due at a conference in Westminster at 9.15am. But at 7.50am, the Central, Circle and District lines at Notting Hill Tube station had been closed. Crowds of people milled at the station's four exits and in the busy west London street, hoping for a bus or taxi to come to their rescue. But many wore the resigned expression of those who knew, from bitter experience, that when the Tubes are down the buses will be packed and the chance of a empty taxi is less than a snowball's in hell. After an hour's walking - with fellow commuters three abreast - Ms Brown picked up a bus at Marble Arch only to sit for a further hour as the bus inched down Oxford Street. She reached Westminster two hours late. She had not seen a single cab with its for hire sign illuminated. But yesterday's real victims spent much of the morning in tunnels underneath central London, reading and rereading their newspapers. Just past Queensway passengers on one Central Line train sat stoically waiting for information, never a word passing between them. As the eye-rolling and paper-rustling reached fever pitch a determined supply-teacher strode from the back of the train and headed for the driver's cabin. A class of eight-year olds was waiting for her, she said. Why aren't we moving? The driver couldn't say. Not good enough, said the teacher, with nods of support from a decidedly chattier carriage. The driver disappeared. The train did not budge. It was there for almost an hour - but at least by then the inmates of the carriage were busy swapping their life stories.</p>

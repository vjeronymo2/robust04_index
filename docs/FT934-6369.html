			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save Kwik Save's full year figures cast little light on what the future holds. While European discount chains have long been a threat, the big guns of UK food retailing started cutting prices only after the financial year end. The performance of Kwik Save's shares reflects as much: holding up well to the end of August but falling by 20 per cent since. More important than the 14 per cent rise in profits, then, is the message that sales growth is now slowing as competition takes hold. Having set out its stall as a discount chain, Kwik Save has little option but to match J. Sainsbury and Tesco on price. Margins are being defended by asking suppliers to fund price cuts. As a champion of branded goods, Kwik Save holds strong cards in such negotiations. But manufacturers can only be squeezed so far. Kwik Save has in the past sacrificed margin in favour of volume growth and it would be strange if the company reacted differently to this latest challenge. How far margins might have to fall to keep sales moving is in the hands of the competition. With a return on capital higher than its peers - and a store opening programme funded entirely out of cashflow - Kwik Save can afford to keep expanding even as the pressure builds. But new stores alone will not deliver earnings growth if margins are falling elsewhere. If returns on new investment turn out to be much lower than in the past, the argument for spending less and distributing more to shareholders will be compelling.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / HK media ban 'not aimed at Malaysian' GOVERNOR Chris Patten of Hong Kong yesterday denied that proposed legislation banning cross-media ownership was aimed at Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian businessman who recently bought a controlling interest in the South China Morning Post from Mr Rupert Murdoch for Dollars 349m (Pounds 230m). The governor was responding to comments made by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, who alleged that the legislation was directed at Mr Kuok, who owns 20 per cent of Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's most popular television station. Mr Patten said Dr Mahathir was 'curiously ill-informed' about the law in Hong Kong. He said the legislation, expected to be tabled next April, would not be retrospective. 'It's certainly not possible,' he said. 'If you start being retrospective about cross-media ownership, at what point do you begin?'</p>

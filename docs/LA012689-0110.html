			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGED MOLESTATION CANCELS PRIVATE PROGRAM FOR RETARDED  </P> <P> An alleged sexual molestation incident has led to cancellation of a  $1.7-million-per-year training program for 138 retarded clients in Orange  County run by the operator of a chain of group homes that is on state probation  because of charges of poor care and supervision.  </P> <P> The clients were removed Jan. 18 from a day program run by Edward T. Dawson's  Social Vocational Services Inc. after a client reported that a stranger had  masturbated in his presence and fondled him in a restroom at a Garden Grove  park.  </P> <P> Officials of the state Department of Social Services are investigating the  incident to see if it will affect the status of Dawon's licenses to operate  nine group homes that are on probation in Southern California. Dawson also runs  a company called Developmental Services Assn. that operates four group homes  for the retarded in San Mateo County, which are on probation for alleged abuse,  poor care or lack of supervision.  </P> <P> Officials of the Regional Center of Orange County -- the private, nonprofit  organization that contracts with the state to provide programs for the  developmentally disabled -- canceled its training-program agreement with Dawson  after learning of the alleged molestation.  </P> <P> Garden Grove police say there is a suspect in the incident but indicate that --  like many criminal cases in which the victims are retarded -- the matter is  difficult to pursue.  </P> <P> "He (the victim) made very confusing and contradictory statements," Lt. Chuck  Gibbs said.  </P> <P> Elaine Bamberg, executive director of the Orange County regional center, cut  off Dawson's day program contracts in a sharply worded letter referring to the  alleged molestation and to previous charges of poor supervision and training  methods.  </P> <P> "This action," she wrote, "is based upon the program's prior history of  problems and failure to remedy them and because of an incident that was  reported on the afternoon of Jan. 18, 1989, involving an alleged assault of a  Social Vocational client who was inadequately supervised by their staff. For  these reasons, the center can no longer assure the health, safety and welfare  of any client attending a Social Vocational Services day program in Orange  County."  </P> <P> Dawson's Orange County day programs came under criticism last April in a report  by a consultant to the Orange County regional center who maintained that some  of the clients were spending the majority of their time in vans or in parks  rather than being trained to work or to control their behavior.  </P> <P> Dawson complained in a written statement that it was his staff that reported  the alleged molestation to the regional center and that the client who was  allegedly victimized was capable of going to the restroom unattended. He said  the training group was in the park for a lunch break.  </P> <P> "After the client had been in the bathroom for two to three minutes," Dawson  wrote, "a community member who knew the group came out of the bathroom and  approached the nearby (Developmental Vocational Services) supervisor. He  suggested that the supervisor intervene because a man inside was acting  strangely."  </P> <P> Dawson also implied that Bamberg was trying to solve her own budgetary problems  by canceling his day program.  </P> <P> In a letter to a Times reporter, Dawson said that the "wholesale termination of  services for the (138) individuals, of even a short duration, would alleviate  Elaine Bamberg's budget problems and protect her reportedly healthy salary."  </P> <P> Don Sizemore, information director for the Orange County regional center,  dismissed Dawson's suggestion of a hidden motive of using funds meant for  client services to pay administrative salaries, pointing out that such a  maneuver is prohibited by state law.  </P> <P> Sizemore said the funds saved in canceling Dawson's day program would soon go  to operators of other programs. He said that 30 to 40 of the clients have been  placed in other programs and that placing the others is "absolutely the No. 1  priority for us."  </P> <P> As for Dawson's reference to Bamberg's "healthy salary," Sizemore said she  makes $74,000 a year as head of the center, which is responsible for services  for 6,000 clients.  </P> <P> Dawson pays himself $110,000 a year and his wife $60,000 for the operation of  their 16 group homes that house about six clients each and their training  programs for about 600 clients.  </P> <P> Dawson's Social Vocational Services had received about $1,000 a month each for  the majority of the clients in the Orange County day program.  </P> <P> After losing the Orange County program, Dawson said he still has 450 clients in  day programs elsewhere in the state.  </P> <P> His training programs have no workshop centers, such as those used in more  traditional approaches, but instead rely heavily on transporting clients by van  to community locations for such activities as distributing leaflets advertising  the program's yardwork service.  </P> <P> Some of the so-called higher-functioning clients are provided busing jobs in  fast-food restaurants or cleanup work in car dealerships under the supervision  of Dawson staff members.  </P></p>

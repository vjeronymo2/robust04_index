			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Railways face jungle of rules: Privatisation bill outlines complex regulation for operators THE GOVERNMENT'S railway privatisation bill to be published today threatens to create a jungle of bureaucracy for would-be private sector operators. Each company seeking a part in the running of the railway - whether as a train operator, station lessor or maintenance depot owner - will need a licence from the new rail regulator. Once a licence is obtained, all operating agreements between companies - for example, between a train operator and a maintenance depot owner - will have to be registered with the regulator. All future changes will also have to be notified. The Railways Bill will split British Rail in two, with one body operating trains and the other owning the tracks. The freight operations will be sold and the passenger operations will be franchised out. The long and complex bill, consisting of 131 clauses and 11 schedules in its final draft, paves the way for the duties of the British Railways Board to be divided and passed on to a plethora of new and existing bodies. In addition to the Rail Regulator - a body similar to Ofgas in the gas industry and Ofwat in the water industry - these will include the franchising authority, responsible for franchising BR's train services; Railtrack, which will own the tracks; a BR residuary body operating trains; the private sector train and station operators; a Joint Industry Body to regulate through-ticketing; and the Health and Safety Commission to take charge of safety. The complexity of the relationships between these bodies is certain to raise complaints that the government's method of privatisation could create bureaucratic obstacles to private sector entrants. Questioned on privatisation at Westminster yesterday, however, Mr John Major, the prime minister, was defiant, vowing to press on with the government's sell-off programme supplemented by more contracting-out and more market testing of functions currently performed by the public sector. Much of the Railways Bill is concerned with setting up the statutory and regulatory framework for the privatised railway, but other features include: The Rail Regulator will protect the interests of freight and passenger train users and promote the use of the railways 'to the greatest extent the secretary of state considers economically possible'. Stringent licensing conditions will be imposed to keep out 'cowboy' operators, to check new entrants' financial standing and to ensure safety. Close monitoring of bilateral relationships will aim to prevent track, train, station or depot owners from colluding to keep out new entrants or indulging in anti-competitive practices. No public sector body - including British Rail, London Underground or any of the metropolitan passenger transport executives - will be allowed to bid for any franchises. The government will have broad powers to give cash grants to freight train operators in an attempt to stem the haemorrhage of freight from rail to road. Railtrack will be eligible to receive cash grants towards the cost of building socially necessary rail infrastructure if the cost cannot be recaptured through fares. There are surprisingly few references to passengers and none to the Passenger's Charter, although the government has said that the charter will stay in force. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is hoping to win royal assent for the bill by October. If the timetable is met, the Department of Transport hopes to franchise out the first groups of passenger services in April 1994.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Ford to sell sports car company stake FORD is to sell its stake in AC Cars, the Surrey-based specialist sports car company in which it took a 50.96 per cent stake for Pounds 1.3m nearly five years ago. The holding is being sold, for an undisclosed sum, to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director. He also controls Autokraft, a private company based near Weybridge, which holds the minority stake in AC Cars. Ford yesterday gave no explanation for its decision to return the holding but said it would continue to assist AC Cars with the supply of engines and components for the AC Ace, a sports car that has been under development for some time.</p>

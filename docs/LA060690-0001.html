			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO LEGISLATORS WIN PRIMARIES  </P> <P> Surviving the sternest tests of their political careers, a handful of San Diego  County legislators -- several of them mired in ethics-related controversies --  were overcoming strong primary challenges Tuesday to earn the right to defend  their seats this fall.  </P> <P> In the most competitive, contentious primary in recent San Diego political  history, Democratic Rep. Jim Bates and two Assembly members -- Democrat Peter  Chacon and Republican Sunny Mojonnier -- were winning their respective  nominations, turning back the most serious challenges that they have faced in  incumbencies stretching from 7 1/2 to 20 years.  </P> <P> In another closely watched race, one-time City Hall aide Jeff Marston was  headed towards victory over former Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike  Gotch in the special 78th District contest to fill the vacancy created by  Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate last December. Both also  won their respective "normal" primaries, meaning that Gotch, who also finished  behind Marston in April's special primary, will have an opportunity to reverse  the outcome this fall when they compete for the two-year term at stake in  November.  </P> <P> Two other Assembly members -- Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) and Steve Peace (D-Chula  Vista) -- won their contested primaries over opponents who, if nothing else,  converted those normally somnolent races into much more than mere electoral  formalities.  </P> <P> The legislators' sweep demonstrated anew the considerable advantages of  incumbency, for several of their victories came amid the kind of debilitating  controversies that often end political careers. Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier,  for example, each have faced official investigations into their conduct during  their past term, while the incumbents' positions on volatile issues such as  abortion and the death penalty also acted as a magnet for opposition in those  and other contests.  </P> <P> Bates' victory over lawyer Byron Georgiou marked the second consecutive  campaign in which sexual harassment charges involving the congressman have been  the issue, as the script and battle lines in Tuesday's primary largely  duplicated those of his 1988 race. Bates' opponent this fall will be Republican  Randall (Duke) Cunningham, a former Navy fighter pilot who outpolled government  consultant Jim Lantry, former U.S. ambassador to Qatar Joseph Ghougassian and  two long shots.  </P> <P> "I feel like a guy that got hit with the kitchen sink but withstood it," Bates  said. "I think my good record over 19 years made the difference."  </P> <P> Chacon, meanwhile, defeated former San Diego City Councilwoman Celia  Ballesteros and newspaper editor John Warren, while Mojonnier handily  outdistanced three rivals, led by former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney.  </P> <P> Despite warm, sunny weather Tuesday, the voter turnout was estimated at 34%, a  dismal performance that some attributed to the paucity of major contested  statewide contests. Even an unusually large number of competitive primaries  here failed to generate higher interest among local voters.  </P> <P> In a county where partisan campaigns often are races more in name than in fact,  Tuesday's election was a compelling departure from the norm, as five San Diego  legislators -- four state Assembly members and one congressman -- faced serious  opposition in their party primaries.  </P> <P> Ironically, a key factor that makes so many incumbents virtually unassailable  in general elections -- their party's lopsided voter registration edge within  their district -- exposes them to greater vulnerability in primaries.  Challengers from within their own party, while still having to overcome the  incumbents' daunting name-recognition and fund-raising advantages, at least do  not have those problems exacerbated by the demographic hurdle that confronts  opponents from the opposite party.  </P> <P> From the start, Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier were viewed as the incumbents whose  seats were most at risk, largely because each has been buffeted by serious  ethical charges that compounded existing questions about their overall  effectiveness. Hunter and Peace, meanwhile, also were forced to mount unusually  aggressive campaigns against, respectively, anti-abortion activist Connie  Youngkin in the 76th District and lawyers Darrel Vandeveld and Robert Garcia in  the 80th District.  </P> <P> In the wake of Bates' rebuke last October by the House Ethics Committee, it  came as no surprise that the four-term San Diego Democrat drew strong  opposition in his reelection campaign. What was unanticipated, however, was  that, before Bates would have to face any of the five Republicans lining up for  the chance to oppose him in November in the 44th District, he would have to  turn back a challenge from a fellow Democrat.  </P> <P> Running on the slogan "The Democrat We Can Respect," Georgiou, the former legal  affairs adviser to then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., sought to transform the  primary into a referendum on Bates' morality. Bates' reprimand for sexually  harassing two female aides and for improperly using his congressional staff for  political purposes, Georgiou argued, not only diminished his effectiveness, but  also left him vulnerable to a Republican challenge this fall. The entry of five  Republicans -- Cunningham, Ghougassian, Lantry, Eric Epifano and Kenny Harrell  -- into the GOP primary in a district with a 54%-34% Democratic voter  registration edge bolstered his argument, Georgiou said.  </P> <P> Although Bates repeatedly apologized for the behavior that led to the  reprimand, he also sought to downplay the controversy, attributing it to "some  kidding and flirting around . . . blown out of proportion" by his opponents.  Trumpeting his strong record on the environment and other core Democratic  issues, Bates also encouraged voters to "not let one thing wipe out" his  19-year career as a San Diego city councilman, county supervisor and  congressman.  </P> <P> Two other issues that kept Bates on the defensive were his vote for a hefty  congressional pay raise and his opposition to the death penalty in most cases,  a contrast to Georgiou's strong advocacy of capital punishment. Although Bates  struck back by labeling Georgiou a carpetbagger for moving into the district  early this year after dropping out of the special 78th Assembly District  contest, the congressman conceded: "This race comes down to an up or down vote  on me."  </P> <P> Chacon faced a similar situation in the 79th Assembly District, where  Ballesteros' candidacy, combined with his own liabilities, confronted him with  the most serious challenge in his 10-term career.  </P> <P> Even some of his closest supporters conceded that Chacon entered the primary  with an unusually heavy load of political baggage. A recent California Journal  article ranked him next-to-last in overall effectiveness in the Assembly, and  Chacon, who occasionally has hinted that he was contemplating retirement, has  drawn increasing criticism for spending far less time in San Diego than at his  home in Placerville, near Sacramento.  </P> <P> The controversy spawned by Chacon's acceptance of $7,500 from a check cashers'  organization in 1988 after he abandoned legislation opposed by the group also  figured prominently in the campaign. The state attorney general's office  concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Chacon with a bribe,  but Ballesteros charged that the gift placed him in murky ethical waters.  </P> <P> "Peter Chacon keeps saying he's going to retire," said one Ballesteros mailer  that aptly summarized her campaign theme. "It's time the public took him up on  his offer."  </P> <P> Mojonnier's campaign for a fifth two-year term in the 75th District was fought  on similar turf, as she encountered the political fallout from a series of  embarrassing headlines chronicling her recent tenure in Sacramento.  </P> <P> In February, Mojonnier agreed to pay a $13,200 fine for double-billing the  state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well as for using  political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for her staff.  Along with other state legislators, she also has been criticized for routinely  using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as chauffeuring her  children and escorting her home after evening parties. Her opponents also  resurrected an issue from Mojonnier's last campaign -- her 1987 acceptance of a  $10,000 speaking fee from the California Peace Officers Assn. after leaving her  sickbed to vote for a new Los Angeles prison.  </P> <P> Mojonnier benefited, however, from the splintering of the anti-incumbent vote  by Delaney and the two other challengers -- La Jolla businesswoman Fay McGrath  and Poway school board member Stan Rodkin.  </P> <P> The special 78th District race between Gotch and Marston, meanwhile, was  perhaps more notable for its unorthodox, confusing format than for its content.  With Gotch's experience in elective office providing the major distinction  between the two candidates, most attention focused on the peculiarity of their  "double election" -- the runoff in the special race for the remaining six  months in Killea's unexpired term, and their normal primary for the two-year  term at stake this fall.  </P> <P> Billing himself as the "only tried and tested" candidate in the race, Gotch  argued that his eight years' service on the City Council made him  better-equipped to quickly adapt to the Legislature. But Marston, a one-time  aide to former Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.),  characterized his own staff work as "doing everything but pushing the button"  on a wide range of local and statewide issues.  </P></p>

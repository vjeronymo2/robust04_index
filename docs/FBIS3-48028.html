			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the government has  no plans to appoint a new Sabah affairs minister to replace Tun  Datu Mustapha, who resigned yesterday. The resignation of Tun  Datu Mustapha as Sabah affairs minister, chairman of the UMNO  [United Malays National Organization] Merudu Division, and  consequently an UMNO member will not affect anyone. Tun Datu  Mustapha had the right to make this decision. It showed,  however, that Tun Datu Mustapaha was not committed to UMNO.  [passage omitted]    Asked about Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan, director of the Sabah  Foundation, who has cited the possibility of playing politics to  revamp relations between the federal government and the Sabah  Government, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the federal  government has never quarreled with the people of Sabah. The  federal government merely disagrees with the present Sabah  leadership:    [Begin Mahathir recording] I have heard these rumors for a  long time. Indeed, they want to be readmitted into the National  Front. We cannot just readmit them, though. You remember that  we admitted them after they insisted, but they quit the National  Front easily at a time when we were facing a general election.  Thus, we cannot readmit them easily. First, we want to know  the extent and see the proof of their commitment. If they are  able to prove that they really had nothing to do with their  leader's action, we will consider readmitting them, because we  are not extremely rigid; we have mercy for them.

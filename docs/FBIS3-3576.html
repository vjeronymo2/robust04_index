			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lhasa, March 2 (XINHUA) -- When farmer Puqung raised  a sow three years ago, he also raised quite a few eyebrows among  his startled neighbors in Targyai Village of Xigaze County,  Tibet.    Other villagers considered the keeping of the animal  "inauspicious".    Three years have passed and Puqung's sow has given birth to  15 piglets. He sold the sucklings and earned 2,000 yuan.    Instantly, Puqung's success became the talk of the hamlet  and  spawned keen followers.    By raising and selling pigs, farmers in Targyai Village are  able to buy chemical fertilizers and new furniture to decorate  their homes.    In recent years, more and more farmers like Puqung have  emerged in Xigaze County. Their interest is no longer confined  to cattle and sheep.    Farmers living in the middle reaches of the Nyang Qu River  of  Bainang County used to regard miles of marshland there as  wasteland. Now they have transformed the swamps into  duck-raising farms. Many have earned more than 10,000 yuan.    Xigaze is one of the grain baskets in Tibet. More than half  of the autonomous region's grain is harvested there. The  potential, however, has not been fully tapped. One saying  describes the local people as "sitting on top of a mountain of  grain, starving."    As China's burgeoning market economy has reached this remote  area, Tibetan farmers are eyeing a world that is more than  highland barley, cattle and sheep.    Out in the wide, open fields of Xigaze stretch patch after  patch of lovely vegetables. The plastic-film covered  greenhouses in farmers' courtyards are also green with  vegetables even in the dead of winter.    On highways are carts of fresh vegetables on the way to  market. Barley for brewing beer and some exotic stock from South  America have found their way into the fields on the roof of the  world.    The growth of animal breeding and planting has broadened the  farming structure and food varieties of Tibetan farmers, who are  earning more with a diversified economy.    Last year, farmers in Gyangze and Bainang Counties earned  more than half their income through breeding and planting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The April issue of the  South Korean magazine MAL carried an article by its contributing  journalist Yim Su-kyong known as the "Flower of Reunification"  under the title "Lonely Struggle of Kim Chi-hyon, a Guerrilla's  Daughter, Against Disease".    According to the article, Kim Chi-hyon is a daughter of Kim  Pyong-chu, a soldier of the Korean People's Army who was engaged  in guerrilla activities in Mt. Chiri during the fatherland  liberation war.    Kim Pyong-chu was born in Musan County, North Hamgyong  Province, in the northern half of the country. While serving in  the People's Army during the Korean war, he was active in Mt.  Chiri together with Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the  Korean People's Army who is now widely known as the incarnation  of faith and will. He was arrested in 1954 and should have been  returned home as a prisoner of war already long ago. But he was  sentenced to 10 years in prison in South Korea for the reason of  his guerrilla activity. After being released from prison, he  was married to a lonely woman and they came to have two sons and  two daughters.    Kim Chi-hyon, 29, is their first-born daughter.    When Yi In-mo was at death's door as an inpatient of the  Pusan University Hospital after a cerebral haemorrhage, Kim  Chi-hyon got a leave and attended on him with utmost care for  two months.    Now, the fragile girl is unhappy with a disease. She was  hospitalized in June, 1992, her illness diagnosed as lymphatic  tuberculosis. Last year, she had her ribs cut off in an  operation, attacked with costal tuberculosis, and the  inflammation has spread to the region of the vertebra. She  cannot get on without the help of painkiller.    She has no relatives to support her in South Korea. Yet, she  is more concerned for her family, for the living of her brothers  and sister than her own pain.    Her father's friends, long-term prisoners who spent scores  of  years in prison, sympathizing with her, formed a "Society for  Saving Kim Chi-hyon" and has been helping her.    In her article Yim Su-kyong says attention of many people is  needed to save the girl who had to feel keenly the sufferings  from division and the cold treatment for the mere reason that  her father was a guerrilla who dedicated his youth to the cause  of national reunification, the girl who is now fighting against  a disease, being little different from a lonely orphan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with agronomist Justina Reve by journalist </F> Diosdado Maso in Granma Province for the "Doing Radio" program  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Maso] Granma Province will have to double its  efforts with agrarian products to fulfill some of its residents'  needs. Granma has not escaped the special period's rigors  regarding tuber production. Perhaps it will have to change its  production plans, 68 percent of which is dedicated to plantains,  50 percent of the province's total production. There are many  problems, however; the province needs fertilizer for 24 of the  800 caballerias that have been sowed. It has 12 tons of fuel  when it actually needs 36 tons, and it has less than half the  manpower needed to tend this crop. Could the plan be responsible  for a low yield and Granma's inability to meet the demands for  tubers and vegetables? Well, since we are currently at a basic  production unit, we will talk with agronomist Justina Reve. What  do you think, Justina?    [Reve] We must understand the situation. Production at our  farm, meaning our enterprise, must be distributed twice to each  consumer -- if we may use that expression. In other words,  although we have to distribute the produce among the population,  we must also send the produce to daycare centers, schools, and  hospitals. This scant production must be distributed among all  consumers. Likewise, we must realize a higher amount of produce  than was previously available in the market and the [words  indistinct] stands. Now we can produce only enough tubers and  rice, of which there is very little, to send to market. Although  we continue to produce the same amount of tubers, it is not  enough because we have to supply more consumers.    [Maso] Then you agree with what the report indicates -- that  efforts are being made here in Granma, but that you fail to meet  the demands?    [Reve] Yes, I agree with that, but we must add something:  The  people hear that we have sowed many caballerias in Granma, but  they must realize that not all of these caballerias are  currently producing. Most of the caballerias were recently sowed  with plantains, which need between three and four months to  grow, so production has yet to begin. A small number of  caballerias are currently producing, so we cannot produce more  or meet the people's demands.</p>

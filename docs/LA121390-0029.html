			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: ENJOYING A 'LONG WALK HOME'  </P> <P> The Scene: The premiere of New Visions Pictures' and Miramax Films' "The Long  Walk Home" at Century City's Cineplex Odeon, followed by a party at the nearby  Twenty/20 club. Approximately $15,000 was raised Tuesday for the United Negro  College Fund.  </P> <P> Who Was There: The special guest was 77-year-old Rosa Parks, the "Mother of the  Modern Civil Rights Movement," who, by refusing to give up her seat to a white  man, triggered the 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott that is the film's  setting. Also there were the film's stars, Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek;  director, Richard Pearce; producers, Howard Koch Jr. and Dave Bell, and Miramax  co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, plus 700 guests, including Patrick Swayze and  wife Lisa Niemi, Laura Dern, Lou Gossett Jr., Anthony Quinn, Suzanne de Passe,  Magic Johnson and Marla Gibbs.  </P> <P> Triumphs: That Rosa Parks came out for the opening. "They invited me and I felt  something about Montgomery would be worthwhile to see," said Parks. "It's a  great movie. It opens up what we have endured and what went on."  </P> <P> Tribute: The guest of honor walked right by the cameras at one point and shyly  avoided the limelight. "I mean, they couldn't get her off a bus," said one  publicist. "She's going to do what she wants to do."  </P> <P> Quoted: "It's sobering that we still have so far to go," said Spacek, who plays  a well-off white woman who becomes a supporter of the movement through her  black maid. "We're still pained by things we felt 35 years ago. Dr. King's  dream has still not been realized."  </P> <P> Also Quoted: "Thing have changed somewhat," said Goldberg. "I'm here, I came in  the front door, I arrived in a limousine. So things have changed a bit. It's  not where it should be, but it's not where it was. So it's getting better, but  it's slow."  </P> <P> Whoopi's Career Plans: "I don't care if it's comedy or drama, I'm just glad to  be working," said Goldberg. "I'll go anywhere someone offers me a check that  won't bounce."  </P> <P> The Buzz: Guests thought the film will inevitably be compared to "Driving Miss  Daisy," although this story is told much more from a black perspective. Of the  experience of filming in Alabama, producer Bell said: "The people in Montgomery  were very cooperative. Some were suspicious, but if you've ever dealt with a  movie company, you have reason to be suspicious."  </P></p>

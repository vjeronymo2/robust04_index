			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Swedes blitzed by welter of advice on EU vote Any undecided Swedish Social Democrats looking for guidance in tomorrow's referendum on joining the European Union were offered little help yesterday by Aftonbladet, the trade union-owned popular newspaper that is the main national voice of the party. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, and Ms Mona Sahlin, his deputy, smiled out of a prominent advertisement paid for by the party urging a Yes vote. 'A Yes to the EU means that you believe in co-operation to manage the Swedish welfare system,' they wrote, appealing to voters on the traditional core issue of Swedish social democracy. But further on, an even bigger ad, also paid for by the party, featured their cabinet colleague Ms Margareta Winberg, the agriculture minister. 'For women's right to their own job and economic independence - vote No,' she declared. The split on the EU within Social Democratic ranks is a key reason why the outcome of tomorrow's referendum has been in such doubt. As it is easily the biggest political party in the land, victory for either side is all but impossible without winning majority support among Social Democrats. Mr Carlsson believes he can capture that majority; but to avoid alienating his own supporters he has allowed anti-EU party members a free hand, even giving them party funds to do so. The presence on the No side of such mainstream figures as Ms Winberg has helped add weight to the anti-EU campaign otherwise dominated by leaders of small political parties, such as Ms Gudrun Schyman of the Left party, and Mr Birger Schlaug of the Environment party. With the help of articulate figures such as Ms Agnetha Stark, a professor of business economics who last night headed the No side in the final television debate, the No campaign has managed to hold its own against the pro-EU establishment in the welter of campaigning, leafleting and media attention that has engulfed Sweden recently. State-run Swedish Radio's main news and talk channel has barely deviated from the subject. Throughout this torrent, the No campaign has plugged away at its main objections: that the EU is an undemocratic, bureaucracy-driven union that will erode Sweden's independence, compromise its neutrality, entrench unemployment, undermine the welfare system and reverse the high levels of women's equality and environmental standards. The message appears to have been most effective among women and young voters. Swedish women are employed heavily in the public sector: many feel EU membership will lead to greater pressure on Sweden to reduce its public services and polls show a majority of women ready to vote No. Likewise, young people, bearing the brunt of Sweden's 13 per cent unemployment rate, are susceptible to the argument that the record of EU member states on employment is dismal. Ultimately, however, it is a mighty task for the No side to defeat the experience and authority of Mr Carlsson, Mr Carl Bildt, the leader of the conservative opposition, the trade union leadership, every well-known Swedish industrialist, the farm organisations and every big Swedish newspaper. If the outcome is No, the Swedish establishment will have been humiliated.</p>

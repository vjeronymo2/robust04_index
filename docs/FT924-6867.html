			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Act of charity brings audit day of reckoning - Andrew Jack explains why non-profit organisations have to take financial reporting more seriously BRITISH CHARITIES may soon be forced to drop their collecting tins and cheque books and turn instead to their computer spreadsheets as a whirlwind of change forces them to take financial reporting seriously. After years of neglect, a substantial cultural shift and a series of new guidelines and legislation are rapidly bringing accounting matters in the sector to the fore. Moral suasion is being replaced with tougher demands for compliance. The next few months should bring considerable reform. Most important are several regulations to supplement the 1992 Charities Act, specifying how charities present and audit their accounts, and an up-dated version of SORP 2, the statement of recommended practice for charity accounts. The Charities Commission is expected to issue a consultation document up-dating SORP 2 by the end of January. The Home Office will be releasing details of several statutory instruments by early next summer to cover the elements to be contained in accounts; the content and format of reports; and the duties of auditors. By next September, there should be requirements in place on what accounts will contain. All charities with annual income in the current or previous two years above Pounds 100,000 will require annual scrutiny by a professional auditor, and those with income above Pounds 1,000 by an 'independent examiner'. All will also be required to file accounts each year. The current pace of reform is not limited to Britain. Last month the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US issued a consultative document on financial statements for not-for-profit organisations as part of a wider programme of sector reform. There is undoubtedly a need for greater attention to responsible financial management and accountability. Charities have substantial tax privileges. They rely on contributions made in good faith by the public or government. They are also big business. Estimates suggest there may be 300,000 or more total charities, with annual income of at least Pounds 16bn. Yet observers do not need to look very far to see the extent of existing neglect. Last year there were nearly 135,000 principal charities registered with the Charity Commission. The proportion of these that got as far as submitting accounts was just 11 per cent in 1989. Thanks to computerisation and greater efforts to chase up delinquents, that figure has risen substantially and the commission is confident it can collect more than 80 per cent of accounts by 1994. Yet last year it still remained at only 46 per cent. There is little guarantee of the quality of financial information even among those charities which do file accounts. In 1988, the Accounting Standards Committee issued SORP 2. But the guidelines are entirely voluntary. They have also been criticised for being too flexible. There is also little data on the extent of compliance with SORP 2. But one barometer of the quality of information is this week's charity annual report and accounts award sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Charities Aid Foundation and the Charity Forum. This year there were only about 330 entries, down from a peak in one year of 500. The judges believe charities may have been put off by details in the application form showing elementary mistakes made in the past. But a good number of submissions still suffer the same faults, including points as basic as no accounts attached or the balance sheet being unsigned and undated, let alone failure to comply with SORP 2. That said, Sir Christopher Collett, chairman of the judges, believes there has been a marked improvement in the quality of charity accounts in the last few years. There has also been a great rise in interest in the subject. Mr Adrian Randall, finance director at the Cancer Research Campaign and another judge, says: 'There has been tremendous improvement in the last two years. Charities are waking up to the fact that we are publicly accountable.' Given the diversity of the sector, it is difficult to generalise. Many thousands of charities are limited liability companies, registered with Companies House and obliged to file annual accounts. Many of the larger organisations are already externally audited, and show a high degree of compliance with SORP 2. For smaller charities, the pattern is more disappointing. There is understandable caution about what they want to reveal. Mr Peter Scott, an accountant and financial publisher compiling a directory of charity accounts, says: 'While companies have a tendency to enhance their figures, charities wear the most poverty-stricken clothes possible and tuck away income for fear that contributions will dry up.' Being too explicit about income could bring a lack of sympathy, since donors tend to contribute when they believe a charity is in financial difficulty. It might also give rival charities ideas on potential new donors. Mr Scott says charities very often write off all expenditure immediately. They try to avoid passing money through income and expenditure. There is little indication of how much of their funding is tied or committed. They also provide scanty information on the value of their assets. He would like to see improvements in the information provided in these areas. He also believes that SORP 2 allows too many alternative methods of treatment and needs to be made more rigidly applicable. A paper submitted by a group of researchers to the Charity Commissioners argues that SORP 2 should be revised to reflect factors such as greater information on charities' sources of income; expenditure by areas of activity; and details of costs. It calls for clarification of which subsidiaries or related organisations should be consolidated, and much more on the valuation of assets. But Scott - like many charity accountants - is also conscious of the dangers of drawing comparisons based on the accounts. Focusing on overheads and administration expenses can give rise to unfounded criticism, for example. The charity accounts award highlights one such instance. One winner, Community Network, showed administration expenses as 90 per cent of income. There was little explanation of these expenses, which might appear very high. In fact, one of the Network's principal activities is telephone counselling, and the telephone bill accounts for most of these costs. The figures will vary widely - and justifiably - between a wide range of different sorts of charities, from fund-raisers to those carrying out their own activities, and from those reliant on volunteers to those staffed by highly-qualified professionals. Mr Pesh Framjee, senior consultant in the charity unit at accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, argues that accounts tend to focus on inputs and are far less valuable in assessing outcomes. He says there is a need to look at other, more qualitative criteria which could be included in the trustees' reports to accompany charity accounts. He proffers a rather heretical view of his profession. 'Accountants think accounts are the be-all and end-all. But charities have no bottom line or earnings figures. The numbers do not measure their effectiveness.'</p>

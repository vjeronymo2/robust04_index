			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD PROVIDES RESEARCH ON PROPERTIES TO BUYERS  </P> <P> The state Structural Pest Control Board regulates pest control operators and  requires that copies of inspection reports and work completion notices be filed  with its office.  </P> <P> If home buyers want to research a property, the reports and notices for the  last two years on any address are available for a $2 search fee.  </P> <P> The pest control board will also tell consumers the number of settled  complaints an exterminator has had in the last two years, but can't discuss  pending complaints.  </P> <P> Consumers can file complaints about inspections or treatments for up to two  years afterwards.  </P> <P> Although it's typical for sellers to take care of termite work, a lot of  complaints occur after buyers allow the seller and real estate agents to handle  it, said Maureen Sharp, deputy registrar. After buyers move in, they are  dissatisfied with the work and complain. The board recommends that buyers order  their own termite inspections and consider getting two or three to compare  findings.  </P> <P> It also suggests getting referrals from satisfied customers when choosing an  exterminator.  </P> <P> Call the pest control board at (213) 620-2255 or (916) 920-6323 for more  information, or send inquiries to 1430 Howe Ave., Sacramento, Calif. 95825.  </P></p>

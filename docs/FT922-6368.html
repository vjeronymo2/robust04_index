			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Western donors cement links with CIS states: Lisbon conference moves beyond emergency aid THE first formal meeting between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and a broad coalition of western donors has laid the foundations for a new, long-term economic partnership. For the first time foreign ministers of the 12 post-Soviet independent states put forward their hopes and needs directly to officials from more than 60 donor states and a dozen international institutions during a European Community-sponsored conference in Lisbon. The presence in town of representatives from the three warring factions of Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Moslems further underlined the scope for violent regional disintegration, evident in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia, which in Czarist times saw itself as protector of the Serbs, is now working closely with the US and the EC to try to end the Bosnian fighting. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, left for Belgrade and Sarajevo after an intensive series of bilateral meetings and the signing on Saturday night of a strategic arms reduction (Start) protocol with the US and the three other nuclear CIS states - Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The EC, US, Japan and Russia also initialled an agreement to set up an international science and technology centre. This is expected to provide employment for former Soviet nuclear weapons specialists and concentrate on ways to reduce nuclear pollution. Until now, aid to the former Soviet states has been extended on an emergency basis under plans agreed in Washington last January to avert the perceived risk of famine and chaos. At that time the emphasis was on emergency food and medical assistance in the form of demonstrative support for the new governments. With maximum publicity the EC and the US sent aircraft laden largely with EC surplus foodstuffs and supplies left over from the Gulf war to selected cities. Psychologically the aid effort appears to have been a success, although in practical terms the aid delivered was small and most of the Dollars 86bn (Pounds 48.5bn) pledged by governments and institutions remains on paper. The Lisbon conference sought to move beyond emergency aid to discuss channelling funds and expertise in a co-ordinated fashion, designed to help recipients increase their capacity to absorb aid effectively. A third meeting will take place in Tokyo in the autumn to refine further the bilateral and multilateral aid programmes. The potential for building a mutually beneficial partnership was underlined by Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He calculated that if growth in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union reached 4 per cent in the medium term, 1.8 percentage points would be added to world economic growth. But Mr Camdessus emphasised steady growth would not be achieved without 'bold and comprehensive' action by recipient countries to build a new legal framework for private enterprise and privatisation. Much of the credit for the more confident tone of the Lisbon meeting is attributable to the speed with which the former Soviet states have been accepted into the IMF, the World Bank and other international financial institutions. The IMF alone expects to provide Dollars 25bn-Dollars 30bn to the 15 states over the next four to five years. But its main contribution will be in provision of expertise in areas like central banking and monetary policy, tax and budget reforms, financial statistics and macro-economic guidance. The way in which the Bretton Woods institutions and the newly created European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have assumed the main burden of both technical and financial assistance since the original Washington conference has reduced a potential conflict between the European Community and the US over who should provide 'leadership' during the traumatic period of transition. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, emphasised the global nature of the coalition now being formed to help the former Soviet states. He praised Venezuela and spoke of the way the US was developing a close partnership with Turkey 'to promote free markets and democracy in the Caucasus and central Asia'. Japan also underlined its special interest in the development of the central Asian republics. Whether Tokyo uses the tentatively scheduled October follow-up conference to raise its relatively modest Dollars 2.5bn aid contribution, however, largely depends on whether Russia and Japan can resolve their long-standing dispute over sovereignty of the Kuril islands. THE World Bank will lend Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) this year for industrial development, a senior bank official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Mr Peter Nore, head of the gas and oil group in the management assistance programme of the World Bank's energy sector, said conditions would be attached to the funds but he declined to elaborate.  The CIS joined the World Bank last month. Mr Nore, who is attending a conference on liquefied natural gas in Malaysia, said part of the money would be used to develop the CIS oil and gas sectors. He said the 15 former Soviet republics were desperate for capital to replace equipment in the oil and gas sectors, although gas production had not fallen after the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>

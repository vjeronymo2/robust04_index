			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: The Fiery Angel - Royal Opera House, Covent Garden The stage is a bare box. Two parallel bars are tracked around the midriff of its walls; they provide home base for the troupe of male athletes in jockstraps who emanate out of the action like human ectoplasm. Much of the time they hang in poetic near-motionlessness from the bars, powdered ghostly white to evoke figures in a cathedral frieze magicked into dramatic half-life. Then, at the faintest hint of obsessive passion or frenzy from the characters on stage down below, they surge from their eyrie into silent animation, hovering at the characters' heels like plague dogs, registering each frisson of disturbance like curves on a demonic seismograph. In the scene of convent exorcism that forms the opera's finale, they scuttle through the lines of nuns, taunting and provoking them in sinuous leaps and bounds, dragging their habits off, staging a mad, controlled riot. They are devils made theatrical flesh; they are played by the Maryinsky Acrobatic Troupe from St Petersburg; and they are the central invention of the Royal Opera's superbly original and imaginatively daring new production of Prokofiev's fourth opera (shared with the Maryinsky theatre, where it was first shown last December). The theme of The Fiery Angel is the demonic possession of its heroine, and the havoc she wreaks on those who cross her path. By discovering a form at once material and symbolic for that possession, David Freeman (producer) and David Roger (designer) have found a method of articulating the supernatural that proves instantly comprehensible on its own terms, simple and potent in its music-theatre logic, and capable of rich response on many levels. Freeman has achieved, indeed, a piece of 'naive' theatre - based upon few props, plain costumes and an admirably fluid manner of scene-change - that ranks with the very best of his work in London, and with the most exciting opera-theatre the city has seen and heard in recent years. The Fiery Angel has until now counted as perhaps the most significant missing link in the London chain of 20th-century masterpieces - regularly inserted into and then removed from the schedules of both London companies, and given previously only a single Sadler's Wells outing (1965) by the New Opera Company and a single, magnificent concert performance at last year's Albert Hall Proms. Beyond all its visual thrills, the success of this first Covent Garden production lies in the way it forces even the most knowledgeable of Fiery Angel devotees to re-consider the work's supposed flaws - its discontinuous plot-unfolding, odd-shaped structure, primitivist approach to characterisation, and unreasonable demands on singers and players alike. The staging allows both a 'modern' and a mystery-play context for the figure of Renata, an irrational, vision-haunted outsider in a rigidly controlled society; it makes for continuously gripping opera-theatre. No fixed solutions are contrived for all the difficult questions of theme and substance, yet all seems lucidly realised. And the music is housed with electrifying responsiveness. Freeman is one architect of Tuesday evening's triumph. The other is the conductor, Edward Downes, who marks his 40th year at the house with this production, the realisation of a lifelong dream. At last year's Fiery Angel Prom his mastery over every element of the score was made manifest. In the theatre that mastery appears more remarkable still. Any competent conductor could, one feels, have a decent go with the opera's set-pieces, buzzing with sulphurous thematic material, motor-driven rhythmic patterns and glamorous, tingling orchestration. It takes a conductor of Downes's experience and authority to squeeze theatrical juice from the less obvious features of the score, the light touches of sardonic humour, the bittersweet lyricism. The finale, that astonishing convent cantata for soprano voices counterpointed by the bass imprecations of the Inquisitor, is not just a big blow-out but an inevitable, logical conclusion. The opera holds together. The leading couple, Galina Gorchakova (Renata) and Sergey Leiferkus (her besotted champion Ruprecht), are those of Downes's 1991 concert. The young Siberian soprano floods the music with tone, ample, lustrous, warm and free, unflecked by strain, wobble or screech. No one, heaven be thanked, seems to have alerted her to the notorious voice-killer risks in the role, and so she just lets it pour out with marvellous ease and vitality. Leiferkus's artistry is of the most subtle and selfless kind; his darkly burnished baritone finds moments of deep, finely nuanced beauty in his music without ever elbowing them vulgarly forward. Ruprecht's pain and despair are the more eloquent for being understated. In a large cast, Paata Burchuladze's bull-like, thunderous Inquisitor, Robert Tear's slyly witty Mephistopheles, the Fortune Teller of Gillian Knight and the Jacob Glock of John Dobson stand out, but no one detracts from the richness of the overall impression. In sum, a brave, powerful, arresting performance - no-one who cares about opera as theatre will want to miss it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] For the protection of the rights of the Greek  minority in Albania, the government carefully follows the moves  of the Albanian Government to give fertile government land in  the village of (Vrina) in Sarande to 150 poor families of  Albanian Muslims from the area of Tepelene.    The above statement by the Greek Foreign Ministry was issued  in response to a question by the Political Spring party, which  used this pretext to call on the government to "pay particular  attention to the continuous efforts to change the population of  North Epirus, instead of insisting on ineffective friendship  overtures to the Albanian regime."    The Greek Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the  government "will continue handling the issues related to the  Greek minority with particular responsibility, distancing itself  from nationalist glorification--which as the experience of the  recent past has proven, has not served the Greek interests--and  with the sole purpose of protecting human rights and minority  rights and one's right to remain in one's birthplace."

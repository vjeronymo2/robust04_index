			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NUDE PAINTING  </P> <P> The censorship of a nude painting of Adam in Newport Beach City Hall  illustrates a pretty grim picture of the cultural ignorance that prevails in  this Republican community. I'm convinced now that God is a liberal and the Los  Angeles Times is his messenger. Thank you for printing what the conservatives  are always hiding from -- reality.  </P> <P> JEFFREY FLEMING  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] George Habash's Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has assumed responsibility for  the terrorist attack on a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret  yesterday. Two Israeli citizens were injured in the attack.  Here is a report by our correspondent in the territories Golan  Yokhpaz:    A leaflet signed by PFLP activists and in which the  organization assumes responsibility for the terrorist attack on  a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret, north of Jerusalem, was  disseminated in Ramallah this morning. This is the first  operation in the framework of settling scores between the  Palestinian people and the Zionists following the massacre in  the Cave of the Patriarchs, the PFLP activists state in their  leaflet. Our forces will not cease their activities until a  just and comprehensive solution has been found to the  Palestinian problem and until a Palestinian state with holy  Jerusalem as its capital has been founded. The leaflet goes on  to say that the attack was carried out by two PFLP fighters who  succeeded in escaping. [passage omitted]    Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were  arrested this morning several hundred meters north of the Erez  checkpoint. Armed with a knife, the two managed to make their  way out of the Gaza Strip without permits to enter Israel. They  planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Israel. They were  carrying a leaflet signed by Hamas and a copy of the Koran.</p>

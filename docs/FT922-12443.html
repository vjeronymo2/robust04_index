			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (The Bottom Line): Hotels sector still has room to improve LAST YEAR was awful, the company says. Pre-tax profits down 62 per cent, earnings per share down 68 per cent. This year looks better, but not much. We are maintaining our dividend, but it is only 60 per cent covered by earnings. We are much too dependent on the UK and that will not change for at least five years. No problem, says the City. We'll mark your shares up 4p on that splendid news, just 2p shy of the year's high. Is a historic multiple of, say, 42 all right? A prospective price earnings ratio of 23? There cannot be many companies that investors treat with the same understanding as Forte, the hotels, contract catering and restaurants group, which reported full-year profits of Pounds 73m last Wednesday, down from Pounds 190m in 1990. Compare Forte's rating with that of Queens Moat Houses, another hotel company, which announced its results a week earlier. Queens Moat's pre-tax profits were down only 3.9 per cent to Pounds 90.4m. The company survived the UK and US recessions by reducing its dependence on the British market, something Forte has been promising to do for some time. Queens Moat trades on a historic and prospective multiple of 10. Hotel companies should be easier for investors to evaluate than organisations which manufacture pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. We have all stayed in hotels: we are in a position to evaluate the quality of service. The management's willingness or reluctance to negotiate a discount on the room rate and a quick glance at how many tables are full at breakfast should help us to decide how well or badly the establishment is doing. Forte and Queens Moat demonstrate the weakness of this common-sense approach. The market appears to have its own reasons for favouring Forte and disliking Queens Moat. Some analysts say Queens Moat is out of fashion because the City does not like its depreciation policy. Other point to its frequent rights issues - seven since 1980. Peter Joseph of Smith New Court says that because Queens Moat has weathered the past year reasonably well there is less scope for a spectacular recovery. Forte's poorer performance means the bounce back to health will be more impressive, although he warns that that is still some years off. Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson says the reason the two companies have such different ratings is that Forte simply has a better understanding of how to handle shareholders. 'Forte have spent a lot of time with shareholders - doing presentations, entertaining them and keeping them informed about what they are planning and what the potential outcomes are. About 15 per cent of Forte's shares are held by Scottish institutions, which are well-known for their long-term view. Many in the London market hold Forte as a core holding, as a long-term hold. Over the past year, as earnings have collapsed, there have been few sellers. 'Queens Moat, on the other hand, is still regarded, and still regards itself, as an emerging company,' he says. The company spends less time explaining itself to its shareholders. Slattery does not expect Forte's profits to justify its share price until the year to end-January 1995. That it is a long time to wait. The shares, in the meantime, are expensive for anyone wanting to invest in the company. Queens Moat shares are cheaper. But forecasts of the company's future performance differ. Queens Moat gained 42 per cent of its profits last year from hotels in Continental Europe. Although its 104 UK hotels suffered through the Gulf War and the recession, its 86 Continental hotels recorded solid performances. Profits in both Germany and the Netherlands rose 20 per cent. The company is cautious about its performance for this year, saying growth will not resume until 1993. Where analysts differ is over prospects for the Continental hotels. Some worry that the German market is about to suffer. Others believe the Continental hotels will prove their resilience. One company has no doubt that the Continent is the place to be. Forte, the market's favourite, says it has several Continental properties in its sights.</p>

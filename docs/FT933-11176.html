			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon upbeat on future despite 33% fall J SAVILLE Gordon, the Birmingham-based group with interests split between steel and pipeline equipment merchanting and property investment, yesterday shrugged off a 33 per cent decline in annual profits with a forecast that it 'is entering a period of real growth'. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April were Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 3.49m). Turnover fell from Pounds 57.2m to Pounds 28.4m, reflecting the withdrawal from securities dealing at the end of the 1991-92 year. Earnings per share slipped from 2.9p to 1.4p, but the final dividend is maintained at 1.7p for a same-again total of 2.2p. Mr John Saville, chairman, accepted with equanimity the need to take funds from reserves to meet the dividend payment. 'We've got the first few months of the current year under our belts; we know what we can afford,' he said. On the property side, operating profits rose last year and will continue to do so this year as rent reviews come into effect. But while last year the group did not obtain the full benefit of the declining interest rates, this year it will. Meanwhile, on the merchanting side, there has been a sharp upturn in demand at the steel stockholding arm, and the company is making a profit for the first time in three years. Pipeline equipment sales, however, are depressed and will remain so until a revival of the construction industry.</p>

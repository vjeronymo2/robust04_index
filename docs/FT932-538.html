			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (4): Painful adjustments in US - The Big Three vehicle assemblers battle to reduce costs THE US automotive parts industry is in the throes of a long and painful consolidation wave which is likely to eliminate many of the sector's weaker players but leave the strongest and most efficient companies significantly more profitable. The process has been going on for the past decade, which has seen the number of North American suppliers dwindle from around 3,000 to 2,000, but it has been intensifying recently, due to new pressures from the Big Three US vehicle assemblers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Faced with fierce competition from Japanese rivals, all three have been seeking to reduce their costs and improve the quality of their products. As a result, they are anxious to cut the number of their suppliers, focussing on those that can deliver good quality at the lowest cost, and form longer-term relationships with them. Contracts are increasingly being awarded to a single source for the life of a model, rather than to several vendors for two or three years as in the past. The buyers are also increasingly prepared to look outside the US, sourcing parts on a global basis. At the same time, the Big Three, anxious to cut their in-house costs, have been farming an increasing amount of responsibility for engineering and testing components to their most important, or first-tier suppliers. Chrysler has taken a lead in bringing component suppliers into the teams developing new models at an early stage of design, which has helped build relationships between the two sides as well as raising its quality and lowering its costs. Ford has a goal of reducing its supplier-base by roughly a third during the first half of the decade. But it is General Motors which has caused the biggest upheaval in the industry over the past year, thanks to the actions of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was appointed to the new post of Head of Worldwide Purchasing for the company just over 12 months ago, (see profile, left). Mr Lopez, who was wooed away from GM to Volkswagen in March of this year, set about radical change in GM's relationships with its suppliers. He demanded price cuts from them of 20 per cent or more but in return offered long-term contracts to those which could meet his quality specifications. He also initiated a system under which 'hit squads,' called Picos teams, went into supplier factories and gave them advice on improving their productivity. All this stirred up considerable resentment among suppliers, some of whom maintained they were already thoroughly efficient and that price cuts 'would merely encourage manufacturers to cut corners, lowering the quality of GM vehicles.' But Mr Jack Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, pointed out recently that 'the best top-tier suppliers have adopted cost-saving ideas that more than offset the price concessions they are giving back to the original equipment manufacturers, or they've gained enough additional work to ensure that their margins remain very healthy.' Furthermore, the best suppliers are also being helped by changes in the US automotive industry. First, the sector is recovering gradually from the sharp recession of 1991, with car and truck sales in May up 14 per cent on the same period of last year. Vendors' sales have been recovering. According to a recent survey by the weekly Automotive News, 44 of the top 50 parts suppliers increased their sales in 1992, relative to 1991. Second, the effects of the recovery are being accentuated by the fact that the Big Three are beginning to claw back market share from Japanese rivals, who rely heavily on Japanese parts suppliers. The turnaround is due both to better US quality and to a sharp rise in the value of the Japanese Yen relative to the dollar. Third, the huge Japanese trade imbalance with the US and sabre rattling by the new Clinton administration is putting increasing pressure on Japanese assemblers to buy a greater proportion of their parts from US suppliers, be these for use in their US or Japanese plants. There may also be sound economic reasons for the Japanese assembly plants in the US to increase their purchases from American vendors. The rising Yen means it is increasingly costly for them to import components from Japan. Well over 400 Japanese parts manufacturers have set up shop in the US, primarily to serve the Japanese factories located in North America, but many observers believe a substantial number of these are losing money, and there are rumours that one or more might sell out to American rivals. Finally, the most efficient suppliers should benefit from a trend at all of the Big Three to reduce the amount of parts they make in-house. The trend is likely to be most marked at General Motors, which still makes some 70 per cent of its own parts, often in a far less efficient manner than outside vendors. Mr Lopez began a programme of Picos efficiency workshops at GM's in-house facilities, but hints that GM might sell off some of its parts operations, or use outside suppliers, has stirred up strong union opposition. The company will need to tread extremely gingerly in tackling the issue. Nevertheless, the writing is on the wall - for GM no less than other parts manufacturers - and many analysts expect the number of US suppliers to dwindle to 1,200 or less by the turn of the century. As Mr James Lohman, chief executive of window system supplier Excel Industries, observed recently: 'Auto-makers are leaning more on fewer suppliers that are technically innovative, have world-class quality and are globally competitive. 'For vendors that fail to meet these expectations, time has just about run out.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         US AUTO INDUSTRY SALES                         January-December 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume     Volume    Share (%)    Share (%)                            (Units)  Change (%) Jan-Dec 92  Jan-Dec 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAR SALES               8,211,236      +0.4       100.0       100.0 Imports                 1,994,748      -5.2        24.3        25.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japanese makes          2,470,807      -0.0        30.1        30.2  of which US-built      1,161,011      +3.3        14.1        13.8 Japanese derived*       2,731,602      -1.1        33.3        33.8 European makes            330,800      -2.4         4.0         4.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAR PRODUCTION          5,665,781      +4.2       100.0       100.0  of which Japanese US-built**              1,416,141      +4.5        25.0        24.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAR SALES BY MANUFACTURER: General Motors**        2,843,860      -2.3        34.6        35.6 Ford**                  1,777,634      +8.7        21.6        20.0 Chrysler                  679,586      -3.3         8.3         8.6 Honda/Acura               768,845      -4.3         9.4         9.8 Toyota/Lexus              760,159      +2.4         9.3         9.1 Nissan/Infiniti           414,011      +0.4         5.0         5.0 Mazda                     248,274     +12.0         3.0         2.7 Mitsubishi                155,580      -3.9         1.9         2.0 Hyundai                   108,549      -7.7         1.3         1.4 Volkswagen/Audi            87,950     -15.4         1.1         1.3 Volvo                      67,916      +0.3         0.8         0.8 BMW                        65,691     +23.1         0.8         0.7 Mercedes-Benz              63,312      +7.5         0.8         0.7 Saab (GM)                  26,377      +1.4         0.3         0.3 Jaguar (Ford)               8,681      -7.4         0.1         0.1 Porsche                     4,115      -6.2         0.1         0.1 Alfa Romeo (Fiat)           2,828     -18.7         0.0         0.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LIGHT TRUCK SALES                   4,674,589     +12.4       100.0       100.0 Imports                   400,907     -24.4         8.6        12.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL CAR, LIGHT TRUCK SALES            12,885,825      +4.5       100.0       100.0 General Motors**        4,397,537      +1.8        34.1        35.0 Ford**                  3,192,458     +11.3        24.8        23.2 Chrysler                1,713,012     +13.6        13.3        12.2 Japanese makes          3,136,556      -1.2        24.3        25.7 Toyota/Lexus            1,023,641      +1.3         7.9         8.2 N.

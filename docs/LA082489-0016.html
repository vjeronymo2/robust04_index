			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAYING IS CITY'S 39TH HOMICIDE  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Inglewood man was killed Monday night in what police say was a  gang-related shooting.  </P> <P> The death of Cozari Brown was the 39th killing in Inglewood this year, the  highest number of homicides since 55 people died in the city in 1980, police  said. A rise in gang violence is a major contributor to the increase in  homicides, Sgt. Harold P. Moret said.  </P> <P> Brown, who police said they believe was a gang member, was walking with a group  of men at about 10 p.m. in the 10100 block of South Woodworth Avenue when a car  pulled alongside. The car's occupants and the pedestrians exchanged words, and  a passenger got out and opened fire on the group with a handgun, police said.  The gunman got back in the car and the driver sped off, police said.  </P> <P> Paramedics treated Brown at the scene. He later died at Daniel Freeman Memorial  Hospital.  </P></p>

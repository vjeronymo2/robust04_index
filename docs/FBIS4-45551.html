Corro R.] </F>   [Text] Panama's credibility and good intentions in the  fight against drug trafficking are being questioned  internationally due to the indifference of the National  Assembly, which for all practical purposes will be unable to  hold a third debate on the reforms to Law no. 23 of the Penal  Code.    Despite the efforts of the public prosecutor's office, the  opinion held by U.S. agencies--that Panama is not complying with  its international commitment against drug trafficking--is being  justified.    Attorney General Jorge Ramon Valdes deplored the situation  in  a statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA and he said that "one  cannot fight against drug trafficking without the necessary  legal instruments."    Valdes added that the skepticism--mainly on the part of the  United States--concerning Panama's will to meet in earnest its  commitments to various agencies throughout the world is  understandable.    On 11 April, a bill to reform the law, which dates back to  30  December 1986, was submitted for a second debate. Among the  reforms being considered is the creation of two prosecutor  offices specializing in drug-related crimes.    The prosecutor offices will have authority and jurisdiction  throughout Panama. The reforms also would permit the use of a  legal framework for adequate procedures to be used in the fight  against drug trafficking, such as undercover operations and drug  exchange surveillance.    All indications are that with the end of the regular session  of the legislative assembly only 15 days away, it will be almost  impossible to discuss the bill, which would amend the current  law to conform with the Vienna Convention.    We should mention this reform is the same one Panama  presented before the OAS, the UN, and other agencies dedicated  to the fight against drugs.    On 9 March, during the 15th ordinary session of the OAS  Interamerican Drug Abuse Control Commission [CICAD], which was  held in Argentina, Attorney General Ramon Valdes, speaking on  behalf of Panama, promised to take action in that respect.</p>

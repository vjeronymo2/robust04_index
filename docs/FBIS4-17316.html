			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Hardyka, senior investigator for </F> cases of special importance at the office of attorney general,  by Ivan Herasyuk; place and date not given: "Nobody Will Be  Made Accountable"]    [Text] [Herasyuk] Perhaps we should have waited until the  investigation on the Chernobyl case would be closed definitely,  but certain media -- I do not know who inspired them -- have  prematurely accused the attorney general's office of inactivity  and even prejudice. Therefore, Mikhail Uladzimiravich, the  public should learn about the results of your work, to prevent  various speculations.    [Hardyka] As everybody knows, in June 1991, the Supreme  Soviet of the then Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic [BSSR]  requested the office of attorney general to conduct a legal  assessment of activities of certain Belarusian officials and  other people responsible for resolving issues connected with the  catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Moreover, the  request was formulated by certain deputies in the following way:  It is necessary to immediately find the officials who are  guilty and put them behind bars. In a law-governed state this  is unacceptable however. It is necessary to determine the  concrete fault of every single man, as well as to point out  which article of which law has been violated. A special  investigating team was therefore set up, and I was requested to  head it. For more than three years, we have been studying the  legislative basis existing at that time concerning radiation  safety, and we have collected several thousand witnesses'  testimonies and experts' reports. The materials have been  gathered in almost 150 bulky volumes. All this had to be  interpreted and systemized, and we have had to provide a legal  assessment of activities of every official responsible for  making specific decisions. Without exaggeration, I can say that  it has been a monumental task.    [Herasyuk] The work has currently entered its final stage.  You have resolved to close the criminal case....    [Hardyka] This has been inevitable, particularly, after the  collapse of the USSR. Since many people became citizens of  other countries, it has been very difficult to continue the  investigation. Additionally, official documents of ministries  which were located in Moscow at that time could not be regarded  as a legal basis of the new independent Republic of Belarus. Of  course, our conclusions may disappoint many people, since  nobody, except for well-known employees of the plant, has been  imprisoned. Nevertheless, our work has not been worthless. We  know precisely today what laws we should have, so people who  break the law do not remain unpunished.    [Herasyuk] What has been disclosed by the investigation?    [Hardyka] First of all, I would like to point out that we  did not begin in an empty space. The Office of the USSR  Attorney General had opened a criminal case prior to ours.  Director Brukhanov, chief engineer Famin, his deputy Dyatlov,  shift supervisor Rogozhyn, and Laushkin, chief of the Nuclear  Power Industry Inspectorate, had already been brought to  account. The criminal investigation against the people  responsible for errors in the reactor's design and workers of  the Ukrainian Civil Defense, who failed to report the accident  in time, had been suspended by the Ukrainian Office of Attorney  General.    On 4 May 1986, the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central  Committee Bureau and the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers established  the Committee for Liquidating the Aftermath of the Chernobyl  Nuclear Power Plant Catastrophe. The committee included  Dzemyantsey, Khusaynaw, [Belarusian Prime Minister] Kebich, and  other officials. Practical recommendations were examined by a  scientific-technical council comprised of such well-known  scientists as Nikitchanka, Pyatrayew, and [former Belarusian  Supreme Soviet Chairman] Shushkevich. Operational headquarters  were opened in Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts. Yet, everything was  coordinated by an operational group of the CPSU Central  Committee Political Bureau.    M. Ryzhkov, former chairman of the USSR Cabinet of  Ministers,  while being interrogated as a witness, said that "taking into  account the knowledge existing at that time, the optimal way of  liquidating the aftermath of the catastrophe was chosen. The  operational group examined issues and adopted appropriate  decisions. The adopted decisions were correct."    M. Kavalyow, former commander of the Civil Defense and  chairman of the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers, said the following:  "I learned about the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant from Hryshahin, chief of the BSSR Civil Defense General  Headquarters. He did not receive any reports from Moscow or  Kiev. At the beginning, we did not have complete data about the  radiation level, nor did we know all the details of the  catastrophe. Our equipment was able to detect only high levels  of radiation. There were no accurate dosimeters in Belarus at  that time. Only after the accident, Moscow allocated money to  purchase such equipment abroad."    First Rank Captain D. Zhukowski, former chief of the Homel  Oblast Civil Defense Headquarters, emphasized that "he was  unable to learn about complete forecasts for radioactive  pollution in Homel Oblast from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  civil defense or the Kiev Oblast Administration."    This was confirmed by the testimony of A. Kamay, former  secretary of the KPB Homel Oblast Committee: "The Kiev Oblast  Civil Defense failed to provide appropriate information.... I  have received fragmentary information about the accident from  the local leadership on 27 April 1986."    USSR Deputy Health Minister noted that "the government  should  have informed the people about radioactive contamination in the  entire country and in separate regions. This was a political  step.... Local authorities were unable to provide information  about the accident and its aftermath. At the beginning, all  reports on the accident were considered secret...."    [Herasyuk] In my opinion, Gorbachev should have been the  first one to be brought to account. He found the courage to  mention something about the accident only two weeks after it  happened. Since the boss kept silent, his subordinates did not  rush to inform the people. Neither Gorbachev nor Ryzhkov,  however, were punished....    [Hardyka] As the investigation has revealed, they, as well  as the leadership of our country, did not violate any laws. We  can only speak about moral accountability here, but this is a  personal matter. The Office of Attorney General must operate  strictly within judicial categories. Thus, the case has been  dismissed, because of the lack of elements of crime in  activities of the people who were responsible for making  important decisions during the days following the Chernobyl  accident.</p>

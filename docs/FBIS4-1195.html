			<p>BFN     [Text] At least 10 people have already been arrested for  attempting to disrupt the elections, and strong measures will be  taken against anyone who tries to hamper the election process.  This is the promise given at IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] headquarters yesterday at a special briefing on  security at polling stations.    [Correspondent Arlene Wainstein] Independent Electoral  Commission chairman, Judge Johann Kriegler, says it's  unrealistic to expect that there won't be some problems.  Flanked by two high-ranking police and army officials, he said  firearms would not be allowed at polling stations.    [Kriegler] Voters who disregard this request and instruction  will be liable for arrest and prosecution.    [Wainstein] Nearly 100,000 members of the police will be on  duty during the critical voting days next week; and they are  ready to arrest anyone who tries to disrupt the voting process.    [Police Commissioner Johan Swart] And they will be detained  in the police cells until after the election. And the South  African Police will do everything in our power to oppose any  application for bail.    [Wainstein] The SADF [South African Defense Force] also has  at least 67 companies of troops on standby with more due to  report in the next few days.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 COUNTIES ALLOW 'OVER 55' TAX TRANSFERS;  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 90: SOME OF STATE'S MOST POPULAR RETIREMENT AREAS HAVE VOTED NOT TO  ACCEPT INTER-COUNTY TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY TAX VALUES FOR HOMEOWNERS 55 OR  OLDER.  </P> <P> Twelve of California's 58 counties have implemented the provisions of  Proposition 90, that allow inter-county transfers of Proposition 13 base-year  property tax values for homeowners 55 or older.  </P> <P> Twenty-two counties -- including such popular retirement destinations as San  Luis Obispo, Placer and Nevada -- have voted not to accept such values, which  preserve Proposition 13 tax savings for those who owned houses at the time the  property tax limiting measure was approved by the electorate more than a decade  ago.  </P> <P> The remaining 24 counties -- including San Francisco -- have neither  implemented Proposition 90 nor rejected its implementation, according to a  Sacramento spokesman for the measure's author, Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long  Beach). There is no time limit on implementing the measure, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Approved by the state's voters in November, 1988, Proposition 90 was written so  that it allowed county supervisors the options of accepting inter-county  transfers, rejecting them or taking no action, according to the local  government relations committee of the California Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> Proposition 60, approved by the voters in November, 1986, allows homeowners 55  or older to transfer the Proposition 13 base-year value of their principal  dwelling to a replacement dwelling, provided that their new house is located in  the same county and was of equal or less value than their former residence,  according to a committee spokesman.  </P> <P> "Equal or lesser value" means that the cost of the replacement home cannot  exceed 105% of the sales price of the old home, or 110% if purchased or built  within two years of the sale of the old home, the CAR spokesman added.  </P> <P> In order to qualify for an inter-county base-year transfer, the replacement  dwelling must have been purchased on or after the specific date which the  receiving county has designated as the effective date for that county.  </P> <P> The first table consists of counties, listed alphabetically, that will accept  inter-county transfers on or after the effective date listed. The second table  lists the counties that have decided not to accept inter-county transfers.  </P> <P> COUNTIES IMPLEMENTING PROP. 90  </P> <P> County:Effective Date  </P> <P> Alameda:7/14/89  </P> <P> Contra Costa:5/19/89  </P> <P> Inyo:8/11/89  </P> <P> Kern:2/2/89  </P> <P> Los Angeles:4/29/89  </P> <P> Marin:3/30/89  </P> <P> Modoc:7/19/89  </P> <P> Orange:3/16/89  </P> <P> Riverside:4/6/89  </P> <P> San Diego:2/14/89  </P> <P> San Mateo:2/16/89  </P> <P> Santa Clara:7/7/89  </P> <P> Source: California Assn. of Realtors, Assemblyman Dave Elder  </P> <P> COUNTIES THAT HAVE REJECTED PROP. 90  </P> <P> Butte  </P> <P> Eldorado  </P> <P> Fresno  </P> <P> Madera  </P> <P> Mendocino  </P> <P> Mono  </P> <P> Monterey  </P> <P> Napa  </P> <P> Nevada  </P> <P> Placer  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P> <P> San Benito  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> Santa Cruz  </P> <P> Solano  </P> <P> Sonoma  </P> <P> Stanislaus  </P> <P> Tulare  </P> <P> Ventura  </P> <P> Yolo  </P> <P> Source: California Assn. of Realtors, Assemblyman Dave Elder  </P></p>

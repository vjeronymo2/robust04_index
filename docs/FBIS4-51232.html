			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Aiming to further  strengthen trade and economic ties with Central and South  American countries, the government has decided to send a trade  delegation to the region to look into investment opportunities,  ranking officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said  Wednesday [25 May].    The announcement came following a Tuesday public hearing  called by legislator Cheng Chien-jen, in which several Central  and South American ambassadors called on the government to  encourage more local investment in their countries as the best  way to promote bilateral ties.    Ambassadors from El Salvador, Paraguay and the Dominican  Republic said that although the performance of the Republic of  China's [ROC] agricutural and fishery missions stationed in  Central and South America have won high praise there, countries  in the region need more foreign investment to boost and upgrade  their economies.    They also advised the ROC to act to counter the diplomatic  offensive launched by Mainland China to develop links with those  Central and South American countries with which the ROC  maintains formal ties.    Ministry officials said the government would continue to do  its best to stimulate more private-sector investment in the  region, particularly in those countries that are friendly to the  ROC.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhong He: "New Laws Regulate Religions"] </F>   [Text] A seminar last week praised two new laws as  important steps to set up a framework to govern religion.    Speakers at the meeting, sponsored by the State Council  Religious Affairs Office and Legal Daily, saluted the  Regulations for Management of Religious Sites and Regulations  for the Management of Religious Activities of Aliens in the  Territory of the People's Republic of China, signed by Premier  Li Peng on January 31.    They said the laws demonstrate China's respect for the  religious freedom of foreigners.    The rules guarantee foreigners the right to participate in  religious activities and meet with Chinese religious personnel.  But they also stipulate that foreigners should not interfere  with Chinese religious groups or affairs.    Zhao Puchu, chairman of the China Buddhist Association, said  authorities constantly solicited opinions from religious  associations while drafting the regulations. He also urged the  State Council to speed up drafting its basic law on religion.    The first article of the law on religious sites protects  holy  activities and spiritual areas, Zhao said.    Ding Guangxun, chairman of the China Christian Council, said  the two laws will not cause any big changes in religious  practice.    "They will not affect religion, for they add nothing new nor  detract from anything we now have," he said.    "Foreigners must not recruit religious followers, appoint  religious teachers, or conduct any other proselytizing  activities among the Chinese people," Ding said quoting the  eighth article of the law.    But, he added, Christians may continue to go to Chinese  churches and lectures and exchange ideas.    Ding stressed the two laws must be translated properly to  avoid misunderstandings.    Zhang Jiyu, deputy secretary-general of the China Taoist  Association, said he hoped the laws will help prevent some local  governments from infringing upon the rights of Taoist temples.    Shu Huaide, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic  Association, said the regulations will ensure the integrity of  the church and promote understanding between believers and  others.    Zhang Shengzuo, director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs,  urged government officials and religious leaders to study the  laws.    Those attending the meeting also offered suggestions on how  to implement them.    Zhao Puchu said officials should carefully register  religious  sites. The government, he said, should not only register  authorized temples, but also those where monks and nuns live and  hold regular religious services.    Furthermore, authorities should clearly define what is  considered "other religious activities" in the eighth article of  the law pertaining to foreigners, he added.    An Shiwei, chairman of the China Islamic Association,  pointed  out that several mosques have been moved in the past 10 years  during urban reconstruction.    "We should make sure that their property rights are not  violated." he said.    China has 16 million Muslims, 6.5 million Protestants, 3.8  million Catholics and 6 million Tibetan Buddhists. More than  60.000 religious sites have been approved.    China also has 200,000 clergymen and 47 colleges for  religious studies.</p>

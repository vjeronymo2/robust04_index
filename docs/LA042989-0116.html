			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW TURNS GRAFFITI INTO ART, MOVES INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE IN SUNSET  </P> <P> As a motivator, Ocean View baseball coach Steve Barrett displays ingenuity and  resourcefulness. His job necessitates it.  </P> <P> But for Friday's Sunset League game against Fountain Valley, Barrett called  upon an unusual source. He drew from the markings of a graffiti artist that  appeared overnight on the Seahawks' right-field fence and third base dugout.  </P> <P> And the Seahawks responded by defeating the Barons, 13-2, to earn a share of  first place in the Sunset League standings. That victory, along with a victory  by Westminister Friday, created a three-way tie for first place: Ocean View,  Fountain Valley and Westminister are all 7-4.  </P> <P> That Friday's game was for a share of first was probably enough to challenge  even non-title contenders. But Barrett milked the markings for all they were  worth.  </P> <P> "It's what everyone at school was talking about," Barrett said of the graffiti  that proclaimed Fountain Valley the Sunset champs and made other derogatory  statements about Ocean View.  </P> <P> "I just used it to fire the guys up. I think we brought that emotion out here  today. They took it kind of personally."  </P> <P> Whether as a response to the drawings or to a big-game challenge, the Seahawks  outpouring of offense resulted in a 10-1 lead after three innings and helped  extend the Seahawks modest winning streak to three games. In all they collected  16 hits, fueling starting pitcher Randy Karliner's second victory over the  Barons.  </P> <P> Karliner, who improved his record to 7-1 and was credited with Ocean View's  only other victory over the Barons this season, allowed six hits over six  innings. Brent Wilken earned the save for Ocean View, which improved its season  record to 15-7.  </P> <P> "It (the graffiti) caught everyone by surprise," Karliner said. "We didn't  think anyone would do that. But you can't point the finger at anyone. A bum  could have done it."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Coach Ron La Ruffa, who said he learned of the incident on the  way over to Ocean View, indicated he didn't know if any of his players were  involved.  </P> <P> Barrett said he didn't know whom to credit or blame for the graffiti. But when  asked what he will use for Tuesday's game with Westminister, he deadpanned,  "I'm wondering that myself. We can't play much better."  </P> <P> In the Empire League:  </P> <P> Katella 3, Esperanza 2 (11 innings) -- Katella's Billy Fitzgerald scored the  winning run from second base in the bottom of the 11th inning on a strikeout  when the pitch got past visiting Esperanza catcher Keith McDonald at Boysen  Park.  </P> <P> McDonald, believing batter Chris Marquez had fouled off the pitch, failed to  chase the ball immediately, allowing Fitzgerald to score.  </P> <P> Both umpires ruled Marquez had not made contact with the ball. Fitzgerald had  reached base on an throwing error by shortstop Jason Bates, the only error in  the game. Esperanza led, 2-0, going into sixth on single runs in the fourth and  sixth, both coming on sacrifice flies. Katella (13-8, 7-4) tied it on a  bases-loaded walk and a wild pitch.

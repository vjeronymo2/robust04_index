			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "So That Christopher's Mission Will Succeed"] </F>   [Text] Once again U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher returned to the region yesterday on the limited  mission of invigorating the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track.  He is bringing with him the Israeli Government's answers to a  number of questions posed by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad  during his last meeting with the U.S. secretary, in preparation  for the resumption of the bilateral talks. No date has yet been  set for holding these talks in Washington because of the  fundamental differences that continue to separate the Syrian and  Israeli positions.    Certainly, the progress achieved so far has been too little  and too slow. Syrian-Israeli differences revolve around the  principle of implementing international resolutions, especially  with regard to Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Golan  Heights in accordance with Security Council Resolution 242. So  far Israel has refused to do so and has added a number of  preconditions to any partial withdrawal to which it will agree.  It is also evident that past U.S. efforts, including the  shuttle trips by former Secretary of State James Baker and  Secretary Christopher, have failed to bridge the existing major  gap and, consequently, failed to give impetus to the  Syrian-Israeli negotiating track.    Naturally, creating such an impetus and emerging from the  stalemate require serious U.S. positions that press for  implementing international resolutions, particularly Resolution  242. Hence, talk about gradual and partial withdrawals from  occupied Syrian lands without knowing the extent of Israeli  commitment to full withdrawal, and a demand for full peaceful  relations with a prior commitment to this, do not conform with  the stated aims of the peace process and flagrantly contradict  the required trust for peacemaking.    In short, so that the U.S. secretary of state's upcoming  tour  of the region will not be similar to the previous ones, what is  required today is more than the idea of partial withdrawal and  is confined to clear Israeli respect for the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the commitment to implement them.  This will open the way to invigorating the talks. Such a  development requires a real and serious effort by the U.S.  secretary during his talks in Israel rather than in Damascus.  Otherwise, the entire peace process will remain at a standstill  despite the limited achievements made so far.</p>

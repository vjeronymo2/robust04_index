			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing As has become the tradition of the season, forecasts abound about the housing market. Some estimates suggest prices in prime areas of London may rise by 25 per cent next year. Other predictions point to double-digit growth. In relative terms, houses are more affordable than for decades. The average house price to earnings ratio is at the lower end of its historical range. Interest rates could fall further while unemployment is drifting downwards. That will reinforce the confidence of prospective buyers with the demographic squeeze doing the rest. But that is perhaps to underestimate the pressure on real incomes that Mr Kenneth Clarke has administered in his Budget. Earnings inflation cannot be counted upon to stimulate the market as it has in the past. Prices have stopped falling and are starting to edge upwards. But negative equity, higher deposits and the greater scrutiny of lending will keep the speed of recovery in check. A recent study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimated that 26 per cent of the homes bought between 1988 and 1991 were worth less than the mortgages used to buy them. The Halifax survey predicting a 15 per cent increase in volume but only a 5 per cent increase in price seems the most plausible estimate.</p>

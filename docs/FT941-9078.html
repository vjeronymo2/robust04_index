			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Assembling an entertainment monster - Blockbuster investors hold the key to the success of the Viacom-Paramount merger After all the fighting, was it worth it? The merger of Viacom, Paramount Communications and - provided it goes ahead - Blockbuster Entertainment will create a monster in the entertainment industry. However, digesting the beast poses significant financial and management challenges. Viacom's management, having just fought a five-month war for control of Paramount, must now gird itself for the struggle to persuade Blockbuster shareholders to join the group. On paper, although the Paramount takeover involves more than Dollars 5bn of new debt, the financial structure created by a three-way merger would be more robust than many of the debt-financed takeovers of the 1980s. The combined group would have total debts of around Dollars 10bn. Analysts put the costs of paying interest and servicing preference share capital at around Dollars 600m, although Mr Frank Biondi, Viacom chief executive, says it will be closer to Dollars 500m-Dollars 550m after the group has refinanced some of its existing debt. The cashflow generated by its combined operations is variously estimated at between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn a year - a comfortable multiple of the group's annual debt servicing costs. Without Blockbuster, though, this debt burden would look much more onerous. Whatever strategic arguments were made for its inclusion, the video rental group was brought into the merger mainly to provide an extra cushion of financial stability. It has only some Dollars 500m of debt, and would provide around a third of the combined group's operating cashflow. Blockbuster shareholders may yet reject the deal, which comes up for approval in the second quarter of the year. They have been offered mainly Viacom class B non-voting shares, a currency which is also being used to finance a large part of the Paramount bid. These shares have plummeted in recent weeks, touching Dollars 28 yesterday, down from a high of over Dollars 60 last summer. Blockbuster has already agreed to pay Dollars 55 each for a large block of these shares, providing Dollars 1.25bn to back Viacom's bid for Paramount. To ease concerns about the value of its B shares, Viacom has offered a degree of underpinning for both the Paramount and Blockbuster bids. Under these so-called contingent value rights, it would issue extra securities to Paramount and Blockbuster shareholders if the B shares remained at a depressed level. However, the extent of the underpinning is limited in both cases. It would also involve the issue of even more B shares, further reducing their value. These considerations have depressed Blockbuster's own share price. If the video rental chain's shareholders now reject the deal, it will leave the merged Viacom/Paramount with considerably less financial flexibility to invest in future development than Mr Redstone had planned. The extended slide in Viacom's B shares, although exacerbated by the prospect of more shares being issued under the contingent value rights, has been driven mainly by a concern that Paramount will dilute Viacom's earnings. Both Viacom and Blockbuster have been rated high-growth companies by the stock market, and traded at multiples of around 16 and 14 times cashflow respectively last summer. Paramount, by contrast, was accorded a rating of 10 times cashflow before the bidding war started, marking a belief that it remains a company with low growth prospects. If the combined group trades at the same valuation level as Time Warner and Walt Disney - the two entertainment groups to which it is most similar - it would carry a multiple of around 11.5, according to analysts at S. G. Warburg. The main loser so far has been Mr Redstone. With around three-quarters of the Viacom B shares currently in issue, he has seen the paper value of his investments slashed in recent months. Mr Redstone also owns some 85 per cent of Viacom's class A voting shares, which have seen their market value tumble to Dollars 34 1/8 from Dollars 67 1/2 . He remains under investigation by securities regulators, who are examining purchases of Viacom shares he made before the Paramount bid was announced, helping to raise the paper value of the offer last September. If Viacom is to reverse the slide in its shares, it must first convince investors that the new group will be more than the sum of its parts. Wall Street remains sceptical about the scope for cutting costs and increasing revenues. According to Mr Biondi, cost cutting will come mainly from reducing corporate overheads and combining the three companies' television and movie production groups: Viacom Entertainment, Paramount Picture and Paramount TV, and two film studies controlled by Blockbuster, Spelling and Republic. Combining these operations should reduce overheads on the production side. Also, it will make the group the biggest buyer of film rights in the entertainment industry, at Dollars 2bn a year, and one of the biggest media buyers - both areas where the group could use its muscle to pressure suppliers into offering discounts, according to Mr Biondi. In terms of growing revenues, Viacom points to three main areas. First, it intends to grow as a producer, publisher and distributor of CD-ROM products, mainly computer games. Second, it has targeted growth in its cable network operations around the world - although there are only limited prospects for growth in the US. And third, it plans to move into merchandising, emulating the stores run by rivals Walt Disney and Warner Brothers. Viacom hopes Blockbuster's experience in managing a large retail network will help it in this regard. There could also be opportunities for cross-promotion of products within the group. For instance, Blockbuster's chain of music retailers in the US - claimed to be the country's largest - could benefit from Viacom's ownership of the popular MTV music video station. Nickelodeon, a cable-TV station popular with children, could be used to promote Blockbuster's Discovery Zone entertainment centres. Meanwhile, the three-way deal, if consummated, could lead to considerable jostling for position among executives from the three companies, raising questions about how quickly the benefits of a merger can be achieved. Executives from Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster would find themselves rubbing shoulders with Nynex, the telephone company which itself backed Viacom's Paramount bid with over Dollars 1bn. Mr Redstone, with a majority of the voting stock, would be securely established at the head of the group. It is a remarkable rise: just seven years ago, at the age of 63, Mr Redstone was launching the bid for Viacom which would first take him out of movie theatres and into cable television. If the second stage of his plan - to acquire Blockbuster - goes ahead, he will end up owning over 20 per cent of the new colossus and controlling some 61 per cent of its voting shares. But what of the others? Mr Biondi has been pencilled in as chief executive of the group. Mr Wayne Huizenga, the former waste management baron who built Blockbuster into the world's biggest video rental company, would become a deputy chairman. Paramount executives have yet to be offered any seats around the table.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       THE BATTLE FOR PARAMOUNT  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 12 Viacom announces dollars 8.2bn agreed cash-and-shares offer         for Paramount Sept 20 QVC launches hostile dollars9.5bn counter-offer Sept 29 Blockbuster agrees to invest dollars         600m in Viacom to back its bid Oct 4   Viacom gets a further dollars1.2bn, this time from Nynex Oct 7   QVC announces financing for its bid: dollars         500m each from Comcast and         Liberty Media, and dollars3bn from banks Oct 17  Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications agree to invest         dollars 500m each in QVC, if Paramount bid succeeds Oct 21  QVC launches cash tender for 51 per cent of Paramount, and         launches legal challenge to friendly merger agreement with         Viacom Oct 24  Viacom matches QVC's partial cash tender offer Nov 11  BellSouth agrees to invest dollars1.5bn in QVC, if it acquires         Paramount Nov 24  Delaware chancery court blocks Paramount/Viacom agreement,         says Paramount has not given adequate consideration to QVC bid Dec 9   Delaware Supreme Court backs lower court ruling Dec 14  Prompted by the courts, Paramount drops its poison pill         arrangements and announces formal auction of company to highest         bidder Dec 20  Viacom and QVC submit new bids Dec 22  Paramount board backs revised QVC bid, worth dollars10bn Jan 7   Viacom announces dollars 8.4bn merger with Blockbuster, which         is to put dollars1.25bn behind a higher cash element in its         offer for Paramount.

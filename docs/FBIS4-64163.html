			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 27 May -- "The purpose of my visit to  Tajikistan is to have talks with the republican leadership on  further steps by the UN with regard to participating in finding  a settlement to the inter-Tajik conflict," Marrack Goulding, UN  under secretary general for political questions, told a group of  Russian correspondents on arrival in Dushanbe. The second round  of inter- Tajik talks, he said, is due to take place in Tehran  on 7 June.    Asked by a correspondent if the question on enhancing the  status of the Dushanbe official delegation at the talks would be  raised during the meetings, Marrack Goulding stressed that he  would not like to go into details at this moment. He promised  to speak in detail about the results of his meetings with the  Tajik leadership, including his meeting with Emomali Rahmonov,  at a news conference.    Marrack Goulding reaffirmed that he is bringing with him a  note from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for Emomali  Rahmonov, chairman of the Tajik Supreme Soviet. However, he  said, he would not wish to reveal the contents of this note just  now.    A meeting will take place today between Marrack Goulding and  Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov, Labor and Employment  Minister Shukur Zukhurov, and Security Minister Said Amir  Zukhurov. During his visit the UN under secretary general will  be received by Tajik Premier Abdulmadjid Samadov.</p>

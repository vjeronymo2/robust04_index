			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE IS THE JUSTICE IN RENT CONTROL LAW?  </P> <P> In Poland almost 50 years ago, they put me in a concentration camp, took away  my property and created a government where justice was denied to me because I  was a minority and easily exploited.  </P> <P> My neighbors all said: "This is wrong, but what can we do? It's the law."  </P> <P> So, I came to America to live where the Constitution says that government is  not able to take away the rights and property of a minority in order to satisfy  political lusts. I started with nothing, worked hard, saved and 20 years ago  bought property on Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> But in Santa Monica, I am again a minority -- a landlord, and the power-hungry  government has bought the majority tenant vote by forcing me and others to keep  our rents ridiculously low. This city says it's legal for a majority to vote  themselves a monetary benefit at the sole expense of the minority. Think about  that, how could that be constitutional?  </P> <P> Here in Santa Monica for 10 years, the local government has used legions of  lawyers and endless complex and costly maneuvers to effectively take my  property away. This city has prevented me and other landlords from using our  own land or from getting out of the rental business unless we pay huge fees  that are almost as much as the value of the land itself. In other words, in  Santa Monica as a landlord, I am a slave -- forced to work against my will  unless I buy my freedom at the expense of losing much of what I worked for.  Some choice.  </P> <P> This city won't let me and others just get out of the business of subsidizing  rents for tenants who "enjoy" radical rent control, even though many of those  tenants are rich. This city's rent board continues to expand its budgets, its  number of lawyers and its disregard for constitutional rights. This city's  political leaders find it profitable to exploit and take away the rights and  property of a minority to gain political power. My neighbors all say: "This is  wrong, but what can we do? It's the law."  </P> <P> In 50 years, nothing has changed.  </P> <P> The rent control people fear that if we landlords should win our fight for  justice . . . then their base of power would crumble. I am not trying to end  rent control, I just want my constitutional rights restored and (to) end this  legal blackmail scheme.  </P> <P> Those outside this city who have the power to bring justice here find it  politically unpopular to help landlords. It is also very profitable for many  people to keep landlords struggling forever against this legal stalling  process.  </P> <P> Where is the true light of freedom I sought so long ago? Where is the true  meaning of this country's Constitution I once admired? Where is the "justice  for all" I sought in America? It's been hidden by legal gobbledygook and  political lusts.  </P> <P> In 50 years, nothing has changed, and now, as it was then, it is beneficial for  the majority to just look the other way and pretend this injustice doesn't  exist.  </P> <P> HENRY YARMARK  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

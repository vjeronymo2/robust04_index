Several commenters opposing an increase in the threshold pointed to an August 1992 study by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) entitled Report to Congress: De Minimis Levels for Commercial Real Estate Appraisals. The OMB study did not oppose an increase in the threshold level but instead stated, ``OMB does not recommend_at this time_a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> level higher than $100,000.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' OMB study at i. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies believe that the major concerns identified by the OMB in urging delay have been addressed with the passage of time. Most importantly, each of the agencies now has an additional year's experience with the $100,000 threshold. Furthermore, OMB noted that FIRREA's appraisal requirements had not been implemented in all states, but such implementation has now occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking Process. Several commenters stated that the agencies had failed to justify increasing the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 because the agencies had not produced a definitive study showing that doing so would not increase loss rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress granted the agencies explicit authority to establish a threshold consistent with safety and soundness. The delegation of authority was broad, and no requirement for quantitative analysis was included. Nor is it reasonably feasible for the agencies to conduct a definitive quantitative analysis that isolates the effect of obtaining Title XI appraisals on institutions' losses on real estate-secured loans given the many variables, including changing market conditions and varying loan underwriting practices, that may affect institutions' ultimate loss experience. For the same reason, the agencies did not conduct a random sampling of the experience of financial institutions, as suggested by one commenter. This does not mean, however, that the final rule fails to rely on objective data. Moreover, that data was analyzed in light of the agencies' experience and expertise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of this rulemaking, the agencies reviewed the data the agencies currently collect from financial institutions and sought out data that would enable the agencies to analyze the effect of the threshold on regulated institutions. Consistent with statutory requirements, the agencies have carefully considered the effect of raising the threshold and determined that a $250,000 threshold level does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions based on the agencies' judgment, expertise, and experience. In making this determination, the agencies have, as described above, analyzed the available data, the comments received during the rulemaking, and relevant work of other governmental agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appraiser Employment. Many commenters from the appraisal industry objected to the proposed increase in the threshold on the grounds that it would decrease their business and employment in the appraisal industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that an appraisal is not required because the transaction falls below $250,000, the appraisal regulation nonetheless requires that an evaluation of the property be conducted. The agencies' appraisal rules do not impede licensed and certified appraisers from performing these evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAO Study. Several commenters suggested that the agencies delay action on any rulemaking pending completion of General Accounting Office (GAO) studies of the threshold scheduled for completion in April 1994 and October 1995. Congress delegated authority to the agencies to establish a threshold in the same legislation that directed the GAO to conduct two studies of the appraisal threshold. Congress clearly did not require the agencies to withhold action on the threshold pending completion of the GAO studies; nor did it make agency action contingent on the outcome of the GAO studies or any other studies. Also, in the Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability issued March 10, 1993, the agencies identified a need to reexamine their existing appraisal rules to make certain that thresholds below which formal appraisals are not needed are reasonable. Therefore, the agencies believe that it is appropriate to proceed with the rulemaking. The agencies are cooperating with the GAO by providing information that it may use in preparing its studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Rolls-Royce rejects millions to keep its last Phantom ROLLS-ROYCE Motors has turned down offers 'running into several million pounds' so that it can keep the last Phantom VI it has produced, the company announced yesterday. As the Phantom (pictured left) was displayed in London, Mr Mike Donovan, Rolls-Royce commercial managing director, said: 'Phantoms can cost anything from Pounds 300,000 upwards. We have had offers running into several millions for this one. It is virtually impossible to put a price on it as it's the very last.' Because of new safety and exhaust emission rules Rolls-Royce has decided that the 6,749th Phantom produced since the model's debut in 1925 will be the last. The company has also moved much of the work at its Mulliner Park Ward coachbuilding plant at Willesden, north London, where the Phantom was the last vehicle made, to its main factory at Crewe. Phantom limousines were notable for their time-consuming hand-built construction. It could take 300 hours to make the cocktail cabinet alone. One of the Phantom's successors, the Crewe-built Silver Spur touring limousine, is pictured on the right.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK HOSPITAL REJECTS MERGER WITH ST. JOSEPH'S OWNERS  </P> <P> Burbank Community Hospital has decided not to pursue a proposal to merge with  the hospital chain that owns St. Joseph Medical Center because such a merger  would probably result in the 103-bed facility being converted into a nursing  home, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Burbank Community Hospital's foundation, composed of 48 doctors and 10  administrators, voted secretly during a closed meeting Wednesday night not to  pursue the merger, said William Daniel, hospital director.  </P> <P> The reason, Daniel said, was because the Sisters of Providence, a nonprofit  foundation that owns the 450-bed St. Joseph Medical Center, would not guarantee  that Burbank Community would continue to operate as a hospital.  </P> <P> "They basically said there was not a need for two general service hospitals in  the area," Daniel said. "They wanted to use the hospital for alternate  health-care purposes."  </P> <P> Dr. Bettina Kurowski, associate administrator for planning at St. Joseph, said  that had a merger occurred, the Sisters of Providence would probably have  turned Burbank Community into a nursing home or hospice.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make sense to run another hospital," Kurowski said. "All you have  to do is look around the Valley to see that there are far more hospital beds  than we need."  </P> <P> Both hospitals have experienced a significant drop in patients over the last  few years, due in part to an increase in outpatient services, officials said.  </P> <P> Burbank Community lost more than $1.3 million last year and is expected to lose  $1 million this year, posing a serious threat to the hospital's future,  officials said.  </P> <P> Daniel said Burbank Community's foundation will explore other alternatives to  keep the hospital going, including seeking another partner.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of other hospital chains around," Daniel said. "Right now,  we're trying to determine the best course to take. . . . I'm convinced that  we've got a place here in Burbank."  </P></p>

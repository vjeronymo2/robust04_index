			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has expressed satisfaction on  his visit to the United States. Addressing a news conference in  Washington D.C., Mr. Narasimha Rao said though essentially a  goodwill mission, the visit has both political and economic  content. His discussions with President Clinton had convinced  him that India and the United States can develop bilateral  relationship of maturity and strength. It can contribute not  only to mutual good but also to the world as a whole. His  current visit has helped towards developing better understanding  between the two countries, Mr. Rao observed.</p>

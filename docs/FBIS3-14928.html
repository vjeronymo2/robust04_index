			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Viktor Ilyukhin, Security Committee Chairman of the  State Duma, thinks that the president's decree dismissing  Nikolay Golushko from his position as head of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) "has nothing to do with the  State Duma's ruling on political amnesty or its materialization."    Ilyukhin found "it difficult to understand from the oblique  formulations of the decree what caused the dismissal of the FCIS  director general." He assumed that the real cause were the last  September and October events when the former Security Ministry  "showed adherence to the Constitution and doubted the  constitutionality of the presidential decree 1400 of September  21."    Ilyukhin thought that this was also the reason why a  decision  was made last December to dismantle the ministry and transform  it into the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- with much  smaller powers.    The dismissal of Golushko might displease the FCIS  personnel.  "It is the president's usual technique, to have an agency  dismantled by somebody he does not like and then dismiss him."</p>

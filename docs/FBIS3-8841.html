			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 17 March press review] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, March 17 (BTA) -- Today's DUMA and  DEMOKRATSIYA, the dailies of the two major political forces in  Bulgaria, lead with articles commenting on the possible  consequences of Prime Minister Berov's illness for the  government and the state. Last Friday [11 March] Prime Minister  Berov underwent a quadruple bypass operation. In the absence of  the prime minister parliament cannot exercise its right of  control over the executive because under the Constitution the  prime minister is solely responsible for his cabinet's policy,  DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS),  writes. The bill moved by National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov for amending the Constitution envisages a possibility  for one quarter or more of the MP's to move for an early  dissolution of parliament when parliament is unable to exercise  control over the government. The Constitution provides for a  dissolution of parliament only when it fails to form a cabinet.  The bill adds to the characteristic features of the state as a  parliamentary republic, DEMOKRATSIYA writes, expressing the  belief that it would be realistic and sensible for the majority  in parliament to support such a change in the Constitution.    In its leader the socialist DUMA writes that President  Zhelyu  Zhelev invited former Foreign Minister Stoyan Ganev to head a  caretaker cabinet, citing no source. According to this daily,  the two of them met in Paris last week when the head of state  paid a three-day visit to the French capital to attend the  UNESCO commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the rescue of  the Bulgarian Jews. It is hardly probable that the president's  busy schedule would have allowed for such a meeting to happen,  presidential spokesman Valentin Stoyanov told DUMA. After this  possible meeting, however, the president "started a shuttle for  recruiting candidate caretaker ministers", DUMA writes citing  unnamed reliable sources. The frequently mentioned as candidate  prime minister Dimitur Ludzhev (former deputy prime minister and  present leader of the New Policy Centre centrist formation) is  no longer a favourite of the president's because of his strong  ties with Bulgarian and foreign business circles", DUMA writes.    "Academician Blagovest Sendov Is Ready To Form a Cabinet",  reads the headline of the leader in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK today.  KONTINENT runs similar information. After his meeting yesterday  [16 March] with the leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for  Rights and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan, the academician, who was  deputy in the Grand National Assembly, said that he is ready to  take the post of prime minister should the political forces  desire this.

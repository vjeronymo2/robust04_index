			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Union votes to keep political fund THE 22,000-strong Society of Telecom Executives voted by a majority of 73 per cent to retain its political fund with about 50 per cent of the members voting in a postal ballot. It was the first union to hold such a ballot under the government's 10-year rule. Unlike most unions with political funds, the STE is not affiliated to the Labour party but union leaders argued it was important to have a fund to intervene effectively in political debate.</p>

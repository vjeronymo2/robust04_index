			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Shoji Shinohara] </F>   [Text] The meeting of finance ministers and central bank  presidents of the seven major nations (G-7) closed with a  chairman's declaration of cooperation on macroeconomic policies  such as reaffirmation of cooperation concerning the  stabilization of foreign currency exchange rates. In actuality,  it appears to have become a unification of purpose to suppress  discontent by various nations against other nations and to  temporarily calm unstable movements in the markets which were a  threat to the recovery of the world economy. As a result, an  ironic outcome has been the postponement of action on almost all  of the difficult issues such as unemployment and economic  problems confronting Japan and the United States which are the  major destabilizing factors of markets, making the real effects  of the agreement an unknown quality.    Before the opening of the G-7 meetings, a high-ranking  Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said, "The principal role  player in the upcoming G-7 is neither Japan nor the United  States, but the market itself."    The recent G-7 meetings were held just as the economies of  the advanced nations were being violently shaken by fluctuations  in the foreign exchange and debenture markets. The chairman's  declaration read by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen warned  against excessive reactions of foreign exchange and debenture  markets and had the strong effect of serving as a message to  market sources.    G-7 meetings in the past debated individual issues such as  Japan's trade surpluses and the U.S. fiscal deficits and had the  strong purpose of questioning the macroeconomic policies of the  respective nations. However, insofar as the recent chairman's  declaration is concerned, it stated, "The slow growth in certain  nations has delayed the correction of international payments  imbalances," thus suggesting domestic expansion of economic  activity in Japan, but no signs of centering criticism on  individual nations relative to separate issues.    Foreign exchange rates which are leaning towards a high yen  and low dollar have had an adverse effect on Japanese export  firms and run the risk of delaying Japan's economic recovery.  Even for the United States, a cheap dollar will cause a rise in  long-term interest rates and will expose the economy to an  unfavorable trend.    A rise in long-term U.S. interest rates will not only  frustrate an economic recovery, but will have an adverse effect  on efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. And the impact will not be  limited to those two phenomena. Sources at the International  Financial Survey Department of the Industrial Bank of Japan  state, "As concerns financial markets, especially relative to  long-term interest rates, international linkage has been  reinforced rather than providing for decoupling (separation of  markets)." There's also the risk that higher interest rates in  the United States will destroy the effects of financial easing  measures in Germany.    It was once considered a priority issue for the G-7 to take  some kind of action against financial market turbulence of this  nature. As an example, if friction between Japan and the United  States on trade issues were to once again surface at the G-7  meetings, there is the possibility that the yen would climb even  further. In the recent G-7 meetings, it appears it was a common  perception among the G-7 nations that they wished to avoid to  the degree possible any situation which could result in the  exchange of criticism on individual issues.    Needless to say, even though an agreement had been reached  on  stablizing foreign exchange and debenture markets, there is no  guarantee that financial markets would react as anticipated by  the governments of the respective nations.    In fact, the Tokyo foreign exchange markets on the 25th had  already taken into account the G-7 agreement on stabilizing  foreign exchange markets and assumed no agreement had been  reached on policies for renewed cooperative intervention and  shifted to a higher yen and cheaper dollar. MOF sources in Japan  which had found some solace in the inclusion of foreign exchange  stabilization provisions in the chairman's declaration found  their hopes for stability crushed at an early stage.    We cannot say that there are no concrete effects because it  was an agreement of a superficial nature. If the dollar falls to  100 yen in foreign currency markets, there is the possibility of  intervention not only by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) but by European  and U.S. authorities as well. Even BOJ officials insist that "we  should take an objective stand relative to the chairman's  declaration on foreign exchange markets," and suggest that the  respective nations will react to any sharp rise in the yen.    Any effort to put the advanced nations' economies back on  the  track of stable growth will require that importance be placed on  the early execution of the the G-7 "growth strategy" calling for  the United States to reduce its fiscal deficit, for European  nations to continue their policy of monetary easing and for  Japan to expand domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus.    However, there are many pending issues, such as medical  insurance reform in the United States as it affects U.S. fiscal  policy and an expansion in the money supply in the area of  German financial policy.    In Japan, political turmoil has had an effect in delaying  the  implementation of economic measures and the tax reduction  extension past the next fiscal year as revealed to the United  States by Minister of Finance Fujii awaits coordination within  the coalition government relative to how long it will remain in  force before implmentation of provisions for offsetting tax  increases as well as the scope of the tax reductions.    Among G-7 nations, there lay a pile of issues, such as  between Japan and the United States as to when talks will be  resumed on the comprehensive economic measures. Even in  connection with the issue of unemployment in advanced nations  which was mentioned at the recent meetings, no concrete  proposals were discussed and the issue was carried over for  discussion at the upcoming Naples summit of leaders of advanced  nations in July.    The policy coordination position reflected in the recent G-7  chairman's declaration represented a unified position hurriedly  established in the face of financial market threats, and any  mistake by advanced nations in handling their roles could lead  to a violent reaction from financial markets.</p>

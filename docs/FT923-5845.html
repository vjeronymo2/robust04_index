			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Poll tax hits vote registration EVIDENCE that the poll tax caused fewer people to register as voters is shown in a survey published yesterday. The survey, by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys for the Home Office, found that the percentage of households returning a form for the 1991 electoral register was lower than in any of the previous annual surveys. The forms would have been sent out in early autumn 1990, shortly after the introduction of the poll tax. Just over half the councils in England and Wales received a completed form from at least 95 per cent of households. The response rate for a quarter of the councils was less than 90 per cent, and less than 80 per cent for one in 11. These figures reverse the improvement in response rates recorded since the survey began in 1987. The biggest fall was recorded in London - where poll-tax rates were among the highest - with the average response rate at 89 per cent, 3 per cent down from 1990. About half of local authorities now leave the names of voters who registered in earlier years on the register for up to three years, even if no registration form is returned. More than half the authorities used the poll-tax register to add names to the electoral register. More than 90 per cent of councils believe their poll-tax backlogs will not have a significant impact on their implementing the council tax, according to a report by consultants CSL services for the Department of the Environment.

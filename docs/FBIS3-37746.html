In  a statement on 16 February, the Armenian Foreign Ministry  officially admitted that eight Azerbaijani prisoners were shot  and killed while attempting to escape. The ministry also said  that the Armenian Defense Ministry was investigating the  incident in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and that the  International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] representative  in Yerevan had been informed of the situation.    The world condemned the criminal practice of establishing  camps for POW's long ago. The Geneva Conventions adopted in  1949 called for the safety of war victims. Those Conventions  banned the inhuman treatment of POW's.    Armenia's criminal action not only grossly conflicted with  the Conventions but also openly violated the accepted norms of  morality and international law. The Azerbaijani prisoners were  shot after Azerbaijan revealed that it was prepared to  unconditionally exchange all the hostages and POW's.    Azerbaijan's government organs have unilaterally released  over 100 Armenian POW's since August 1993 and, in accordance  with its signing of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Azerbaijan has  revealed that it condemns the taking of hostages by any side  during the military operations. Azerbaijan's ruling organs  repeatedly appealed to their counterparts in Armenia to maintain  a similar approach to the issue of the Azerbaijani hostages and  POW's. But the Republic's appeals failed to yield a result.    The mistreatment of the innocent war victims reconfirms  Armenia's involvement in the war against Azerbaijan. Otherwise,  why should POW camps be established near Gumry, Spitak,  Echmiadzin, and Gugark in Armenia? Over 3,500 people are  imprisoned in them, most of them children, women, and elderly  people.    The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry expresses indignation over  the Armenian ruling organs' fearless activities and describes  them as inhuman. It calls on the international community, the  ICRC, and other international and humanitarian organizations to  investigate all the aspects of Armenia's criminal action.</p>

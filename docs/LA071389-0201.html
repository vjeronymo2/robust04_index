			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOMB BLAST AT DISCO HURTS 7 U.S. SOLDIERS;  </P> <P> ATTACK ON AMERICAN SERVICEMEN IS 4TH IN HONDURAS THIS YEAR  </P> <P> A bomb exploded today outside a discotheque patronized by American military  personnel, wounding seven U.S. Army soldiers, three of them seriously,  officials said.  </P> <P> The attack occurred shortly after midnight at La Ceiba, more than 200 miles  north of Tegucigalpa, U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles V. Barclay said in a  telephone interview. There was no claim of responsibility.  </P> <P> It was the fourth attack on U.S. soldiers in Honduras since Feb. 1. Three  soldiers were injured in the previous incidents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victims Were MPs  </P> <P> Today's victims were Army military police, who were in La Ceiba to act as  escorts for about 150 American soldiers taking part in a joint road-building  exercise with Honduran troops, Barclay said. He said the entire group was due  to leave La Ceiba today.  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the  explosive was thrown as the Americans left a disco. Barclay could not confirm  that.  </P> <P> "We don't know if the explosive device was hurled from a passing automobile or  had been detonated in place," Barclay said.  </P> <P> The injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had been given a night's  leave and were in civilian clothes. Two uninjured soldiers fled and were  arrested by Honduran troops because they had no identification, a Honduran  military commander said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serious Condition  </P> <P> Barclay said three of the wounded soldiers were in serious condition, while the  four others suffered lesser injuries. He said all were assigned to the Enrique  Soto Cano Air Base, 50 miles northeast of Tegucigalpa, a major center for U.S.  troops in Honduras.  </P> <P> The wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in La Ceiba, Barclay  said. Their names were not released.  </P> <P> Col. Eric Sanchez said the uninjured Americans were being held until they could  be officially identified by U.S. officials.  </P> <P> Sanchez, the Honduran military commander at La Ceiba, said the attack occurred  at 12:30 a.m. and involved a "homemade explosive device."  </P> <P> Barclay said the troops were part of a convoy that had been building roads in a  province 120 miles east of La Ceiba. The convoy had stopped for the night  during its trip back to Soto Cano.  </P> <P> About 15,000 American troops and Honduran soldiers were taking part in an  exercise called Strong Roads that began in December and ended Tuesday.  </P> <P> At least 20 American soldiers have been wounded in attacks in Honduras since  1982, when the United States started increasing its military presence in this  country and holding joint exercises with Honduran troops.  </P> <P> Today's attack came three months after unidentified assailants used gunfire and  an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11 U.S. and six Honduran soldiers  outside Olanchita, near La Ceiba. One jeep was disabled in the April 11 attack,  but no injuries were reported.  </P></p>

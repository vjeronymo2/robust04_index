			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Management: Troubleshooters for hire - Companies that have turned to outside managers for help with short-term problems 'WHAT WILL we be doing five years from now? I can't imagine myself sitting in this production job indefinitely and there are only so many places on the board.' Jerry Kroon, the 46-year-old executive vice-president of manufacturing at Fokker Aircraft, was having a mid-life crisis. His confidante, Fokker's 42-year-old marketing manager, nodded gravely. Suddenly Kroon had an idea: 'Let's start a company called Fokker Driftwood, for all the people the company can't use in proper situations anymore. We will hire out our services for some of the time and we'll have a ball.' The conversation proceeded in jokey vein, yet it presented the perfect solution to a serious problem. There are large numbers of unemployed or dissatisfied executives with plenty of experience looking for new challenges. Equally, there are many companies that need extra help from time to time. Companies have slimmed down to such an extent that they increasingly find they have no management resources to deal with anything out of the ordinary. The answer, as Kroon suggested, is to create a new market for 'interim managers', employed for finite periods by companies when they are stretched or facing particular problems. Some big companies are setting up such markets in house. At IBM some middle managers have been saved from early retirement and put into a special unit of troubleshooters that are sent out on short-term assignments. Smaller companies which cannot afford this luxury are increasingly looking to outsiders specialising in interim management. 'Interim management? Never heard of it,' said Sir John Harvey-Jones, speaking at a recent conference on the subject organised by Learning Curve, the specialist training company. The remark caused much consternation among the established interim managers and their agents attending the session. Interim management, as these practitioners went on to explain to Sir John, is half way between consultancy and recruitment. The interim manager is there not just to advise, but to implement: to 'make it happen'. But unlike permanent managers, their contribution is limited in time and during each assignment they remain independent. According to Martin Wood, director in charge of interim management at PA Consulting, only one in eight large British companies has used interim management. Most of the others either have not heard of it, like Sir John, or have prejudices that prevent them from trying it. One problem is the name. There is no agreement about what interim managers should be called. They are also known as flexi-executives, portfolio executives, handymen (after management guru Charles Handy, who advocates flexible working patterns), temporary executives, freelance managers, managers for hire and line consultants. In the US the terms 'head renting' and 'executive leasing' are also common. Whatever their name, their task is a demanding one. Some companies doubt whether an outsider can get immediate results in an unfamiliar environment. It is much harder to be a good interim manager than simply a good manager. According to Wood, the ideal person is aged between 45 and 65, and has senior board experience. They need to be over-qualified for the work in hand, as they will probably come in late and be expected to sort things out at once. 'They must have the skills of a good consultant, and must be able to handle a team. They must not be politicians, but must wear their hearts on their sleeve,' says Wood. They also need to be of independent financial means, as they must never be dependent on any one employer, and they must not be searching for full-time employment. For the right person the pay is good, anything between Pounds 300 and Pounds 1,000 a day, which is two to three times the going rate for the job in hand. There are no other employment costs, and interim managers can be dispensed with as soon as their services are no longer wanted. The skills of an interim manager improve with time. John Baker has been one for six years and has been involved in putting quality programmes into three companies. 'I learned lessons from the first, applied them in the second, and in the third we put in BS5750 with remarkable ease, against a background of a bunch of guys saying: 'We can't possibly do it'.' Interim managers are to be found in an array of peculiar situations. They have been working at Leyland DAF keeping the company going while the receiver looked for buyers. At the long-delayed British Library, an interim manager, who has done project directorships for the Aga Kahn, has been brought in to hurry the project along. Different companies use them for different reasons. Britannia Life hired an interim manager to help absorb the acquisition of a fellow financial services company. 'We needed a thorough review, and needed it quickly,' said Peter Burdon, managing director. He decided not to employ a consultant because 'they are isolated and sell solutions. They also run up all sorts of extra costs. An interim manager is a fixed cost'. Within days the agency identified two candidates, and the one Britannia chose started work within a week. The experiment was a great success, and the manager is now on the permanent staff. Birky Plastics, a subsidiary of the Japanese group Marubeni, brought in an interim manager while a less-experienced internal candidate was being groomed for the job. 'We found we could involve the new man in numerous areas of business without threatening anyone as they knew he was only there for a short time,' said Tony Wright, chief executive. There is potential for friction between the interim manager and the existing staff, many of whom may suspect the outsider and begrudge his fatter pay-packet. Some interim executives think that these problems are best dealt with directly. 'I get the guys together and say: 'Well, I am taking this job on a contract basis and I am in charge from now on until you are told otherwise.' With a sufficiently menacing glare round the room, nothing more gets said about it,' says Baker. Others prefer the softly-softly route. 'You cannot go in there with the assumption that you can plough through it,' says Martin Rosenhead, who has done interim management work for large organisations including the police and the prisons. 'You have got to persuade them that you are not threatening, because they have been used to being threatened, and are well trained to cope with it for a very long time.' Yet it can all go horribly wrong. According to John Hird, chairman of the Association of Temporary and Interim Executives, one company hired an interim computer specialist who caused untold damage by buying the wrong computer equipment; while another company took on a temporary finance director who turned out to be unqualified and incompetent. One answer, says Hird, might be to go through a reliable agency rather than through an 'old boy' network, as the agency, which has its reputation to defend, should have put more time into selecting the right people. However, this route may cost more: an agency usually takes 25 to 40 per cent of the salary. There are a growing number of agencies - such as P-E International, PA Consulting and Albermarle - which have several hundred interim managers on their books. The notion of interim management will only catch on in a big way if a large enough pool of exceptional people can be found. Good managers are rare enough and, if good interim managers are still fewer and farther between, the market may continue to grow slowly, no matter how persuasive its logic.</p>

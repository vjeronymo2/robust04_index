			<p>BFN     [Text] Government yesterday expressed "serious concern"  over Washington's request to have its military personnel in the  country agranted diplomatic status. Foreign Affairs  Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino yesterday confirmed Washington's  request, adding that "this issue are already being discussed at  the lower levels."    Mr. Severino said government is "exploring all the  possibilities" with regard to the request although he declined  to expound further. "We'll talk to you about it when the right  time comes," he said.    The request was made in view of the joint Philippines-United  States Balikatan [Shoulder to Shoulder] exercises in which  American military personnel will be participating. The  Balikatan is scheduled to be held here sometime this year.    The request was said to be related to government's  disregarding the status of forces agreement -- where rules  regarding the safety of American military personnel in the  country are included -- following the abolition of the bases  treaty. Sources said granting diplomatic status to American  military personnel will have serious political consequences.</p>

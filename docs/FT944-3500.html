			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television 'The night before Christmas' is started off-screen in the stilted semi-cockney whine associated with stage infants, but the camera reveals a journalistic adult: Suzanne Moore, who presents Without Walls: J'Accuse Santa Claus (9pm, Channel 4). The modern image of Santa is apparently the Americanisation of such pagan figures as our own Father Christmas. A parade of po-faced witnesses (except the author of The Making of Modern Christmas whose smile is as strained as any department store Santa's) earnestly describe the moral and psychological harm done to children by (a) believing Santa exists and (b) finding he doesn't. The editor of Cosmopolitan says toy advertising 'offends the hell out of me'. A professor from Loughborough University calls the phenomenon 'pretty hideous'. A writer compares Santa unfavourably with Catholic warnings of eternal hell-fire. Their implied superiority to us ad-watching ignoramuses is as ludicrous as the solemn lament for joyfully subversive paganism uttered in Ms Moore's humourless tones.</p>

"As the new chairman, 1 will try to maintain the social  vision the commission has had to date, and the commission should  have identical dispositions [regulations] toward all electoral  commissions," stated Prof. Laczkowski. He believes that the  guarantee of neutrality and apoliticalness, as well as the PKW's  professionalism, lies in the commission's composition, which  consists of three judges from each of the following: the  Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme  Administrative Court.    The first matter that will face the commission under the  leadership of its new chairman is that of clearing the accounts  of the electoral committees. As of 11 January, only 64 of the  176 committees have turned in their reports to the PKW. The  legal interpretation also requires that the closing date of the  tenure of the gmina [parish, the smallest administrative unit]  councils be specified. It is still not known whether the time  limit will be the same for all gminas or whether it will be  counted individually from the day of election.    Prof. Laczkowski is 63 years old. He is a graduate of the  Department of Law of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan.  As a specialist in public law, he lectures at his alma mater and  also at the Catholic University in Lublin. Since 1990, he has  held the office of judge of the State Tribunal. In 1991, he  became a member of the governing body of the General Electoral  Commissioner. Despite his new duties, the professor says that he  has no intention of quitting his academic work.</p>

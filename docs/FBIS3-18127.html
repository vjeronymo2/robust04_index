			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "lz": "Loss of Confidence in the East"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- Shortly after the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] gathered new strength at its party congress in  Hamburg, it received a cold shower in eastern Germany: The east  German voters, a majority of whom still supported the  CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] four years ago, gave Kohl's  party the cold shoulder at the beginning of the super election  year. According an Infratest poll (1,117 persons polled,  conclusion of poll on 14 February), support for the CDU between  Ruegen and the Erz Mountains has dropped to 14 percent. Thus,  the party is only sightly ahead of the successor party of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS]. At 24 percent, the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] received the best rating, but it also trails far  behind the group of frustrated citizens who do not have positive  feelings for any party (37 percent).    A dramatic loss of confidence was also observed concerning  the question of competence. Only every second east German  believes that the parties can resolve major problems, including  unemployment, internal security, and the adaptation of the  eastern level to the western. As far as the parties are  concerned, the SPD has a lead over the CDU. Regarding  unemployment, the ratio is 30 to 15. On the issue of social  security, the CDU trails behind the PDS.    Observers view these figures, which do not yet determine the  outcome of the elections, as a serious sign of helplessness. In  addition, the economic and social problems resulting from the  restructuring of the collapsing east German economy are not  blamed on the SED but on the democratic parties.    The question concerning the most convincing politician makes  that clear: At 71 percent, Brandenburg's Minister for Social  Affairs Regine Hildebrandt tops the list, followed by Saxon  Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf and Brandenburg  Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. Ms. Hildebrandt's strategy  is to present people in the new laender as those who are always  discriminated against. Her often-used slogan "We must not put  up with this," makes her the most popular politician in east  Germany. Politicians, however, who seek reconciliation can rely  on less support: Wolfgang Thierse (33), Angela Merkel (24), and  Bernhard Vogel (23). Even Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of German  unity, did not receive more than 23 percent.</p>

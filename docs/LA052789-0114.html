			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SCHOOL REMEMBERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana High School paid a pre-Memorial Day tribute Friday to its alumni who  havegone on to serve in the U.S. armed forces.  </P> <P> "It is with great honor that we respect and recognize the great contributions  our students have made over the past 100 years," Andrew Hernandez, the school's  principal, said before about 60 guests.  </P> <P> Unveiled were two plaques honoring Santa Ana High students who fought in  Vietnam and Korea. Former students who fought in one of America's four wars in  this century were also honored. They included Fred Rosenbaum, a 92-year-old  veteran of World War I, who attended the school from 1913 to 1915.  </P> <P> Marine Corps Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter, commanding general of the El Toro  Marine Corps Air Station, was the keynote speaker at the 45-minute program.  Shuter said that while Memorial Day means "barbecues, hot dogs, ballgames and .  . . the Indy 500" for some people, "many civilians, and we in the military,  demand that the sacrifices made, in war or in peacetime, are not made in vain."  </P> <P> By holding the tribute, Shuter said, Santa Ana High was "refusing to allow  their contribution to be dimmed by history."  </P> <P> Five students who were either members of the school band or the Navy Junior  ROTC unit -- including one student who fainted -- required treatment after  standing in the sun during the program. None was seriously hurt, a school  administrator said.  </P></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / High street banks want card groups to join clearing body High street banks are to invite credit and debit card payment groups such as Visa and Switch to join their body responsible for cheque and cash clearing. An internal study has raised concerns about growing competition from payment systems not run by banks. The effort to bring credit and debit payments under the Association for Payment Clearing Services umbrella follows the collapse of the banks' attempt in the 1980s to create Eftpos, a single clearing and settlement system for debit cards. Since the collapse of the Eftpos initiative in 1989, the largest co-operative effort involving credit and debit cards within Apacs has been the joint initiative to reduce fraud. Card payments are now settled by rival card groups, although they are cleared through banks. After a study which has also led banks to allow mutual or sub-contracted processing of cheques and credit vouchers to save costs, Apacs has now decided to try to extend membership to outside clearing and payment groups, notably the card payment organisations. The unpublished study says it believes that 'there would be benefits to such organisations from having a stronger relationship with Apacs, and that most would wish to do so, provided the balance of rights and obligations was sensible, and there was a level playing field'. The study argues that the 'orderly development' of the payments industry is fundamental to maintaining standards such as avoiding fraud. However, it points out that the membership of international payments systems has mushroomed in the past decade, leading to far greater diversity. It predicts 'fierce competition' throughout the 1990s between the leading payments systems and networks including Visa, Mastercard and the bank-owned Swift international payments network, as well as third party processing companies such as Sligos. Apacs executives say they have no intention of trying to revive Eftpos, which collapsed after the launch of Barclays' Connect debit card and the formation of the Switch consortium. Mr Andrew Malecki, head of strategy and planning, said there was 'zero chance' of Apacs trying to set up a single national clearing and settlement system for plastic cards. Mr Malecki said Apacs' ruling council had approved the strategy set out in the study of association of embracing 'a wide range of payment clearing and settlement activities and organisations', but it had not set precise terms for the admission of new members. Some Apacs executives believe the association would have to admit card groups on more flexible terms than in the past because organisations such as Visa and Mastercard have international memberships, and constitutions which would be difficult to change.</p>

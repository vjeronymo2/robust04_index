			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Better a language that confuses than one that is over-exact? Sir, The article by James Morgan ('As They Say in Europe: Watch your tongue]', January 25) on the perils of other people's languages cites German irritation with the imprecision of the English phrase, 'Old Fish Hill Street', in which no indication is given of whether 'old' refers to fish, hill or street. This could beg the question, from an English-speaking person, of who would necessarily want to know such a thing, or, indeed, why. However, the example brought to mind Mark Twain's essay, 'The awful German language' quoted in the book, Words and Women, by Casey Miller and Kate Swift. After pointing to the absurdity and apparent indignity of young ladies and wives being described as genderless, while mere turnips are designated female, Twain continues: 'To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description, that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German speaks of an Englishman as the Englander; to change the sex, he adds -in, and that stands for Englishwoman - Englanderin. That seems descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: die Englanderin - which means 'the she-Englishwoman'. I consider that that person is over-described.' Presumably, the degree of description deemed necessary is in the eyes or ears of the variously mother-tongued and therefore biased beholders.

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hoare Govett returns to gilt-edged market making Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which now belongs to ABN Amro, the Dutch Bank, has received approval from the Bank of England to become a gilt-edged market-maker (Gemm). It will start operations on June 6. Hoare Govett was a Gemm at the time of 'Big Bang' in the City of London, but withdrew from the gilts market in 1988 as part of cost-cutting measures by its then owner, Security Pacific of the US. Several other foreign houses also stopped dealing in gilts in the late 1980s in the face of tough competition in an overcrowded market. However, an improvement in conditions in the market in recent years has prompted some to return. There are 20 other Gemms, the most recent entrants being Merrill Lynch of the US, which pulled out in the late 1980s after incurring heavy losses, and Yamaichi of Japan.</p>

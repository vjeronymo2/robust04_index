			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Russia forecasts more stable economy Russia may achieve the basis for economic stabilisation in 1995 despite the recent turbulence on the currency markets and a further contraction of output, according to an economics ministry forecast presented to parliament yesterday. The ministry predicted that the fall in gross domestic product would slow to 6-8 per cent next year but that this would mask strong growth in Russia's services sector, which some economists suggest is only inadequately recorded in official statistics. An accompanying finance ministry report forecast the year-on-year inflation rate would fall to 27-30 per cent by the end of 1995, compared with 180 per cent in 1994, 840 per cent in 1993 and 2,000 per cent in 1992. 'This bears witness to the first signs of stabilisation, or at least the basis for stabilisation,' the economics ministry report said. Mrs Tatyana Paramanova, the newly-appointed acting head of the central bank, vowed she would use Russia's foreign exchange reserves to defend the rouble, introducing greater exchange rate stability. In her first interview since being nominated last week by President Boris Yeltsin, she also promised to create a modern banking system in Russia, commensurate with the size of the country, and to develop effective monetary policy instruments. However, the government's relatively tough budgetary stance - symbolised by a frugal draft budget for 1995 - will be severely tested in the coming weeks as opposition intensifies. Parliament, which has been incensed by the rouble's volatility, will hold a confidence vote on the government on Thursday and some deputies are likely vigorously to oppose the 1995 budget draft. The trades union movement has also called for a national strike on the same day to highlight the plight of thousands of workers who have not been paid for months. It was reported yesterday that 73 workers had gone on hunger strike in the Sverdlovsk region to protest about wage arrears at their military equipment plant. Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has already turned up the political heat, claiming that the proposed 1995 defence budget of Rbs44,000bn was insufficient for the armed forces. Pressure from the defence, heavy industry and agriculture lobbies has already resulted in a sizeable increase in credits this year. The economics ministry report forecast Russia's trade surplus would rise from Dollars 18.3bn in 1994 to Dollars 19.1bn next year - although this may reflect a sharp projected fall in imports following the rouble's depreciation.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Kohl overflows with optimism MR Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, last night was optimistic about almost everything - even about Mr John Major. At his post-summit press conference, Mr Kohl kept up the insistent bonhomie he had shown when, on arriving in Birmingham on Thursday evening, he shook hands with bystanders outside the conference hotel. Running through a large selection of his favourite metaphors, the chancellor said common resolve to ratify the Maastricht Treaty showed 'everyone wants the European train to press on'. He brushed aside the possibility of a points failure sparked off by British or Danish recalcitrance. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, had left any doubt about their fundamental support for the treaty. 'The Danes do not want the train to go without them.' Asked about Mr Major's domestic political travails, Mr Kohl responded: 'I have no doubt that my friend John Major will overcome (his domestic troubles).' The prime minister would simply need to show the same persistence as the chancellor himself had often displayed, Mr Kohl said. Mr Kohl could not resist putting an optimistic gloss on all the other summit questions. He made optimistic noises about the outlook for German interest rate cuts. He said the deliberations on Gatt showed 'the outlook for a successful conclusion has improved'. He was even sanguine about the Bundestag's decision to reserve for itself the last word on European monetary union in 1996 or 1998. This step counters the 'automaticity' on monetary union Mr Kohl originally wanted to build into the treaty. But, at his most Panglossian, the chancellor declared it was 'self evident' that, for such a 'decisive step', parliament should have the final say.</p>

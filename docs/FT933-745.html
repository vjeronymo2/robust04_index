			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Exile wins in C Africa Republic MR ANGE-FELIX PATASSE, a veteran politician, has been elected president of the Central African Republic after years of thwarted efforts and periodic exile, Reuter reports from Bangui. Mr Patasse won just over 52 per cent of the vote in the second-round run-off on September 19. His opponent, Mr Abel Goumba, took 47 per cent. The two, both contesting the presidency for the third time in the republic's chaotic history, knocked incumbent President Andre Kolingba out of the race in a first round on August 22. Mr Patasse, 56, was prime minister for two months in 1976 during the reign of Jean-Bedel Bokassa until the despotic ruler dissolved the cabinet and had himself proclaimed emperor. Mr Patasse went to France, the former colonial power, returning in 1980 after Bokassa's overthrow in a French-backed coup. He was beaten in the country's first multi-party elections the next year by Mr David Dacko, Bokassa's nephew. The losers accused Mr Dacko of rigging the vote and he responded by banning opposition parties. Mr Kolingba freed Bokassa from jail on September 1. The former emperor was accused of cannibalism and infanticide and was serving a 20-year term for murder and embezzlement. Bokassa spoke at Bangui's cathedral on Sunday, clad in his ornate marshal's uniform, and said that like Christ he had been condemned in the name of the people.</p>

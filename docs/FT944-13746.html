			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sandoz sales growth held to 3% by strength of Swiss currency Sandoz, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals, nutrition and chemicals group, said consolidated sales rose only 3 per cent in the first nine months of the year to SFr11.89bn (Dollars 9.53bn), with reported growth restrained by the strength of the Swiss franc. Sandoz, which acquired Gerber Products, the leading US baby food supplier, for Dollars 3.7bn in August, said group sales growth in local currencies was about 9 per cent. The group expected a 'sound improvement' in operating income in the full year. However, because of weaker financial income, it reiterated its earlier forecast that net income would only be at about last year's SFr1.7bn. In the third quarter, group sales were up 5.4 per cent at SFr3.67bn, with all of the increase coming from the inclusion of SFr190m from Gerber since August 25. Mr Raymund Breu, finance director, said the cost of the Gerber acquisition would not dilute earnings either this year or in 1995. The nutrition division, into which Gerber has been integrated, saw its third-quarter sales soar 68 per cent to SFr719m. Mr Breu said if Gerber and two large acquisitions from last year were excluded, the division was still growing at about a 6 per cent rate. The pharmaceuticals division suffered a 2.7 per cent drop in sales in the third quarter to SFr1.79bn. But Mr Breu said the underlying trend was up 3 per cent in local currencies, slightly ahead of the industry average. Sales in the agrochemicals division dropped 5 per cent in the third quarter to SFr175m but in the nine months this has been the group's fastest growing division, with sales up 10 per cent in local currencies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Monday foreign exchange rates should reflect economic  fundamentals of each country. The premier made the remarks  after his brief meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi  Mieno, who attended a meeting of top financial officials from  the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Washington late last  month.    "We (Hata and Mieno) discussed economic issues in a wide  range. Yen and U.S. dollar rates should reflect both countries'  fundamentals," Hata told a group of reporters.    The U.S. dollar moved little with fears of dollar-supporting  intervention by the Bank of Japan after opening at 101.80 yen in  Tokyo on Monday, 0.58 yen lower than Friday's quote.</p>

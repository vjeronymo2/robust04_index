			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Miners take redundancy as hopes dim MORE THAN half the 25,000 manual job cuts British Coal sought through mine closures last October have been achieved by voluntary means in spite of the scaling-back of the mine-closure programme from 31 to 19 pits. The pace of departure of mineworkers is quickening as more of them accept the inevitability of closures. More than 13,000 have left since October, 2,600 of them in the last week. The latest redundancies leave British Coal with less than 25,000 blue-collar employees. The redundancies are being taken on a voluntary basis and represent a setback for unions which are still fighting closures. Disputes over British Coal's closure consultation procedures are expected to return to the High Court in the next few weeks. This, however, is unlikely to save any of the pits. Miners at some collieries, including Shirebrook, Rossington, Houghton Main, Markham Main and Easington have already voted to accept local deals on improved redundancies. British Coal says this signifies approval for closure. Under the local deals, negotiated in the last few weeks, some miners will gain up to Pounds 8,000 more than under the national deal. This is lifting the average payment to above the previous Pounds 26,000. The pace of redundancies has also been influenced by the cessation of mining last week at five pits which are earmarked for closure or mothballing. These will joined on Friday by Easington and Westoe, both in the north-east of England, which are to be maintained in a state where mining could be resumed. But the chances of them re-opening are remote.</p>

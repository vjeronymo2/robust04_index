			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse hinders metal projects THE COLLAPSE OF the former Soviet Union is having a widespread negative impact on mining and metal projects. Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, said yesterday its Dollars 600m offer to renew the Pechenganikel smelter, part of the Norilsk nickel combine in Russia, had lapsed. Technical details had been agreed but Russia's take-over had delayed financial arrangements. Norilsk had asked the Russian authorities to be allowed to keep all its foreign currency earnings and to be able to export its metal tariff-free for some time to pay for the smelter's refurbishment, Outokumpu said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have indefinitely delayed a bauxite mining joint venture in Jamaica. The Nikolaev alumina plant in the Ukraine and a US company were to have refurbished the former Reynolds Metals mine in Lydford for Dollars 50m. Mining should have started next year at an annual 1.5m, rising to 2.5m tonnes. Russia's gold industry suffered from obsolete equipment, shortages of spare parts, energy and raw materials and loss of staff, said Mr Alexandre Doumnov, formerly a director of the Soviet state bank. He said gold production had stagnated for two years and was now likely to decline.</p>

According to the reports, aircraft without identifying  markings conducted air raids on 6 and 16 January, which resulted  in the death of a woman with a child and tens of wounded. The  Tajikistan Resistance Council's headquarters confirmed that  there had been deliberate air bombing attacks on the camps  which, according to Western journalists' data, are home to about  20,000 refugees from the former Kurgan-Tyuba Oblast.    This essentially is the first armed attack on the refugees.  There was an incident in the spring of last year, when an  attempt was made to poison the people in the Sakhi camp near  Mazar-e Sharif. As a result of this action about 100 people died  and 500 were brought to Afghan hospitals. A man who had poisoned  the water, which was brought to the refugees in cisterns, was  apprehended. He turned out to be a Tajik doctor, who said on  Afghan television after being apprehended that the action had  been conceived by Tajik special services. In just one year a  cemetery set up near the Sakhi camp, which is located in the  steppe, grew to about 1,000 graves. A correspondent of the  Japanese newspaper ASAHI, who had visited the Sakhi camp, told  of the extreme hardships of refugee life.    Nevertheless, conditions at least are tolerable for the  refugees in the Sakhi camp since it is the only camp monitored  by the UN mission and the International Red Cross. Other camps  in Afghanistan get their supply of food and necessary medical  supplies from Muslim countries and organizations.    However, the situation that emerged in connection with the  bombardment of Tajik refugee camps in Kunduz is quite  explainable. After the unsuccessful storming of Kabul undertaken  in the early hours of 1 January, General Dustum's units, which  represent Afghanistan's Uzbek population and are actively  supported by the Government of Uzbekistan, are trying to shift  the strike onto the camps. Most likely it is tied to a  large-scale action conceived with the purpose of liquidating  Tajik opposition in Afghanistan. It is possible that the air  force that conducted the raids on the camps does not belong to  General Dustum, since it is known that his helicopters and  airplanes are on territory controlled by Dustum's adversary,  Afghanistan's former minister of defense, Ahmad Shah Massud.  This happened after General Dustum ordered an air raid on Kabul  but the pilots--mainly Tajiks and Pashtuns by ethnic  origin--sided with President Rabbani. According to Tajikistan  Resistance Council information, the aircraft without identifying  markings come from the north, from behind the former  Soviet-Afghan border.    The coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in  the CIS countries has protested this action. The document  distributed by it describes this as an attempt to derail the  process of preparation for negotiations between the opposition  and the current government in Dushanbe. There is no other  explanation for terrorism against refugees. If this is the case,  it becomes clear now that General Dustum has always supported a  pro-communist coup in Tajikistan. The Tajik opposition believes  that the United Nations and the entire world community should  urgently investigate this incident and protect the refugees from  an encroachment on their lives, whoever it comes from.</p>

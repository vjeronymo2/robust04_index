Addressing a meeting with journalists which was held at the  government building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment on  Friday [4 February], Soskovets focused on the Russo-Georgian  package of trade and economic agreements. Soskovets is deeply  convinced that both countries seek to find a common approach to  the development of industrial infrastructure.    "Georgian colleagues displayed a particular interest in  Russian enterprises of the fuel-and-energy sector," Soskovets  said. He pointed out that a number of Russian joint stock  societies expressed the readiness to take part in the  modernisation of oil processing complexes on the territory of  Georgia. However, Soskovets emphasised that "our relations  should develop on the basis of parity and mutual advantage".    Soskovets did not rule out a possibility of granting a  credit  to Georgia worth 20 billion roubles in the near future. He  pointed out that the Russian side seeks to connect these funds  with the so-called tied credit.    Speaking about the economic situation in Russia, Soskovets,  who is in charge of issues of the fuel and energy sector, the  military-industrial complex and industry in general, said that  the state budget remains one of the most pressing problems  today. He pointed out that at present, the Russian Government,  on the one hand, has been holding consultations with ministries  and state committees on the development of the coordinated  system of mutual payments between enterprises, and on the other  hand, seeks to conduct a tough policy of allocating credits to  different branches of the economy.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK warns on unitary tax MR Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, confirmed yesterday that the government would retaliate against US companies unless the dispute over California's unitary system for taxing foreign companies was resolved by the end of this year. Mr Lamont said that following his meeting last month with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, he had been assured that the US administration was very keen 'to find a solution to the problem that is acceptable'. But to underline the seriousness with which the UK government was treating the issue, Mr Lamont said he had told the Inland Revenue to get information from California-based companies in the UK on the probable impact of cancelling the tax break given to US companies on the dividends they receive from their British subsidiaries. Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, welcomed Mr Lamont's decision and emphasised the strong political support there was from MPs of all parties for retaliation if it was needed. 'President Clinton has totally disregarded the US's international commitments and, unfortunately, US business will now have to pay a very real and high price,' he said. The US Supreme Court is expected to decide today whether to hear a case brought by Barclays Bank, the UK clearing bank, against the Californian system. In a break with the policy of previous US administrations, Mr Clinton this month decided not to file a brief on Barclays' side. Under the unitary system California may assess taxes on companies not on the profits they actually make in the state, but on a proportion of their worldwide earnings. It will be very simple and quick for the UK government to launch retaliatory action. In direct response to the Barclays case, it inserted a clause in the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes act designed to remove tax credits from non-resident companies connected with states where the unitary system is employed . Parliament would simply need to approve a statutory instrument to bring this into effect. Alternatively, more detailed measures could be introduced into the new Finance Bill following the next budget in November. Mr Peter Parsons, a tax partner with accountants Touche Ross, said: 'This is something that we've all been expecting and hoping for. It is entirely appropriate. 'The US is not going to listen unless some specific measures are taken. The numbers involved will impact quite significantly back at head office in California.' The US Treasury said the administration would 'work with California in trying to address the concerns the UK government has raised.' In a squeeze over tax, Page 16</p>

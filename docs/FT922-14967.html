			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (1): Successes on many fronts - Milton Keynes poses the question of whether in Britain a complete city can ever be built from scratch. The experiment is unlikely to be repeated in the 1990s whichever political party or parties gain power. It may not be Venice or even Bath, but by its own lights it has worked IT was difficult not to feel a twinge of sympathy for the Milton Keynes Development Corporation last month as its officers cleared their desks, put their books and papers into packing cases, and decided which of the hundreds of potted plants to take with them. The development corporation was wound up on March 31 after 25 years. It has achieved notable successes on many fronts in creating a city - a city in the country as it has been termed - out of three small towns and 13 villages spread over 33 sq miles of Buckinghamshire. Yet, Milton Keynes continues to produce an ambivalent attitude in people who visit and comment on it. One writer quoted Gertrude Stein's remark about Oakland in California, saying that there is no there there. Mr Colin Amery, the architecture critic, wrote recently in this newspaper about the city and its new ecumenical church, saying: 'There is a brand new ecumenical church with its dome at the centre. . . this dome ought to have been bigger. The dome does not do what domes are meant to do and sail over the lower buildings. Instead, it looks as though it tried to rise above its surroundings but sighed so deeply that it sank down again. That somehow sums up what I feel about Milton Keynes - it ought to have been wonderful but it isn't' Everyone feels obliged to mention the concrete cows. These are in a field visible from the trains from London. They were a gift from a visiting US sculptress, Liz Leyh. Somehow they have come to symbolise the absence of life in central Milton Keynes. In short, the lack of downtown bustle, busy street life, urban presence  - or whatever it is that gives a city heart - is seen as meaning that Milton Keynes has not become a truly three-dimensional city where people can happily live, work and play. Milton Keynes, more than any other new town started in the 1950s and 1960s, poses the question of whether in Britain, where we traditionally view our population centres as old organisms which evolve and expand naturally, a completely new city can be built from scratch. Perhaps you inevitably end up with a garden suburb which, although pretty, lacks soul. Certainly, if you like a city to have a public house on every corner, and its streets to be dirty and choked with traffic, then Milton Keynes is not for you. Perhaps for the cognoscente the city is not architecturally what they might wish it to be. But to criticise the planners at the development corporation because they have not created another Oxford or Bristol is to miss the point. Milton Keynes was always going to be different. It was going to hark back to the idealism of the first new towns early this century: towns like Welwyn Garden City and Letchworth which envisaged low-density housing in rural or garden settings. But, at the same time, it was going to be big and balanced enough to reach a critical mass of its own. Importantly, it was going to contrast with many of our other cities which had grown haphazardly since the 19th century in that it could cope with that 20th century phenomenon the motor car. The new town ideal underwent a perversion in the middle years of the century. In order to accommodate overspill populations from the big cities while they were cleared of slum housing, a large number of new towns were created. Often they were old market towns with bits of housing and industry bolted on in a higgledy-piggledy way. Many people were decanted into the new housing unwillingly, creating a single class of workers, while managers and owners lived in the surrounding countryside. The anticipated population explosion of the 1950s, in the big cities such as London, never materialised. Some of the new towns only managed to grow to about 80,000. This was not enough to develop sufficient support services or amenities. New town blues became a 1960s phenomenon. Milton Keynes, which was the last of the new towns to be commissioned in 1967, would avoid all this by getting the size and balance right by means of a comprehensive plan. The city - Milton Keynes is, in fact, not officially a city although it has always called itself one - would be built on an American-style system of grid roads. Within the grids, there would be a balanced range of housing, retailing and social amenities. Workers would live alongside bosses. Nobody would need more than 10 minutes to get to work. And everyone could go home for lunch, if they wanted to, or, alternatively, go shopping. The original villages and towns were to be drawn into this multicentred city. The central business district would be left until last. A parallel system of 'redways' or walkways, adjacent to and beneath the roads, would mean that pedestrians and cyclists could move about the city without interfering with motor traffic. No buildings were to be above tree height, so when the 13m trees and shrubs planted in the landscape grew up it would not feel like living in a city at all. There is no overhead cabling. All this was seen as possible because it was launched at a time when a totally planned environment was believed desirable, massive public spending was almost an article of faith and social engineering on an enormous scale had not become discredited. It is difficult to see the experiment of Milton Keynes being repeated in the 1990s whichever political party or parties gain power. On its own terms, Milton Keynes has not been a failure. The population has grown from 40,000 to 152,000 over the 25 years, and nearly 70,000 jobs have been created. More than 2,500 companies have been attracted. Because they represent a wide spread and only 15 companies employ more than 500 employees, Milton Keynes has weathered the recession better than many places. Unemployment, at 7 per cent, is below the average for the south-east. Traffic moves around at an average speed of 40mph. This compares with 11mph in London. Just about everyone you talk to likes being in Milton Keynes. Mr Simon Cuthbertson, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte says: 'I am very happy with the lifestyle here. I live in a village in the country, but I am in the office in 10 minutes. 'I can always park. I can drive to Heathrow in an hour and I am going to the Festival Hall in London tonight. I will be there in just over an hour, door to door.' Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing director of Alps Electric, one of the 43 Japanese companies in Milton Keynes, says: 'I like the transport situation here. It is so easy to get around Milton Keynes and so easy to see my customers elsewhere in the country.' For many of those who have moved in there is little inclination to return to their former home areas. 'I came here 14 years ago because the housing was so cheap and there was work. I would never go back to Southall. This is marvellous for the kids. I tried to persuade others in my family to move out,' Mr Samsar Dhuynay, who has a young family and describes himself as a railwayman, says. Milton Keynes does have its minus points. You could not be without a car. The city centre could do with more amenities, particularly a theatre or concert hall, though it does have a large multiplex cinema, The Point. It may not be Venice or even Bath, but by its own lights it has worked. A more interesting question is whether without the development corporation to drive it along it will continue to grow and become rounded out. The government technically still owns 3,500 acres, an area in itself bigger than some existing new towns.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Comprehensively and Correctly </F> Implement the Policy of Freedom of Religious Belief"]    [Text] State Council Premier Li Peng signed and issued the  "Provisions on the Management of Religious Activities of Foreign  Nationals Within the Boundaries of the People's Republic of  China" (hereinafter called the "Provisions") and the  "Regulations on the Management of Places of Religious  Activities" (hereinafter called the "Regulations") on 31  January 1994. They are two important administrative regulations  of the Chinese Government for the management of religious  affairs. The promulgation of these two regulations is an  important measure for China to comprehensively and correctly  implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, strengthen  the management of religious affairs according to law, and keep  religion in line with socialist society. It is also an  important step taken in the building of the legal system  concerning religious affairs in China.    The Chinese Government has always pursued a policy of  freedom  of religious belief. As early as in the period of the  democratic revolution, the CPC, in accordance with the principle  of freedom of religious belief, formed an extensive  anti-imperialist patriotic united front with the religious  masses of people of various nationalities which became an  important guarantee for uniting people throughout the country to  score victory in the democratic revolution. Since the founding  of the republic, the situation of religion in China, following a  thorough transformation of the socialist system and important  reform of the religious system, has undergone a historic and  fundamental change, and the party's policy of freedom of  religious belief has been implemented further. Practice has  proved that the policy of freedom of religious belief conforms  with the national conditions of China and is supported by the  broad religious masses and the people of various nationalities.  These two regulations on religion have been formulated precisely  in accordance with the Constitution of China and the consistent  policy of freedom of religious belief. The "Provisions" have  given full expression to the fixed principles of the Chinese  Government's respect for foreigners' freedom of religious belief  within the boundaries of China, protection for their normal  religious activities, and protection for their friendly  exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities with  religious circles of China. At the same time, the "Provisions"  also have given expression to the principle that "religious  bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign  domination," which is set out in the Constitution of China, and  have explicitly stated that foreigners should observe the laws  of China, should not damage the public interests of Chinese  society, and should not in any way interfere in the internal  affairs of religion in China. In this way, foreigners are  provided with legal protection for exercising their right to  freedom of religious belief within the boundaries of China, for  taking part in normal religious activities, and for carrying out  friendly exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities  with the religious circles of China.    The "Regulations" have fully stipulated the legitimate  rights  and interests of places for religious activities and how to  safeguard these rights and interests. The "Regulations" also  have stipulated the legal responsibility for acts of  encroachment on the legitimate rights and interests of places  for religious activities. At the same time, the "Regulations"  have stipulated the duties and obligations of places of  religious activities to the state and society. These are  mainly: "Religious activities conducted in places of religious  activities are to abide by laws and regulations. No individual  is permitted to make use of places of religious activities to  carry out activities that undermine national unity, nationality  solidarity, and social stability; that harm the health of  citizens; or that hinder the country's education system." The  "Regulations" also have stipulated that places of religious  activities are to be registered and registered places of  religious activities are to be protected by law.    The promulgation and implementation of the two religious  regulations meet the needs in managing religious affairs  according to law and in comprehensively and correctly  implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief.  Managing religious affairs according to law means that the  government will carry out administrative management and  supervision of the implementation of relevant religions laws,  decrees, and policies. Managing religious affairs according to  law does not contradict the policy of freedom of religious  belief, and the purpose of such management is to better  implement the policy. Managing according to law includes two  aspects: One is to protect citizens' right to freedom of  religious belief, normal religious activities, and the  legitimate rights and interests of religious circles. The other  aspect is to restrict and crack down on criminal activities that  make use of religion. They are two aspects of one issue and are  dialectically unified. They can neither be set against one  another, nor be separated. This kind of management is to  include religious activities and religious affairs into the  Constitution and laws. It is not meant to interfere with the  normal religious activities or the internal affairs of religious  bodies and places of religious activities, nor is it meant to  interfere with citizens' freedom of religious belief. Government  functionaries, various units, and individuals should seriously  abide by the "Regulations" and should not willfully infringe on  the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles.    The promulgation of these two regulations is a good  beginning  for legislation concerning religious affairs in China. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "To protect the people's  democracy, we must strengthen the legal system. We must set up  systems and formulate laws on democracy, and must ensure that  these systems and laws will not change with the change of  leaders and will not change with changes in the leaders' views  and attention." With the implementation of these two  regulations, the building of the legal system concerning  religious affairs will be constantly improved and strengthened,  the legal system concerning religious affairs gradually will be  set up in China, and the Chinese Government's management of  religious affairs will be placed truly within the orbit of the  legal system. At present, we should lay stress on properly  implementing the two administrative regulations on religion, and  should make sure they are observed and strictly enforced, and  that violations of the regulations are punished so that these  two regulations are really implemented. We believe that the  implementation of these two regulations will have an important  impact on comprehensively and correctly implementing the policy  of freedom of religious belief in our country, strengthening the  management of religious affairs, enhancing unity between  religious and non-religious citizens, maintaining social  stability, conducting international friendly religious  exchanges, promoting the Chinese people's understanding and  friendship with the people of all countries in the world, and  speeding up the building of socialist modernization.</p>

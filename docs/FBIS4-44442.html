			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xu Jianbing (1776 1017 0393): "Public Ownership </F> Does Not Mean the Public Owns Nothing"]    [Text] There are repeated discussions now regarding  enterprises owned by the whole people. It is commonly said that  their efficiency is low and they lack vitality. There are two  kinds of sides. The majority hopes that deeper reform will make  enterprises owned by the whole people develop prosperously  because they recognize that such enterprises are the backbone of  socialism. It goes without saying that, without this  backbone--the mansion of socialist modernization, a small room  or even a tent could not be raised. However, in society there  also is a minority of people, some of whom have been affected by  public opinion, others who stack up bills (including foreign  currency) to put in banks or safety deposit boxes for future  private development. Still others originally had an antagonistic  attitude towards socialism, thus they do their utmost to slander  ownership by the whole people. These people either thoroughly  wreck ownership by the whole people or else they swallowed  sleeping pills and cannot be awakened.    On 15 December 93, the "Wide Angle," a special 50th edition  of JINGJI RIBAO, printed an article entitled "Ownership by All =  Ownership by None." Even without reading the contents, the title  tells the author's intent.    In relating the reasoning as to why "ownership by all =  ownership by none," use is made of one of Hegel's phrases,  "absolute brightness equals absolute darkness." This proves the  author's partiality towards Hegel's "absolutist concept," but  unfortunately, although Hegel was a master dialectician, he was  ultimately an idealist. His philosophy is immersed with an  absolute idealist system. That author's "ownership by all =  ownership by none" namely is that absolute ownership is equal to  absolute non-owner ship. However, through motion changes, the  internal contradiction in Hegel's "absolutist concept" naturally  will turn to face this elevated idealist principle applied  mechanistically. Marxists will not approve of Hegel's  "absolutist concept." The author's mechanistic use also is an  arrow shot at nothing. Moreover, Hegel's philosophy and China's  present economic system are totally unrelated. Slapping the two  together does not illustrate the author's erudition.    The author's article in JINGJI RIBAO naturally is not a  simple attempt to express himself as a follower of Hegel but one  to mix ideologies, ultimately getting rid of the economy owned  by the whole people so as to be able to attain his goal of  ownership by noone. However, unfortunately, the author just  talks nonsense and has not even grasped the connotation of  ownership by the whole people.    After the entire country was liberated, we did not accept  the  Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital or imperialist, feudalist  property, turning it into ownership by the whole people. Via  three great socialist transformations, the majority of private  capital-run enterprises became joint public and private  operations and then were owned by the whole people. These  economies owned by the whole people are the state's most  important sources of finance. Their proportions of total  financial income were, 1950, 33.4 percent; 1952, up to 58.1  percent; 1953-1957, the First Five-Year Plan, approached 70  percent; during the "Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Five-Year  Plans," more than 85 percent; and from 1981-1985, during the  Sixth Five-Year Plan, they fell to around 78.2 percent (above  figures from DANGDAI ZHONGGUO CAIZHENG [CONTEMPORARY CHINESE  FINANCE], Volume 2). The several trillion yuan turned over by  enterprises or units in the ownership by the whole people system  were not actually divied up to all the masses but all were used  for economic construction, social and cultural education,  national defense, administrative controls, and so on. Even  primary school students all know that China's economy, culture,  education, science and technology and military affairs, not to  mention socialist construction, could not have developed without  them and might have thoroughly collapsed. At that time, China  really was about to become a society "where all had nothing";  China could only have become a land of foreigners. Therefore, we  offer advice to Hegel's follower: It is better to begin with  common sense. Taking a famous person's idealist few words to  cheat ourselves and others is useless. The author said, "What is  the result of everyone having rights to state property? No one  is truly responsible." Where does such talk come from? An  enterprise's party committee secretary or chief must be  responsible for state property, for the workers of his own  plant, and be responsible to the state and the law. There may be  some party committee secretaries or chiefs who have lost their  positions and caused losses to state property, but this is not  equivalent to no one being responsible for state property in all  enterprises. According to the author's view, it will not do for  "everyone to have authority." It will only be fine if state  property is given to individuals in private ownership.  Therefore, the view taken by this author actually is a kind of  privatization theory which existed as early as several years ago.    To clarify a point, big mistakes were made in our past  economic work. Regarding financial expense allocation, there  were some errors or shortcomings but they were of no direct  relationship to implementing a system of ownership by the whole  people. Steadfast opposition to implementing and protecting a  system of ownership by the whole people essentially is  opposition to implementing and protecting socialism. At a deeper  level, it also is opposition to our regime which we seized from  reactionary rulers in China to destroy imperialism, feudalism  and bureaucratic capitalism, bullying and oppressing the  people's power and their property. The road which such  opposition could take is exceedingly clear.</p>

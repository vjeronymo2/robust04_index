			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABUSED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM LOSES FUNDING CUT APPEAL  </P> <P> Foothill Family Service, a 64-year-old Pasadena agency that operates a  counseling program for sexually abused children, lost an appeal Tuesday in  Sacramento for restoration of $123,000 in state-administered funds.  </P> <P> Foothill, which serves nearly 1,000 abused children each year, had for the last  three years received more than $100,000 annually in federal funds through the  state Office of Criminal Justice Planning.  </P> <P> The agency was not among 12 programs selected for another three years of  funding.  </P> <P> "The de-funding is occurring at a bad time," Foothill Executive Director David  Eisenberg said.  </P> <P> The loss represents about half of the agency's $250,000 annual budget for the  sexual abuse counseling program, he said.  </P></p>

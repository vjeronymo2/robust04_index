There are two primary techniques for performing the replacement:  incubation of the analog with apomembranes and cultivation of  halobacteria that are defective in terms of retinal synthesis on  a medium to which a given retinal analog is added. Since  replacement with the first technique has a negligible effect on  protein structure and interprotein interactions, and the  purple-membrane hydroxylaminolysis involved leads to  irreversible changes in properties, the second technique is  thought to produce analogs with a protein structure that is  closer to native and with certain properties that differ from  those of analogs obtained with the first technique. The  researchers here studied the structural and functional  differences between the bacteriorhodopsin 4-keto analog obtained  via the insertion of a retinal analog into apomembranes  consisting of either the R1M1 or ET-1000 strains and the pigment  obtained via the cultivation of the JW-5 mutant retinal-free  strain on a medium containing 4-keto-retinal. The absorption  spectrum of the pigment from the JW-5 strain had no  retinal-oxime absorption band, but did possess a minor band at  410 nm that, in terms of peak, coincided with the band of  brown-membrane cytochrome b. The circular dichromism spectrum of  the pigment lacks the typical pronounced doublet, and one  positive band predominates, with only small distortions. Opsin  fluorescence output is twice that in 4-keto-BR, and the spectral  peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths by 2-3 nm. No  light-adaptation spectral effects were observed in the pigment  from the JW-5 strain. The dependence of the constant for the  intermediate M rates of decay is lg(k) approximately -pH/5 at pH  5-7, and lg(k) approximately -pH/1.25 at pH 7-9.

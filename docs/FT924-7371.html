			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Wise words on Germany GERMANY'S FIVE wise men make a good case for independent economic advice with their latest economic report. They also demonstrate why governments that are not required to commission independent advice are loath to do so. For the economic advisers have no need to pull their punches. The west German economy faces the prospect of a recession next year, they say, unless the federal and Lander governments act to control public-sector wages and subsidies. If the German government fails to act, the populations and governments of both Germany and Europe will know whom to blame. German monetary policy will determine the prospects for economic growth in west Germany and western Europe next year. The wise men's forecast of zero growth in west Germany in 1993 assumes that west German economic growth will be half a per cent by the second half of the year. But the recovery is dependent on lower German interest rates well before then. Yet the wise men neither blame the Bundesbank for Germany's current problems nor urge rate cuts now. The Bundesbank is rapped on the knuckles for the manner in which it raised interest rates in July only to drop them again in September. But it is the federal and Lander governments that are lashed by the wise men's collective tongue. It is their failure to outline a credible strategy for bringing the budget deficit under control and the lack of leadership on wages which are responsible for keeping interest rates high. Inflation concern Unfortunately for the central bank, high interest rates and a strong exchange rate have limited direct effects on Germany's current inflationary pressures. These policies are certainly squeezing inflation in the internationally exposed sectors of the economy: industrial output fell in September by 2 per cent, while wholesale prices actually fell in October. Yet domestic wage pressures and the cumulative effects of loose fiscal policy mean that service sector inflation is still running at above 5 1/2 per cent a year. It is the Bundesbank's job to worry first and foremost about inflation, not growth and employment. It can only ease policy when there are clear signs that these service sector inflationary pressures are abating. But white collar civil servants have already made a wage claim for an increase of 5 1/2 per cent next year, while their blue collar colleagues are unlikely to make a lower wage bid. Yet a German inflation rate below 2 per cent requires wage settlements of no more than 4 per cent. Nor have the federal and Lander governments come up with credible and substantial proposals to tighten fiscal policy and so take some of the strain off monetary policy. Indeed, the wise men point out that the projected path for general government borrowing over the next few years is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions about the rate of growth of nominal gross domestic product. The federal government expects government borrowing to halve from DM120bn last year to DM66bn in 1996. But the wise men expect borrowing to rise to DM136bn. Industrial recession For now, there can be little doubt a medium-term objective of price stability requires the Bundesbank to keep policy tight. The Bundesbank may well wait at least until the public sector wage negotiations are under way before deciding to cut the discount rate. Yet the longer the Bundesbank delays before cutting interest rates, the greater the chance that the industrial recession, of which yesterday's profit warning from Daimler-Benz provides further evidence, will spread to the whole economy. Sadly a recession is the only, albeit blunt, tool the Bundesbank has available to achieve its anti-inflationary objectives. The German government does have the power to make the Bundesbank's job easier. A credible plan to reduce the fiscal deficit over the next four years, detailing cuts in spending and subsidy now and tax increases when the economy recovers, would make it much easier to ease monetary policy. Meanwhile, Chancellor Kohl's solidarity talks must deliver a firm commitment to wage restraint from both the public and private sector unions. If the government fails to act, Germany will continue to suffer from deepening stagflation. Mr Kohl's European partners desperately need him to show leadership. Without it, Europe's economic prospects are going to look increasingly bleak.</p>

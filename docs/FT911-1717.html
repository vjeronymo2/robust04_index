			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financial sector draws inspiration from US THE CONTINENT re-opened after Wednesday's May Day holiday in a positive mood yesterday. Financial stocks were inspired by the US interest rate cut and Wall Street's strength, writes Our Markets Staff. Madrid remained shut. PARIS bounced 2.5 per cent higher, after the interest rate cuts in the US and a rise in the Matif. The CAC 40 index gained 45.05 to 1,824.23 in fairly good turnover of about FFr2.5bn, up from FFr1.9bn. One dealer said that the rally was stronger than expected, suggesting that the index could test the 1,850 level again in the near term, although failure to break that resistance level could lead to another modest setback. The financial sector was strong: Bancaire picked up FFr34 or 6.8 per cent to FFr534, Societe Generale rose FFr25.40 or 6.1 per cent to FFr441.50 and Axa Midi gained FFr53 or 5.1 per cent to FFr1,090. Suez added FFr11.50 to FFr349.40 on heavy volume of 577,960 shares after Tuesday's results. Nouvelles Galeries remained suspended at its April 26 price of FFr780. Galeries Lafayette rose FFr13 to FFr1,720; the stores company, which has been forced to bid for Nouvelles Galeries after raising its stake, offered FFr863.50 a share. FRANKFURT rose as institutional buy orders hit a dry market and on the news that the Bundesbank had left interest rates unchanged at its regular meeting. The DAX index advanced 24.25 or 1.5 per cent to 1,630.04, its highest close since August 30. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, put on 9.21 or 1.4 per cent to 689.97. Volume rose to DM5.8bn from DM4.1bn. Bank shares rose on interest rate optimism. Deutsche Bank jumped DM12.50 to DM656.30 and Dresdner Bank climbed DM7 to DM380. Viag, the diversified utility group which has bought the European activities of Continental Can of the US, rose DM4 to DM362. After the market closed, Viag said its new shares to be issued as part of a one-for-eight capital increase would be priced at DM285 each. In the retail sector, Karstadt fell DM6.50 to DM647.50 on profit-taking after its recent strength. In pharmaceuticals, Schering eased DM4.70 to DM773.50 after the company said it expected 1991 group earnings to be flat. MILAN was led higher by the banking and insurance sectors. The Comit index rose 5.72 to 581.53 but volume remained thin at an estimated L120bn. Generali, the country's largest insurer, rose L390 to L36,840 while Mediobanca advanced L350 to L15,950. Tuesday's settlement of the battle for control of the publisher Mondadori continued to focus attention on the shares involved. Trading in Mondadori non-convertible savings shares was suspended until the close, when they were set at L14,600, up 13.2 per cent or L1,700, while L'Espresso, the newspaper and magazine publisher, surged L2,200 or 9.6 per cent to L25,000. In telecommunications, Sirti rose L390 or 3.1 per cent to L12,970 after winning a big contract from Sip. But Benetton, the leisure clothes manufacturer, was held back by further details of its planned capital increase. The company said at its annual meeting just before May Day that it planned to raise up to L15bn nominal or 30m shares by the end of 1993, possibly via a convertible bond. The shares rose L50 to L8,450. AMSTERDAM came off the day's highs on profit-taking as the dollar fell back. The CBS tendency index closed 0.8 up at 96.2 after hitting 96.5 earlier. Philips advanced another Fl 1 to Fl 30 after its good first-quarter results the previous day. But DSM, the chemical company, fell Fl 1 to Fl 114.30 on lower-than-expected first-quarter results. ZURICH's Credit Suisse index rose 2.9 to 552.5. CS Holding's bearers gained SFr60 to SFr2,160 and its registered shares added SFr8 to SFr405 after its 1990 results. The group's shares had fallen on the announcement of a dividend cut, but recovered on the news that shareholders would be offered a bonus option. OSLO's volume was boosted by activity in pharmaceutical company Hafslund. Turnover grew from NKr388m to NKr629m, with about NKr161m accounted for by Hafslund, which rose NKr4 to NKr187 after better-than-expected first-quarter results. COPENHAGEN saw further foreign demand for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company. It rose DKr11 to DKr435 on volume of 105,954 shares. Danisco gained another DKr13 to DKr960 after its purchase of east German sugar factories. ISTANBUL continued to recover from its sharp falls in the first two days this week. The index gained 196.53 or 5.2 per cent to 3,985.84.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - May 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1118.81  1119.16  1122.58  1124.25  1125.61  1127.27  1125.40  1128.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        Day's High   1128.32     Day's Low   1118.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 1      Apr 30     Apr 29     Apr 26     Apr 25 1110.32+   1111.29    1120.75    1115.94    1122.55  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) +Indicative.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

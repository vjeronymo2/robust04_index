			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> FINAL OK FOR WATER PLAN  </P> <P> Emergency water-rationing measures received unanimous final approval by the  City Council on Tuesday night. Responding to California's drought, the council  enacted the measures that limit lawn watering to twice a week and prohibit  residents from filling pools unless they are new or in need of repair.  </P> <P> The measures, now in effect, add to the city's list of water measures approved  last year. Those measures include a ban on lawn watering between 10 a.m and 4  p.m. and the use of running water to wash cars.  </P> <P> The emergency ordinance also outlaws the hosing down of driveways and sidewalks  and requires restaurants to display placards on tables that state water will be  served only upon request. The ordinance will be in effect until the council  determines that there is no longer a water crisis. Violators could face a $20  or 20% surcharge on their water bills, whichever is more, and a $100 fine. The  council also hopes residents will voluntarily reduce water use by 10%. To meet  that goal, the city has distributed low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators  and has offered to inspect lawns and irrigation systems for water-use  efficiency.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINE;  </P> <P> TENNESSEE EYEING SUGAR BOWL  </P> <P> Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors says his team is aiming for a berth in the Sugar  Bowl, and he has not discussed with his players the possibility of playing in  the controversy-ridden Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz.  </P> <P> The 14th-ranked Volunteers play No. 15 Mississippi on Saturday, and a loss  would probably end Tennessee's hopes for a Southeastern Conference championship  and a trip to New Orleans.  </P> <P> Controversy has surrounded the Fiesta Bowl because of some teams' reluctance to  play in a state that rejected a holiday in memory of slain civil rights leader  Martin Luther King Jr. Majors said he has not talked about that with his  players.  </P> <P> "It is our desire to try our best to play our way into the Sugar Bowl," he  said. ". . . That's all I've talked to the players about.  </P> <P> "Otherwise I will not have anything else to add about any other arrangements,  and will not address that issue personally unless things change Saturday."  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Perot outspending both rival camps MR Ross Perot is now spending more money on his independent campaign than President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton combined, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. The latest figures from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show that, in the first two weeks of October, Mr Perot paid Dollars 26m (Pounds 15.9m) from his own pocket, against the Bush campaign's outlay of Dollars 12.3m and the Clinton camp's Dollars 11.9m. By law the two main party candidates, receiving about Dollars 55m each in federal funding, may spend no more than Dollars 65.5m. According to the FEC, Mr Bush was left with Dollars 23.5m in the bank for the final three weeks and Mr Clinton Dollars 14.5m. Since Mr Perot's effort is entirely self-financed he is subject to no limits, although he must report what he spends. Almost all his outlays are on a massive advertising campaign - Dollars 23.6m in the first two weeks of October alone - and, if he maintains the current rate, he may exceed the permitted ceiling for the other two. So far he has spent Dollars 48m on his own cause. The Perot camp finally announced yesterday their candidate would do some 'conventional' campaigning - making appearances tomorrow at rallies in Flemington, New Jersey, and in Pittsburgh. Concentrating solely on paid-for advertising, apart from his 'free' participation in the presidential debates, means Mr Perot has had to answer no questions from the media. Both the Bush and Clinton campaigns, worried by his upward movement in the polls, have been pressing the media to investigate Mr Perot's record, much as they did earlier in the summer. ABC TV reported on Thursday night that it had found no evidence to substantiate one of Mr Perot's claims that a band of would-be assassins hired by the North Vietnamese had once penetrated his family compound in Dallas, only to be repelled by his guards. Otherwise he is still getting off lightly. Vice-President Dan Quayle insisted on TV yesterday that the race was between Mr Bush and Mr Clinton and that Perot supporters should 'think long and hard about whether they really want to throw their vote away'. However, the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows the gap between Mr Clinton and Mr Bush to be twice as big as that between Mr Bush and Mr Perot. It gives Mr Clinton 47 per cent, Mr Bush 28 per cent and Mr Perot 19 per cent. In electoral college terms - where 270 votes are needed for victory - Mr Perot is not yet a threat to carry a single state. The latest compilation of state polls by Hotline, a political newsletter, has Mr Clinton ahead in 39 states with 421 college votes, Mr Bush in seven with 45, leaving five states, worth 72 votes, reckoned a tie. Only in Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming, amounting to 10 college votes, does Mr Perot score 20 per cent or more. PRESIDENT George Bush declared yesterday the US could 'begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam war', writes Jurek Martin. Following a White House debriefing by a US mission just returned from Hanoi, Mr Bush said he would immediately authorise 'modest' humanitarian aid to Vietnam, mostly for flood relief. This is in return for documentation provided by Vietnam on the unknown fate of more than 2,200 Americans held prisoner of war and missing in action. Mr Bush said 'we will begin reviewing what further steps we can take with Hanoi. We appreciate what's been done.' Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was a former prisoner of war and part of the US delegation, said Vietnam was now 'desperate for economic assistance'.</p>

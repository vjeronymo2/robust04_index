			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides again on CPI THE DOLLAR again slipped sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday after low consumer price data invited speculation that the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates, writes James Blitz. The US currency hit a low of DM1.5691 after the consumer price data showed that inflation grew by a meagre 0.1 per cent in May and by 0.2 per cent in the non-food and energy sectors. The market had been expecting a rise of 0.3 per cent for both figures. By the end of the European session, the dollar had clambered back up to close at DM1.5770, compared to a previous close of DM1.5790. But analysts feel that the downside risk for the US currency remains strong. 'The figures show that the Fed has all the room in the world to ease monetary policy,' said one bank trader. The dollar's weakness is exacerbated by the German currency's growing strength in the European Monetary System. The tremors created by Denmark's 'No' to the Maastricht treaty have started to fade away, but the markets now have to contend with Ireland's referendum next Thursday. Opinion polls indicate that the Irish will endorse the treaty, but the market will remain jittery. Yesterday, two currencies were still suffering Maastricht blues. The Bank of Spain intervened in the market in the morning, selling D-Marks against the Spanish peseta at around Pta63.06. This came after Spain's consumer price index for May showed a higher than expected rise of 0.3 per cent. The Bank regards the containment of inflation as one of its main priorities, and will thus want to keep the currency strong. The peseta closed stronger at Pta62.88 compared to a previous close of Pta63.09. The Italian lira was also supported by intervention, as the Bank of Italy sold about DM60m at the midday currency fixing. But the currency still fell back to Lira757.20 to the D-Mark from a previous close of Lira756.40. Senior Italian officials said that Italian money market rates were adequate to defend the currency if next week's Irish vote starts to look uncertain. Sterling, which has suffered alongside the lira all week, gained against both the D-Mark and the dollar after May's UK retail prices index was unchanged at 4.3 per cent for the year. The pound closed up 1/2 a pfennig at DM2.9200. Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.8520 from a previous close of Dollars 1.8460. The yen weakened marginally against the D-Mark after the May Tankan report on business performance confirmed the broad weakness of the Japanese economy. The D-Mark rose to Y80.31 from a previous close of Y80.27.</p>

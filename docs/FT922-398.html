			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / RiverBus fund angers tenants CANARY WHARF tenants showed further signs of restiveness yesterday. There was no sign, however, that any companies would follow Texaco in delaying relocation to the London Docklands site that has been placed in administration. Anger is focused on payments for the RiverBus service on the Thames. The administrators have refused to underwrite the service's losses after Tuesday. A consortium of Docklands interests is planning measures to maintain the service for another three months. Several Canary Wharf tenants have joined the scheme while voicing strong discontent. One tenant said yesterday: 'If for any reason the funding for the RiverBus fails, which relies on the administrators putting their share into the pot, then on July 1 there are a number of people who will see the auditors as being in breach of contract. 'Next week is the time when we will see action of some sort or other.' Several tenants are said to be considering their position, but none appeared yesterday to have decided to follow Texaco's move, which was interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on the administrators. Another comment was that the estate was not being maintained to the same standard as it had been until the end of May. However, the development's most committed tenants are all expected to stay in place.</p>

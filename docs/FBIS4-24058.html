			<p>BFN     [Text] Deposed Ethiopian dictator, Mengistu Haile-Mariam,  is reported to be advising the Zimbabwean Government on  intelligence gathering, security, and weapons purchases.  Zimbabwe's independent DAILY GAZETTE said Mr. Mengistu began  acting as a consultant to the Central Intelligence Organization  and the ministry responsible for state security several months  after being granted political asylum in Harare in 1991.    The newspaper said his role revolved around training  programs  on intelligence tactics and the acquisition of modern armaments.  The Zimbabwean Government has refused to comment on the report.</p>

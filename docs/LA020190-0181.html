The children  were named heroes and each was given $250 in savings bonds by the residential  security firm Westec.  </P> <P> Westec, based in Irvine, has given heroism awards to 11 other Southern  California children since starting the program last year to recognize youths  who save lives or prevent injury by quick action in emergencies.  </P></p>

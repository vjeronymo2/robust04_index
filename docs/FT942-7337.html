			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Unions face biggest bill in Pounds 1.5m Labour leader poll The Labour leadership election is likely to cost about Pounds 1.5m, of which only Pounds 100,000 will be borne directly by the party, it emerged yesterday. Most of the cost will fall on affiliated unions which will have to organise postal ballots of more than 4m members who pay the political levy. The TGWU and the GMB, the two biggest general unions, said the gross cost of balloting their 1.8m members would be about Pounds 300,000 each. Some unions, such as the AEEU craft union, will reduce costs by sending ballot papers with routine literature such as union journals. Labour officials said that up to a third of the cost might be recouped by combining the ballot with a membership drive and delivery of marketing and advertising material.

The election will make only a small dent in the union movement's financial contribution to Labour, which is running at about Pounds 9m a year. Union funds cover about half of the annual running costs of the party and provide the bulk of the election fund, which is expected to amount to about Pounds 20m by 1996. Union leaders are more concerned about the political implications of the leadership election. Officials say that a large number of affiliated unions are likely to refrain from endorsing any of the potential candidates when nominations open after the European elections on June 9. Like many Labour activists, union officials want to back the candidate most likely to win an election. Many grudgingly believe that will be Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. However, some union leaders have too many reservations about Mr Blair's modernist views on union and employment issues to offer him public support. Some union leaders also fear their authority would be undermined if they publicly endorsed a candidate who was then rejected by a majority of rank-and-file members. Many officials say the election has revealed a cultural shift in unions. 'For the first time . . . almost everyone . . . is deciding who to back on the basis of who can win the election, not on the basis of ideology,' said one official, adding: 'It is an extraordinary cultural change.'</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Return of Portugal's capitalist families: The restoration of the businesses that fell in the 'revolution of the carnations' 20 years ago Twenty years ago men like Mr Ricardo Salgado Esprito Santo were depicted in graffiti on the walls of Lisbon wearing top hats, smoking fat cigars and clutching fistfuls of dollars. A large boot was usually drawn behind them showing what the young army captains who seized power on April 25 1974 planned to do with the capitalists who had prospered under 48 years of right-wing dictatorship. The boot landed in 1975. Like other business leaders, the Esprito Santos, the second largest of seven family groups that accounted for almost three-quarters of Portugal's gross domestic product under the dictatorship of Salazar and latterly Caetano, lost 95 per cent of their assets through nationalisation. Long-haired commandos marched their patriarchs into jail. Others fled into exile. Two decades later, Mr Esprito Santo now appears on the glossy covers of Portuguese business magazines and is respectfully interviewed on television. Back as president of the bank wrested from his family for 17 years, he is admired by a society that unashamedly prizes business success despite all the efforts made during the 'revolution of the carnations' to bury capitalist values. Families such the Esprito Santos, the Mellos and the Champalimauds lost almost everything, started afresh abroad and returned after making enough money to buy back the companies that had been taken from them. They have been welcomed back with open arms - but virtually no financial compensation - by a government eager to stimulate private enterprise to help Portugal compete in the single European market. Even the 'angry young captains' who led the 1974 coup show little resentment. 'Personally, I would have liked to have seen Portugal evolve into a less markedly capitalist society,' says Lt Col Vasco Lourenco, a hero of the revolution. 'The patronage of the old regime enabled these businessmen to flourish. But no stigma should be attached to them today because they are competing on the same terms as everyone else.' Mr Esprito Santo believes he has earned the endorsement. 'What most pleases me about our return to Portugal is that we have proved we are true entrepreneurs who can survive in a competitive international market without the government protection we enjoyed before the revolution.' The Salazar regime promoted a handful of powerful business families by regulating which companies could operate in which sectors and closing the country off to foreign investment. This oligarchy sheltered business groups from competition but also prevented them from developing entrepreneurial skills and a free-market mentality. 'It was only when we were forced to start again from scratch outside the country that we learned what it takes to survive in an open market,' said Mr Esprito Santo. The centre-right government of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, is reversing the post-revolutionary nationalisations with a re-privatisation programme that has already turned most of the financial sector over to private owners and is now focusing on industrial companies. 'The alternatives to capitalism we put forward have clearly failed,' said Col Lourenco, acknowledging the financial ruin that has beset many nationalised companies. Mr Lus Mira Amaral, industry minister, said: 'Portugal deeply wronged the businessmen whose companies were taken over by the state. The right policy would have been to allow the survival of the fittest by liberalising the economy. We are happy they are returning. We need all the successful businesses we can get.' But there have been no special privileges. Mr Jose Manuel de Mello complains that the prices of re-privatised companies are far in excess of what their former owners were paid in compensation. They were awarded 28-year bonds, widely described as 'wallpaper', paying 2.5 per cent interest when inflation was running at 30 per cent. One former owner estimated the compensation represented 2 per cent of the market value of his shares and many are still fighting in the courts for what they consider just compensation. Mr de Mello's family owned Companhia Uniao Fabril, an industrial conglomerate of more than 100 companies that was broken up and largely nationalised after the revolution. His survival raft was Lisnave, a ship-repair yard that escaped state takeover. He is now lining up a Esc100bn (Pounds 387m) bid for control of Banco Totta e Acores, a bank formerly owned by his family but controlled by Banesto, the Spanish bank, since its re-privatisation in 1989. When soldiers with machine guns burst into a board meeting of Banco Esprito Santo (BES) to arrest the directors on March 11 1975, the family owned the bank, the insurance company Tranquilidade, shareholdings in many of Portugal's leading companies and extensive coffee, sugar and cotton plantations in Angola and Mozambique, then Portuguese colonies. 'We were left only with a few art objects and our homes, which we sold at very low prices because they were threatened with occupation,' said Mr Esprito Santo. Mr Manuel Esprito Santo Silva, his cousin and then president of the group, spent five months in jail, crammed in a cell with 14 others. He was summarily tried for economic sabotage, acquitted and released. He died in London, aged 57, before his family regained control of its bank and insurance company. The group's six senior partners went into exile, regrouping in Luxembourg where they mustered Dollars 20,000 to set up Esprito Santo International Holding. They founded a small bank in Brazil and raised capital on the international bond market. In 1986, Mr Mario Soares, Portugal's Socialist prime minister who is now president, asked them back. Mr Soares said this spirit of forgiving, also extended to the Pide, the political police of the former regime, had been essential to Portugal's successful transition to democracy. The Esprito Santos began again in Portugal by opening a small merchant bank in partnership with France's Credit Agricole. They bought control of Tranquilidade when it was re-privatised in 1989 and of BES in 1991, re-establishing themselves as the country's leading financial family. 'The employees wanted us back and turned down the offer of a Spanish bank to finance a management buy-out,' said Mr Esprito Santo. 'Our dedication is now to our work, not to remembering the past.'</p>

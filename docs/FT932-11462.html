			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Fresh doubts raised about US recovery FRESH SIGNS of US economic weakness emerged yesterday with an unexpected plunge in one of the key indicators for the manufacturing industry. The Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.7 per cent in April against 53.4 per cent in March, partly as a result of a sudden drop in new orders. This was the lowest reading since last September and far below the projections of Wall Street analysts, who had expected a modest firming of the index. A reading below 50 per cent is generally regarded as evidence that the manufacturing sector is contracting. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending, hit by severe winter weather, had fallen 0.8 per cent in March, the first decline in seven months. Spending, however, remained 5 per cent higher than in March last year. The fall in the purchasing managers' index is significant because it suggests that economic weakness in the first quarter carried over into April. Last week the Commerce Department reported a sharp decline in economic growth - to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter compared with 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. 'After sustaining a high level of growth for five months, new orders collapsed,' said Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for national purchasing managers. If orders did not revive, the 'current economic malaise' would continue, he said. The purchasing managers' new orders index fell to 51.1 per cent last month against 58 per cent in March. The index for production fell to 51.8 per cent compared with 57.4 per cent. Some relief, however, was provided by an unexpected increase in the index for new export orders, which rose to 53.2 per cent against 49.9 per cent in March, despite the slowdown in Europe and Japan.

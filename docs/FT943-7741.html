			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Boost for Clinton as House approves crime bill The US House of Representatives approved a controversial Dollars 30.2bn crime bill yesterday , giving much-needed support to the wobbling presidency of Mr Bill Clinton. Democrats and moderate Republicans joined forces to approve legislation which had been years in the making and provides - over six years - almost Dollars 10bn for prisons, Dollars 8.8bn for police, and Dollars 4.3bn for 'crime prevention' social programmes. It was passed by 235 to 195, with 46 Republicans joining those in favour. If the bill is passed by the Senate, to which it will be swiftly sent, the president will have a big victory and, he hopes, momentum as his initiatives on healthcare and welfare reform come before Congress in the autumn and the US votes in mid-term congressional elections in November. Conservative Republicans in the Senate may yet try to block the crime bill by a filibuster but, now that the House has passed a measure which seems to have strong support among US voters, such senators could be reluctant to be seen frustrating it. Nine days ago prospects looked bleak for Mr Clinton, when the crime bill failed a procedural vote in the House. The president, his top aides and congressional Democrats then worked feverishly to bring enough of the recalcitrant Democrats into line. Five days ago they began rare negotiations with moderate Republicans, rather than drop a ban on assault weapons, which might have won the votes of conservative pro-gun Democrats. To meet the demands of Republican moderates, the Democrats agreed to a compromise bill which cut Dollars 3.3bn from a Dollars 33.5bn bill and eliminated and consolidated many of the clauses favoured by liberal Democrats. The legislation kept the tougher sentencing components, which the administration had hoped would attract conservatives. Funds to provide incentives so that local governments can hire 100,000 police - a Clinton campaign promise - were retained, and local governments were given a greater say on how the funds would be spent. As House and Senate negotiators laboured on through the weekend, two threats to the legislation emerged. A rival bill, was introduced by the conservatives and the gun lobby. It contained no social programmes or ban on assaults weapons. That was defeated, with 30 Republicans voting against the measure. Congress has been trying to pass a significant crime bill for six years. Past legislation addressing the US crime problem failed to stem the violence, despite an imprisonment rate that exceeds every other industrialised country. This crime bill was supposed to be different because it provided for prevention programmes, which had bought liberal support; increased funds for prisons and police; and added a popular gun control measure. Republicans were torn between a desire to deprive the president of a victory and reluctance to face their voters next November having opposed a crime bill. Liberal Democrats wanted a victory for the president and their own re-election, but were reluctant to vote for a bill tilted towards the harsh measures which had been ineffective in the past. Debate was marked by usual partisan excesses, but for a small group in the centre that called for future bipartisan efforts on the nation's difficulties. With polls showing that most Americans consider crime the nation's largest problem, that sentiment prevailed - for the moment.</p>

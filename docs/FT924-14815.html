			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Trieste must wait to relive old glory - Hopes of an economic renaissance have been unfulfilled THERE are today some remarkably glum faces in Trieste, the Italian port city which three years ago thought of itself on the brink of an economic renaissance. Once the port and commercial centre of the Austro-Hungarian empire, many locals believed Trieste would relive its former glories with the political and economic liberalisation of eastern Europe that was expected to follow the fall of the Berlin wall. Even before that, Trieste was reasserting its historical function as a trading centre. On an average Saturday, it would be filled with cars from the former Yugoslavia - and even more distant east European countries - crammed with shoppers after scarce food and consumer goods. While much of the trade was local and for private consumption, the volumes were immense, recalls Mr Pier Giorgio Luccarini, chairman of Cassa di Risparmio di Trieste, the city's savings bank. 'Trieste used to be invaded by Yugoslavs. Rather than just buying one or two pairs of jeans, they would buy 20, keep two and resell the rest.' The local chamber of commerce reckons cross-border business helped to support a disproportionately large retail sector for a city of 230,000. Such flows fostered views that Trieste, isolated from the rest of Italy and vulnerable economically after losing its 'hinterland' of Istria and Dalmatia to Yugoslavia after 1945, was set for an economic boom. 'There was a mood which was irrational and sentimental for the past,' admits Mr Giulio Staffieri, Trieste's mayor. Instead, Trieste's economy has plunged into recession, with rising unemployment and a sharp increase in insolvencies. Retail sales alone have sunk by 40 per cent since hostilities broke out in the former Yugoslavia, the chamber of commerce reckons. Political turmoil in Yugoslavia put an immediate break on trade. While business has picked up since independence in Slovenia, Trieste's immediate neighbour, in mid-1991, commerce with other ex-Yugoslavian states remains depressed. Economic difficulties have also affected Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics, says Mr Luccarini. 'Travel may be easier now than three years ago, but many Hungarians and Czechs have less money to spend than they did under communism.' While commerce and services, on which the city's economy is based, have suffered badly, it has also been hit by the recession in the heavy, public-sector, industries which account for thousands of jobs. The former Ilva steelworks are in receivership after a failed privatisation attempt, the local ship repair yards are in crisis because of overcapacity in the Adriatic, while the state-owned Grandi Motori marine propulsion group is suffering from a shortage of orders. Even the publicly-owned port, Italy's second biggest, is in loss. Though wealthy, the city has one of Italy's oldest populations, while its birth rate is among the lowest. The population has been shrinking steadily for 20 years. Poor transport links with neighbouring east European countries have also impeded trade, says Prof Giacomo Borruso, rector of Trieste University and an expert on transport economics. New road and rail links are on the drawing board, but completion is still a long way off. 'What is missing in Trieste is entrepreneurship,' says Mr Staffieri. 'We need people who will set up new businesses and take advantage of the opportunities for trade with the east that will eventually arise.' Despite the difficulties, local businessmen have taken some initiatives. Eyebrows were raised last December when the savings bank opened a branch in the Slovenian port of Koper, across the bay. 'No one could understand why,' says Mr Luccarini. 'But this is our obvious catchment area. Where else can we find new business?' Heartened by its success, he has just bought a small bank in Croatia. The family-owned Illy coffee group, one of Italy's biggest, is planning to open a factory in Slovenia. Generali, Italy's biggest insurer company and Trieste's best-known company, has been returning to its central European roots with a string of deals in Hungary and Romania. 'When the Berlin Wall fell, we felt we were on the verge of a new beginning,' says Prof Borruso. 'Now we realise it's going to take much longer.'</p>

The newspaper said that the remarks by the president put an  end to rumors appearing in parts of the French press that  Cameroon would leave the franc zone in the wake of the  devaluation of the CFA franc in mid-January.    The leader of the radical opposition, John Fru Ndi,  suggested  that Cameroon should exit the zone and create its own currency.</p>

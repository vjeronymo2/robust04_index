			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Albania protests about Greece Albania urged the US and the Nato alliance yesterday to press Greece to stop 'provocative acts'. This marks a further deterioration in relations between the two Balkan neighbours, at odds over the ethnic Greek minority in Albania. President Sali Berisha recalled Albania's envoy from Athens on Monday as a protest, after a Greek aircraft flew over Albanian territory dropping leaflets calling for the overthrow of the Tirana government. Albania brushed aside Greece's explanation that the flight was an act of a renegade aviator who stole a crop-duster, and has accused Athens of launching a 'Cold War' against Tirana. Tensions have risen since the trial for spying of five ethnic Greeks opened in Tirana this month. Greece says the trial is aimed at intimidating Albania's Greek minority.</p>

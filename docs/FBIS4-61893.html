			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian space surveillance station in Latvia  will be used for scientific purposes after Russia withdraws its  troops from the republic. The station will be utilized for  space, the world ocean and seismic research. This was decided  by the Latvian Academy of Science today.    The radio radar station with a 32-meter parabolic aerial is  situated near Ventspils (180 kilometers to the north-west from  Riga). It is considered one of the three Russian military  strategic facilities on Latvian territory along with the radio  radar station in Skrunda and the military port in Liepaja.    The Latvian Academy stressed that the radio telescope could  be used jointly with the Russian Academy of Science. The two  academies had signed a protocol on intentions in late April.    Head of the Department for Control over Russian troop  withdrawal in the Latvian government, Ilgonis Upmalis,  emphasized that utilization of the station for scientific  purposes would raise the authority of Latvian science and let  Latvia contribute to international research programs.    The Russian military facility will be transferred to Latvia  on August 31, 1994 (after Russian troop withdrawal is over).</p>

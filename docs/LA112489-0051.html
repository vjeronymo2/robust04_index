			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKE-UP CERTAIN, CZECH OFFICIAL SAYS;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS RALLY IN PRAGUE, A PARTY LEADER ASSERTS  THAT 'REAL CHANGES' WILL BE MADE. THE LEADERSHIP MEETS IN EMERGENCY SESSION  TODAY.  </P> <P> More than a quarter of a million people jammed into Prague's main square  Thursday in a rally to support opposition demands for political change, as a  senior Communist Party figure announced that a shake-up in the party's  hierarchy is imminent.  </P> <P> Prague party chief Miroslav Stepan, also a member of the ruling Politburo, told  a group of factory workers in the capital that an emergency party Central  Committee meeting scheduled for today will produce "real personnel changes."  </P> <P> The Central Committee has the power to replace members of the Politburo,  including hard-line party leader Milos Jakes.  </P> <P> Stepan's comments were made amid signs that a major power struggle has been  played out within the Communist Party's hierarchy. Although doubts remained  regarding the outcome, there are signs that reformists may have won the day.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police and the party's own militia reportedly occupied state-run  Czechoslovak television during the day Thursday, but by evening, they had  withdrawn. Also believed to have withdrawn from the capital are militia units  that had arrived Wednesday, triggering rumors that Jakes might use them to  force an end to the weeklong crisis.  </P> <P> The party daily Rude Pravo carried an article criticizing "the lack of  flexibility of the hierarchy, which failed to deal with the crisis situation."  </P> <P> Jakes has been under growing pressure as anti-government demonstrations on an  unprecedented scale have shaken the regime. His resignation, along with those  of five other senior party hard-liners, is a key demand of the political  opposition.  </P> <P> There is mounting speculation that Jakes himself may be forced out today,  although some believe he could attempt to dump others from the Politburo first  in an effort to save himself.  </P> <P> "Jakes is under attack from all sides," said one Communist Party official with  links to the Central Committee.  </P> <P> While the 150-member Central Committee is heavily weighted in favor of  hard-liners, the intensity of the pressure for change is said to have led a  number of members to support turnover.  </P> <P> "There are lots of 'yes, yes' men in there, but already many are swinging  around," the Communist Party official said. "There are lots of strange  bedfellows at the moment."  </P> <P> Jakes heads one of the last hard-line Communist governments in Eastern Europe.  His position has become increasingly precarious since the fall of East German  hard-liner Erich Honecker last month.  </P> <P> A Czechoslovak Communist Party adviser indicated that Jakes also has come under  fire from Moscow, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reportedly  demanding that the Prague regime move ahead with reform.  </P> <P> Jakes reportedly met Thursday with the Soviet ambassador to Prague, Viktor  Lomakin.  </P> <P> Despite the pressure on Jakes, some analysts warned that his departure is not a  foregone conclusion.  </P> <P> "It's premature to say the game is over," one Western diplomat cautioned.  </P> <P> Jakes himself appeared to show no sign of wavering, telling a group of party  workers and trade union organizations in northern Czechoslovakia that he "will  use political means to halt the negative development in society."  </P> <P> Still, party leaders will have to take more than token action to defuse  mounting support for a two-hour, anti-government general strike planned for  Monday, diplomats said.  </P> <P> At Thursday's rally, opposition leader Vaclav Havel announced that more than  500 industrial concerns had pledged support for the strike. The stoppage was  called by the recently formed opposition group Civic Forum to press its demands  for the resignation of hard-liners and punishment for those responsible for  police violence against student demonstrators last Friday.  </P> <P> Although students and intellectuals in many large cities are backing the  strike, the support of the workers is vital if it is to succeed.  </P> <P> The massive rally Thursday, by far the largest to date, clearly gave the  fledgling opposition coalition a powerful emotional boost.  </P> <P> A bit of graffiti sprayed onto a wall near the square summed up the mood of the  largest rally since protesters began gathering in force one week ago:  "Victory."  </P> <P> At one point, the crowd clapped to the rhythm of the American black spiritual,  "Let My People Go."  </P> <P> In what one analyst called Havel's first purely political speech, the dissident  playwright pleaded for greater support for the strike.  </P> <P> "The strike may decide whether we start on the road to democracy or whether an  isolated group of people will win who want to keep all others out -- people who  want to keep power by mouthing empty slogans of reconstruction," he said.  </P> <P> In addition to an appeal to workers to join the strike, Havel also said the  Civic Forum remains prepared for a dialogue with the government to chart the  country's future.  </P> <P> He called on the police and the army "to join the people and, if necessary,  defend them. We want to live in a free, democratic Czechoslovakia. . . ."  </P> <P> At the same rally, the leader of the small Socialist Party, Jan Skoda, allied  himself clearly with the opposition, even though his party remains technically  linked to the Communists as a member of a national front that rules.  </P> <P> "We consider this party again as independent and free," he said. "Our first  task today is a renaissance of the democratic process. . . ."  </P> <P> The opposition received a further boost when former party leader Alexander  Dubcek addressed a pro-strike rally of about 10,000 people in the city of  Bratislava.  </P> <P> A letter from the architect of the country's 1968 liberalization was read at  Wednesday's rally in Prague, and there were rumors he plans to speak at an  opposition rally here.  </P></p>

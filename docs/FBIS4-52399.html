			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, said his  country is ready for the restoration of full diplomatic  relations with the United States at any time. Speaking to Radio  Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, Mr. Kiet  said normalized relations would be in the interests of not only  the two countries, but the entire region. He said full  diplomatic ties were inevitable.    Mr. Kiet committed his government to continuing political  reforms, which, he said, paved the way for economic reforms.  But asked if Vietnam was moving toward a multiparty democracy,  Mr. Kiet said the question was never raised because the priority  was to make the country rich and build a civilized society.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Hopes of EC summit pact raised: Major and Mitterrand to hold meeting on eve of Edinburgh talks EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers made progress yesterday on resolving Denmark's difficulties with the Maastricht treaty on European union, raising hopes of a solution at this week's summit of EC leaders in Edinburgh. However, officials of the British presidency warned last night that new changes sought by the Danes, particularly on defence issues, could prove a fresh obstacle to an agreement. A solution allowing Denmark to put the treaty to a second referendum is seen as the lever needed to reach agreement on the main differences affecting the Community, notably the budget, enlargement and decentralised decision-making. Foreign ministers from several member states, during a meeting in Brussels, raised reservations about a UK draft allowing Denmark legally binding opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty. Italy, Spain, and Germany - acting on legal advice - suggested the UK paper amounted to a new treaty. But Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the Community 'should never leave its fate to lawyers'. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, agreed: 'I am sure legal doubts can be dealt with after today's discussion. After that it is a matter of political will.' The 'conclave' of EC foreign ministers in Brussels was the last high-level gathering of the Twelve ahead of Edinburgh, which many member states believe is doomed to failure. Last night, Downing Street announced that Mr John Major would hold an unscheduled eve-of-summit dinner with President Francois Mitterrand in Edinburgh tomorrow night. The surprise meeting, agreed in a telephone call between the two leaders yesterday, comes after British officials had stressed that no such encounter was necessary due to regular contacts between Paris and London. Nonetheless, the absence of a visit to the Elysee Palace on Mr Major's tour of capitals ahead of the summit had drawn speculation that Anglo-French relations have deteriorated significantly during Britain's six-month EC presidency. Downing Street would say only that Britain and France shared many joint positions on issues to be addressed at Edinburgh. It said consultations were needed on the order of the agenda, including the so-called Danish question. The Brussels talks yesterday were aimed at meeting Denmark's demands for opt-outs on a common currency, a European army, justice matters and EC citizenship. Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal service, who helped draft the UK paper, declared that the UK formula would not require members to re-ratify Maastricht. A new legally refined UK draft will be circulated before Edinburgh, with a final decision unlikely before the end of the summit on Saturday night. 'It is balanced on a razor's edge', said Mr Hurd. Foreign ministers and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, also highlighted their still unresolved differences on 'subsidiarity' - decentralising decision making - and making Community business more open and democratic.</p>

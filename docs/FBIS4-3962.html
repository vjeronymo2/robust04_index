			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The United  Nations Security Council today demanded an immediate cease-fire  by the Bosnian Serbs, under the auspices of the UN Protection  Force (Unprofor), in Gorazde and throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The council, by adopting this resolution, invited the  secretary- general to take the steps necessary to ensure that  Unprofor is able to monitor the situation in Gorazde, one of the  six UN-designated "safe havens" in the republic.    Condemning in the strongest terms the shelling and attacks  by  Bosnian Serb forces against Gorazde over the past two weeks, the  council demanded the withdrawal of these forces and their  weapons to a distance where they no longer constitute a threat  to the safe area.    The council also demanded the immediate release of all UN  personnel currently held by the Bosnian Serb forces, as well as  unimpeded freedom of movement for Unprofor in the fulfillment of  its tasks.    In order to bring together current diplomatic initiatives,  the council called for the intensification of efforts to achieve  a peaceful settlement, with coordination and close consultation  between representatives of the United States and Russia and  those of the United Nations and the European Union.    The council warned that it "stands ready promptly to  consider  taking further measures as required."</p>

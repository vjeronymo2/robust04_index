			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar received Max van  der Stoel, the CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities,  Wednesday [18 May].    Laar told Interfax that he and van der Stoel discussed the  application of the Foreigner Act in the country. Lack of  progress in this field had come under criticism both in Estonia  and abroad. In particular, the European Union had recently  expressed its disappointment over delays with issuance of  residence and work permits to foreigners.    Laar said that van der Stoel had expressed satisfaction over  steps taken recently by government and parliament. In  particular, the foreigners who had been registered as residents  of the country before July 1, 1990, had been allowed to apply  for a permanent permit simultaneously with an application for a  temporary permit. Steps are taken to help the foreigners study  the state language and obtain exit documents, Laar said.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold outshines silver in Peru mining rush - Companies are ever more assiduously seeking the yellow metal GOLD FEVER is gripping Peru. In the face of long-depressed silver prices - the South American country is the second largest producer after Mexico - local mining companies are ever more assiduously seeking the yellow metal; and joining them in the hunt is an increasing number of foreign mining houses. According to Mr Carlos Diez Canseco, general manager of Peru's National Mining Society: 'Gold is what's attracting most of the foreign companies currently visiting Peru'. Canadian, Australian and Korean interest is especially keen, he says. Already well ahead of the field in the gold rush is a consortium formed by Newmont Mining of Denver, the biggest gold producer in the US and BRGM of France, together with Peru's own leading silver producer, the Buenaventura group. Mining is already under way at its Yanacocha gold deposit in the north-central Andes and processing is due to commence on Sunday. It is Peru's first large-scale dump-leaching operation and Newmont Exploration's first venture in the country. Yanacocha - a disseminated, low-grade deposit - is expected to produce 250,000 troy ounces. of gold a year, which will almost double Peru's output. Proven reserve levels guarantee at least seven years' output, and Newmont is exploring further in the surrounding area. Usually, in leaching operations, the ore needs prior crushing. But in the Yanacocha deposits no preparation will be necessary. Trials have established that simple dump-leaching of Yanacocha's porous rock will allow recovery of some 83 per cent of the ore's gold content in the surprisingly short period of 30 days. (About 65 per cent recovery in double the period would be considered normal). Yanacocha's highly soluble ore averages between 1.5 and three ounces of gold per tonne. It is planned to use the Merrill Crowe method for gold recovery, which involves the addition of zinc powder. The end product will be 'dore' bullion, in a mixture of 60 per cent gold, 40 per cent silver. The consortium says it has not yet decided where, or even whether, to refine. Development costs may total Dollars 45m - modest in relation to potential returns. In Chile, according to one member of the consortium, a similar project would involve three times the initial outlay. In fact, projected profitability is such that Buenaventura has obtained a rare development loan from a group of local Peruvian banks. Germany's state development bank DEG and the International Finance Corporation are also expected to participate in the financing. Investment costs are being kept down by subcontracting all the earth-moving to a local company in partnership with Zublin of Germany. The entire operation will employ only about 100 workers. They will live in nearby Cajamarca, obviating the need for camp facilities. Newmont is spending heavily on security for the new operation. And that is not surprising as an earlier joint project with BRGM was halted when guerrillas invaded the mining area. But Cajamarca looks a better security bet - the mine is only 45km by a good road from the departmental capital and guerrilla activity is almost non-existent. As gold enters a mini-boom phase, the long-lasting depression in silver prices has forced all Peru's traditional silver producers to diversify. The Buenaventura group, Peru's leading private producer, has entered into a series of joint ventures with other mining concerns, of which Yanacocha is only one. Buenaventura is still heavily dependent, nevertheless, on silver. 'We're trying to diversify, but it still accounts for around 70 per cent of our sales, down from 85 per cent,' says Mr Roque Benavides. The group has a small percentage in the promising Iscaycruz zinc mine, which is scheduled to start producing in 1995 - other shareholders are BRGM, Paraibuna do Metais and Marc Rich - and an even smaller stake in Cyprus Minerals' bid for the Cerro Verde copper deposit, due for sale in September. Milpo is another largely family-owned Peruvian mining company which has seen a dramatic shift in its business in the past decade. 'In the early '80s and at Dollars 20 an ounce, our output hinged on silver,' says Mr Augusto Baertl, Milpo's managing director. 'But currently silver accounts for only some 15 per cent of total sales - zinc is our main product now, lead is second.' Milpo, however, like most Peruvian mines, has no alternative but to keep mining the silver - 'It's an integral part of the ore; you have to exploit rationally everything you've got,' says Mr Baertl. 'While the silver isn't profitable by itself, at least it adds value to our zinc concentrates.' Milpo is involved in several gold exploration ventures, one with Buenaventura, another with Southern Peru Copper Corporation in the region near Peru's southern border with Chile. If Yanacocha is outstanding for the grade of its ore and ease of exploitation, Peru offers plenty of other gold possibilities. The lure of alluvial deposits on the high plateau of Ananea, running down to the Madre de Dios river basin, has already transformed thousands of peasant farmers into gold panners - and there are prospects for larger-scale operations too. The areas between Ica and Arequipa in the south and around Pataz in the north are also interesting. In the Pataz area Peru's two largest traditional gold mines, Retamas and Poderosa, are doing very nicely. Mineroperu, the state minerals company is also offering a series of already-studied gold deposits to private investors. These include the vast goldfields of San Antonio de Poto, on the high Andean plateau near Puno. But there are several smaller and more easily accessible projects that could be attractive to the medium-sized investor.</p>

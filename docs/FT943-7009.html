			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz to use Volkswagen engines Mercedes-Benz, the German maker of luxury and executive cars, is to buy engines from Volkswagen for use in a future passenger vehicle. It will be the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles. The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology from Mercedes-Benz for a new range of light commercial vehicles. Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles, which are expected to be launched in early 1996. The new vehicle, the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz into one of the fastest growing segments of the European car market, where it will compete with established rivals such as the Renault Espace and new vehicles that are being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW itself. Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year. The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that China will never seek any sphere of  influence or hegemonism in the world and resolutely opposes any  country that tries to resort to hegemonism and power politics  against China.    The Chinese premier made the remarks during his meeting with  Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. presidential national security  adviser here today.    He said that China will not export its own ideology nor its  concept of values; neither will it allow any country to impose  its ideology or concept of values on China.    China respects the internal affairs of other countries and  will never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in  China's internal affairs and detract China from its own road of  development, he stressed.    Li said that China's present policy and road of development,  which are based on prolonged efforts of exploration and  practice, conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese  people.    The premier said that great changes has taken place in the  world since Brzezinski's previous visit to China more than six  years ago.    China takes economic development as its central task and  pursues a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping  the initiative in its own hands, Premier Li Peng said, and these  should be the basic starting point for foreign observers to  understand China.    "Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes in their  decision- making if they base their understanding of China  merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese to the  ignorance of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese  people," the premier said.    Li said that China's development and growth in its strength  constitute an important factor contributing to world peace,  adding that in international exchange, China strictly observes  the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, posing no threat  to any other country or provoking any disputes or confrontation.    On Sino-U.S. relations, Li said he appreciated President  Clinton's attitude of hoping to see a powerful, stable and  prosperous China and the Chinese Government hopes that Sino-U.S.  relations will gradually improve and develop.    Brzezinski said that China is a very important country, both  regionally and globally, and it is a major factor for world  stability.    He believed that a closer U.S.-Sino relationship would be  good for both countries and this fact cannot be changed by the  differences between them.    Expressing his happiness with China's progress in its  foreign  relations, Brzezinski said that he had carefully studied Premier  Li's recent speeches concerning China's policy of developing  relations with four Central Asian countries, and he believed the  policies were of universal significance.    From a long-term point of view, he said that he was  optimistic about the future of U.S.-Sino relations, which will  occupy a most important position in the U.S. foreign policy.    Prior to the meeting, Premier Li Peng gave a brief interview  to CBS reporter Constance Yu-hwa Chung and answered her  questions on U.S.-Sino relations.</p>

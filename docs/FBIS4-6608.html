			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) </F> Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, and  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi at a joint  news conference with unidentified correspondents at the Diet  building in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Murayama] I am Murayama of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Since the moderator asked me to explain  the details of what we discussed at the party leaders' meeting,  I will now do so.    The party leaders' meeting started at 1400 [0500 GMT] in the  Standing Committee chairman's room. As has been explained,  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa acted as chairman of the  meeting. As the moderator said, we had long discussions at the  meeting. I am sure all of you have a list of what we discussed  and confirmed at the meeting. The party leaders confirmed a  total of 10 policies -- nine policies plus one supplementary  policy -- and signed an agreement. After the discussions,  Chairman Hosokawa said he wanted to discuss with us the  selection of a candidate for the next prime minister. I  immediately said that I wanted to recommend Tsutomu Hata, who  served as deputy prime minister of the Hosokawa administration,  for the post, saying that he is the most suitable candidate.  After each party leader explained his opinion, the meeting  unanimously endorsed Tsutomu Hata as a candidate for the next  premiership. After that, the meeting was ended. That is what  we discussed at the meeting.    [Unidentified moderator] Now, I would like to ask the  Komeito chairman to speak.    [Ishida] We had serious policy debate during the past two  weeks. As a result of it, we reached an agreement on the items  needed to be confirmed for formation of a new coalition  government. After agreeing on the items, we decided to recommend  Tsutomu Hata as the next prime minister. Now we have agreed on  formation of the second coalition government, I feel that each  party has shouldered quite a heavy responsibility.    Moreover, the opening paragraph of the policy agreement  states that we will unite under the banner of reform, which the  Hosokawa administration called for, to regain the people's trust  in politics. Because of this, I think that continuation of  efforts for realization of reform is one of the main tasks of  the second coalition government. Moreover, various opinions  were expressed during the policy debate and I think it is a very  important task of the new coalition government to play a  responsible role in dealing with the international situation.    Another task is that we have to start budget deliberations  as  soon as possible to accelerate economic recovery. Steady  economic recovery is the major task of the second coalition  government. These are what we are determined to do.    [Unidentified moderator] The next speaker is DSP Chairman  Ouchi.    [Ouchi] I am Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist  Party of Japan. Our party has asserted not only that a new  leader to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be  decided within the framework of the current coalition  government, but also that it should be clarified to the people  what the new administration intends to do. As a result of many  hours of policy discussion, coalition representatives have  pulled their hearts together to successfully work out an  agreement, even though it was a formidable task. This is a  historical achievement in the history of Japanese politics as  regards coalition governments. Clarifying policies and forming  a new cabinet are important responsibilities of the coalition  government which must be fulfilled for the sake of the people.  Since I felt this has been achieved, I gave it my appraisal.  After carefully considering in our own way who should be chosen  leader from among the coalition alliance, we judged that Tsutomu  Hata, who is deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign  minister, was the most appropriate candidate based on his  character, knowledge, and ability. I made a statement to that  effect at the meeting of coalition party leaders, explaining  that our party fully endorsed Hata. Should a new coalition  government under Hata be formed, its major responsibility would  be to first have Diet deliberations carried on as smoothly as  possible regarding the draft budget bill, which is what the  people want right now, and have it enacted as soon as possible.  I also feel this would tentatively be the most important key to  help bring about economic recovery. There are still problems  which need to be solved before political reform can be  completely carried out. While continuing to work toward this  end, it will be necessary as soon as possible to settle those  issues which will be particularly important from now on,  particular among them relations with the United States,  especially regarding economic ties which continue to be  entangled. In view of the upcoming Naples summit, I also feel  improving Japanese-U.S. relations is an impending issue. Many  other problems have accumulated. The fact that coalition  representatives have conducted heated debates on such issues as  tax system reform and the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms  development is extremely significant. The new administration  must carry out its policies by building a foundation on the  results of such debates. This is a great task that will be  imposed on the new administration. We plan to give our full  support so the new administration can carry out this task. That  is all.</p>

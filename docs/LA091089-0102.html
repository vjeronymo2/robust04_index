			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR MANY PUPILS, SCHOOL HEALTH EXAMS CAN SPELL BIG DIFFERENCE FOR FUTURE  </P> <P> The first-grader smiled shyly as school nurse-practitioner Sue Horn measured  his height and weight, then asked him to walk and hop along a straight line of  masking tape on the floor.  </P> <P> The San Diego city schools nurse measured his difficulty in hopping with one  foot along the line, in drawing a circle and square, choosing the colors green  and yellow, and in following directions for "above" and "behind."  </P> <P> Horn completed the hourlong physical exam with an extensive check of his eyes,  spine, heart and lungs and the taking of urine and blood samples, at the same  time noting the child's limited vocabulary for his age in responding to simple  questions. And all the while, she both tried to reassure the boy's mother about  the problems showing up and to assimilate information the mother was pouring  forth, including the fact she was on drugs during the boy's pregnancy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rush to Meet Requirements  </P> <P> Horn and the elementary school's regular nurse subsequently have scheduled  appointments between the boy and school specialists in speech and language, and  in special physical education, to draw up plans for helping improve his motor  skills and spur overall development. So far, however, they have had less luck  in persuading the parents to visit a nearby pediatric clinic for additional  medical checks, even  </P> <P> though it would be covered free through their Medi-Cal health eligibility.  </P> <P> Horn, along with colleagues throughout San Diego County and the state, will be  extremely busy during the next three months as they scramble to meet  requirements of a California state law for all first-graders to receive  physical examinations. Countywide, there are more than 37,000 eligible  students, with 483,000 across California.  </P> <P> In a majority of cases, parents have already arranged for the exams themselves  with their regular pediatricians, who send the results to school nurses and  note areas where school specialists can follow up.  </P> <P> But to cover the growing number of cases of families on limited incomes with no  medical care -- such as the boy examined by Horn the other day -- the state  provides funds to all county health departments. For smaller school districts  such as Oceanside, county health administrators make arrangements with 240 area  doctors to perform the physicals. In cases such as the San Diego Unified  district, the nation's eighth largest, the health department contracts with the  district's nursing division. The state spends $86 million annually for its  Child Health and Disability Prevention Program.  </P> <P> "Schools try to be forceful on compliance," but there are no penalties for  districts not able to persuade parents to schedule exams, even at no cost, said  Phyllis Elkind, who monitors the program in San Diego County. "It depends on  both the nature of the student population as well as district commitment . . .  the lower figures are generally but not always in areas with higher turnover of  kids, with language barriers, and where they are close to the border."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unknown Health Problems  </P> <P> Statewide compliance last year was 82.5% of all first-graders, with the county  figure slightly below. For individual county districts, percentages ranged from  55.4% in National City, 56.1% in San Ysidro, 61% in San Marcos, 72.7% in  Oceanside, 78.6% in San Diego Unified, 86% in Poway, to 100% in Lemon Grove,  Rancho Santa Fe and Valley Center.  </P> <P> Statewide, the health screenings find that one in 10 children has an unknown  health problem, with the figure 15% in San Diego County, Elkind said.  </P> <P> Of the 20% of students countywide annually whose parents ignore requests for  screening, Elkind said they present little if any health risk to the general  school population, in large part because the parents must nevertheless have  presented proof of required immunizations for acute contagious diseases before  enrollment is permitted.  </P> <P> "The (lack of a screening) creates more of an individual problem, in that we  might miss problems in vision, or hearing, or not notice developmental delays  or congenital type of problems that will become more serious in later years,"  Elkind said.  </P> <P> Horn's examination of the first-grader touched on the many issues that urban  schools face in trying to improve the health of children from lower  socioeconomic areas. The exam was the first that the boy had received since  being treated in an emergency room for epilepsy several years earlier, the  mother told Horn. Despite Medi-Cal eligibility, neither the boy nor his little  sister has a pediatrician.  </P> <P> "I've always wondered how much things would cost," she said. Not until the  mother received one of many fliers sent out by the school beginning nine months  ago did she learn that the screening could be done free. The mother's concern  was evident, as she asked Horn questions during the exam and even asked to have  the wall poster warning against drugs to show her husband, whom she said is  still hooked on them as well as on alcohol.  </P> <P> But Horn said that, although many parents are genuinely interested in their  children's health, they have little understanding of how to use the school  system or the health establishment to their benefit. Even for those who agree  to the screenings, only about half accompany their children, school district  figures show.  </P> <P> "It's so frustrating, especially in arranging follow-ups," Horn said later. In  the case of the boy's exam, "all the parents have to do is make one call to the  nearby clinic, but so far, nothing has been done . . . when I called the father  the other day, he told me that his child is fine, no need to see a doctor."  </P> <P> Horn said she and other nurses have the responsibility to talk with parents  over and over, letting them know that the nurses and the system "are there to  help" and somehow get the parents involved.  </P> <P> But the schools can juggle classroom placement, arrange special tutoring for  language development, and monitor improvements even without full parent  participation, Horn said.  </P> <P> Adds colleague Steve Martin, a nurse-practitioner at Sherman Elementary School:  "With these screenings, at least the school can find out early about chronic  conditions that will affect a student's education. . . . Otherwise, they might  not be picked up until the third or fourth grade" when the student is so far  behind developmentally that problems become major."  </P> <P> Were the state program not available, Horn said, many more children would fall  through the cracks.  </P> <P> "And among those kids, we'd miss (developmental problems) that later could show  up as poor attendance, discipline problems, not doing homework, and even  eventually dropping out," she said.  </P></p>

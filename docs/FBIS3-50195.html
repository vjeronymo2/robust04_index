Speaking in a Czech Television's discussion program, Arena,  Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic's entrance into NATO  would depend on the development of the security situation in  Europe.    "If the developments are calm, peaceful, and heading for  democracy in all Eastern and Central European states, ... the  Czech Republic's admission into NATO may be protracted, but this  will pose no risk to our security," Zieleniec said. He added  that he did not think the country would now be facing any urgent  threat.    Zieleniec said it was in the Czech Republic's interest that  the neighbor countries belong to the same political-military  bloc. "No one wants its own border to be the border of  confrontation," he said. He dismissed as false all press  considerations about the Czech Republic's wish to join NATO  before its neighbors. But Zieleniec said that the North  Atlantic Alliance, which jointly guarantees a bigger entity, had  to be effective. The immediate opening of NATO deep eastwards  and embracing states where democracy "is not yet fully  convincing" would be risky.</p>

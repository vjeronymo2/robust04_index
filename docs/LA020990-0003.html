			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY  </P> <P> Two readers with inquiring minds, Harry Bradley and Robert Jeffers, phoned  separately to ask why, in these energy-conscious times, the Department of Water  and Power building downtown is lit up like a Christmas tree at night.  </P> <P> 'Cause . . . it's party time!  </P> <P> The DWP is throwing a birthday bash for itself.  </P> <P> Spokesman Ed Freudenburg explained that the lights-are-on-but-nobody's-home  arrangement is in effect between dusk and 11 p.m. "in honor of the 25th  anniversary of the building," which opened in June, 1965.  </P> <P> The DWP, still smarting from city Controller Rick Tuttle's criticism of two  department lunches totaling $1,800 last year, pointed out that the lighting  costs only "about $90" per day. (Or about $15,000 for the six-month  celebration.)  </P> <P> Freudenburg also said that the lighting consists only of florescent tubing  around the outside of each floor, which gives the impression that the 15-layer  birthday building is more brightly lit than it is.  </P> <P> Still, it's a real surprise party, especially for rate-payers.  </P> <P> You often hear about youthful hackers tapping into complex computer systems.  But USC freshman Tim Needham used an old-fashioned method the other day to  prove there was something faulty with the new, sophisticated security system at  his campus housing facility.  </P> <P> He kicked the door in.  </P> <P> That is, the inside door. First, he had to open the locked outside door. He  accomplished that by jerking the door "a couple of times." And Needham isn't  built like a USC football player.  </P> <P> His feat, which was witnessed by the Daily Trojan's Michael Utley as well as by  an officer of the private security firm that installed the device, set off  fears about the system, which is scheduled to be placed in more than 50  buildings on or near the campus.  </P> <P> But Steve Ward, head of USC's campus police, said that he believes the faulty  setup was confined to one entrance.  </P> <P> "The outside door was broken and there was some warping on the inside one," he  said.  </P> <P> As proof that the system works elsewhere, he said that there have since been  two separate cases of students trying unsuccessfully to kick in other doors.  </P> <P> Perhaps the security company should put them on the payroll as system-testers.  </P> <P> Just when Santa Monica's leaders were no doubt ready to declare "When Veronica  Plays Her Harmonica Down on the Pier at Santa Monica" as the city's official  song, they found a forgotten 1960s tune about the amusement zone.  </P> <P> It's "Santa Monica Pier," recorded by Noel Harrison.  </P> <P> The stirring lyrics include:  </P> <P> I took you down to the pier, dear.  </P> <P>  It was such a fine idea-r.  </P> <P>  Fish and chips and the beer, dear,  </P> <P>  Down on Santa Monica Pier.  </P> <P>  While Harrison also croons about "the music of the merry-go-round," there  isn't a single mention of Veronica's musical instrument.  </P> <P> Speaking of Pier Song 1, Dan Shapiro thinks it would have become a perennial  holiday tune (like Jose Feliciano's "Feliz Navidad") if only the title had been  extended to read:  </P> <P> "When Veronica Plays Her Harmonica Down on the Pier at Santa Monica on  Hanukkah."  </P></p>

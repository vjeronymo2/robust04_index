			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: DRESSING FOR LAUGHS  </P> <P> The Movie: "She Devil."  </P> <P> The look: A contemporary tale of two women in need of an image consultant. When  we first meet them, Meryl Streep as Mary Fisher is a romance writer with a a  corner on pink taffeta iced in ruffles, while Barr's housewife character is  pure polyester tent dresses.  </P> <P> The costume designer: Academy-Award winning designer ('All That Jazz") Albert  Wolsky. His credits are impressive: "Sophie's Choice," "Manhattan," as well as  the current release, "Enemies, A Love Story."  </P> <P> The conflict: Both characters evolve drastically during the course of the  comedy, so the fashion story had to underline their respective personal  developments.  </P> <P> The plan: To take both characters on what Wolsky calls a "voyage of clothes."  In the beginning, Streep's Fisher (shown here) dresses in variations on the  flowery style of British romance novelist, Barbara Cartland. "That was the germ  of the idea," Wolsky explains. He has Fisher floating in cloud-soft silk  charmeuse, taffeta, crepe and chiffon. She wears pink and "face powder" colors  such as beige, ecru, silver gray and lavender. By contrast, Barr's Patchett  epitomizes a woman with a big waist line, bad taste and no time to shop. Wolsky  has her schlepping around in sweats, jeans, jumpers and tasteless polyester  floral print dresses.  </P> <P> The program: Ultimately, when Streep's Fisher attempts to become a serious  writer, her clothes evolve from light to dark, from silk to wool, from flowing  to fitted. As Wolsky puts it, it's a look you might expect from a contemporary  woman writer. Patchett's fashion emancipation begins when she starts her own  employment agency. At her most stylish -- and liberated -- she wears white and  beige trouser suits with long matching coats.  </P> <P> The sources: Wolsky says he designed about half of each character's wardrobes,  and bought the rest at New York stores. For Barr's dowdy period, he did some  shopping at large-size stores in suburban malls, and bought her navy business  suits at Macy's. He overhauled almost everything he bought, adding or removing  details, until each item was unrecognizable. He avoided head-to-toe designer  looks. "I don't think people dress that way," he says.  </P> <P> The payoff: For large women, the stylish Barr can be a fashion role model. By  wearing clean lines, and not hiding under tents, she looks thinner and has a  certain flair. As for Streep, her character somehow looks foolish to the end,  even in her black-chic stage. After all, this is a comedy. BETTY GOODWIN  </P></p>

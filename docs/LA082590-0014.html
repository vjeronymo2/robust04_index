			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROODBERG STORY DIDN'T DESERVE MARATHON SPACE  </P> <P> The worst thing about the Richard Roodberg debacle (Aug. 19) is that The Times  chose to waste so much space -- two long articles of over 3,000 words -- on  this guy.  </P> <P> In the space you used, you could have printed the results of every local  masters track and field meet held this year. That would have been far more  interesting and informative about what masters running is really like.  </P> <P> There are dozens of fascinating, human-interest stories out there about senior  runners. To focus on Roodberg is an embarrassment to The Times, and an insult  to genuine over-40 athletes.  </P> <P> AL SHEAHEN, Editor  </P> <P> National Masters Running News  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / French inflation at 3.1% French prices rose by between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent in April, the 11th consecutive month that France's rate of inflation has been lower than Germany's, writes William Dawkins in Paris. This brings to 1 per cent the rise in French inflation since the turn of the year, or 3.1 per cent over the past 12 months, according to provisional figures. That represents a slight decline in the annual rate, from 3.2 per cent in March. However, economists believe the trend is stable, since prices fell automatically in April thanks to the government's decision to reduce the top rate of VAT from 22 per cent to 18.6 per cent. This month's inflation will be affected by the 10.5 per cent rise in tobacco prices from April 27, part of the government's anti-smoking campaign.</p>

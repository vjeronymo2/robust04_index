			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Violence still setting Mideast agenda: Roger Matthews assesses the latest blow to a failing peace process ISRAEL'S extensive air raids and artillery bombardment of Lebanon yesterday again underlined just how narrow the line is between war and peace in the Middle East. Since October 1991, when the Middle East peace conference convened in Madrid, the main issue in the region has been the unique opportunity that existed for a settlement. But, after 10 rounds of negotiations, it is still violence and the response to it that are setting the agenda. Lebanon's southern border with Israel is where the failures of the peace process are most easily exploited by those most opposed to it. Since its unsuccessful attempts in 1978 and 1982 to impose itself on Lebanon politically, Israel has occupied part of the south, purportedly to protect its territory from rocket attacks. But the occupation invites retaliation, provides a focus for the rivalry between Syria and Israel for influence in Lebanon, and has opened the door to the involvement of Iran through Hizbollah, the radical Shia movement which it largely finances. Hizbollah serves several purposes. It can claim to be acting as a national liberation movement, has a legitimate role in Lebanese political life, but can also reflect the interests of Syria and Iran, at least for as long as the aims of those two countries coincide. It is a measure of Hizbollah's importance to Iran that it continues to be generously funded and well equipped militarily at a time when Tehran itself is in difficulty meeting its international obligations. The increasing sophistication and effectiveness of Hizbollah attacks against Israeli positions in southern Lebanon, especially during this month when seven Israeli soldiers have been killed, was always likely, indeed designed, to draw a response. However, Israel knows from long experience that air attacks will not deter Hizbollah for long, while wider ground operations carry the risk of additional casualties. The reported deaths of several Syrian soldiers in yesterday's attacks also illustrates how easily the conflict could broaden. Syria maintains at least 35,000 troops in Lebanon as part of an agreement between the two governments. Israel, and no few Lebanese, see the Syrian presence as an occupation, but the government in Beirut angrily rejects this. Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanese prime minister, insists that the Syrian forces will withdraw as soon as they are no longer required, which is not the case with Israel. However, there seems to be broad acceptance that the Syrians will not pull back while Israel still occupies part of south Lebanon and the Golan Heights. And despite more than 20 months of negotiations, Syria, Lebanon and Israel have been unable to report any real narrowing of the gaps. The proximity of several of yesterday's air raids to the Syrian border was obviously designed to stress the Israeli accusation that Damascus is ultimately responsible for the increased activity of Hizbollah. There is little argument that, although financed by Iran, most supplies reach Hizbollah through Syrian-controlled territory. The Israelis suspect, with some reason, that Syrian frustration at Israel's refusal to commit itself to withdraw from the Golan Heights is shown by the degree of latitude given to Hizbollah. The danger of further military confrontation in Lebanon therefore remains high, although President Hafez al-Assad, robbed of the diplomatic and military backing of the former Soviet Union, is likely to measure any response with great care. He will not wish to risk his perhaps irreplaceable front-line aircraft against Israel, or expose his surface-to-air missiles in the Bekaa valley to fresh attack. For those reasons Mr Assad is certain to welcome the visit later this week to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. But for the Americans, yesterday's events in Lebanon are the clearest warning yet of the consequences of continued lack of progress in the Middle East peace process.</p>

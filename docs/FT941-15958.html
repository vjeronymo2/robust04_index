			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Arco to take Dollars 450m charge Atlantic Richfield (Arco) is to take a charge of Dollars 450m after tax to cover the costs of shrinking its US oil and gas businesses outside Alaska. The charge, which is to be included in fourth-quarter figures for 1993, follows Arco's announcement in October that it would incur a 'substantial' charge to reshape the bulk of its US operations. It covers severance costs from shedding 1,300 jobs, as well as the write-down of some oil and gas properties which the company plans to sell.</p>

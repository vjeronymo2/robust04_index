			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Britain blames the Bundesbank DOWNING STREET last night launched an unprecedented attack on the Bundesbank by laying most of the blame for the unfolding sterling crisis on the German central bank. In a breach of convention that served only to stress the extent of the British government's anger, Downing Street detailed at least five occasions on which senior Bundesbank board members or unknown bank sources had used language that had undermined the pound. In unusually frank terms, senior officials said the straw that had broken the camel's back had been the reports yesterday of an interview given by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to the Handelsblatt and the Wall Street Journal newspapers. 'If, within a system like the ERM, someone is openly saying something about a currency, then it becomes a one-way bet,' a senior government official said. Downing Street said that late on Tuesday Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had repeatedly interrupted a formal dinner at the home of the US Ambassador to London to call Germany in a bid to suppress comments by Mr Schlesinger that implicitly sug-gested the pound would be devalued. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, was also frantically telephoning his colleagues in Frankfurt as part of the fire-fighting operation. But in the end the advance reports of Mr Schlesinger's words proved a fatal combination with the weakening dollar, high D-Mark interest rates and the unease provoked by the approach of Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. The Bundesbank last night rejected the criticisms. The British government's decision to leave the ERM was its own and did not involve the German central bank or the Bonn government, though there had been telephone consultation, said an official. The Bundesbank could 'neither welcome nor regret' the decision. The official added that problems of the UK could not be blamed on the Bundesbank. 'Other factors are involved than the interest rate policies of the Bundesbank.' As sterling's value slipped yesterday afternoon, prime minister John Major telephoned Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, to explain the UK's decisions and why they were being taken. A Downing Street official tersely described the prime minister's tone as 'firm'. The five occasions on which Bundesbank comments affected the pound cited by Downing Street included: August 25: Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, sent tremors through the markets by suggesting an ERM shake-up could be in the offing; August 28: Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the seven-man permanent directorate, expressed the view that there was no reason to cut German interest rates; September 10: 'unknown sources' suggested that the pound should devalue; September 15: newspapers and news agencies reported sources in the Bundesbank and Bonn as suggesting that a sterling devaluation could not be ruled out; Yesterday: Mr Schlesinger was widely quoted as saying that Europe's financial problems were unresolved in spite of Sunday's realignment which he did not deem to be enough. Faced with this barrage of comments from Germany, it was hardly surprising that the strenuous efforts of both the prime minister and the chancellor to sustain confidence in the pound had foundered, the official implied. Once the market had decided that a sterling devaluation was inevitable interest rates could have been raised by 'hundreds of per cent' without having any impact on the markets, the official added.</p>

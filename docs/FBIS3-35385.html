Addressing a press conference on Tuesday at a local hotel,  he  said that Indian oppression in Kashmir had risen to alarming  proportion during the last three months and Indian forces even  penetrated in the Sopore area which was known to be the fort of  the freedom fighters.    He said that Indian attacks on exact target showed that  Indian forces got specific information.    Keeping in view the prevailing situation and the prime  minister's recent `confession' regarding her help to Rajiv  Gandhi to crush the Sikh movement in the East Punjab, one could  suspect that she was also helping the present Indian government  in connection with the freedom movement in Kashmir, Nawaz  alleged.    Nawaz Sharif has charged that the prime minister was 'a  security risk' for Pakistan. "Following the confession of the  prime minister in a BBC interview last week that she helped  former Indian premier late Rajiv Gandhi against the Sikh  movement in the Indian Punjab, she has become a security risk  for the country" he said.    Nawaz Sharif said the prime minister must make her position  clear to the nation in this matter as it was more serious an  issue than the Watergate affair. He said the cause of Pakistan  has been compromised by the prime minister.    The PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] chief said that  India never helped Pakistan in our hours of need nor it  fulfilled promises made to the Kashmiri people. In fact India  was responsible for the dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971.  Moreover, Indian intelligence agency RAW [Research and Analysis  Wing] has been working to weaken Pakistan, he added.    He said that prime minister has been sidetracking the main  issue and did not answered the questions asked in his February  19 letter to her.    He questioned as to which principle made it binding for  Pakistan to help its enemy and added that those who demolished  Babri Mosque deserved no help.    "I will take her to the court of the people," said Nawaz.    Replying to a question whether he would bring all these  things into the notice of the president and the chief of army  staff he said that he would keep on playing his national,  constitutional, legal and moral duty.    He said that his party would consider withdrawing its  members  from the Kashmir Committee of the National Assembly keeping in  view the "government's lukewarm attitude over the issue." He  said he would strive for protecting the interests of the country  and would not hesitate in taking any legal and constitutional  step towards this end.</p>

Presiding Justice Ryohei Kizaki said the doctor, Takako  Nobuhara, had worked in Palestinian refugee camps after going to  Lebanon in 1971.    Nobuhara lost her passport and applied for a new one in 1982  at the Japanese embassy in Syria.    But the Foreign Ministry refused to issue the document and  she filed suit in 1993, demanding a new one.    The Tokyo District Court accepted her demand in December  1989  and ruled that the ministry's refusal was illegal since her  alleged close relationship with the Red Army was not  acknowledged.    The ministry then appealed to the Tokyo High Court and the  court ruled May 19, 1992, that based on the ministry's evidence,  Nobuhara had been a liaison agent in Beirut for the Red Army's  leader Fusako Shigenobu.    Japanese police have placed Shigenobu on an international  wanted list.    The Red Army, formed in 1971, is responsible for a series of  hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s.    It is reportedly based in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and has  close ties with radical Palestinian groups.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: At last, sherry really is A SERIOUS anomaly in the UK wine world is now being removed. So-called British 'sherry,' made from imported grape concentrate, has had a diminishing tax advantage over the real thing: sherry made from fresh grapes in the Jerez district of Spain. By the end of 1995, this preference will have been wiped out. It arose because British sherry was allowed to pay the same tax as table wine, now 95p a bottle. But most real sherry pays Pounds 1.63 - and, until this year, Pounds 1.88 if between 18` and 22` in alcoholic strength. More important than the tax, however, is the ruling that, from 1996, the word 'sherry' cannot be used in the European Community for wines that have been labelled as British, Irish, Australian or South African sherry. The Spaniards should have won this battle long ago but the British sherry lobby fought to retain the word on its labels. Moreover, no longer do fortified wines - sherry, port and madeira - have to pay a higher duty of Pounds 3 a case if between 8` and 22`. There is now only one rate, which means an initial 5p a bottle off the low-strength wines and an encouraging 30p on the stronger wines, plus VAT. By the beginning of 1996, the duty on low-strength sherries will have fallen by Pounds 3.78 a case and by Pounds 7.43 on those of high strength - subject, of course, to the actions of the chancellor in the intervening budgets. These reforms provide, at the right time of year, an incentive to sample the warming old high-strength sherries from Jerez. The amontillados, olorosos and palo cortados from old soleras started many years ago and, unblended with the sweet pedro ximenex (PX) wines, have a concentrated aroma, deep flavour and dry finish that make them delicious aperitifs. Amontillado. Cheap amontillados are no more than sweetened finos, but the genuine article must be at least eight years old before it is transformed naturally. Lighter than olorosos, they also have a long taste in the mouth. Sainsbury has an attractive amontillado that is claimed to have an average age of 35 years (Pounds 3.45 a half). A very reputable one is Valdespino's Tio Diego (Wine Society, Stevenage, Hertfordshires, Pounds 7.90). Outstanding, however, is Gonzalez Byass's Amontillado del Duque Viejo (Peatling, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Pounds 19.49), which is wonderfully rich and concentrated with a bone-dry finish. Oloroso. Normally regarded as a sweet wine - with the low-strength Bristol Cream (Pounds 5.62 in most supermarkets) being the best known - it can, in fact, provide the most satisfying, concentrated sherry with a dry finish at a very reasonable price. Safeways has Lustau's excellent, full-bodied dry old oloroso (Pounds 3.29 a half-bottle). The Wine Society lists Valdespino's very concentrated Viejo Oloroso (Pounds 7.15). Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, has Oloroso Especial (Pounds 7.56) from the reputable firm of Hidalgo. Wine Cellars, 153-155 Wandsworth High Street, London, includes Valdespino's Don Gon-Zalo Dry Oloroso (Pounds 9.69). Philip Eyres of Coleshill, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, lists the distinctive Lustau dry oloroso, Viejo de Jerez (Pounds 10.86). Palo Cortado. Between an amontillado and an oloroso in style, this is said to be a one-in-3,000 cask rarity, so any offered cheaply should be treated warily. It has a crisper taste than oloroso. Harvey's has an authentic 1796 Palo Cortado for Pounds 9.50 (Wine Society Pounds 9.60), while Wine Cellars has Valdespino's Del Carrascal (Pounds 9.69). Those looking for something outstanding might try the PP Solera, founded in 1922, from the London department store, Selfridges (Pounds 20.99).</p>

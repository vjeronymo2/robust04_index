			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. LOSES A STRONG VOICE  </P> <P> The angriest voice in Los Angeles television was cut off yesterday. Bill Stout,  62, the man who hectored generals in Vietnam and sycophants in City Hall, died  of cardiac arrest.  </P> <P> All TV news people read. Stout could also write. And ask hard questions. He  learned his journalism at UCLA in the days before reporters and anchors were  supposed to be beautiful, handsome or at least avuncular. Stout's strength was  to grow up skeptical and intellectual; he understood war, politics and the  petty lies people tell each other. On screen, he was sarcastic. Off screen, he  could be sardonic. Funny, too.  </P> <P> He cocked his eyebrow at the audience and told his version of the whole story.  Station managers and sponsors didn't always like whole stories because  executives also tend to live with petty lies and half-told truths. So Stout  moved around in his 40-year broadcasting career, from network to independent  channel and back to network again. For the last few years he has been the news  conscience of KCBS-TV, doing a commentary called "Perspective," spouting truth,  spewing opinion and making clear which was which.  </P> <P> Stout and his spouse, Peggy, were news junkies, the first ones on the block to  have a computer that could talk to other computers, the first to have a wire  service clacking in the family room.  </P> <P> Two years ago he had a heart attack. He came back on screen looking older,  balder, more tired but no less furious about the wayward ways of public life.  His was a voice suitable for judgment day, and some days in the '60s and '70s  Stout seemed to be speaking for the national character -- or lack of it. From  one medium to another, we thank you, Bill. You were so often right.  </P></p>

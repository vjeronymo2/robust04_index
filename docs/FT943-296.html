			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Euro-MPs back drift nets ban The European Parliament voted yesterday to ban fishing with drift nets in European waters from next January, only hours after EU fisheries ministers failed to agree on a phased-in ban by the end of 1997. Drift nets are long walls of mesh which are highly effective, but which the European Commission insists cause ecological damage by entrapping species indiscriminately. They were at the centre of this summer's skirmishes in the Bay of Biscay between the northern Spanish and French fleets, which Spanish fishermen warned before Wednesday's ministerial meeting could turn violent. The French fleet uses drift nets to catch tuna at less cost than the Spaniards, who use the line and live-bait system, while Spain is the main market for the catch. Spain and the Commission won little support for their position, and new scientific data on the effect of drift nets is due to be considered in December. Yesterday's parliament vote, however, gives a political boost to efforts to ban drift nets, although member states can disregard Strasbourg's views.</p>

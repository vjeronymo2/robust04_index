			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / PLO attacks on Arafat's tactics grow Powerful mainstream Palestinian opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process gathered momentum yesterday as negotiators in Cairo tried to wrap up a long-delayed agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Criticism of the negotiating tactics of Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, and Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, from both inside and outside the organisation, forced angry delegates who feel undermined by the attacks to demand a statement of support from PLO headquarters in Tunis. In occupied Arab East Jerusalem Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the popular former Palestinian chief negotiator from Gaza, circulated a petition signed by 20 prominent Palestinians, protesting at PLO concessions. He said an agreement which did not halt all Jewish settlement would lack legitimacy 'and shall therefore not be binding on the Palestinian people, its institutions, public figures and political forces'. Mr Abdel-Shafi, regarded as an elder statesman by Palestinians, called on his people to support his position in a move which will clearly undermine the PLO further, hindering its efforts to win back its disintegrating support in the occupied territories. Mr Abdel-Shafi's challenge came after leaders of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction attacked the PLO's negotiating tactics last weekend. The attacks, led by Mr Hani Hassan and Mr Abbas Zaki, hit at PLO concessions, 'lack of consultation' by Mr Arafat, and the negotiation strategy of Mr Shaath. Fatah leaders attacked Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a), chief PLO economic negotiator, for having compromised in talks with Israel on Palestinian aspirations for an independent economy. Many Palestinians have become increasingly concerned the PLO has given away too much in talks with a rigid Israel and left the Palestinians with a virtual 'Bantustan'. Recently, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, former Palestinian spokeswoman, urged Mr Arafat to suspend his participation in the talks or risk destroying what little legitimacy and credibility the PLO had left with Palestinians in the occupied territories. She said the PLO team had displayed 'blatant lack of strategy and preparedness' and given up too much, particularly on the issue of Jewish settlements which she described as a 'self-destruct mechanism'. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, has recognised the grave dangers facing the process from Mr Arafat's declining support base. Mr Peres has warned the government he had found Mr Arafat troubled and suspicious during talks in Bucharest last week. He reportedly told the cabinet the agreement must be signed soon or 'perhaps the whole thing won't come to pass'. At the heart of Palestinian criticism of Mr Arafat and Mr Shaath is the issue of how much sovereignty and authority the Palestinian self-government will exercise. Many Palestinians believed last September's peace accord offered them a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho and the basis for building an independent state. But Israel has refused to grant the PLO even symbols of sovereignty and left settlements in large areas of Gaza to be protected by Israeli troops. The last issues to be resolved in Cairo are about sovereignty, whether the Palestinians will have their own stamps, passports, currency and trade regime; the extent of Palestinian legal jurisdiction over Israelis and foreigners in Gaza-Jericho, and how much control the Palestinian self-government will have over the Gaza Strip's coastline and airspace.</p>

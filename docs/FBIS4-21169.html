Thirty-five police leaders and  street level investigators have come together for a three day  meeting in Joutseno to plan a joint effort to combat drugs and  develop cooperation. This first meeting will end Friday [11  March].    Office chief Antti Turkama of the Central Criminal Police is  promising more meetings and contacts in the future. ``An  agreement in principle has already been made about a personnel  exchange program. This will lead to narcotics investigators and  lab personnel going for visits to familiarize themselves with  the other agency's methods of investigation, equipment, and new  narcotics.''    According to Nikolai Gorbachevsky, the commander of the  Criminal Department of the St. Petersburg Militia, meetings  between experts on other branches of criminal activity are also  to be expected. The next ones will be between those specializing  in violent crime. Officials are concerned about the increase in  crimes of violence, against businessmen in particular, in Russia.    The cooperation between these officials is made possible by  a  treaty between the two countries. According to the St.  Petersburg Militia Criminal Department commander the federation  government and the ministry currently encourage cooperation. In  bygone times they prevented it.    In Gorbachevsky's opinion St. Petersburg has not yet become  a  center for the international drug trade. ``We are heading toward  that distinction. There are increasing numbers of drug users and  the choice of available drugs is getting greater,'' says  Gorbachevsky. The international drug mafia has also shown an  interest in St. Petersburg, at the very least as a  transportation link.    The commander of the Narcotics Department of the St.  Petersburg Militia, Anatoli Goncharenko, considers the area to  be primarily a drug consumer concentration. Inexpensive drugs,  derived from natural plants, are supplied from other parts of  Russia. Synthetic drugs manufactured in laboratories,  amphetamines, among others, make for a special problem in St.  Petersburg. According to Goncharenko there are many unemployed  or underemployed, highly educated chemists in St. Petersburg,  who can supplement family incomes with drugs they can  manufacture at their jobs.    In addition to a 1000-kg cocaine shipment, the narcotics  militia in St. Petersburg confiscated 1000 kg of other drugs.  The major portion of these, however, are inexpensive  plant-based drugs.</p>

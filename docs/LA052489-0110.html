			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Fears that the new immigration law may cause a farm labor shortage in  California have failed to materialize in the San Joaquin Valley, according to  the chairman of the Fresno Farm Bureau's labor committee. Grape grower Don Laub  said "the work force looks real good," although he admitted that it is still  too early to predict whether there will be enough workers when the harvest  season reaches its peak in late summer. Many growers expressed concern last  year that not enough undocumented workers would legalize their status under the  amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to form an  adequate labor pool. "That fear has failed, so far, to materialize," Laub said,  "and it may never happen."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], director of  the PLO's Economic Department, has said that the PLO has decided  to open a Palestinian development bank to channel foreign aid to  the occupied territories.    In remarks to REUTERS, he said the bank will start off with  $250 million, partly contributed by the Palestinian authority  and Palestinian and foreign private sectors, including (?French)  banks.    Brother Abu-al-'Ala' said the establishment of the bank  marks  a key step, which, besides facilitating the flow of assistance  to the occupied land, will be the conduit for loans to the  private sector.    International aid donors met in Paris last month and pledged  $570 million in 1994 toward funding Palestinian projects in the  areas due to come under the interim Palestinian self-rule  authority.    The decision to set up a Palestinian development bank was  made by the accountants of the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction when it convened last week. The  PLO Executive Committee will meet in a few days to name a  constituent body for the bank, which is expected to begin its  operations within months.</p>

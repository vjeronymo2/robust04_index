			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Presidents Kim Yong-sam  of South Korea and Bill Clinton of the United States agreed  Friday that they have no other choice but to press the U.N.  Security Council [UNSC] to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions  against North Korea.    The agreement came in a 30-minute telephone conversation  from  7:15 P.M. Moscow time. The call was made by Clinton in Rome,  where the U.S. President is attending events commemorating the  50th anniversary of D-day.    President Kim received the call as he wound up his four-day  state visit to Russia.    The United States has completed preparations for a better  and  firmer defense of South Korea, Clinton told Kim, according to  presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik.    Chu said he could not disclose further details of the  presidential conversation.    Prior to talking with Kim, Clinton called Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and told him that the North Korean nuclear row  will now have to be dealt with by the U.N. Security Council.    Details of the Clinton-Yeltsin call were not disclosed  either, but the U.S. President was understood to have phoned  Yeltsin in order to secure Russian support for the Security  Council plans. They also reportedly discussed taking concerted  steps between the United States and South Korea along with Japan  and China.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. RICE PRODUCERS IN UNFRIENDLY FIELDS;  </P> <P> JAPAN: AMERICANS PROMOTE PRODUCT IN TOKYO EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T EVEN GIVE THE  GRAIN AWAY THERE.  </P> <P> Rice producers from the United States today began trying to promote  American-grown rice in Japan -- a country where imported rice cannot even be  given away.  </P> <P> The U.S. rice industry group opened its promotion despite Japan's total ban on  commercial imports of the staple grain.  </P> <P> In Japan, any public use of foreign rice is prohibited by the food control law,  and regulations even limit the amount that private individuals can bring into  the country. This prevents the U.S. Rice Millers Assn. from even giving away  free samples as it promotes its product.  </P> <P> The chairman of the U.S. Rice Millers Assn. was quoted as saying that the  United States could supply half a million metric tons annually if Japan lifted  its barriers to imports.  </P> <P> Ronald Caffey told a news conference that the United States wanted access to  Japan's rice market, but not the total liberalization of the market, Kyodo News  Service reported.  </P> <P> The U.S. rice group is attending an international food convention here and will  present information about U.S.-grown rice and the goals of the U.S. industry.  </P> <P> A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the promotion was not intended "to offend the  Japanese government or apply political pressure to liberalize rice  importation."  </P> <P> Rice is the last major item on which Japan bans commercial imports. The grain  has special significance in the Japanese culture, and the domestic crop  cultivated on its scarce farmland is considered a symbol of the island nation's  self-sufficiency.  </P> <P> With annual consumption of 10 million metric tons, half a million tons would  represent 5% of the Japanese rice market.  </P> <P> But senior U.S. Rice Millers Assn. official David Graves told reporters at the  same news conference that this estimate for U.S. exports could be too high if  preferences for certain kinds of rice by Japanese are considered, Kyodo  reported.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, the association filed a petition urging Washington to impose  tariffs and quotas on Japanese exports unless Tokyo allowed foreign producers  to supply 10% of the country's domestic demand for rice within four years.  </P></p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Observer: Rebuilding Have you noticed how many of the hot-shot builders of the last boom have swallowed their pride and are re-emerging on the boards of far smaller competitors? The latest is Terry Upsall, who was on the point of floating Britain's second biggest housebuilder CHB when Hanson took over its heavily indebted parent last year. At 55, he has just been given a non-executive berth at The Berkeley Group, headed by Tony Pidgley, whose ambition is to turn his building firm into the most profitable in its sector. Pidgley, who is 10 years younger than Upsall, has already befriended Roger Lewis after he lost his job as chief executive of once high flying Crest Nicholson, and made him his finance director. Meanwhile John Swanson, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive of Barratt last year, has been taken on as operations director of the much smaller Tay Homes, and his deputy, John Cassidy, has re-emerged as finance director of the private Wain Group. Unlike most of the other casualties, Upsall lost his job through no fault of his own. Hence his re-surfacing at Berkeley is particularly intriguing. At Beazer he was used to running his own show and building more than five times as many houses as Berkeley. Hard to see how he can be content playing second fiddle to Pidgley, unless he's being groomed as Berkeley's first independent chairman.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL;  </P> <P> WORRY OVER COLLEGE COSTS RISING ALONG WITH FEES  </P> <P> Nearly all Orange County parents believe that a college education is critical  to career success for their children, but fewer than half feel confident that  they will be able to afford it, according to a Times Orange County poll.  </P> <P> It is not surprising that such a highly educated population -- 41% of adult  Orange County residents have four-year degrees, contrasted with 16% nationwide  -- place a premium on learning. But even among the more affluent -- those whose  household income exceeds $60,000 -- more than 40% expressed doubts that they  would be able to pay the bills, the survey found.  </P> <P> "Everything I read says college costs are rising dramatically," said Robert  Swenson, a stockbroker who lives in San Juan Capistrano. "We should be able to  educate our kids, but it will be tough, especially if they go to grad school.  It will involve sacrifices for all of us."  </P> <P> Swenson and his wife, Yolanda, both UCLA graduates, are well-off by most  standards: Their income far exceeds the county median of $45,000, and they have  substantial equity in a home they bought in 1977. They also have two bright  children -- Robert, 10, who talks about becoming a doctor, and Stephanie, 7.  </P> <P> "It's a question of juggling around assets or hitting a few investment home  runs," Robert Swenson said. "It's likely our children will go to a public  university, and more likely they will attend a year of junior college or even  two years. They're both very good students, and we're hoping they will get  scholarships somewhere."  </P> <P> Such worries have increased along with annual tuition increases, according to  Orange County parents who were surveyed Aug. 6 through 8 in the poll, conducted  by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine.  </P> <P> The cost of attending a four-year college or university this fall in the United  States will increase an average of 7% for public institutions and 9% for  private schools, outpacing inflation for the ninth consecutive year, according  to the College Board.  </P> <P> Nationwide, the average tuition for private colleges and universities will  reach $8,737 for the 1989-90 academic year, the board estimates. At public  institutions, the average tuition will rise to $1,694.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Concern'  </P> <P> At public universities in Orange County, the total for tuition and other fees  for the 1989-90 school year will range from $922 at Cal State Fullerton to  $1,828 at UC Irvine. At Chapman College, a private liberal arts institution in  Orange, tuition and fees will total $11,595 for the academic year. Community  colleges, which have a $100-a-year tuition cap, remain a bargain.  </P> <P> "The poll suggests there is great concern about the escalating costs of a  college education," Baldassare said. "There is a perception that costs are high  and could go higher."  </P> <P> The astronomical price of housing in Orange County -- the median price for a  home was $255,000 in July, and only 9% of families in the county had income  sufficient to buy at that price -- undoubtedly figures into the financing  equation, Baldassare said.  </P> <P> "Aside from our unique characteristics of high levels of education and high  income, we also have high housing costs," he said. "The results suggest it is  difficult for many people to make the level of commitment" to college  educations for their children "they feel is necessary in a community with such  high housing costs."  </P> <P> The large percentage of parents reporting that they have begun saving ahead of  time for their children's education is another indication of concern about  rising college costs, Baldassare said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Couple Started Trust Funds  </P> <P> Two out of three parents polled said they are putting money aside today. Among  the parents who are themselves college graduates, the ratio was nearly three  out of four.  </P> <P> "I think a college education is very important," said Karen Arndt of  Westminster, who was among the 90% of all respondents who rated a college  degree as critical to success. "You can get a better job with a better  education. That's what I keep telling my children."  </P> <P> Arndt and her husband, Craig, say they are "not likely" to be able to afford  the college educations they want for their son, Chris, 12, and their daughter,  Andrea, 4. Nevertheless, the couple has established trust funds toward that  end. Karen Arndt is not now employed; her husband works as a laborer. Both are  high school graduates.  </P> <P> "It's awfully expensive to put a child through college, so we've been putting  money away since our oldest was a baby," she said. "I hope both of the children  will go to college. We want them to have the best life possible."  </P> <P> Indeed, the dream of owning a home has been put aside for the Arndt family, she  said.  </P> <P> "We're renting right now," Arndt said. "We still haven't been able to afford a  house, and I don't know if we ever will in Orange County."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Will Be a Struggle'  </P> <P> Linda Heitkamp of Garden Grove also fears that she and her husband will not be  able to put their two children -- Jenae, 10, and Gina, 8 -- through college.  Heitkamp, who works part time as a teacher's aide, and her husband, Jacob, an  educational coordinator for a vocational school, estimate that in 10 years, it  might cost $25,000 for each to put their children through a public university.  </P> <P> "College is extremely important and totally out of reach," said Heitkamp, who  has a two-year degree from Long Beach City College and whose husband is a Cal  State Long Beach graduate. "I know it will be a struggle, but I feel it's worth  it. I don't know what we will do."  </P> <P> At 3, Christiana Porter's primary interest seems to be eating and finger  painting, according to her father, Sam Porter Jr. He and his wife, Debra, hope  to be able to help when she is ready to explore other ambitions, but they have  been unable to save for a college fund.  </P> <P> "I think college is very critical to get ahead," said Sam Porter, a mason who  hopes to take law enforcement training to become a police officer. "But there's  no way we could ever send our daughter to a private school. And even a public  university will run quite a bit when she is old enough.  </P> <P> "We're unable to save anything now. I don't know what we will do when our  daughter is college-age."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How the Poll Was Conducted  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll consisted of interviews with 600 adult county  residents. It was conducted Aug. 6 through 8 on weekend days and weekday nights  using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers.  </P> <P> The margin of error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 4%. For  subgroups, the margin of error is higher. The margin of error for a subgroup  such as the 200 parents with children in school, for example, is plus or minus  7%.  </P> <P> All respondents were guaranteed anonymity. Some respondents, however, agreed to  be interviewed again later for news stories on the poll.  </P> <P> The poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL  </P> <P> College Education  </P> <P> "How important do you consider a college education for your children?"

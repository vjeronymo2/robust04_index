			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  today congratulated the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on  its 30th summit which opened today in Tunis.    In a message sent to the summit, Li Peng said the birth of  new South Africa signified the victory accomplished by the OAU  and all African people in the political field.    But Li also expressed the concern over the on-going  conflicts  in some African countries, in particular Rwanda.    "Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in  Rwanda  in particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the  economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the  international community," said Li.    "We firmly support the OAU in its vigorous efforts to  mediate  in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain political and  social stability in African countries," he added.    While wishing the summit a complete success, the premier  said  to enhance friendly relations and cooperation with Africa "has  all along been part and parcel of the foreign policy of the  Chinese Government."</p>

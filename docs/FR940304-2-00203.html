			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Local and Intrastate Planning Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section supports development of planning and/or implementation strategies of local governments, intrastate multi-community or multi-county entities, and local non-profit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Evaluative Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the evaluative criteria applied to the previous planning grant category_questions of interoperability, identification of end-users, and incorporation of broad input_are germane to Local and Intrastate Planning Grant applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the focus of this subcategory is considerably less ``global'' than for Statewide, Regional, and National Planning Grants, proposals in this subcategory should nevertheless exhibit the same consistency with the long range NII objective of fostering seamless, multi-functional networks. Accordingly, questions of interoperability and connectivity should be carefully considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the context of this subcategory, a number of questions become especially relevant: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> What provisions in the plan have been made to address crucial ``last mile'' connectivity questions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Is sufficient technical and operational expertise available at the local level to ensure efficient planning and subsequent implementation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Will service provider and/or end-user acceptance of new or expanded telecommunications services present any special difficulties?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Formation of Partnerships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NTIA will consider favorably applications that demonstrate a partnership among groups of communities or entities for the purpose of pooling and leveraging resources. This does not mean that these groups should come together merely for the purpose of obtaining a federal grant. This partnership or coalition should demonstrate that it will continue to function and operate effectively once the NTIA grant is concluded. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Can the local resources of national or regional organizations, both public and private, be enlisted in support of the planning effort?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What unique linguistic, social, cultural, political, or economic impediments exist locally that might hinder the planning effort?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Innovation and Experimentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information infrastructure has evolved and been used in unanticipated ways. Similarly, many of the most valuable telecommunications services (such as the Internet) and facilities now in use were once experimental. NTIA is seeking applications for planning grants that will foster and encourage experimentation with use of NII technologies at the grass roots level, build the capacity of the public to participate in the emerging NII, or address specific objectives underlying the deployment of the NII as identified in the Agenda for Action (September 21, 1993). For this reason, projects supported under Category Two should be those that are more likely to lead to the development of innovative methods, practices, or policies that will ensure that the NII activities reach a broad population. The objective is to build both the technical and human infrastructure needed to make the NII useful to citizens. These plans can serve as models for similar projects that are most likely to lead to the development of systems, projects, and policies that can stimulate similar initiatives in other areas of the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants should clearly define the administrative or institutional support that has been generated to advance any planning effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Can national sources of public and private funding be leveraged in support of a local planning effort?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since many local initiatives tend to rely heavily in the initial stages on volunteer energies, how will questions of continuity be addressed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Financial Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funds may be spent on information collection, salaries, travel, lodging, and other expenses reasonably related to planning activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

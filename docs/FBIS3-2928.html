			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By network reporter Ren Yongming; from the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Hu Jintao, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau Standing Committee and member of the CPC  Central Committee Secretariat, and Chi Haotian, state councillor  and minister of national defense, joined the National People's  Congress [NPC] deputies of the Tibet delegation in examining the  government work report on the morning of 13 March.    After Raidi, deputy head of the Tibetan delegation, declared  the meeting open at 0900, the deputies freely spoke about what  they wanted to speak. Commenting on the three major  requirements -- reform, development, and stability -- Deputies  Losang Gyaincun, Qiangba Pingcuo, Losang Namgyai, and Losang  Toinzhub maintained that, because of Tibet's rather special  situation, it must properly handle the relations between those  three requirements in order to attain the targets set for 1994.  This means that, in addition to making efforts to deepen  reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote  development, Tibet must also pay attention to maintaining a  stable social, political, and economic environment and strive to  promote reform and development in a stable environment and  achieve a long-term social stability through reform and  development.    Deputy Losang Toinzhub said: None of the three requirements  -- reform, development, and stability -- is dispensable.  Tibet's socialist modernization drive certainly can move  forward as long as we are able to properly handle the relations  between the three requirements, maintain the standards of  productive forces [sheng chan li biao jun], seize the  opportunity, achieve breakthroughs in key points while promoting  all projects as a whole, work in line with the national  framework [yu quan guo zai kuang jia shang yi zhi] and  structures, and, in light of Tibet's actual needs, take resolute  actions, adopt flexible policies, and take steady and reliable  steps.    Comrade Hu Jintao listened attentively to the views of the  speakers, occasionally nodded to express his approval and  inquired about Tibet's framework for reform.    After the deputies finished speaking, Raidi asked Minister  Chi Haotian to say a few words. Chi Haotian said: I have come  to learn from you. People in Tibet care very much for and  support the armed forces, and they have contributed  significantly to strengthen the border defense in southwest  China. Under the new situation, we must continue to strengthen  army-police-people unity [jun jing min tuan jie]. The armed  forces and the people should share the same destiny, breathe the  same breath, and link their hearts so that our border areas can  be built into a steel great wall. Meanwhile, we must strengthen  the joint army-people defense to ensure stability in border  areas. As long as army and people are united as one, we can  surmount any difficulty.</p>

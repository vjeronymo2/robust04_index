			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, April 30 (AFP) -- Fourteen opposition  figures, including the army's former supreme commander, have  been sentenced to between two and 10 years in jail for  conspiring to topple the government, judicial officials said  Saturday [30 April].    A special civil tribunal announced it had sentenced nine out  of 17 people tried in absentia to 10 years for conspiring  against 'Umar al-Bashir's regime.    They included former army commander-in-chief General Fathi  Ahmed Ali, former security chief General Al Hadi Bushra, and  former Deputy Chief of Staff General Abdul Rahman Saeed.    They were charged with sending teams to Lebanon for  explosives training in order to carry out sabotage and  assassinations inside Sudan as a precursor to a coup.    The remaining eight tried in their absence were acquitted.    Five of the nine defendants present in court, who were  arrested in May, were jailed for between two and seven years.    The remaining four were acquitted.</p>

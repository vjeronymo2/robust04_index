			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark hit by pay settlement PRESSURES on the franc eased yesterday as a news of weak growth in Germany, including a surprisinglu low pay deal, prompted widespread selling of the D-Mark. The sell-off led to a switch into sterling which performed well against both the German and US currencies, writes Peter John. The franc had received some continuing support from the French central bank which had been intervening in early trading. It received a further boost when Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said France and Germany would do everything in their power, jointly, to preserve the current parity of their two currencies. In a warning shot to speculators who had been testing the strength of the currency over the past two days, Mr Sapin said; 'Anyone who wants to damage the franc-mark link will find himself faced with the solidarity of the two (finance) ministers and the two central banks.' The franc, which had languished at around FFr3.411 against the D-Mark over the past two days despite intervention from the Bundesbank as well as the Bank of France, lifted to FFr3.404 and reached FFr1.859 against the dollar, up from FFr1.866. Meanwhile, pressure on the D-Mark developed in the far eastern markets as investors sold the D-Mark in exchange for pounds, yen francs and dollars. When the European markets opened the pressure intensified as Germany announced a surprisingly moderate pay settlement with steel workers. A 3.3 per cent rise over 18 months against demands of about 7.5 per cent gave a strong pointer to the strains on the economy and the impending need to cut interest rates. The settlement implications were compounded by disappointing economic statistics and the D-Mark tumbled a pfennig to DM1.580 against the dollar. Meanwhile, sterling, ignored for so long, put on a bravura performance that was said to have been prompted by a significant purchase from one UK institution. It was suggested that a complicated cross, carried out through one clearing bank involving mark and yen and worth around Pounds 500m, gave the initial impetus to the UK currency. Then, when the pound broke through the DM2.45 barrier, a bear squeeze developed as dealers who had sold sterling earlier in the week as the were caught short. The pound surged nearly four pfennigs to to DM2.475 regaining a level last reached in mid-October. It was also one and a half cents stronger against the US currency, closing at Dollars 1.5640. Most dealers argued however that the sharp rise in sterling did not presage economic recovery but rather pointed to a reassessment of a currency that had been left on the sidelines for some time and was beginning to look cheap. Elsewhere among European currencies, the Irish central bank said it had arranged to borrow up to DM4bn from German banks in order to support the Irish punt in the foreign exchange markets.</p>

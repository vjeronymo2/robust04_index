He was a relatively young man who had never traveled  abroad.    That is all that was reported about the patient at the  Oblast  Center for AIDS prevention and Control. The rest is a  doctor-patient privilege.    The virus of the ``plague of the 20th century'' was detected  when the patient visited the rayon polyclinic for a quite  different and insignificant illness. At present, physicians are  investigating this first patient's contacts. Incidentally, a  correction must be made: first officially detected HIV carrier.  In the opinion of specialists, there are up to 10 undetected  cases for each one that is found.</p>

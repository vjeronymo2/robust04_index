			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Englishman goes to market for Scotland For the first time, an Englishman is to become chairman of what remains of the Glasgow stock exchange. Anthony Vine-Lott, 45-year-old managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers, is to succeed Robert White of the Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White as chairman of the Scottish regional advisory group of the London Stock Exchange. Glasgow is one of the more active of the dwindling number of regional branches of the Stock Exchange. It has the only firms of market-makers outside London (two of them) and handles most settlements for Glasgow-based stockbrokers, such as Allied Provincial. The exchange, which employs about 20 people, claims to be second only to London in the volume of business it handles. Meanwhile, Barclays Stockbrokers is probably the biggest user of the Glasgow exchange. It employs about 300 people in the city and does all share transactions for retail customers of the bank's branches, as well as handling back office work for a number of regional stockbrokers. It claims to transact 10 per cent of all retail business in the UK. Vine-Lott is one of the new breed of stockbrokers who came into the business from the technology side rather than from dealing, having been a senior executive of Wang UK in the early 1980s. He helped design an electronic dealing system for Barclays de Zoete Wedd before becoming md of Barclays Stockbrokers in 1988. But he only works two days a week in Glasgow, spending the rest of the week in London, and his home is in Kent. He sees the Scottish regional advisory group as 'a local lobby group sponsored by the exchange' which should work as a conduit to pass information to members of the stock exchange and to obtain their views to pass back to London. He wants to widen the role of the committee to represent the views of quoted Scottish companies and Scottish fund managers on stock exchange matters.</p>

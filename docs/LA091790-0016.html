His ability in a single cartoon to puncture the hoopla  and hype of contemporary political culture borders on sheer genius.  </P> <P> However, his cartoon depicting a proposed new wing of the Nixon Library as a  prison named after convicted Watergate accomplices includes the name Mardian.  In fact, Robert Mardian's conviction of Watergate wrongdoing was overturned on  appeal.  </P> <P> TOM WERT  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

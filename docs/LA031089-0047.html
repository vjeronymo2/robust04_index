			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VATICAN TELLS U.S. BISHOPS TO BECOME TOUGHER TEACHERS  </P> <P> As Pope John Paul II looked on, senior Vatican cardinals Thursday ordered U.S.  bishops to combat the secular influence of American society on religion by  being tougher teachers of their faith.  </P> <P> On the second day of an extraordinary conference with the Pope, the three dozen  American prelates and members of the Vatican Curia got down to theological  brass tacks. American preoccupation with the difficulties of evangelization in  a free-thinking democratic society was countered by Vatican insistence that the  bishops strengthen their resolve rather than accommodate it to the secularism  of modern America.  </P> <P> "The Vatican rejects the pick-and-choose kind of K mart Catholicism so  prevalent in the United States," Father John Navone, a Jesuit theologian at the  Pontifical Gregorian University, said. "It is telling the bishops their job is  to communicate the real things, not fashionable counterfeits."  </P> <P> Cardinal Joseph A. Ratzinger, who as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine  of the Faith is the Vatican's principal theological disciplinarian, warned the  Americans against allowing their teaching authority to be usurped by academic  theologians, or their leadership role reduced to that of mere "spiritual  administrators."  </P> <P> He told the bishops they must reimpose their authority over dissent within the  church, if necessary risking even greater dissent in the process. A summary of  Ratzinger's theme-setting remarks, made at Wednesday's opening session, was  made public Thursday. Americans had hoped to publicize the full texts of all  the speeches at the 10 working sessions, but the Vatican demurred, preferring  one-page summaries and press briefings by a spokesman for each side.  </P> <P> "Today's theologians have an influence not only in the environment of  scientific research and university teaching, but through the mass media bring  to the public arena a concert dissonant to the point that their voices drown  out that of the bishop evangelist," Ratzinger warned. "In many parts of the  world, theologians have taken the place of bishops as teachers, engendering a  growing insecurity and disorientation."  </P> <P> Ratzinger, who is sometimes called the "deputy Pope," though not to his face,  told the bishops: "It is necessary to risk being unpopular because of the  truth. . . . It is worth suffering for the truth. In the deepest sense of the  word, the evangelist must also be a martyr."  </P> <P> Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, one of the American delegates, said:  "To me, the important message of Cardinal Ratzinger's remarks was stressing the  bishop's key role as messenger of the Gospel. We must recognize the danger in  modern times of simply becoming managers. The Vatican is challenging us to make  the message relevant and appealing . . . how to get the attention of people  reaching for another Bud Light."  </P> <P> Three sessions Thursday dealt with the role of priests as agents of  evangelization, the pastoral role of bishops in religious life and a discussion  of liturgy and the sacraments, with emphasis on confession. The Vatican,  resolute for one-on-one confessions, makes no secret of its dislike of a  growing American tendency toward general or group absolution.  </P> <P> "Thursday was a great day," Mahony said. "Particularly the discussion on  priests gave us a very useful overview."  </P> <P> After formal presentations, one by an American and one by a member of the  Curia, the Vatican's administrative arm, the prelates discuss the issues in a  seminar-like session in the presence of the Pope.  </P> <P> "About 85% of the time, we Americans are talking to each other. They're  listening to us, and we're listening to each other," said Mahony.  </P> <P> In Thursday's session on the priesthood, Curia Cardinal Antonio Innocenti told  the American bishops they need to better support their priests, some of whom,  he said, endure "personal identity crises." Some American priests are receiving  theological training "inadequate for the needs and challenges of the times,"  Innocenti said.  </P> <P> Despite a decline in vocations in the United States, priests must be chosen  with "acute discernment," said Innocenti, adding that American priests must  also "deal with loss of prestige and consideration of the priestly mission in  American society."  </P> <P> Mahony said: "He talked about the disorientation of priests before conflicting  ecclesiastical models. I think he's right. Some priests don't know which way to  go. We need to support them better."  </P> <P> Speaking for the Americans, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston characterized  American priests as "an extraordinarily faithful group who have been called to  evangelize in uniquely challenging times and have done so effectively, despite  significant pressures on their morale."  </P> <P> Their mission of evangelization, Law said, is complicated in the United States  today by exaggerated emphasis on egoism, "which undermines marriage and family  life." He said priests are also challenged by aspects of American culture,  including "the isolation of sexual pleasure as an end in itself, a climate of  moral and intellectual relativism."  </P> <P> Law called on bishops to be particularly supportive of American priests to help  them meet demanding problems such as celibacy, "which requires ever-greater  support for priests," and the diminishing public role of the priest.  </P> <P> The conference, which was called to ease strains between the American church  and its traditionalist central authority at the Vatican, will continue today,  with sessions on the laity, the family, the young and the training of priests.  </P> <P> On Saturday, two final sessions will consider ecumenism and the use of the mass  media for evangelization. The conference, the first extended session of its  kind between the church of 53 million Americans and its obedience-demanding  leader, will conclude with a papal address Saturday afternoon.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Castle Communs advances to Pounds 0.85m Castle Communications, which markets audio and visual rights, saw pre-tax profits improve from Pounds 759,000 to Pounds 853,000 in the six months to December 31. The results for the USM-quoted company were helped by cost cutting, including the closure of a number of subsidiaries and higher profits from licensing activities. As a result of the closures turnover fell to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 19.4m). Earnings per share came out at 7.4p (7.1p) and the interim dividend is being maintained at 4p. Castle owns a substantial number of 1960s and 1970s recorded music copyrights which it is having revalued 'in view of the current interest in the value of such catalogues'.</p>

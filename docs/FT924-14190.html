			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Surge in over-counter healthcare sales seen EUROPEAN sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products are set to rise by more than 15 per cent a year between 1990 and 1995, making it one of the fastest growing retail sectors. The increase will be partly driven by Europe's ageing population, which will require more medicines, according to a report by Euromonitor, the London-based market research company. However, growth is also likely to be fuelled by EC governments switching increasing numbers of prescription products - which are reimbursed by the state - to OTC status. Since patients pay for OTC products, many health ministries are adopting this strategy to control growing expenditure. The fastest expanding OTC market will be France, with 28 per cent growth projected over the five years to 1995, followed by Germany with 17 per cent. Both countries are expected to switch the largest number of products to OTC status. The report argues that the OTC monopoly held by pharmacies in EC markets such as France, Belgium, Italy and Spain is being eroded by mass market outlets such as drug-stores and supermarkets. European Commission measures to standardise sales of OTC products are likely to be long and painful, it argues. European-wide mass distribution of OTC products, as exists in the UK with groups such as Boots the Chemist, is not on the horizon, it suggests. Pharmacy Distribution in Europe to 1995.

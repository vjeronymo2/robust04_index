			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 25 May TASS -- In connection with the package  of six presidential decrees, signed on 23 May 1994, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin has addressed a letter to the State Duma  (lower chamber of the Russian parliament), calling its attention  to several circumstances.    "The proclamation of these decrees," the letter says, "is  dictated by the imperative need to pull the country out of the  economic crisis and to continue the reforms. Due to various  reasons, the present legislation does not ensure the needed  conditions for the effective reformation of the Russian economy.  Due to this, and in order to fulfil their constitutional duties  and the president's and government's commitments under the  social concord agreement, a decision was adopted to step up the  ongoing economic transformations.    The president informed the State Duma that after the  adoption  of his decrees, the Government of the Russian Federation was  instructed to submit to the Federal Assembly (parliament) bills,  worked out on their basis, so that the latter could adopt  amendments and supplements to the legislation in force. "The  decrees, in the part relating to the competence of the Federal  Assembly, will remain in force until corresponding federal laws  are adopted," the president's letter says.</p>

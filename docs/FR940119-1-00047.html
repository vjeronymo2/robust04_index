			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results of the research support the red and white pattern, retroreflective intensity and width of materials in NHTSA's final rule. With regard to durability, the study indicated on page 166 that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The typical service life of a trailer is estimated at 14 years. It would be desirable that retroreflective treatments provide adequate performance for at least that long. The limited data collected *&blank;*&blank;* indicate that it is possible to use retroreflective materials in a trucking environment and suffer very little, if any loss in performance for ten or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years *&blank;*&blank;*. Until more definitive data are available, it is recommended that performance loss due to aging be established at 80 percent retention over the fourteen-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship Between FHWA and NHTSA Requirements for Lamps and Reflective Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NHTSA is responsible for establishing manufacturing standards for motor vehicles. Manufacturers of motor vehicles and certain motor vehicle equipment must certify that their products meet all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs). The standards for lamps and reflective devices are contained under FMVSS No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA is responsible for establishing standards for commercial motor vehicles used in interstate commerce. Commercial motor vehicles subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations must meet the requirements of 49 CFR Parts 393 (Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation) and 396 (Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance). Generally, part 393 does not establish vehicle or equipment manufacturing standards per se, but rather establishes requirements for certain equipment necessary for the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. The requirements for lamps and reflective devices are contained under &sect;&sect;393.11 through 393.26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements in &sect;&sect;393.11 through 393.26 are generally consistent with the manufacturing standards in FMVSS No. 108. Manufacturers are required to equip newly manufactured commercial motor vehicles in accordance with FMVSS No. 108. Commercial motor vehicles subject to the FMCSRs must be equipped with lamps and reflective devices as required under part 393.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Current FMCSRs Requirement for Conspicuity Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 393.11 requires that all lighting devices on motor vehicles placed in operation after March 7, 1989, meet the requirements of FMVSS No. 108 in effect at the time the vehicle is manufactured. Therefore, trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993, the effective date of the FMVSS No. 108 requirement for retroreflective tape or reflex reflectors, must have such reflective devices of the type and in the locations specified in FMVSS No. 108.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA specifically requests comments that address the application of conspicuity requirements to trailers manufactured before December 1, 1993. In a separate rulemaking, the FHWA will discuss maintenance and testing of conspicuity treatments on trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993. The FHWA made a distinction between the two categories of vehicles because the technical and economic issues associated with the consideration of retrofitting trailers with the conspicuity treatment are much more complex than those associated with a requirement that motor carriers maintain the conspicuity treatment with which the trailer was originally equipped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA requests that commenters address the specific issues below. However, the FHWA encourages commenters to include a discussion of any other issues that the commenters believe are relevant to this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Many motor carriers have been using retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors which are not of the colors, retroreflective intensity, width, or configuration of the conspicuity treatment in the NHTSA's final rule. The FHWA seeks information on the type of conspicuity treatments in use and quantitative data on the cost and effectiveness of those treatments in preventing and/or mitigating accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What types of technical problems (e.g., tape not adhering to the surface of the trailer) have motor carriers encountered when applying conspicuity materials to in-service trailers? Are any problems unique to certain types of trailers, or to certain types of paints, coatings, or surfaces?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What is the approximate cost (parts and labor) to apply conspicuity treatments to trailers? Is special training required for employees performing this task? What cost differences may exist between having this task performed by the motor carrier's own maintenance department or by third parties?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

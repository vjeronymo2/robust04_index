			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's tea crop likely to decline INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, is likely to harvest a crop of 730m kg in the current year, compared with 741.7m kg in 1991, when production increased by 27m kg. In its annual review, J. Thomas &amp; Company, the tea auction house, says that while north India could match last year's crop of 556.7m kg, a big production shortfall in the south Indian estates is feared. According to the review, India is unlikely to find export markets for more than 200m kg of tea, against 203m kg last year, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which used to account for more than half its overseas sales. India has signed tea export protocols with Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for a total of 65m kg. But the review says: 'It is possible that the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) may import similar quantities as in the previous year from the world market, with Indian teas comprising a major share, but Indian exports to the CIS are unlikely to be as dominant as in 1991.' J. Thomas believes, moreover, that Russia and the other former Soviet republics will be operating in lower price bands than in earlier years. The situations in Iraq and Yugoslavia add to India's concerns. The UK, Germany, Poland, Iran, Egypt and Japan are, however, expected to buy more Indian tea this year. As for prices, the review says that good quality CTC (cut, tear and curl) and orthodox teas should be commanding healthy premiums, while poorer orthodox as well as plain and medium CTC 'may fall into a high risk area due to more subdued operations by the CIS'. In view of the disposition of quality conscious Indian consumers to pay 'premiums for good CTC teas', J. Thomas recommends that the industry should concentrate on the production of quality tea to remain viable. Unlike the other tea producing countries, India has a huge domestic market for tea, of some 539m kg last year. The sharp widening of the price differential between good and plain categories since last year will encourage gardens in general to improve their agricultural practices. According to J. Thomas, Indian gardens are likely to concentrate on the production of CTC tea, since no one is sure of the support to be lent to orthodox tea by Russia and the other republics. Indian green tea production will, however, remain at about 8m kg.</p>

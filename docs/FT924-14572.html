			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Management: High time to turn round R&amp;D - Sterling's devaluation provides UK manufacturers with a golden opportunity In the tidal wave of commentary about the state of British manufacturing industry following sterling's devaluation, one issue has gone virtually unmentioned: the sudden scope which now exists for increased profits to be used on the development of new and improved products, and also - though less immediately vital - on research. A sharp surge in the rate of product innovation has not only been made possible by devaluation; it is desperately needed if Britain is ever to have any hope of closing its yawning trade gap. It will prove a vital competitive weapon even if the recession continues for another five years. As every commentator has recognised, sterling's devaluation will bring a number of short-term benefits to British exporters, including increased profits. The stock market's delirious initial reaction to devaluation three weeks ago was powered heavily by the expectation that profit rises would be used to boost dividends - as well as by the hope of further share price gains to come. Beyond that, most economists and other commentators have argued merely that higher profits will enable hard-pressed companies to cut their debt and strengthen their balance sheets. There has been some talk of higher investment, but always with the apparent implication that this will be in the form either of acquisitions - like Hanson's bid this week for Ranks Hovis McDougall - or of spending on plant and equipment. The latter is an unlikely option for many companies so long as they can see no end to their current overcapacity. Which is why a surge in the rate of relatively short-run development ('D') - as distinct from riskier, longer-term research ('R') - is now not only possible, but doubly necessary. Pitched carefully, a modest investment in the right sort of product and process improvement can bring a positive return in just two or three years. Failure to make that investment can consign one's existing product to near-oblivion. Back in the slump years of the 1930s, this lesson was learned to great effect by a few manufacturers, especially in America - which was partly why the industrial design profession had its first real flowering there at that time. Wise manufacturers try to work this trick with everything - including expensive items such as cars. In a desperate attempt to recapture lost sales and profits, Ford of Europe is now in the process of launching an improved version of its lacklustre Escort model only two years after its initial launch; it has been 're-skinned', and otherwise improved, by its industrial designers and engineers. As the UK food and computer software industries have shown over the past few years, an increased rate of such 'incremental innovation', to use the technical term, can do wonders for one's market share. In grossly saturated markets such as segments of consumer electronics, the revamp of a product's exterior, or also of its performance, may fail to work its magic. But such cases are the exception. The readiness of German, and especially Japanese, industry to undertake a steady flow of incremental product and process improvements, as opposed to less frequent and much riskier big leaps forward, is one of the reasons for those countries' industrial success in the past 20 years against the more breakthrough-minded US and UK. In the sort of consumer and industrial products at which they excel, the Germans may not introduce improvements as often as the Japanese do in their own areas of strength. But the Germans certainly beat the British. So, these days, do many American companies, which are borrowing Japan's incremental tactics for all they are worth. A lot of this incremental expenditure falls outside OECD and other official definitions of research and development. So Britain's poor performance in incremental development adds an extra layer of concern to its awful standing versus its main industrial competitors in the sort of expenditure comparisons shown in the illustration. Sceptical economists will argue that this article represents the ravings of a technology freak, and adherence to the obvious fallacy that a nation's economic strength varies in direct proportion to its expenditure on development and research. On both counts, such criticism of the foregoing is misplaced. Likewise, to advocate a surge in spending on D, and possibly also on R, does not in any way imply disagreement with critics who argue that improving the management and productivity of both development and research, on even the most worthwhile of projects, is more important than simply increasing the spend. Quality does count more than quantity, in other words. In economic jargon, raising the outputs of development and research must be more of a priority than raising the inputs to them. Yet this does not mean that greater inputs are not also required, as an economic consultant, David Sawers, suggested in the FT last month (Personal View, Sept 2). Better output and greater input are both needed if British companies, and the nation as a whole, are to improve their real competitive performance. Recent US academic and consultancy research has shown that large Japanese companies are managing their design, development and engineering processes much more efficiently than either their US or their European counterparts. In America, companies are now moving fast, through various changes in management processes, to close that productivity gap. Yet, in spite of a sharp slide in corporate profitability in 1991, many of the same companies are also spending more on both D and R. Given the intense financial pressures which they feel from Wall Street these days, few if any of them can be doing so out of blind faith. Rather, they have learned from experience that market-driven incremental development is a vital factor in commercial success - as, in many cases, is research. If anyone really doubts this, they need only ask resilient US companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and 3M, or the more mundane massed ranks of Germany's world-beating engineering enterprises. Or, of course, Japan's ultra-competitive car industry. Alternatively, much closer to the home of some of the most unworldly economists around, doubters could talk to Glaxo, ICL or even mundane old Turner &amp; Newall (T&amp;N). In their very different industries, all three are heavily dependent on D, R, or both. The figures above are taken from the government-backed 1991 'UK R&amp;D Scoreboard', produced by Company Reporting. The 1992 statistics do not include a table of each country's Top 100 all-industry spenders, or sector breakdowns, except for the UK. The figures should not be read as precise to the decimal point, because of differences in definitions between countries, and even between companies in the same country. But the US and UK figures are based closely on the rather narrow OECD definition of 'R&amp;D', as are those for leading German companies. For the most part, the US and UK figures exclude government-funded research and development. Two things, above all, emerge from the statistics. First, the total UK outlay on research and development is relatively low in every sector, even those few where Britain is, or has been, supposedly strong, such as chemicals and aerospace. This relates to the second point: that, even in sectors where the UK's leading companies are just as R&amp;D-intensive as their global rivals - such as ICI in chemicals - R&amp;D intensity tails off behind them.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF R&amp;D SPENDING BY TOP 100 SPENDERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- R&amp;D % OF SALES             All Industries   Motor   Chemical   Consumer   Electrical &amp;                                                 products   electronics                                                excluding                                                     food UK                    1.69    2.77       3.56       0.53           4.25 US                    3.80    3.60       4.50       1.60           5.60 Germany               5.09    4.73       5.79       4.37           9.09 Japan                 3.71    4.12       3.88       8.59           5.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- R&amp;D % OF SALES            Aerospace   Leisure   Manufacturing  Metals &amp;   Telecomm-                                      including    mining   unications                                     mechanical                                    engineering UK              3.34      0.36            0.79       0.57         1.85 US              4.20      6.80            4.10       1.70         5.50 Germany        23.78         -            3.67       1.81            - Japan              -      3.62            3.23       0.73         4.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Where no German or Japanese entry is shown, this is because no single company from that country had an R&amp;D spend large enough for it to be included in the national all industry list of top 100 R&amp;D spenders.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Company Reporting  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Congress spending axe threatens supercollider TEXAN politicians yesterday began a desperate rearguard action to try to save the Superconducting Supercollider, after the House of Representatives voted to kill the Dollars 8bn scientific research project. The supercollider's goal is to find out more about subatomic particles by smashing them against each other in a 54-mile oval tunnel, now under construction near Waxahachie, Texas. But the project, derided by its critics as a pork-barrel scheme with no scientific value, appears to have fallen victim to Congress's new enthusiasm for cutting expenditure. 'The House was looking for a blood sacrifice and they found it in the Supercollider,' said Congressman Joe Barton, in whose district Waxahachie lies. Supercollider funding could be restored by the Senate, but its leading backer there, Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, warned yesterday that it faced an uphill fight. The spending axe in Congress has been much sharpened by a recent surge of attention to the spiralling federal budget deficit. A bid to amend the constitution to require the government to balance its budget narrowly failed last week to win the necessary two-thirds majority in the House. After signalling their attachment to the principle of fiscal rectitude, the 280 members who voted for the constitutional amendment appear to be shy of showing hypocrisy by voting so soon afterwards for lavish spending projects. House committees have agreed in recent days cuts in defence spending - and even in the Congressional operating budget. The supercollider has had its critics since it was proposed in 1986, among them scientists who feared it would take almost all the federal money available for scientific research. The administration claimed at first that it would cost Dollars 5.3bn, but its estimate has since risen to Dollars 8.2bn, and critics' estimates run to more than Dollars 11bn. Texas chipped in Dollars 1bn in order to lure the supercollider to Waxahachie, but the administration has claimed all along that a quarter to a half of the cost would be met by foreign participation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hajj Isma'il, chief of Palestinian </F> police in Jericho, by Mahmud Husayn in Cairo; date not given:  "We Are Trying Hard To Avoid Clashing With Armed Settlers, Will  Take Measures To Regulate and Control Appearance of  Weapons"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction]    [Text] Palestinian police forces assumed civil powers in  Gaza and Jericho on Wednesday. Palestinians took over  administration of their own affairs for the first time. How is  the Palestinian police planning best to perform its missions?  How will it deal with citizens and with settlers at the same  time? Colonel Hajj Isma'il, chief of the Palestinian police  forces, throws light on the future duties of the Palestinian  police in the following telephone interview with our AL-SHARQ  bureau in Cairo.    [Husayn] What missions have been assigned to the Palestinian  police? How do you feel now that the Feast of Sacrifice has  arrived with the police forces among their own people in Gaza  and Jericho for the first time?    [Isma'il] First I send my greetings to all people in the  Arab  homeland on the occasion of the Blessed Feast of Sacrifice. I  send these greetings from the liberated land of Palestine and  the brave city of Jericho. We send expressions of love and  esteem to all who contributed and helped the Palestinian people  return to their land and home. Greetings to the whole Arab  nation from the Atlantic to the Gulf!    As for the duties of the police, since their arrival, the  civilian police forces have assumed normal duties as usual in  the territory, especially in the Jericho area. The forces have  begun to execute all their duties to provide security and safety  and maintain order. Affairs here in Jericho are proceeding  normally and as usual. The Palestinian police are running  affairs in accordance with the operational program they have.    [Husayn] What is the situation of the settlers in the Gaza  and Jericho area? Do you expect disturbances to be fomented  during the operation of the Palestinian police forces?    [Isma'il] We have worked hard from the beginning to avoid  getting into problems with the settlers, particularly the  religious ones. The Jews have a small synagogue in the Jericho  area. One of the agreements was that the religious should be  allowed to frequent this synagogue once a week or at any time  they wish, but on condition that they not be armed. The  religious are insisting on entering the synagogue with their  weapons and are refusing to be bound by the agreement. They are  giving us trouble and problems. They also are going through the  city. We are trying hard in liaison with the Israeli side to  overcome the problems. We are still suffering from this problem.  The religious settlers are still behaving provocatively.    [Husayn] What about the return of refugee Jericho residents  to their lands from Jordan?    [Isma'il] There are large numbers of Palestinians living  completely on Jordanian soil and receiving much attention in  Jordan. They are now waiting for arrangements to be made to  implement the agreement on a return of the refugees. They will  have priority in returning to their country. Special committees  will begin in this context to discuss the return of the  refugees--joint Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian committees and  joint Israeli-Palestinian-Egyptian committees.    [Husayn] What about Palestinians visiting Jerusalem, given  the ban that Israel is imposing?    [Isma'il] The Israeli position remains the same regarding  visits to Jerusalem by residents of the Jericho area. We are  suffering from this difficulty. We discussed the subject last  Wednesday with the Israeli side. The Israeli position still has  not changed on this subject.    They insist that anyone who wants to visit Jerusalem must  obtain a permit. We have informed them that Jerusalem is part of  Palestinian territory. We shall soon visit Jerusalem. We are  working to break the blockade and lift the measures that the  Israeli side has imposed on Jerusalem.    [Husayn] What preparations are being made to receive  Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the Jericho area?    [Isma'il] We in the West Bank and Gaza are eagerly awaiting  the arrival of Chairman Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and earnestly  preparing to receive him. The timing of the arrival has been  left up to the chairman. He will be among his people and  friends. We welcome him warmly among the people of his homeland.    [Husayn] What about supervision of the King Husayn Bridge  entering and leaving Jericho, as well as the passage linking  Jericho and the Gaza Strip? What is the situation of the police  forces regarding these two crossings?    [Isma'il] There are agreements on the subject. The Israeli  side is building the installations necessary for traffic on the  three crossings. The Israeli side will soon finish setting up  the designated stations, and we shall then begin to implement  all measures concerned with the process of entering and leaving  the corridors in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  on the subject.    [Husayn] Would you tell us something about the deployment of  the Palestinian police forces and the duties assigned to them?    [Isma'il] As soon as our forces reached the Jericho area,  they moved to secure and safeguard public installations. We are  working hard to assure public order and provide protection to  citizens. When we arrived, we began to provide protection to all  institutions, so that they can operate normally. Tourism as  usual has returned to Jericho. All civil institutions are  working regularly. We also took swift steps to restore control  of traffic in the city and of public utilities in cooperation  with people here. We are witnessing great joy among our people  who lived under the occupation and those who have returned from  the diaspora. The whole country is filled with joy. Jericho will  be a step toward the return of all our lands--until the flag of  freedom shall fly over them. We are working hard to make Jericho  a brick in the edifice of our independent Palestinian national  state. We ask the Arab states to support the Palestinian people,  so that we can restore the infrastructure that we received in  ruinous condition from the Israeli army of occupation.    We are working to build a modern state. This requires  support  from the Arab and Islamic nation.    [Husayn] What measures are the Palestinian police forces  taking with regard to the issue of arms proliferating in the  hands of civilian citizens in Jericho?    [Isma'il] We for our part will take measures to guarantee  and  control the weapons phenomenon in a way that protects the  dignity of citizens and the dignity of the homeland. We expect  close cooperation from citizens with the police. We have no  troubles on this subject in Jericho, since everyone favors  stopping the circulation of any illegitimate and illegal weapons.</p>

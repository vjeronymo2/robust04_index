			<p>BFN     [Text] The General People's Congress General Committee  [GPCGC] has held an emergency meeting under GPC Assistant  Secretary General 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani at the end of  which it issued the following statement:    Our Yemeni people and the Arab and Islamic nation were  distressed when the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] under 'Ali Salim al-Bid issued its  ill-fated secessionist declaration.    The GPCGC vehemently condemns this treasonous, foolhardy,  and  rash action and views al-Bid's secessionist declaration only two  hours after the implementation of the decision by the joint  meeting of the Council of Ministers and the Speakership of the  House of Representatives to halt all military operations as  another scandal by this deviationist gang, and as the gloomy  end, and the resounding collapse of the last of its  fragmentation and partitioning illusions and dreams. This is  because it flagrantly deviated from national consensus, the  popular will, and from the deeply-rooted ideological,  historical, and national constants of our people, and because it  became involved in the conspiracy to fragment the homeland's  unity and engage the country in sectarian, provincial, and  tribal disputes.    While condemning and strongly rejecting this criminal  action,  the GPCGC supports and blesses all the unity steps, the  courageous sovereign decisions, and the responsible historic and  national stands that were adopted by the leaders of the higher  constitutional bodies, with at their head brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. At the same  time, it emphasizies to our Armed Forces the need to tighten the  siege on the dens of this gang, to pursue its corrupt symbols,  to stalk them wherever they may be, and to expeditiously arrest  them and bring them to trial so that they may receive the just  punishment for all the atrocities and the reprehensible fascist  crimes they have committed against our people and homeland.    The GPCGC highly values the victories and the great heroic  feats the sons of our Armed Forces and Public Security daily  record and which they baptize with costly blood in all the  locations of honor and dignity in defense of unity, and to  protect the democratic achievements and the elected legitimate  institutions. The GPCGC would like here to note its great  appreciation of all the honest soldiers and officers of unity  who were misled by the gang of apostasy and secession but who,  after becoming aware of the reality of the vile conspiracy,  rushed to join the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy, refusing to obey the orders of this isolationist and  renegade gang within the YSP.    The GPCGC emphasizes that it is still confident that the  unity leaders within the YSP are capable of confronting the  secessionist trend within the party, of liquidating it, and of  clearly supporting the unity state and its institutions. The  GPCGC also urges all our people with their national and social  forces, their political parties and organizations, their popular  organizations, and their trade unions to stand as one rank in  support of unity and to safeguard democracy and constitutional  legitimacy and all the civilized achievements of our people. It  also calls for mobilizing our masses potential and our  homeland's resources to confront the schemes of this unjust and  criminal gang and protect the security, stability, and  independence of the homeland.    The GPCGC praises all the fraternal stands and sincere  sentiments that many of our Arab brothers and friends in the  world have expressed when they reiterated their support for the  unity of our people and for constitutional legitimacy, and their  concern not to interfere in Yemen's domestic affairs. From  this premise, the GPCGC warns against any contact or dealings  with this gang and views the recognition of this fictitious and  secessionist entity by any fraternal or friendly country as an  enmical act against our people, an infringement on their  sovereignty and independence, and a blatant and rejected  interference in their domestic affairs.    The GPCGC is confident of our masses ability, the capability  of our Armed Forces, the alertness of our security organs, and  the cohesion of our national ranks to score decisive victory on  all the secessionist agents to obey God's saying: And fight  them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there  prevails justice and faith in God.    Issued by the General People's Congress General Committee,  Sanaa, 23 May 1994</p>

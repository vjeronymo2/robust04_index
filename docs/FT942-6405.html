			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UN likely to discuss N Korea sanctions The UN Security Council is expected to meet today to discuss actions against North Korea for its refusal to let international inspectors examine fuel rods being removed from its nuclear reactor. The council has been divided over the issue, with the US threatening sanctions and China warning against punishing North Korea. It is likely that the council will consider a resolution urging Pyongyang to reach an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on sampling the fuel rods. In a separate move, the Japanese government yesterday offered North Korea financial aid if it allows full inspections of nuclear sites. The proposal, while vague, appears to mark a softening in its policy policy, as Japan has previously insisted official aid to North Korea will only come after normalisation of diplomatic relations. The IAEA wants to analyse the fuel rods to determine if North Korea has removed any plutonium-rich fuel rods from its 5MW reactor and diverted them for its suspected nuclear weapons programme. If North Korea fails to guarantee the testing of the fuel rods, the US is likely to ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions on the North. North Korea has warned that the imposition of sanctions would amount to an 'act of war'. 'The North Korean nuclear problem is entering its most serious stage and the present situation is extremely worrisome,' said a South Korean foreign ministry spokesman. Talks on the inspection procedures between North Korea and the IAEA broke down at the weekend. North Korea is removing the spent nuclear fuel at a rapid pace and preventing the IAEA from selecting samples for later testing. Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported North Korea had proposed the IAEA could analyse the fuel rods once a package deal is completed between Washington and Pyongyang on diplomatic recognition and economic aid. An aide to South Korean President Kim Young-sam suggested that Pyongyang's actions in recent days were equivalent to a hard bet in poker: 'It is a risky gamble to obtain the maximum gains, but they may have miscalculated this time because the US appears to running out of patience.' Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, said his country was ready to do much to help improve living standards in North Korea, and was prepared to offer assistance in exchange for concessions on the nuclear dispute.</p>

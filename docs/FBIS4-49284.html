			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Anhui </F> Discipline Inspection Commission"]    [Text] The ninth plenary session of the Anhui Discipline  Inspection Commission was held in Hefei from 21 to 23 March.  Twenty-five discipline inspection commission members attended  the meeting. Attending as observers were persons in charge of  the discipline inspection organs of various localities, cities,  counties (districts), units directly under the province,  universities, and large-sized enterprises and institutions. The  plenary session, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line, revolved around the party's tasks of  seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability; conveyed the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection; reviewed and summed up  anticorruption fight across Anhui since 1993, especially the  second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection; exchanged the experience in anticorruption fight;  and made arrangements for anticorruption tasks in 1994.    The plenary session deliberated and approved a report  "Launching the Deep-Going Anticorruption Fight So As To Serve  Anhui's Reform, Development, and Stability" by Chen Guanglin,  secretary of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission, on  behalf of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission Standing  Committee. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC  Commission, delivered an important speech at the meeting. The  session held that comrade Lu Rongjing's speech and Comrade Chen  Guanglin's report earnestly implemented the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection; analyzed Anhui's anticorruption fight in a  seeking-truth-from-facts manner; summed up the experience of  anticorruption fight in 1993; and clearly defined the tasks of  the anticorruption fight in 1994. The session called on party  organizations at all levels across Anhui to earnestly organize  the broad ranks of party members and cadres to study the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ninth Plenary Session  of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission; to further reach  a unity of thinking and understanding; to meet the demands of  the central authorities and the provincial party committee; to  strengthen flesh-and-blood ties with the masses of the people;  to adopt effective measures; and continue to carry out the  deep-going anticorruption fight.    Last year was a year witnessing rapid progress in reform,  opening up, and economic development in Anhui, as well as major  breakthroughs in the anticorruption fight. Party organizations,  governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels  across Anhui firmly carried out the party's basic line; and,  based on the arrangements of the central authorities and the  Anhui provincial party committee, closely revolved around the  pivotal task of economic development, led the broad ranks of  party members, cadres, and the people to launch a broad and  deep-going anticorruption fight, and accomplished many tasks.  Generally speaking, the anticorruption fight across Anhui was  good and its development was healthy. To a varying extent, we  scored some results in carrying out the three tasks put forward  by the central authorities and basically met the demands of the  central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee.  Remarkable results were scored in areas and departments where  good work was done. All of these made positive contributions to  maintaining political stability, promoting reform, opening up,  and economic development in Anhui, as well as ensuring the  implementation of the macroeconomic regulation and control in  Anhui. The session held that we should fully affirm the  progress and results achieved in the anticorruption fight at an  earlier stage; however, we must address the issue of the  unbalanced progress of Anhui's anticorruption fight. Some  results are not solid, and some deep-rooted problems have yet to  be resolved. We still face a grim situation in the  anticorruption fight. This is a very formidable task that needs  persistent arduous efforts and allows no laxity.    In last year's anticorruption fight, various localities and  departments thoroughly implemented the central authorities'  arrangements, policies, and principles regarding the launching  of the anticorruption fight and accumulated a great deal of  experience. These experiences are mainly as follows: 1) to  accord with the tasks of the central authorities and the Anhui  provincial party committee, closely integrate reform, opening  up, and economic development with the anticorruption fight, and  ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the Anhui  economy; 2) to adhere to the principle of "firmly grasping two  links at the same time" and truly take the responsibility of  leading the anticorruption fight; 3) to fully mobilize the  masses and rely on them to fight corruption; 4) to attach  importance to doing a good job at every stage and concentrate  efforts on management over special projects; 5) to strengthen  leadership over investigation and handling of cases and make  efforts toward solving major cases; and 6) to give full play to  responsible institutions' functions and form joint forces to  fight corruption. These experiences should be applied to guide  the future anticorruption fight and improved in practice.    The session pointed out: In accordance with the  arrangements of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial  party committee, the general requirement of this year's  anticorruption fight is to adhere to taking Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance; to  thoroughly implement guidelines of the third plenary session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and the 10th Plenary  Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in an  all-round manner; to grasp the party's tasks; to closely revolve  around the pivotal task of economic development; to adhere to  the three anticorruption tasks; and, on the basis of  consolidating achieved results, to continue to carry out  effectively the deep-going and protracted anticorruption fight;  and to serve Anhui's reform, development, and stability.    First, we should continue to exercise strict supervision  over  leading cadres' honesty and discipline. Leading cadres of party  and government organs at and above the county (section) level  should strictly implement various regulations of the central  authorities and the State Council regarding the strengthening of  the construction of party work style and a clean government. We  should continue to thoroughly implement the five-article  regulations on honesty and discipline put forward by the central  authorities last year. On this basis, we should firmly  implement the five-article regulations put forward and  reiterated by the central authorities this year:    (1) It is not allowed to violate regulations to purchase and  replace imported luxury cars; it is not allowed to abuse one's  authority to change or borrow cars and extort funds for car  buying from enterprises and subordinate units; it is not allowed  to use loans, pooled funds, and funds for special projects to  purchase cars for leading cadres. County (city) party and  government organs and units that have not paid back workers'  wages are not allowed to purchase cars. (2) It is not allowed  to violate the State Council's regulations on the reform of the  housing system to purchase homes at lower prices; it is not  allowed to abuse one's authority to offer preferential  conditions when purchasing homes for oneself, one's children,  and relatives; it is not allowed to spend public funds on  refurbishing individual's homes. (3) On their domestic official  business trips, leading cadres should travel with light luggage  and few attendants and should not go beyond the local standards  for room and board. It is not allowed to host special dance  parties for leading cadres. (4) It is not allowed to turn  events into big extravaganzas, in the name of weddings,  funerals, post transfers, birthdays, or house-warming. It is,  especially, not allowed to spend public funds and property on  hosting such events and to take the opportunity to accumulate  wealth. (5) It is not allowed to abuse one's authority to delay  paying back public funds; it is not allowed to borrow public  funds for purchasing homes for oneself and one's relatives and  friends, to build private houses, and engage in profit-earning  activities.    In accordance with the guidelines of the central  authorities'  regulations, we should, in the light of Anhui's reality, include  the correcting of party and government organs that violate  regulations to spend public funds on installing telephones in  their homes into the contents on cadres' honesty and discipline;  and implement this together with the central authorities'  five-article regulations. Leading cadres of enterprises and  institutions and those of party and government organs at and  above county (section) level also should implement the  regulations on honesty and discipline; oppose such corrupt  phenomena as abusing power for personal gain, embezzlement,  taking bribes, and extravagance.    Second, we should continue to do a good job in investigating  and handling major cases. We should focus on the investigation  and handling of law- and discipline-violating cases of leading  party and government organs and cadres, judicial departments,  administrative law-enforcement departments, economic  administrative departments, and their staff members; and  concentrate our efforts on the investigation and handling of  major cases. We should emphasize the investigation and handling  of cases that involve leading cadres embezzling funds, taking  bribes, and abusing power for personal gain; cases that involve  law- and discipline-enforcement personnel practicing favoritism  and engaging in malpractice, perverting justice for bribes,  violating the law when enforcing laws, and violating discipline  when enforcing discipline; and cases that involve legal bodies  violating the law and discipline. We should select typical  cases to make public to the masses and improve the social  effects of the handling of cases.    Third, we must continue to stop unhealthy tendencies. (1)  We must continue to firmly stop unwarranted levies, and place  emphasis on intensifying supervision and inspection, making sure  that rules are strictly followed. Efforts must be made to deal  with noncompensatory use of enterprises' vehicles, computers,  and telecommunications equipment by party and government organs,  or their personnel, through abusing their authority; as well as  the problem involving the use of various names to appropriate  enterprises' funds for creating "small coffers" for organs, or  using appropriated funds for projects benefiting staff workers.  The unhealthy tendency of soliciting financial support from  enterprises under all sorts of excuses must stop. Efforts to  alleviate peasants' burdens must continue. The central  government's regulations on separating the collection and use of  administrative levies and fines must be firmly followed, and  specific measures must be drawn up for implementing these  regulations. (2) The "small coffers" of party and government  organs, administrative organs, and institutions must be  screened. (3) Continual efforts must be made to stop the  unhealthy trend of using public funds for travelling abroad or  in other parts of the country.    To safeguard the solemnity of political discipline and  ensure  the implementation of government orders, discipline inspection  and supervisory organs at all levels must, while carrying out  these three anticorruption projects, intensify their supervision  over law enforcement and the implementation of democratic  centralism, focusing attention on the implementation of all  major decisions and measures of the party Central Committee, the  State Council, the provincial party committee, and the  provincial government on deepening reforms, developing the  economy, and maintaining stability.    This year is an important year for implementing the  guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the  10th Plenary Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial Party  Committee; an important year for Anhui to achieve a sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development; and an important year  for restructuring the economic system. While reform,  development, and stability are arduous tasks, so is the  anticorruption struggle. The plenary session urges all party  committees and governments to properly handle the relations  between reform, development, stability, and the anticorruption  struggle; firmly uphold the policy of promoting material  civilization and socialist ethics at the same time; and regard  the anticorruption struggle as part of the scheme of overall  importance. We must mobilize all party members to wage the  fight, party organs and government departments must join forces,  and each and every organ and department has to responsibilities  to fulfill. The fight against corruption must be closely  coordinated with efforts to improve party conduct and work  ethics, party members and cadres must be regularly educated to  be mindful of their conduct and work ethics, rules and  regulations governing party conduct should be drawn up, and the  work ethics-related legislation must be expedited, so that the  root causes and the symptoms can be dealt with at the same time.  Party and government leaders at all levels must set examples  with their personal deeds. They must take the lead in  implementing the Central Committee's regulations and  requirements for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics,  earnestly intensify supervision over the anticorruption  struggle, and render assistance in doing away with interference  and in dealing with thorny problems. Anticorruption propaganda  must be further intensified and a good environment for the media  to join in the fight against corruption should be created.    To keep pace with the anticorruption drive, discipline  inspection and supervisory organs must be even stronger. As  advisors and important assistants to party committees and  governments in improving party conduct and work ethics,  discipline inspection and supervisory organs play the role of  organizing, coordinating, and guiding the struggle. Cadres,  especially leading cadres, of all discipline inspection and  supervisory organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study  the unabridged version in the light of the actual state of  affairs, and use the guidelines to guide their work. Leading  bodies of all discipline inspection commissions must abide by  the party principle for democratic centralism, exercise  collective leadership and share responsibilities, work with  greater unity and coordination, and do their jobs with concerted  efforts. We must sum up experiences of improving efficiency by  merging offices, and continue to streamline our organization,  organs, operations, and operating procedures so that each organ  will have two different functions. All organs must intensify  their ideological and operational construction. They must  educate their cadres to uphold the concept of taking overall  interests into account and guide their cadres to study the  market economy so that they can do their jobs more efficiently.  Organs must also intensify investigation and study and do their  jobs creatively.    The plenary session believes that, as long as party  committees and governments at all levels firmly implement the  decisions of the Central Committee and the provincial party  committee on fighting corruption, have a consensus of view,  earnestly strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses to  follow through with the project, this year's anticorruption  drive certainly will achieve new success.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Sold a pup - again Instances of predatory behaviour by British insurance salesmen have become so commonplace that revelations of mis-selling hardly come as a surprise. Yet the Securities and Investments Board's latest findings, reported in the Financial Times today, point to such extensive mis-selling in personal pensions that the picture is becoming increasingly disturbing. Failures of compliance appear to have taken place in a significant proportion of the sales of nearly 500,000 personal pension plans to former members of occupational pension schemes. These failures, which involve a number of self-regulatory organisations including the SIB itself, go back as far as 1988. A sampling exercise has established that countless transactions were completed on the basis of inadequate investigation of the purchasers' existing pension arrangements and financial affairs. The watchdogs apparently did nothing to monitor those in the system whose selling techniques were known to be in most urgent need of monitoring. None of this need imply that personal pensions were inappropriate for each and every one of the customers in question. There will be many, especially among the young for whom the flexibility of a personal pension plan is appealing, who may remain happy when their circumstances have been investigated. But it is already clear that many older people have been persuaded to leave good schemes with full index-linking of deferred pensions. Here the benefits are most unlikely to be matched by a personal pension. Redundant mineworkers, in particular, have been shamelessly gulled by salesmen from some of the best-known names in insurance and banking. It is not putting it too strongly to say that this is scandalous. And to its credit the SIB is recognising as much in its response, which will aim to provide appropriate financial remedies, in co-operation with the insurance industry, over the next two years. Co-operation will almost certainly be forthcoming, since the damage to the industry's already tarnished reputation is potentially so great that urgent efforts at restitution are in the insurers' own interest. But the task of investigation and finding appropriate means of restitution will not be easy. Nor will the damage to the regulatory structure be easy to repair. Insurance has always been the Achilles' heel of the 1986 Financial Services Act regime. Since the arrival of Mr Andrew Large at its head, the SIB has sought more vigorously to address this weakness. Yet the latest revelations indicate that an entirely new approach is needed to raise the standards of salesmanship that now prevail in dealing with complex products such as pensions. Education and training will have to be transformed if confidence is to be re-established. In promoting personal pensions with such enthusiasm before the regulatory regime had been tried and tested, the government has shown itself to be pretty much on a par with the insurance salesmen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al Rabia'a [March] 15, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY -- The INDIAN NEWS AGENCY said that Malcolm Ronil, the  director of missile operations in the American Defence  Department expressed his country's concern at the development of  what he called `missile programmes' in seven countries: India,  North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. The agency  cited the official as saying that a ballistic missiles programme  in these countries constitutes a serious threat to American  national interests.    The international affairs editor of the JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY, commenting on this said that these statements once more  expose a series of facts, the most important that, - they are  levelled against countries which are neither Christian nor  Jewish. This is new proof of plans by the Jewish-Christian  alliance against Islam and other non Jewish and non Christian  religions, specifically Confucianism and Buddhism. This can be  seen given that these statements do not at all mention the  nuclear arsenal which the Israelis have, an arsenal including  200 nuclear warheads, which the Israelis have publicly declared  to have in their possession. No one has called for the  destruction of these weapons nor has anyone expressed concern  about their existence. However, the reason is obvious, namely  that there will be no objection to these weapons so long as they  are aimed at the Arabs, whom, in the eyes of the Christians and  Jews, are undesirable animals who should be annihilated.    The Great Jamahiriyah, one of the countries mentioned by the  United States has, as a peace loving country, repeatedly  asserted that it does not have weapons of mass destruction in  its possession, nor does it even consider them, or owning them.  Instead, the Great Jamahiriyah is preoccupied with its  development programme and building a prosperous life for its  people. Therefore, the continuous repetition of such statements  which are emanating from the highest American and British  official levels if [word indistinct] official terrorism by  nuclear superpowers carried out against a peace loving country  which is being subjected to unjust harsh measures imposed by  these countries which dominate the Security Council and obliges  it to adopt resolutions which serve their best interests and  their colonialist aims.    None of the countries which the American official listed in  his statement have ever attacked the United States or Britain.  Indeed, the opposite is true, for these countries have, at  various times, been the victim of aggression and colonialism  stemming from these two countries themselves. Thus, these  countries would normally be expected to think about self defence  and ways to prevent aggression and colonialism meted out by  these two western countries who until this day have deployed  their warships off the shores of these countries in a blatant  display of provocation and arrogance.</p>

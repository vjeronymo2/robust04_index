			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan prepares for tobacco group float Shares in Japan Tobacco are to be offered next month ahead of the the state-owned group's listing on the Tokyo stock exchange in late October, Japan's ministry of finance announced yesterday. The decision follows a two-year delay in the share offering due to the sluggish Tokyo stock market. The stock exchange listing comes a year after that of East Japan Railway, when demand was so great that the TSE's computer system came to a standstill for a while. The success of JT's listing is crucial to the share offerings of other state-owned companies waiting to be privatised, including the railway operators splintered from the former Japan National Railway. The government will release 666,666 shares, or one-third of the outstanding 2m shares. Of this, 230,000 will be auctioned publicly in August. The rest will be sold at a price based on that auction. The finance ministry has approved the entry of two US firms, Canter Fitzgerald Securities and Garban, to operate as inter-dealer brokerages for Japanese government bonds. Japan's 'broker's broker' operations are dominated by two Japanese companies, Japan Bond Trading and Nakadachi Securities. The US firms will be the first foreign operators to move into the market. The move is a response to US demands for more open financial markets. The US firms have undertaken inter-dealer transactions in US government bonds in Japan since 1988.</p>

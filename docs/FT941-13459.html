			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Stuck in a nightmare of debt: Pressure is growing on Trinidad and Tobago In a clear attempt to prepare for increasing stringency, Trinidad and Tobago's political leaders are being colourfully blunt about the problems of the once-buoyant economy which is facing continued uncertainty, due mainly to the state of the oil market. 'In the same way that to make a cake you have to break an egg, as we move to economic prosperity there is necessarily a period of difficulty,' said Mr Patrick Manning, the prime minister. Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, has confessed to a 'major nightmare' with the country's finances, and has asked his countrymen for 'patience and sacrifice' while the government tries to massage the stagnant economy. These are trying times for the lop-sided, oil dependent economy, once as healthy as any in the Caribbean basin, but now suffering from the prolonged lassitude of the international oil market. The government is being forced increasingly towards austerity and fiscal prudence as organised labour, always truculent, is becoming increasingly annoyed. The cause of Mr Mottley's nightmare is the demand of servicing the country's foreign debt with reduced income from oil. Trinidad and Tobago's per capita foreign debt, at Dollars 2,416, is higher than most of the more well-known debtor countries. The English-speaking republic of 1.2m people is a small oil producer, with output averaging 150,000 barrels per day in better times. Each time the oil price falls the economy is further pressurised to meet debt servicing costs  -Dollars 608m this year, almost one third of export receipts. 'The implications of the high debt service for economic growth are significant,' said Mr Mottley. 'In order to free the resources to meet the debt service in this period, this country must cut back on its overall expenditure, both consumption and investment expenditures.' For the 1994 budget, Mr Mottley announced new taxes on petrol, financial services, vehicle transfers and cigarettes, and the extension of a business levy to cover the self-employed. The money is needed to finance expenditure of TTDollars 7.7bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The government's handling of the economy and its proposals to create stability have been attacked by its critics. 'I don't see that the budget is going to make a difference,' said Mr Basdeo Panday, leader of the main opposition party. 'It seems to be a continuation of last year. Although the minister mentions that he is aware of what the problems are in the society, he has really not said anything about tackling them in a serious way.' The government, however, is getting support from the business community. The Employers Consultative Council said the government was 'courageous' in building on earlier efforts at economic reform, and had presented 'a budget of new enlightenment and rededication of purpose, not a pause for refreshment'. The earlier reforms implemented by Mr Manning's administration included the deregulation of the foreign exchange market in May, when the currency was floated and controls lifted on currency movements. The government has also been divesting state-owned economic enterprises. It has sold its wholly-owned urea plant and its 51 per cent stake in an ammonia plant to raise money to help service its foreign debt. Its plan to sack thousands of workers from three state-owned utility companies has raised the hackles of organised labour, which is also opposed to the divestment of state enterprises. The government claims that the port authority and the public transport and water companies recorded a cumulative loss of TTDollars 342m in 1992. The state owes public servants about TTDollars 3bn, which the government says it cannot pay. The government faces some difficulty in stimulating the economy. Continuing contraction in the petroleum and manufacturing sectors has led the government to a preliminary assessment of economic growth of 1 per cent last year, and a forecast of about the same for this year, following a decline of 1.6 per cent in 1992. Mr Mottley recently visited financial capitals testing the market for a Dollars 100m Eurobond issue to help meet debt payments, after the success of a similar issue last year. There are now darker clouds on the horizon. Last month's budget, and the government's economic plans, were predicated on oil prices at Dollars 19 per barrel. The slump in prices since will force the government into more unpopular stringency which is unlikely to end Mr Mottley's nightmare.</p>

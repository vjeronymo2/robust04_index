			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala lumpur, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Malaysian  defense minister Najib Tun Razak today met visiting Chinese  General Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese  People's Liberation Army.    The Chinese general is here to attend the Defense Services  Asia '94 exhibition.    During their meeting, Najib and Zhang agreed that reciprocal  visits of the leaders of the two countries should continue in  the interest of mutual understanding and friendship.    Malaysia sees China as a close neighbor, said Najib. Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamed's visit to China last year further  strengthened the bilateral relationship, he added.    A growing number of Malaysians are visiting China, and they  are getting excited about China's economic prospects, Najib said.    When introducing China's defense policy to Najib, Zhang said  China will not seek hegemony, commit aggression, align with any  other country or build military bases abroad, adding the Chinese  Army is totally committed to defense.</p>

He revealed that by 1997 the living space in Beijing is to  reach 14 sq m per capita, 5.7 sq m more than the figure at the  end of 1993.    Over the past 15 years of reform, Zhang said, Beijing has  poured about 26 billion yuan (some three billion U.S. dollars)  into house-building, erecting 1.3 million flats with a total  area of nearly 80 million sq m.    By 1993 the living space increased to 8.3 sq m per capita,  almost double that in 1978.    However, house construction still cannot keep up with the  demand, the mayor said.    According to the plan, from now to 1997 the city intends to  build 2.5 million sq m of improved living quarters.    In a departure from the present monotonous layout of blocks,  the appearance and style of buildings will be diversified. The  surrounding environment will also be improved, Zhang said.    Complementary facilities for education, medical care and  recreation as well as commercial, financial, telecommunications  and postal services will be set up at the same time, he added.</p>

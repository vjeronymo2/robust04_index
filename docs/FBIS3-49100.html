According to the  short-term forecast of the National Labor Center, the decline  will continue in the first half of 1994, and the number of  people out of work will stand at around 580,000.    Statistics indicate that the value of Hungarian industrial  production rose by 4 percent in 1993. The number of unemployed  declined from 680,000 in March (a rate of 13 percent), to  630,000 (12.2 percent).    This, however, is not the total number of unemployed. Last  year, the National Labor Center carried out a national survey on  those left out of the registers because their unemployment aid  is no longer granted (as they had been out of work for one  year). The result was that 12 percent of the long-term  unemployed were left out of the register without any financial  aid. The forecast of the institution for the first six months  of 1994 reckons with only 20,000 people who stand to lose their  eligibility, which means that roughly 50,000 people will not be  on the unemployment records, but will be out of work in the  summer of 1994.    The short-term forecast covered 4,600 firms that employed  about one-third of workers (1.7 million people) and predicts a  decline of 50,000 in the number of registered unemployed to  580,000, that is 11.4 percent of the population in the working  age group.    The analyses stresses that company manpower strategies have  changed considerably in view of the boom taking shape in  economy. The proportion of companies dismissing workers has  steadily declined since the second half of 1992, and, in the  second half of 1993, the number of economic units dismissing  workers was less than those offering vacancies.    Company investment inclination also shows a steady rise,  with  18 percent of firms expanding capacities in the second half of  1993. This proportion was significantly higher in industry,  building industry, and servicing industry. The number of firms  reporting growing orders is also on the rise. In the last  quarter of 1993, the proportion of firms in a good or improving  situation outnumbered that of firms in a lastingly poor or  deteriorating situation, for the first time in two and a half  years.    Demand will mainly increase for skilled workers, and more  and  more companies intend to employ first-time job seekers, which  will improve the employment opportunities of this age-group (the  rate of unemployment in the 16 to 25 age-group is 17 percent).    Figures indicate the boom also has beneficial effects on the  territorial differences in unemployment, with employment  opportunities showing the fastest rise in counties with the  highest unemployment rates.    The analysis reckons with a further improvement in economic  performance and, therefore, better employment opportunities as  dismissals related to restructuring in industry, building  industry and services is drawing to an end, after three years.  However, in spite of the improving economic situation, the  future of long-term unemployed persons unable to find work due  to lack of qualifications or for health reasons, is still to be  settled, experts note.</p>

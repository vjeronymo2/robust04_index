			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Success story ends in exile and bitterness THE NISSAN UK fraud trial has been Lear without the king. Across the water in Switzerland the main actor in the drama, Mr Octav Botnar, has remained beyond the reach of British justice. The warrant issued for his arrest in January last year by the Inland Revenue has never been served. At the time Mr Botnar was abroad, and in the subsequent 18 months he has shown little enthusiasm for leaving his chalet in the mountains above Geneva to return to the country in which he made his fortune. He has since become embroiled in the furore over Conservative party funding, with reports that he contributed up to Pounds 1m through off-shore accounts to Tory funds in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mr Botnar's story is one of the more extraordinary in the annals of modern British business. In his late 50s, at an age when many would be contemplating retirement, he took over the exclusive franchise for importing and distributing Nissan vehicles in the UK. In the course of the next 21 years he built businesses with an annual turnover of about Pounds 1.5bn and annual pre-tax profits close to Pounds 150m. Now it has been revealed that even these hefty profits were fraudulently understated. Mr Botnar built a web of trusts obscuring the ultimate ownership of his operations in entities registered in Panama and the Bahamas which are still exciting Revenue interest. For nearly two decades it appeared that his business could do little wrong. Nissan's share of UK new car sales grew until it was capturing 6 per cent of the market and was far and away the leading Japanese car franchise in the UK. By the early 1990s, however, the magic had begun to fade. Without knowing it, the skids had already been put under Nissan UK, even as it was celebrating one of its proudest moments. In December 1990 Mr Botnar invited guests, friends and media to London's Savoy Hotel for a rare public appearance to celebrate Nissan UK's 21st birthday. Mr Cecil Parkinson - then a very recent ex-transport secretary - rose to describe Mr Botnar as 'truthfully one of our great philanthropists'. Nissan UK had revealed that morning that it was donating Pounds 8m to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. What Mr Botnar did not realise then was that Japan's second-largest carmaker had decided a week before to end Nissan UK's lucrative exclusive import franchise. The decision was made public at the end of December 1990. Nissan Motor said that 'the basis of trust essential to a trading relationship was no longer present between the two companies'. Ever since, Mr Botnar has been at bay. He has fought to outwit the forces closing in on him with a vigour and determination that belie his 79 years and a recent history of serious heart disease. Yet he has been forced to remain in exile from the UK, an increasingly embittered old man, fighting the Revenue and other legal battles but with only mount-ing frustration to show for it. Mr Botnar remains in complete and idiosyncratic control by telephone of the part of his empire that survived the termination of the Nissan franchise, namely the sister company Automotive Financial Group Holdings. This is one of the UK's largest multifranchise retail motor groups. He has often raged against Nissan Motor managers, who he has always claimed were responsible for tipping off the Revenue about him. Mr Botnar, now at home recovering from major surgery, was characteristically unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>

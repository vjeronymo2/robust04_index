			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] The government wants to modify the Industrial  Property (Brands and Patents) Bill the Chamber of Deputies  submitted to the Senate. The proposed modifications are now in  the hands of Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party-Paraiba] and Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party-Parana] -- the rapporteurs of the  Constitution and Justice and Economic Affairs Committees of the  Senate, respectively. The modifications are based on an  agreement approved during the Uruguay round of GATT talks held  in April. The agreement is known as TRIPS ("Trade-Related  Intellectual Property Rights") [given in English].    Bio-technically, the TRIPS agreement does not impose any  major restrictions on obtaining patents on microorganisms, says  Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, the National Institute of  Industrial Property (INPI) president. Article 27 of the GATT  agreement states that "patents will be granted and their rights  will be fully enjoyable, without discrimination over the  involved technological field. Patents may not apply to plants  or animals, but they can apply to microorganisms. In the case  of plants, however, a `sui generis' system can be adopted if  there is no system of patents for plant species."    This article does not clash with the government suggestion  to  maintain patents on microorganisms but not on plants or animals.    Compulsory licenses: Gusmao said the adjustments  proposed by the government deal with the wording of regulations.  The GATT agreement states that compulsory licenses may be  granted provided they meet domestic market needs, except in  cases of unfair competition as defined by court or  administrative authorities. The agreement adds that the  appropriate authorities may cancel compulsory licenses if the  circumstances that justified the issuance of such licenses  disappear and will probably not reappear. The INPI president  said the bill in the Senate will have to be adjusted as follows:    "Pipeline": Article 70 of the TRIPS agreement  provides for a "pipeline" system (patent protection on products  being developed and/or those yet to be sold on the Brazilian  market, until the patent in the originating country expires),  even in countries that adopt grace periods before granting the  patent. It also provides for a five-year period of exclusive  sale on such products to prevent imitation.    In case of the "pipeline" protection, the government  suggested a modification prepared by Deputy Roberto Freire,  which the Chamber of Deputies did not approve. The government  wants to protect patents that have already been launched abroad,  provided the products -- patented in one or more countries --  have not been sold on the Brazilian market. The text approved  by the Chamber of Deputies says that "pipeline" protection will  be granted only to non-patented products.    Domestic manufacture versus imports: Article 27 of the TRIPS  agreement says patents will be granted and their rights fully  enjoyable regardless of the place where the product was invented  or whether the products are imported or locally produced.  Gusmao said this article, which is not very clear, will be  submitted to the new World Trade Organization (WTC). "Brazil  will respect the WTC decision. The government believes a bill  adjusted to the TRIPS should prevail.    The bill at the Senate conditions a patent to full and  complete production of the patented product in Brazilian  territory, in order to meet domestic market needs, with full use  of the patented process. To assure this "compulsory local  production," the bill provides for the issue of compulsory  licenses to local manufacturers three years after the issue of  the patent.    Gusmao said the government believes "importation does not  prove the use of the patent." That is, the patent must be  exploited in Brazil, and not through imports. The government  supports the local exploitation condition, which foments  industrialization."    Parallel importation: This is the importation of  patented products without the authorization of the patent owner.  Interfarma -- an organization of 39 foreign laboratories -- has  stated that the TRIPS agreement forbids parallel importation.  The government, however, maintains that the GATT agreement  "says nothing" about parallel importation. Gusmao said parallel  importation can be admitted only within a common market or a  free-trade zone with reciprocal rights. For example, it will be  authorized in Mercosur [Common Market of the South], through  regulations in the intellectual property rights code of the four  countries. Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan  authorities analyzed the subject last week.    In its suggested modifications, Gusmao said the government  does not consider parallel importation because it is  inconsistent with the requirement of local exploitation of the  patent.</p>

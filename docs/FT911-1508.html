			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Food: An eye for history - Nicholas Lander recommends a favourite London hotel SINCE I began writing this column I have been unable to recommend one of my favourite London hotels, Hazlitt's. It has a lot to offer - West End location, comfort and very reasonable prices (Pounds 86 per night for a double room) - but no restaurant. However, in January 1990 Hazlitt's proprietors, Douglas Blain and Peter McKay, doubled the size of their empire with the acquisition of the Gore Hotel, SW7, and in September 1990 became landlords of Bistrot 190, now a highly successful restaurant, on the ground floor of the Gore. This is a story of how with business sense and flair you can fall into two hazardous businesses - the hotel and restaurant trades - and land on your feet. Blain and McKay met in 1977 on the committee of the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust rescuing derelict Georgian buildings. Enthusiasts for aged buildings (Hazlitt's was built in 1716, the Gore in the 1850s) they began by buying two houses built in 1725 from British Land for Pounds 2,000, renovating them and then selling them for Pounds 90,000 - a percentage profit they have never repeated] In 1986 they heard that three adjacent buildings in Soho which had been nurses' homes for the Women's Hospital next door were coming up for auction. Checking in the Survey of London (an architectural survey of all the buildings in central London dating back to 1800) Blain discovered that underneath the awful paint was the original wooden panelling; this gave them the confidence to lodge the winning bid and look around for finance. Their dream of a small, comfortable and intimate hotel was initially greeted with disdain: surveyors told them to pull the buildings down, the local authority immediately assumed it was a cover for a brothel. Their persistence, helped by a supportive bank manager, won through and the first part of the hotel opened in September 1986. Hazlitt's opened with six bedrooms, just two bathrooms and a room rate of only 30. But guests, it seemed, particularly Americans, wanted creature comforts as well. The rest of Hazlitt's rooms were immediately brought up to expectations and business flourished. McKay, with some time in the film world, sees an hotel interior as a film set and has delighted in filling Hazlitt's, and now the Gore, with pictures, prints and antiques. Simple, old and mellow were the criteria for the design, the only plastic to be allowed in the rooms being that of the telephone and the TV. They also decided that, surrounded by Soho's restaurants, Hazlitt's would offer only a continental breakfast; no bar, room or restaurant service. The hotel would offer instead the kind of personal service they would expect when travelling themselves and, with a predominantly female staff, they now boast 60 per cent repeat business. As they appreciated the limitations imposed by the lack of a hotel restaurant, Blain and McKay pinpointed four areas of London in which they felt they could repeat Hazlitt's success. They saw the attractions of West London - with publishers and advertisers moving there - and the lure of the Albert Hall. In November 1989 an agent introduced them to the owner of the Gore and by January 16 1990 it was theirs, another suitable canvas for McKay. He discovered a wooden staircase not even on the plans and plenty of idiosyncratic design. On the first floor, where the 1950's the Elizabethan Rooms dining club had prospered in the 1950s, a lovely minstrel's gallery still survives (ask for room 101). But there was considerable work to be done. Fifty-four new bathrooms had to be installed, the staff organised and the restaurant, smelling of stale scampi and chips, was closed immediately. Although attracted to the restaurant business the partners were aware of its pitfalls. They had, however, unwittingly, become landlords of a restaurant, as the Gore's basement had been sub-leased to a consortium establishing the BES-funded restaurant and club, 190 Queensgate. A year ago Blain and McKay approached the head of the consortium, Roy Ackerman, and its chef, Anthony Worrall-Thompson to see if they would be interested in running the hotel's restaurant and room service. They were and the ensuing arrangement has brought the best out of both sides. Blain and McKay provided the hardware, the fixtures and fittings and, most importantly, the hotel computer which has helped to monitor costs (often a chef's blindspot). Worrall-Thompson has been left to concentrate on the cooking. And, as proprietors and landlords, they retain ultimate control. Worrall-Thompson's original menu was rejected because Blain and McKay felt it was too pretentious and expensive. Worrall-Thompson came back with others which have pleased customers and landlords alike and the Bistrot has served more than 25,000 meals since it opened last September. The room and the menu suit each other well. Large windows on two sides let in natural light and McKay's policy has been pursued with the interior - paint it cream and cover it with pictures (there are 4,500 in the hotel). The food, with its emphasis on the Mediterranean, is varied, healthy and of generous proportions: pumpkin and pepper soup, garlic terrine, bruschetta with plum tomatoes, chicory tarte tatin, lamb shank with flageolet beans and rosemary polenta are just some of the temptations. Prices follow the owners' principle of being slightly below the market - the average spend at lunch is Pounds 17 per person, at dinner Pounds 20. As the Gore prospers Blain and McKay are looking to expand. Hazlitt's, 6, Frith Street, London W1, tel 071-434-1771; fax 071-439 - 1524.

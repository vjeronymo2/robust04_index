			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Two companies' unusual approach to goodwill TWO QUOTED companies have adopted an unusual approach to new accounting standards, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual accounts. Enterprise Computer Holdings, the computing services company, and West Trust, the fabrics manufacturer, have both been required to alter their treatment of goodwill under a ruling issued last December by the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board. The ruling requires companies to reflect in their profit and loss account on disposal any goodwill at the time of acquisition. Goodwill is the difference between the net assets and the purchase price paid. Both West Trust and Enterprise Computer include this goodwill element, but split it between an adjustment of goodwill and a surplus or loss on sale and closure of subsidiaries. They do not refer elsewhere in the accounts to the full loss including goodwill. West Trust shows a Pounds 2.3m goodwill item and a separate Pounds 480,000 loss on the sale of a subsidiary in its accounts for the year to March 31. Enterprise Computer shows a Pounds 1.1m surplus on sale and a Pounds 23.1m goodwill write-off as extraordinary items, and then reinstates the Pounds 23.1m below the line before showing a transfer from the profit and loss account of Pounds 7m. Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman of Enterprise Computer, says the company showed a Pounds 1.1m surplus because it still held shares in the company it sold, and separated out the two items because 'otherwise shareholders would have had a heart attack to see the loss for the year without realising that no cash went out.'</p>

He said that the continuation of  these sanctions would be a blatant injustice and a mockery of  small nations, principles of international law and the United  Nations Charter.    In a speech to the 59th session of ministers of the  Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa, the assistant  secretary general of the Arab League said that we call for all  resolutions adopted by the Arab League, the Organisation for  African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organisation and the  Nonaligned Movement to be complied with.</p>

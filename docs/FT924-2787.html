			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (11): Never say no to a rock star - User Report, Fisher Park / How computer software helps to create three-dimensional fantasies for live musical events where demanding, last-minute changes are the order of the day sketching, designing and building a stage set for a musical event. But it's all change at the last minute if the massive design doesn't have the right 'feel' for the megastar client once it is built, regardless of cost and wasted effort. At the office of Fisher Park in Kings Cross, London, the details stored on its small network of CAD screens are essential to the fast turnaround of their work. They enable the company to adapt existing designs, pull in the details of various stadium venues, and test the designs for 'buildability'. In Fisher Park's somewhat off-beat line of business, fantastic ideas have to be translated into workable, often mobile, structures. These have to be built with regard to public safety regulations - and, just as important, they must be designed to be broken down, packed into a truck, transported, and rebuilt within the strictures of the next venue, wherever that is, without exhausting the production crew. 'Although we call ourselves 3D designers,' says Mr Park, director, 'We are really architects working in rock and roll. We deal with the client, take the brief, visualise it, supervise the construction and implementation. We are very much leaders and drivers of the project, although we're invisible on the night.' Their CAD system, Autodesk's AutoCAD running on a small PC network, is used as an 'electronic pen', speeding up some of the tedious but precise design work needed to realise the sketches resulting from brainstorming sessions with the rock star. Further down the line, they have to fulfil the normal duties of an architect, providing working details to the crew who have to build and break down the set and lighting equipment. Fisher Park is the stage-set design company for rock concerts and world-touring megastars. A newly-published book charts the progress of their work: Sutherland Lyall's Rock Sets is full of photographs and CAD drawings of such rock spectacles as Roger Waters' The Wall in Berlin, all designed by Fisher Park. Things have changed since the early days in 1966 when the Beatles played at the Shea stadium in New York, packed with screaming fans who could hardly see them. The current vogue for son et lumiere extravaganzas calls for a combination of inspirational and practical design skills, plus the ability to get on with temperamental rock stars. Something has to happen on stage all the time to entertain and dazzle the audience. Fisher Park has practically defined the business of mounting spectacular live events. They met at (and still lecture for) the Architectural Association. As a partnership, the pair has brought the professionalism of mechanical and structural engineering to an essentially ephemeral, theatrical business. Having stumbled into it by accident with the rock group Pink Floyd in 1977, their credits now include Pavarotti in the Park, Tina Turner's Foreign Affair European tour, U2's Zoo TV Outside Broadcast US Stadium tour, and the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels tour. It was Mick Jagger, the Stones' lead singer, who wanted a last-minute change in their Urban Jungle set: overnight it was transformed from a green jungle into a backdrop for a ravening dog. The problem for Fisher Park is that the process of designing the sets is very labour-intensive, and calls for a peculiar combinations of talent. The process starts with a brainstorming session, which produces pen-and-ink sketches, illustrating styles, narratives and thematic ideas, sometimes produces from little more than a vague 'feel' or suggested atmosphere. 'The skill at this stage is in the sketches and the visualisation,' says Mr Park. 'Our job is the technical realisation of the artiste's ideas. He or she is the only begetter and creator. It is true that we can lead our clients up paths they might never have explored, because we have experience of the possibilities. But we also know the technical requirements and limitations of touring and performing.' Stage two involves design drawings such as technical elevations, and the third stage has to provide working details. These must be precise for such contractors as Scena and Brilliant Stages, London-based companies who provide the building, electrical, lighting, carpentry and painting skills to realise the designs. The sets may cost between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m but still represent only a fraction of the production costs. The team works closely with production experts on details of the tour schedule and the needs of the crew in build and break-down phases. 'We all work together as a team: we are the invisible member of it. If we don't produce something workable, the stage crew will simply edit the set by leaving parts of it behind as the tour proceeds. 'If they feel they own it - that they're part of the culture and the project  -then they'll want to preserve the integrity of the idea.' Using AutoCAD, the first two stages of design can take place more or less simultaneously. As the sketches evolve from the ideas stage, they can be drawn on screen and tested for practicality. Another advantage is that the system can store a vast catalogue of re-usable modular elements, such as Varilite searchlights which Fisher-Park first used at the Seville Expo. The objects can be manipulated to fit new designs, saving hours of detailed drawing time. At one time, the company was tempted to try out Macintosh computers, but decided to wait until AutoCAD, which they see as the standard architectural computer tool, was available in 3D. The company did not get computers until 1988 and now runs a three-seat installation using Autocad release 11 - including desktop publishing facilities - on Dell and Compaq work stations. They are planning to graduate to release 12. Autodesk's 3D studio software allows them to animate the designs. Mr Park already had some experience of CAD software in his career at Ove Arup. 'One issue was technical backup and reliability. It was reassuring that AutoCAD had the biggest user base and a large user group. Many of the drawbacks that had deterred us from computerising before were overcome in later releases of the software.' The main advantage has been in providing an extremely fast response to ideas, but as Mr Fisher explains, the employment of technology has to be appropriate. 'The drawings are only information. We have always produced more comprehensive drawings because of our backgrounds. In fact, a hand sketch can be more evocative because you're only limited by your talent and imagination, it's not a matter of affording the technology. The computer is only a tool to help you design: it's not a panacea, no substitute for a good idea.' Even as a workaday tool the software has its uses, for example imposing the discipline of perspective. The company provides a professional engineering approach, and the depth of detail. As with less transitory architecture, each set is inspected and signed off at every stage. Its competitors - largely from theatrical backgrounds - use computers, but not as a design tool. Fisher Park uses the 'struggle before you ask' principle, never having attended an AutoCAD training course. They refer to the two-inch thick manual, and rely on a friendly consultant firm Deus Ex Machina to provide tailoring and comforting menus, the main complaint being that AutoCAD is so complex that it is unfriendly, even for an habitual user. The CAD images have been used with fully rendered computer animation to produce a video based on the U2 rock spectacular. This acts as a showcase for Fisher Park's skills: they would like to explore arenas beyond rock and roll. On a more mundane level, the software allows them to produce A4 images that can be faxed to clients. As other organisations become CAD users, Fisher Park finds further benefits. Now it can exchange AutoCAD details with the lighting company Samuelsons, or pull in ready-made flatplan survey details from another contractor, as they did for Seville Expo. But the real pay-off is that the two directors are now able to manage the workload without lots of staff producing technical drawings - 'in 1989 we got rid of six drawing boards and put in three computers,' recalls Mark Fisher. 'Now two of us do all the graft, and maintain a huge output. It's easier to show people what we're talking about, and we can produce detailed drawings very efficiently, but I couldn't say that's why they come to us. They buy our ability to design, not to use computers.'</p>

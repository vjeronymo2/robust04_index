			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: NEC to lift stake in Groupe Bull NEC, the Japanese electronics group, plans to increase its stake in Groupe Bull as part of the privatisation of the loss-making French computer group. The Japanese company, which is Bull's largest private shareholder, said yesterday it was 'considering positively' an increase in its 4.4 per cent stake. However, the company would not reveal how much it was willing to invest in Bull. The French government plans to reduce its stake in Bull from 75.8 per cent to less than 50 per cent within the next few months through the sale of shares to industry partners. French officials declined to comment on the size of the stake which could be sold to NEC, but industry observers believe the Japanese company could raise its holding to about 10 per cent. The two companies, which co-operate in marketing and in the development of mainframe computers, have strengthened business ties over the past year. NEC invested Y7bn (Dollars 72m) in Bull at the end of 1993 as part of a recapitalisation plan for the French group. Earlier this year, NEC announced a plan to increase transactions with Bull from an annual Y6bn-Y7bn to about Y20bn within the financial year. NEC said its interest in raising its stake in Bull reflected its strategy of expanding its operations in Europe. The development of a global information infrastructure made Europe a particularly promising market for NEC's computer and telecommunications equipment and systems, NEC said. According to NEC, Bull's marketing network will assist in the development of its activities in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, where demand is expected to expand. The relationship between NEC and Bull has provided NEC with a marketing channel in Europe and Bull with a range of NEC products. The French government has been seeking partners for Bull to enable its privatisation. The task has been complicated, however, by the weak financial position of the group, which has suffered losses of more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.9bn) over the past three years. The French industry ministry said it had no objection to NEC raising its holding. This represents a shift since 1991 when Mrs Edith Cresson, then prime minister, sought to block the Japanese group's investment in Bull.</p>

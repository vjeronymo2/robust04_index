			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: A new chance to break with the old ways - A look at the Mexican election victor's scope to curb the ruling party's powerful role After his comfortable victory in the Mexican presidential election on Sunday, Mr Ernesto Zedillo now faces the daunting task of preparing in little more than three months for a presidency that stretches from December 1 until the end of the year 2000. Officials close to Mr Zedillo indicate that he will concentrate on three broad areas until December - improving relations with the opposition and broadening his support in the country, beginning the reform of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, and establishing policies and picking ministers for the next administration. None of the three will be easy. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of the leftist opposition, yesterday denounced the election as fraudulent, and promised to challenge the results. Previous attempts to reform the PRI have all failed, with the party apparently more resistant to change than any other institution in Mexico. Also, many reforms Mr Zedillo has pledged touch some of the most powerful and vested interests in the country. But he will have some advantages. The election results reveal a depth of support for the PRI even in a highly adverse political year for the party, and indicate broad if not enthusiastic endorsement for the way the country has been managed by President Carlos Salinas over the past six years. With reports of electoral irregularities so far limited, Mr Zedillo can claim a democratic mandate for his policies. The immediate issue is to heal the wounds that the long and often bitter campaign generated. Mr Cardenas of the leftist opposition and Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right opposition both sharply criticised the manner of Mr Zedillo's victory. They claim that the seemingly unlimited spending of the ruling party, the biased media coverage of the campaign, and support from the government indicate an unwillingness PRI to embrace democracy. Mr Cardenas is his most immediate threat, although his poor showing in the poll and perception that irregularities were isolated, may weaken his ability to protest. Yesterday, Mr Cardenas said the fraudulent election was a grave threat to Mexico's political stability. He called for supporters to oppose the results. He was joined by an estimated 20,000 supporters, far fewer than the number that backed him after the 1988 presidential election. However even Mr Fernandez - whose party has generally supported the PRI - withheld a full endorsement of Mr Zedillo's victory yesterday morning, attacking what he called a 'profoundly iniquitous and profoundly unjust' political system. But he said he would not join the protests, and would challenge irregularities in the election courts. Mr Zedillo, in his victory speech, made conciliatory gestures. He asked his opponents to 'emphasise what we have in common, without sacrificing differences'. He told foreign correspondents late on Sunday that 'my responsibility is not only for those who voted for the PRI but those who voted for other parties. Today, Mexico has a great opportunity to have an important agreement among all the political parties.' It is unclear what such an agreement might entail. Many people are so sceptical about the PRI that they will not believe Mr Zedillo until he makes specific concessions to the opposition. Mr Enrique Krauze, a prominent historian, said Mr Zedillo 'should interpret the election as a mandate to change the system from within.' But, given his way of campaigning and previous record in government, 'we have not had the slightest sign that makes us think he is willing to do this.' Mr Zedillo may choose some members of the opposition to join his cabinet as a way of winning their support. A plural cabinet would certainly fit in with his pledge to represent all of Mexico, and not just the PRI. But it remains to be seen what if any positions Mr Zedillo offers - more importantly the opposition response is also awaited. His pledge to reform the PRI will almost certainly form part of his attempts to forge relations with the opposition. Mr Zedillo promised in the campaign to separate the PRI from the government, not to interfere in the ruling party when in office, and to propose democratic methods for the party to pick its candidates. Over the next three months, Mr Zedillo and his associates are likely to set out the broad outlines of internal party reforms rather than making final decisions, according to Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, a respected economist who, as the new head of the PRI's commission of ideology, is expected to play a key role in drawing up the new policies. He said the reforms would have to be discussed extensively with the rank-and-file, and agreed by them before being implemented. Other Zedillo associates accept the difficulty of pushing through such reforms, which have always failed in the past. President Carlos Salinas briefly experimented with internal primaries for some offices, before abandoning the effort after they had caused bitter divisions in the party. They seemed mainly to benefit the party old guard, who are generally well organised to get out the vote. Giving up the power of patronage would seriously weaken Mr Zedillo, who would be giving up the traditional mechanism through which the Mexican president keeps control of party officials and ensures their unwavering loyalty. For this reason some are doubtful that Mr Zedillo will carry through on the reforms, and others are worried that if does, he will find it more difficult to govern the country. Mr Zedillo's policies in government are likely to reduce his presidential powers still further. According to officials, his administration will begin by implementing reforms of the police, and of the judicial system, to make them both more professional and the judiciary more independent of the executive, and introduce policies that will devolve more powers to state and municipal governments. On the economy Mr Zedillo will work hard to ensure a smooth transition with the current government. Aides say they will try to reach agreement with the current administration on public spending priorities for next year. Mr Zedillo has promised a rise in public investment of 25 per cent for next year, in an effort to enhance economic growth.</p>

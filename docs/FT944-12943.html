			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Truth of the Matter: Only victims have the right to forgive Years ago, the vicar of a London parish was beaten by thugs in his own house and his daughter attacked and raped before his eyes. Shortly afterwards he appeared on TV and announced that he forgave his assailants. There was public admiration for such high-minded Christian charity. But some of us felt uneasy. The cynic in us thinks it is just what he would have to say if he was going to keep any self-respect as a Christian minister. But then I found myself pondering why it felt so different when a father who had seen his daughter blown to pieces by the IRA spoke so movingly about forgiveness and pleaded that there should be no revenge. Was it that one was a private tragedy, the other a wound to a whole community ? These are tangled issues, but I have a gut feeling that we must explore them. Behind them loom much deeper waters about the transactions communities and nations need to engage in if they are to steer a course out of vengeance into reconciliation. In my trade we spend much time trying to help individuals and families find ways out of personal conflict. Is any of that experience transferable into the arena of international affairs? There, I suspect, we are all out of our depth. But for what they are worth there may be some pointers. For one thing, I cannot forgive an assailant if he is not around to be forgiven and if he has not asked for forgiveness and given some signs of genuine contrition. Time has to pass. The rage and anger has to be processed somewhere and somehow or it will seep out in displaced responses to other people and other situations. And the daughter? I cannot forgive her assailant. Only the victim can forgive. No one else is entitled to. Only after she has reached the point where she can stretch out a hand am I entitled to do the same. I may want to persuade her to, for, gross as the injury has been, part of her own healing process must lie in letting the poison go. By nursing our wounds we may turn our backs on healing them. The future is more important than the past. If forgiveness at the personal level is more complex and intractable than a glib Christian precept sometimes makes it seem, forgiveness at the community or national level is far more perplexing. Yet if nations and communities are not to live embattled in age-old feuds and poisoned by past traumas we have to find some way of enabling a process akin to forgiveness to be transacted. But how? How does a nation forgive? There can be no forgiveness without repentance. How does a nation repent? The first step must be to tell and acknowledge the truth, not just the facts about the trauma and loss which have been inflicted, but a truthful recognition of the feelings of horror and grief and pain. Peoples who have suffered must feel that their pain has been felt and responsibility for it accepted by the other side. There must be no excuses, no explanations, no glib political prevarications. Not for the first time the eyes of nations are fixed once again on South Africa. Since the 1950s South Africa was the international paradigm of gross oppression, destroying its own black citizens by the thousand. Now, South Africa is groping its way towards reconciliation and forgiveness. How far this is the direct influence of men such as Trevor Huddleston and Desmond Tutu and how far it is due to a natural generosity in the African character we shall never know. But some of it is due to the acceptance by the ANC and the nationalists that there is no other way out of the impending bloodbath. They recognise that the future is more important than the past. They know their fates are bound together. And they are pragmatists not ideologues. Ideology is the death of peace. In Nelson Mandela they have a statesman of global stature with a clear understanding of what must be done to achieve reconciliation. No concealment of past atrocities; the terrible truth must be told. An amnesty, perhaps, for all but the most wicked, conditional maybe on admission of guilt and reparations. Of course no reparation can bring back the dead or remake shattered lives, but, even if inadequate, it can still be a token of a change of heart to which a generous response may be made. Generosity is of the essence. Mandela himself has been a victim, a man brought back from the brink of execution, his best years destroyed. He has the right to choose to forgive and to provide a paradigm for his people to lead them away from the abyss. 'In victory, magnanimity.' Such a stance requires considerable political courage. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is one of the few western leaders to have had the courage to ask for forgiveness for his people. But it would not have been realistic if there had not been a groundswell of public opinion which felt guilt and shame for the years of the Third Reich. The next question is more difficult. When and how do we forgive? When do the Jews forgive? When do the Unionists forgive? When do the Irish forgive the British? When do the Bosnians, Serbs and Croats forgive? Nations and communities are not good at repenting - yet if we do not find a way to repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation, our ancient and more recent wounds will remain running sores and our children's children will be caught up in these vicious cycles of unforgiving violence and revenge which threaten to overwhelm us all. A nation with no history is like a man who has lost his memory; our national identity is forged in the telling of our history. But, if the core of our national consciousness is welded only from an obsessive picking over the fragments of past injustices and trauma, or from the mythic triumph of battles long ago, the past holds us in fetters. We cannot reach out to make a new and peaceful future for our children to live in as long as we are constantly showing repeats of films about past wars. The images of war offer no solutions except more violence to the problems of traumatised and hostile peoples. How can we go about it? The terrible truths must be exposed. Reparations must be agreed. But then statesmen must speak for nations words which nations cannot speak. Stories must be told. Journalists and editors must take risks with their congenital cynicism to say the unsayable. The media have a huge responsibility for shifting public attitudes. Images of generosity must be sought and held up to the public gaze. One such I heard from Archbishop Trevor Huddleston. With his permission I tell it here. The archbishop was an honoured guest at Mandela's inauguration. He was lodged in a guarded hotel with other heads of state, for he, like Mandela, is at constant risk of assassination. He rose early one morning and went out to say mass on the arm of his minder for he is now physically frail. From his room he had to walk along a passageway at the end of which was an armed guard. As they approached him the man stepped forward and saluted. He asked if he could touch the archbishop's arm. From his accent it was clear that he was an Afrikaner. In his guttural English, he said quietly: 'I am so sorry. I am so sorry for what we have done to your people. I am so sorry.' The archbishop held his hand, and replied: 'But now we are all one people; black and white and coloured and English and Afrikaner. We are all equal citizens of the new South Africa. Our future is together.' 'Ach no,' said the soldier. 'You do not understand. I have done terrible things. Terrible, truly terrible. But I heard your voice on the radio and my heart changed.' Then, hesitantly, as if he expected the request to be refused: 'Father, will you bless me?' So he knelt and the new South Africa forgave the old. Hugh Dickinson is Dean of Salisbury.</p>

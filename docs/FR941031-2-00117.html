Projects meeting the eligibility requirements in section 1 above are ranked for funding priority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.1&blank;FAA regional offices rank all grant applications according to the Priority System defined in Chapter 3 or Order 5100.38A. Projects are scored and ranked in the Priority System based on type of project and airport size (lowest overall scores have highest priority). Development project types include (in descending order of priority): Special Programs (safety and security items required by regulation or congressional mandate); reconstruction (infrastructure preservation); standards (including noise mitigation); upgrade; new capacity; and new airport construction. Airport size classes include (in descending order of priority): primary airports and relievers in large and medium hubs; primary airports and relievers outside of large and medium hubs; commercial service airports other than primary airports; and noncommercial airports. Priority System scores by project type and airport role and size are shown in Figure 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2&blank;On an annual basis, the FAA will establish performance goals for the AIP. In FY 1995, goals will be related to five factors of the airport system: Safety; security; infrastructure preservation; capacity; and environmental compatibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.3&blank;The FAA will ensure consistent application of current and future selection criteria at the regional FAA office level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.4&blank;FAA headquarters will use threshold Priority System scores to ensure that only the highest priority projects from a national perspective are funded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

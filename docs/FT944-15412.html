			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New Look margins grow to 16.9% in first half Operating margins at New Look, the women's wear chain, grew to 16.9 per cent in its first half, the pathfinder prospectus showed yesterday. The 224-shop chain, which hopes for a market value above Pounds 150m, made operating profits of Pounds 9.92m on sales of Pounds 58.7m in the six months to September 24. In the year to the end of March, when operating margins were 12.5 per cent, operating profits were Pounds 11.1m on sales of Pounds 88.4m. Mr Tom Singh, founder and deputy chairman, said the group was well on course for sales of more than Pounds 100m this year. Sales per square foot were Pounds 449 in 1993-94, up from Pounds 299 in 1989-90. He attributes the growth, among other factors, to a stock turnover rate of more than 15 times, compared with a sector average of eight times. More than 1.5m customers pass through the shops every week. The group is wholly owned by the Singh family. About 35 per cent of the equity is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer. Mr Singh will not be selling any shares. He will have about 9 per cent of the company after flotation. The flotation will raise about Pounds 10m of new money, most of which will be spent on freeholds. The prospectus shows that Mr Singh, the managing director and the corporate development director will be paid 2 per cent of any increase in net profits under a bonus scheme. Mr Singh said yesterday that the group was highly incentivised, with bonus schemes for all its workers, including the 71 per cent of staff who are part time. Impact day is November 3 and dealings are expected to begin on November 18. Sponsors are J Henry Schroder Wagg and brokers James Capel.</p>

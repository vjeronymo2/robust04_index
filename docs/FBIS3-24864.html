Magistrates, who were present at  courts throughout the entire country, displayed the February  program for court hearings, the radio stated. All cases slated  for trial in January will be dealt with in February, in  accordance with the recommendations of the national follow-up  committee on magistrates' demands, which has asked the judicial  corps to work "without interruption."    In a statement on national radio, the committee chairman,  Ferdinand Tchianga, announced the creation of "a solidarity  fund" by the judicial staff to support their colleagues whose  salaries have been suspended. The salaries of 56 magistrates  and more than 200 court workers have been suspended for  irregular attendance at work.    In addition, a "free association of moderate teachers,"  created in Douala, has decided to dissociate itself from the  strike called on 24 January by the autonomous public high school  teachers union, also in demand for salary payment. According to  the national radio, this association appealed on 29 January "to  teachers who have a sense of responsibility and who care for the  future of their children" to resume classes.</p>

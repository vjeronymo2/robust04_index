			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Nadir faces Cyprus arrest President Rauf Denktash of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in northern Cyprus called yesterday for the arrest of the fugitive tycoon, Mr Asil Nadir, on charges of tax evasion. A statement published in Turkish Cypriot newspapers criticised the government for failing to arrest Mr Nadir and demanded it do so without delay. Mr Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot and former head of the collapsed Polly Peck International empire, faces charges in Britain of theft and false accounting. He jumped a bail of Pounds 3.5m in May 1993 and fled to northern Cyprus. The breakaway republic, proclaimed in 1983 and recognised only by Turkey, has no extradition treaty with Britain. President Denktash had helped Mr Nadir lay the foundations of the Polly Peck empire by giving him hotels, factories and other property seized from Greek Cypriots after the invasion. The president rejected British requests for Mr Nadir's extradition last year and treated him as an honoured guest. But relations have deteriorated in recent months as Mr Nadir found himself increasingly unable to pay taxes in northern Cyprus as well as the wages of 1,500 Turkish Cypriots employed by his enterprises.</p>

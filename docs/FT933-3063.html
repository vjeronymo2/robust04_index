			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / French try to protect Europe from Hollywood FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as a US attempt to use the world trade negotiations to swamp Europe with Hollywood films. Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Dollars 8.8m) in aid to encourage film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) deal were to cover the cinema, the French government 'will not sign it'. France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over agriculture, because it cannot credibly claim that the livelihood of less than 4,000 French employed in full-time film-making is as vital a national interest as the future of more than 1m farmers. Paris would therefore probably allow itself to be outvoted on any audiovisual deal. But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture. Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park and Last Action Hero were already taking too large a slice of the French cinema market, the minister claimed that Gatt's general free trade principle of non-discrimination would make it impossible for France to keep its regular FFr1.3bn a year subsidy for the making of French films and its requirement that French broadcasters must air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made films. The special aid announced by Mr Toubon yesterday is particularly aimed at helping French studios fighting competition from lower cost locations in eastern Europe and Portugal. As with agriculture, France is at odds with some of its EC partners, and the European Commission, over the right approach to the US in Gatt. Paris argues that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by claiming a total 'exception' for it. By contrast, the Commission maintains that by including audiovisual products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of this sensitive cultural area, the EC would be better placed to defend Community broadcasting legislation, as well as the tougher national provisions of countries like France, from unilateral US attack in the future. The EC's television broadcasting directive merely recommends that European stations schedule a majority of EC-made programmes. French legislation requires national stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent of EC-made programmes, while also subsidising local film-making from a 5.5 per cent levy on TV station turnover and an 11 per cent tax on cinema tickets.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Colombo bomb kills candidate A suspected Tamil suicide bomber killed 50 people, including Sri Lankan opposition leader Gamini Dissanayake, at a presidential election rally in Colombo last night. 'It was a human bomb,' a military officer said. 'There was a person in the crowd in the second or third row who had explosives. There was a blast which was carried forward towards the stage.' The government immediately called off peace talks with separatist Tamil rebels, due to resume today, and clamped a curfew on the island. The November 9 presidential poll, in which Mr Dissanayake was a candidate, appeared in jeopardy. Those killed also included Gamini Wijesekera, general secretary of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) and two former ministers. About 300 people were wounded in the blast, which came just as Mr Dissanayake finished speaking. Police said the prime suspects were Tamil rebels fighting for a separate state in the north and east. They have previously been accused of killing Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa and former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Mr Dissanayake had been expected to mount a strong challenge to the main presidential contender, prime minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who is the ruling People's Alliance candidate. The UNP lost power to the Alliance in parliamentary elections last August after ruling for 17 years.</p>

This decision was made,  according to an official communique, because the situation "does  not allow the normal functioning of bilateral cooperation  between the two countries." The communique adds that Germany's  interests in Haiti will be represented after 31 March by the  German Consulate in Miami and that German humanitarian aid will  continue to flow through nongovernment organizations and  churches.    Germany has traditional ties with Haiti and is one of the  principal countries to offer aid to this Caribbean country.  This aid includes the installation of hydroelectric plants over  the past few years, as well as agricultural infrastructure  assistance and scholarships for professionals and students. The  Haitian-German Institute has been operating for one year in  Port-au-Prince and offers classes in German.</p>

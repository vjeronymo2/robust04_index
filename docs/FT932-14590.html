			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Manana arrives - a bright Euro-dawn THE Easter headlines read 'Socialist Party in crisis meeting' and 'Elections to be brought forward.' The big opinion pieces were written by earnest men with titles like 'Professor of Moral Aesthetics at the University of Montpellier.' Spain is like other nations, but with more respect for other nations. All I know of the country comes from the papers and history books. And the papers are as dull as are the domestic concerns of Spain these days. Apart, that is, from one glorious period last year when El Pais offered a specially commissioned detective story to coincide with the Olympics. One memorable episode opened with the words, 'Inspector Carvalho left the Serbian javelin thrower in her delirium, singing the Internationale, and wended his way back from the hospital to the building of the International Olympic Committee.' Those unfamiliar with post-modern Catalan deconstructionism would do well to study the works of the writer, Manuel Vazquez Montalban. That aside, Spain is the most normal of countries. It has thrown itself into the process of integration with astonishing enthusiasm, its nationalism is expressed in foraging for as much cash as Brussels can provide. It accepts the whole Maastricht ethos and much else: subsidiarity? Certainly not. Federal Europe is the thing. More power to Brussels' elbow. Perhaps this is because Spain spent 40 years of this century subjected to the kind of crass, introverted nationalism that dominated others for 20 at most. But then it probably spent most of the last millennium in that peculiar state. Spain is the one European nation that has shuffled off its unsavoury past through its own efforts and, in effect, 'reinvented itself.' The normalisation of Spain means that for foreigners the dark allure of Holy Week in Seville has been overtaken by images of nihilistic self-indulgence limited only by the possibilities of a packaged fortnight: El Greco submerged by Salvador Dali. It is not the land of Gerald Brenan's wonderful Spanish Labyrinth. Today Homage to Catalonia would be a publicity handout from the Barcelona Tourist Board. Hugh Thomas' Spanish Civil War is a magnificent history that might be of another country. And no bad thing. The dark side that has nearly disappeared may not be worth having, but there is something about the European-ness of contemporary Spain that is all wrong. 'Africa,' ran the cliche, 'begins at the Pyrenees.' That is hardly true today. The road signs are the same as the French and, although the country stretches as far west as Ireland, the time zone is that of Berlin and Warsaw. It is 20 years since I found myself chatting to a woman in Bilbao who told me that her father had not been able to speak to anybody in his home town, Pamplona, since the day Franco landed in 1936. On hearing the news over the radio while playing cards in a local bar, he said, 'That means trouble.' From that moment he ceased to exist in the eyes of his friends. They joined the requetes, a fanatical army of Carlists, unorthodox monarchists, who supported Franco's cause and seemed even crazier than the African Legion which would marched into battle under the slogan 'Long live death and down with intelligence.' The man went to republican territory; I asked his daughter what he did then. 'Oh, he became a Liberal Democrat,' she said. 'What did that mean?' 'It meant he shot everyone who wasn't' Today, I imagine, that man and his one-time friends are reunited, the only irreconcilable differences are over the relative merits of football teams. The Spain of anarcho-syndicalism and clerical fascism has disappeared with the end of a nation that seemed to exist in a permanent corrida. Spain has become efficient, manana just means 'tomorrow.' In Italy 500 ago there was a saying, mi venga la morte di Spagna - 'Let my death come from Spain.' It was a prayer, which, if granted, would guarantee for immortality. Today such a prayer would mean death delivered custom-wrapped by Federal Express in 24 hours together with a 'genuine hand-tooled morocco leather-bound coffin and miniature stainless steel-style Toledo sword replicas.' The press holds few comforts for the traditionalist: the Letter from the Editor in El Mundo last Monday concerned the row in the Socialist Party and appeared under the headline, 'Both sides are right.' I could find only one remnant of Espana autentica in that edition of the paper. It was in a story headed, 'A source in the Ministry of Defence says that a woman is less stable than a man.' Many members of the armed forces do not accept a woman as an equal 'and still less would they take orders from one.' Somewhere the real Spain still exists.

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market regains a measure of composure - Market Report Four days of big losses in the UK equity market - totalling 76 points - were brought to a halt yesterday as share prices rallied strongly on the back of a bear squeeze and the continuing rally on Wall Street. The FT-SE 100 index closed at the day's best level of 3,393.2, up 29.7. Second-line stocks put on a more muted performance, the FT-SE Mid 250 rising 17.9 at 4,028.5. 'There's been an element of decoupling between equities and gilts today, which has been seen as bullish for equities,' said a leading marketmaker at one of the European securities houses. The US market gained ground during London trading hours, rising 18 points on the Dow Jones Average and continuing the good performance in recent sessions. It was pointed out that the US index had almost recouped all the ground it lost in the single session when the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy by increasing its Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points. US bonds were said to have improved yesterday. Gilts closed above the day's lows after disappointing industrial output numbers for December increased hopes of a rate cut. The data showed manufacturing output down 0.5 per cent against most economists' forecasts of a rise of some 0.3 per cent. The lower output figure plus a disappointing survey of UK distributive trades released by the Confederation of British Industry were said to have increased hopes that a further 25 basis points reduction in UK interest rates may be under consideration. The CBI survey indicated that UK consumer spending was showing signs of faltering ahead of the tax increases scheduled to impact from April. Today brings another batch of crucial economic details, notably inflation figures for January. NatWest Securities is forecasting unchanged month-on-month inflation, and headline inflation of 2.9 per cent, with underlying inflation of 3.2 per cent. Unemployment figures for January are expected to show a fall of between 23,000 to 30,000. UK share prices began the session in good form, stimulated by the good showing by Wall Street overnight and relatively undisturbed by the latest fall of the Tokyo market. Strong support for FT-SE futures helped the cash market build on its firm opening, with professional traders running short positions said to have been sufficiently worried by the market's opening strength to have closed them out. Confidence in the market grew through the session, with dealers noting signs that some of the bears had scrambled to buy stock towards the close of trading, when Wall Street was in full flow and the FT-SE 100 advancing rapidly. 'There was too much downside hysteria in the market at the start of the week; it only needed Wall Street to move ahead and that's exactly what has happened,' said one senior dealer. He also pointed out that the Hong Kong market had staged a good rally yesterday and was expected to continue to move up this morning. HSBC and Standard Chartered were among the FT-SE 100's best performers yesterday. One disappointment for the market was the level of business transacted, although again this was said to result from the severe weather problems affecting the City. Turnover reached 771.2m shares. Customer business on Monday was Pounds 1.45bn, well down on recent levels.</p>

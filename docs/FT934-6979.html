			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bundesbank policy-making council meets only twice more this year, on December 2 and December 16. With long bund yields close to a historical low, at 5.85 per cent on Friday, the market is clearly anticipating further decisive rate cuts at one or other of these meetings. The failure to deliver more than a fractional reduction in the securities repurchase rate after last Thursday's council meeting did nothing to unsettle the optimism. Money supply date published today and inflation figures for four states later this week will be closely scrutinised to see whether the optimism is justified. The market expects growth in October M3 of 6.3 to 6.7 per cent on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis, compared with the Bundesbank's target of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for the year. Inflation data from Baden-Wurttemberg, North-Rhine Westphalia, Hesse and Bavaria are also likely to be positive. Two factors weigh against the optimism. First is the Bundesbank's love of surprise: everybody is taking a rate cut for granted, so it is likely to want to disappoint them. Second is the influence of the US bond market: investors are becoming wary of the possibility of US interest rate rises. This has unsettled US bond prices and could spill over into the bund market.</p>

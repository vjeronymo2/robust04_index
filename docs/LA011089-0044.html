			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A LONG WAY FROM WALL ST. TO ENCINO  </P> <P> Michael Milken may well be the best-known name on Wall Street. But on Ventura  Boulevard, just a few blocks from his home, he is something of a stranger.  </P> <P> In a highly unscientific survey last week, the Times queried 100 people in  Encino, the San Fernando Valley suburb where Milken grew up and still lives,  and at Birmingham High School, where Milken graduated 25 years ago, to gauge  how well known he is in his own back yard. People were picked at random in a  telephone survey or asked to fill out a questionnaire in person.  </P> <P> Only a third of the people surveyed could correctly identify the Drexel Burnham  Lambert executive and philanthropist as the nation's premier junk bondsman and  subject of a huge federal stock-fraud investigation.  </P> <P> And the rest? They listed Milken as everything from Encino's mayor to  heavyweight champ Mike Tyson's divorce lawyer, a space shuttle astronaut, the  new editor of The Times, the inventor of the fax machine and a character out of  the television series "thirtysomething." Some confused him with New York  developer Donald Trump, computer whiz Steve Jobs and Walt Disney Co. Chairman  Michael Eisner.  </P> <P> Because the survey was unscientific, definitive conclusions can't be drawn from  the results. Still, they suggest that Milken is far from a household name --  even in his hometown.  </P> <P> "Somewhere I've read his name, but I don't know of him. Is he an entertainer?"  asked Alan Stein, a comic and producer at Encino's L.A. Cabaret comedy club  whose response was typical.  </P> <P> Which isn't surprising. Other, professional surveys indicate that business  people are not nearly as well known as entertainers. According to Marketing  Evaluations, a Port Washington, N.Y., market research firm, the top celebrity  in familiarity and appeal in most recent surveys was entertainer Bill Cosby  with a 96% score, followed by actor Michael J. Fox at 90%. Chrysler Chairman  Lee Iacocca scores about 71%, with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner at 67%.  </P> <P> Milken certainly isn't lacking for publicity. A database survey of the nation's  largest newspapers, magazines and wire services showed that last year Milken's  name appeared in no fewer than 250 headlines. That does not include countless  other Milken-related stories on Drexel or others touched by the insider trading  scandal, such as imprisoned stock speculator Ivan Boesky.  </P> <P> Milken's lack of name recognition comes as no surprise to Kenneth Lerer, his  personal spokesman. "Michael has said he has never sought the spotlight. He  wants his kids to grow up in a very normal fashion," Lerer said.  </P> <P> Despite the recent attention, it is unlikely that Milken, 42, is even Encino's  most famous resident. That probably is singer Michael Jackson, who reportedly  plans to move to a ranch near Santa Barbara this spring, but keep his Encino  home.  </P> <P> Milken is undoubtedly Encino's wealthiest resident. Last year, Forbes magazine  estimated his fortune at $800 million.  </P> <P> He got that way by creating the market for "junk bonds," which are high-yield,  high-risk debt securities. Believing that many good companies were shunned from  the financial markets, Milken from his Beverly Hills office built junk bonds  into a market worth more than $160 billion, prompting some to call him the most  important American financier since J.P. Morgan. But he also became  controversial as the junk bonds he developed were used to fuel the ambitions of  takeover specialists such as Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman and TWA Chairman  Carl C. Icahn.  </P> <P> Milken also is becoming increasingly known through his charitable empire. He  and his wife donated $196 million to their three charitable foundations in  1987, according to recent state records. Also, Milken has been seen  increasingly at public events such as baseball games with disadvantaged youths  he is helping.  </P> <P> Most of his notoriety, however, has come from being the target of a massive  government stock-fraud investigation. In September, the Securities and Exchange  Commission accused him in a civil lawsuit of insider trading, manipulating  stock prices and having an illegal stock-trading arrangement with Boesky.  Milken has denied the SEC charges. He is expected to be indicted soon in New  York.  </P> <P> Despite the notoriety that came with the insider trading scandal, few of the  100 people queried last week knew details of Milken's predicament, even if they  knew in general what he does for a living.  </P> <P> "I just know he's in a lot of trouble," said Henry Lipson, who has had a  pharmacy on Ventura Boulevard in Encino since 1955.  </P> <P> The Encino survey was done in two parts. The first involved distributing  questionnaires to 66 people along Encino's main street, Ventura Boulevard, and  at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. No one was told it was a newspaper survey. The  questionnaires asked "Who is Michael Milken?" and offered a choice of 20  answers to choose from.  </P> <P> Of the 66 responses, 21, or slightly fewer than one-third, correctly identified  Milken. The rate would have been lower had it not been for a group of students  taking an accounting class at Birmingham, who presumably knew him because of  their interest in business.  </P> <P> Some of the other results:  </P> <P> 9% of the respondents picked Milken as Encino's mayor. Encino does not have its  own mayor, except for the celebrities who serve as honorary ones, because it is  part of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> 8% identified him as Tyson's divorce lawyer. (Howard Weitzman is Tyson's  lawyer.) Another 8% thought Milken was the county supervisor -- Mike Antonovich  -- who was reelected in November over Baxter Ward. And 8% more thought Milken  was the Times' new editor. (Shelby Coffey III is the new editor.)  </P> <P> 6% confused Milken with President-elect George Bush's choice to be Treasury  secretary, Nicholas Brady.  </P> <P> 5% said he was the New York real estate developer and Atlantic City casino  owner Donald Trump or computer pioneer Jobs. Still another 5% of those  questioned thought Milken was a "thirtysomething" character.  </P> <P> 3% said he was a crew member on the space shuttle Discovery. Another 3%  answered that Milken was the inventor of the fax machine. And about 3% thought  Milken was an unsuccessful Oscar nominee for best actor last year.  </P> <P> The other part of the survey involved asking 25 Encino residents, whose names  were randomly selected from the telephone book and 9 local community or  business leaders, whether they could identify Milken.  </P> <P> He was easily identified by Steve Edwards, a Los Angeles talk-show host who  serves this year as Encino's honorary mayor, and Jan Sobel, executive director  of the Encino Chamber of Commerce. So did Larry Buck, who sells hot dogs from a  cart at Encino Park near Milken's home.  </P> <P> But others stumbled. Postmaster Barry Seltzer said he could not identify  Milken. Also having trouble was Mark Wilson, a professional magician who this  year is Encino's honorary sheriff.  </P> <P> Milken is largely a stranger today at Birmingham High, where in 1964 he  practiced high-yield pep as head cheerleader -- along with actress Sally Field  -- was named prom king and served as a member of the Boys League service  organization with Michael Ovitz, who went on to become a Hollywood "superagent"  as head of Creative Artists Agency.  </P> <P> Neal Federman, who teaches an economics class at Birmingham, recalls discussing  the insider trading scandal last year during one of his classes. He said that  nearly all of the students did not know who Milken was, even those students who  live near him.  </P> <P> "Across the board I would say they have no idea who he is," Federman said. Part  of the reason may be because the school is much different from the neighborhood  suburban high school it was in Milken's day, with one-third of the 3,100  students now bused to the school from inner-city areas.  </P> <P> Federman said, however, that one student in the class discovered who Milken was  after scores of reporters and photographers started hanging around his  neighborhood, where Milken lives.  </P> <P> The student "had noticed there were people standing outside the house trying to  talk to Milken or waiting to get a picture of him as he emerged," Federman  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO IS MICHAEL MILKEN? Junk bond king Mike Milken is one of the best known  names on Wall Street, but what about on Ventura Boulevard? As part of an  unscientific survey, 66 people were asked to identify Milken on a  questionnaire. Those surveyed were in his hometown of Encino or at Birmingham  High School in Van Nuys, where he graduated in 1964. Less than one in three  correctly identified him.

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to seek social chapter vote LABOUR WILL tomorrow press its demand for another debate on Maastricht's social chapter so that MPs can vote on a new amendment which - if passed - the party believes could yet embarrass the government into including the chapter in the treaty. The opposition has new confidence that it has found a way of forcing the UK government to choose between accepting the social chapter and being unable to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Comments from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, on Monday have encouraged both Labour and the Tory Euro-rebels to believe that a new social chapter amendment might affect the UK government's ability to ratify. Labour would then go on to argue that the social chapter should be included in order for ratification to proceed. Sir Nicholas appeared to concede that an amendment to exclude the social protocol - which contains both the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out' from it - from the part of the bill extending the powers of the European parliament would wreck the treaty. This follows the government's conversion last week to the view that passing the earlier Labour amendment, simply excluding the social protocol from UK law, would not affect ratification. When the Commons resumes detailed discussion of the Maastricht bill tomorrow Mr George Robertson, the opposition European affairs spokesman, will ask Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker who chairs the proceedings, for an opportunity to re-open the debate on social issues. An amendment along the lines referred to by Sir Nicholas was tabled on Monday. If Mr Morris does not allow MPs to talk about and vote on the new and apparently effective Labour amendment, then the issue could be revived only if MPs voted through any change to the bill, which would trigger an extra stage of discussion. Either way, the critical vote would not come for some weeks, giving time for the government to exert pressure both on potential Tory rebels and on some opposition parties. All of the groupings will want to be sure of the legal position before deciding what to do. In particular, ministers believe that once the amendment was clearly established as one that would wreck the treaty, the Liberal Democrats might decide not to vote with other opposition parties. Ministers are still confident that they will succeed in passing the bill and emphasise that there is a majority in favour of Maastricht at Westminster, in spite of this week's setback. Tomorrow, when debate resumes on the planned Committee of Regions, Labour will press for the committee's members to be elected - and may be joined by MPs of other parties. Ministers believe, however, a Labour victory would not jeopardise ratification.</p>

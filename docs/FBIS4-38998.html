			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray by Yevgeniy </F> Molchanov in the "Power" column: "The Question of Resignation  Is Closed. Sergey Shakhray Will Participate in Negotiations  With Chechnya" -- place, date not given]    [Excerpts] [Molchanov] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what is the  real story behind your resignation?    [Shakhray] It is known that my resignation was preceded by  my dismissal from the post of nationalities and regional policy  minister which, in my opinion, was effected in violation of  ethical norms. I had two options: either to keep silent or to  protest the impermissibility of breaching the norms of official  ethics. The sole way of expressing one's position in a  situation when you are a member of a team is not to impose  political assessments on your colleagues. And if you have to  talk about a breach of ethics, this must be done after you  resign. This is how I acted, announcing my resignation. This  is my right. And it is the right of the president and the  premier to accept or reject this resignation.    The resignation was not accepted. There were meetings with  the president and the premier. My further tasks, duties, and  functions under the new conditions were clarified. And the most  important thing for me here was that nationalities and regional  policy remained under my jurisdiction, as vice premier.  Moreover, representatives of many regions requested the  country's leadership not to accept my resignation. In this  situation I considered it inappropriate to insist on my  resignation. (It would be very important for me to express  through this newspaper my gratitude to those who supported me in  those days). On the other hand, what has happened helped me  identify both my true allies and adversaries, and even  "traitors." A valuable experience.    The question of resignation was closed; the conversation  with  the president moved to more urgent matters: on regional and  nationalities policy, drafting a treaty on Kaliningrad Oblast,  and mechanisms and implementation of the treaty between the  power bodies of Russia and Tatarstan. In view of the numerous  insinuations and rumors about my resignation being related to  the upcoming negotiations with Chechnya, I asked directly  whether I had been removed from the position of chief negotiator  at the talks on a settlement with the Chechen Republic which I  led in accordance with the president's message and a Duma  resolution. The answer was negative.    I introduced the new minister to the ministry collective,  which I think was very important psychologically both for him  and myself. We shall work. [passage omitted]    [Molchanov] As vice premier, which matters will you oversee  now?    [Shakhray] They include the following sets of questions:  First, nationalities and regional policy; second, interaction  with legislative and judicial bodies. (After all I have  experience of working in parliament and in the government).    My terms of reference also include matters of interaction  between the government and the mass media. I stress:  interaction, not supervision, coordination, or direction. Not  as it is envisioned in the TV and radio broadcasting plan  drafted by the State Duma. I consider one of the major  shortfalls in the government's performance the inability to  explain its decisions, take public reaction into account, and  shape public opinion.</p>

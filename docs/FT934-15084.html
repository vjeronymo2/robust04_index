			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply fears drive up jute prices THE PACE of advance in Indian raw jute prices in the current season, which began in July, has raised concern that there will be further erosion in the competitiveness of jute products against their substitutes, particularly synthetic products. According to officials of the Indian Jute Mills Association, jute products will meet with consumer resistance both within and outside the country if inflation in prices of the raw fibre is not checked. Raw jute accounts for about 45 per cent of the cost of production of jute goods. 'If raw jute commands such high prices now when the new crop is arriving in the market in volumes, then the supply situation will become particularly critical from January onwards by which time the farmers will have largely disposed of their stocks,' warn the IJMA officials. The benchmark W5 grade of fibre is being traded at about Rs570 (Pounds 12) a quintal (100lb), against Rs400 in the corresponding period of the previous season. The IJMA has urged the federal government to allow 'free import' of raw jute to keep the fibre prices in check. At present, the jute mills are allowed to import fibre provided it is all used for the production of jute goods for export. The IJMA has suggested the doing away with the 'export linkage of raw jute import'. According to industry officials, at least 1.2m bales (180 kg each) will have to be imported this season (July-June) if India is to maintain jute goods production at the normal level of about 1.3m tonnes and leave a reasonable carry-over to 1994-95. Unlike in the past, when only superior grades of jute were imported for the production of high value jute items for export, in the current season, the Indian industry will need to import the entire range of fibre. While Bangladesh, backed by a crop of a little over 5m bales, will have a comfortable export surplus, will be India's main source of import, the industry thinks it can also import some fibre from Nepal and Thailand. As jute prices in India are higher than in Bangladesh, there is no doubt that a good quantity of Bangladeshi fibre will be smuggled into India along the long unguarded border. According to the traders, jute smuggling, a common occurence, could run at between 300,000 bales and 400,000 bales a year. Meanwhile, the industry has described the initial official crop forecast of 7.2m bales as 'totally unrealistic'. Not only will this season's jute crop not be more than 6.5m bales, but the quality of a good portion of the jute grown in Assam and parts of north Bengal has suffered because of the floods. The Indian crop being short and the prices high, it is unlikely that the Jute Commissioner's office will sanction exports in the current season even though the merchant shippers are insisting that some export should be allowed. Even without any exports, it will not be easy to organise supplies of 8.5m bales for the jute mills and 400,000 bales for use at village level. Moreover, the next season needs to open with stocks equal to at least two and a half months' fibre requirement to ensure smooth running of the mills. Meanwhile, in the first four months of the financial year to next July, India's exports of jute goods increased by 43 per cent to 73,000 tonnes, compared with the same period of the previous year.</p>

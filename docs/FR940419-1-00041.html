			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a proposed Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. With respect to the Nile crocodile or to the saltwater crocodile in Australia, no Federal activities are known that would require conferral or consultation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, sections 4(d) and 9 of the ESA and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 (which incorporate certain provisions of 50 CFR 17.21) set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that generally apply to all threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and State conservation agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.32. With regard to threatened wildlife, a permit may be issued for the following purposes: scientific, enhancement of propagation or survival, economic hardship, zoological exhibition or educational purposes, incidental taking, or special purposes consistent with the ESA. All such permits must also be consistent with the purposes and policy of the ESA as required by section 10(d). Such a permit shall be governed by the provisions of &sect;17.32 unless a special rule applicable to the wildlife (appearing in &sect;&sect;17.40 to 17.48) provides otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although threatened species are generally covered by all prohibitions applicable to endangered species, under section 4(d) of the ESA, the Secretary may propose special rules if deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species. The rule proposed to be included in &sect;17.42 would allow commercial importation into the United States of certain farm-raised specimens of Australia's saltwater crocodile population, specimens of this species from Papua New Guinea, and certain specimens of Nile crocodile populations downlisted to Appendix II by CITES Parties under ranching or quota provisions as provided for by CITES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Description of Proposed Special Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States would allow import only of those specimens or parts or products authorized to be exported under CITES. In addition, the proposed special rule would not allow trade in such species with countries that are not parties to CITES, that have taken reservations for crocodilian species under CITES, that do not make required annual reports to the CITES Secretariat, that have failed to designate Management Authority(s) and Scientific Authorities, or that do not adequately control illegal trade in crocodilian species. Importation of parts of saltwater crocodiles directly from Australia or Papua New Guinea, or parts of Nile crocodiles directly from countries with Appendix II populations would also be allowed under certain circumstances, if the country of origin implements provisions of the universal tagging system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Marking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> International trade in certain crocodilians has presented significant problems for the Parties; several resolutions have been adopted at previous meetings of the Parties in an effort to establish management regimes to benefit the conservation of the species. The United States, in conjunction with Australia, Italy, and Germany submitted a resolution to the CITES Secretariat that was adopted at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan (March 2&hyph;13, 1992). This resolution (Conf. 8.14) calls for a universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins in international trade. Furthermore, in accordance with resolution Conf. 8.14, the Animals Committee at its July 1992 and September 1993 meetings adopted resolutions recommending additional practices for tracking and monitoring tags. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aspects of this resolution dealing with imports into the United States are incorporated into this proposed rule, and U.S. implementation of this resolution for import, export, and re-export for all crocodilian species will be incorporated into a future revision of 50 CFR part 23. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce the potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance of skins and products among different species of crocodilians. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 OFFICERS TO BE TRIED IN KIDNAPING CASE  </P> <P> Two San Diego police officers were ordered Thursday to stand trial on felony  kidnaping and robbery charges after two illegal aliens testified that the  officers stole their money, drove them to an isolated area away from downtown  and abandoned them.  </P> <P> At the close of a two-day preliminary hearing, San Diego Municipal Judge  Nicholas Kasimatis ruled that sufficient cause was shown for Officers Lloyd J.  Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf to stand trial.  </P> <P> Hoff scheduled arraignment for March 2 in Superior Court, where, if convicted,  they could be sentenced to life in prison.  </P> <P> "Everything reflects these two officers worked together," the judge said. "The  elements of kidnaping and the elements of kidnaping for robbery were shown.  There is sufficient cause to believe they are both guilty."  </P> <P> The two illegal aliens, both of whom admitted on the stand that they use  illegal drugs, testified that they were among three undocumented workers who  were stopped by the officers in separate incidents last August.  </P> <P> Besides having their cash stolen and being taken against their will to the area  near the railroad tracks, one of the immigrants said, Hoff struck him in the  testicles several times with his police flashlight and pushed him into a pool  of dirty water.  </P> <P> The most serious charge against the officers -- which could bring the life  sentences -- is one count of felony kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, in  which Arturo Romero Garcia testified that he was taken to the railroad area and  robbed of $35.  </P> <P> A similar count was reduced to simple kidnaping after evidence indicated that  Rolando Carrera Reyes was robbed first, then taken to the deserted area.  </P> <P> Testimony in the preliminary hearing alleged that Hoff stole the money from the  illegal aliens, beat one of them and drove the patrol car to the isolated area.  </P> <P> Schaaf's primary role was described by the victims as going along with the  events, except for one instance in which he allegedly tore up one of the  victim's identification papers.  </P> <P> Schaaf's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, argued that Schaaf should not be bound over  for trial.  </P> <P> "There has been absolutely no testimony to connect Officer Schaaf to a crime,"  Bobbitt told the judge. "They all said he did nothing. Being present and doing  nothing to stop a crime is not a crime. The best evidence is that he was only  present."  </P> <P> But, said Craig Rooten, a deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the case,  "He was there. He assisted in transporting these people around. He even tore up  some of their papers. He adopted all of Officer Hoff's actions by not doing  anything about it and taking these people off to dark areas where they were  relieved of their money."  </P> <P> Kasimatis agreed that "it's clear Schaaf's role was substantially less." But  the judge pointed to other evidence that showed Schaaf's complicity.  </P> <P> Several other officers testified Thursday that they saw two of the illegal  aliens in the back seat of Hoff's and Schaaf's patrol car. Fingerprints taken  from the car matched those of the immigrants.  </P> <P> And, although officers are required to list in their daily logs every citizen  contact they make while on duty, Hoff's and Schaaf's journal had no notation of  stopping the illegal aliens.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of the illegal aliens. They showed  that the immigrants were known to police, often using aliases, and several  times lied to police detectives investigating the kidnaping and robbery  allegations.  </P> <P> Garcia is serving time in jail for auto burglary. He admitted from the stand  that he has been a heavy heroin user and was once charged with, but not  convicted of, murder.  </P> <P> Carrera Reyes admitted that he smokes marijuana. And, when he arrived in court  to testify in the case, he was arrested on a six warrants, the most serious of  which accused him of possession of marijuana for sale.  </P> <P> The third alleged victim, identified as Ramiro Rodriguez, has disappeared since  he complained to police that he also was robbed and kidnaped by the two  officers. Rooten said police believe that Rodriguez has relatives in  Watsonville, Calif., but said that Rodriguez has not been located.  </P> <P> "We'd sure like to find him," Rooten said.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: SEC eases rules on foreign issues THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday offered a partial exemption from some of its anti-manipulation rules to foreign issuers of private placements and rights offerings. The decision should make it easier for overseas companies to attract US investors when issuing stock in the US, say industry observers. In the past, foreign issuers and underwriters have been reluctant to make portions of an issue available to US investors because it would mean operating under much tighter SEC regulations. In particular, the SEC forbids the underwriters and issuers of an offering from trading the securities while an issue is in progress, a rule intended to prevent the price of an issue from being unfairly inflated. In some cases this has dissuaded issuers from offering stock in the US, and in others it has forced issuers to seek special exemption from the SEC, as was the case with UK privatisation issues. Yesterday's decision means issuers will now be granted a blanket exemption. However, in order to qualify issuers will have to have been in operation for over three years, and must limit their offerings to institutional investors.</p>

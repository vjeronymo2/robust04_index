			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vaclav Musilek: "A Stable Europe Without </F> Russia Is Just an Illusion"]    [Text] The foreign ministers of the North Atlantic  Alliance's member states must solve a complicated puzzle. How to  link together as tightly as possible Russia and the Alliance by  means of the Partnership for Peace project and, at the same  time, not weaken NATO itself. The ministers' meeting, which  begins on 9 June, will discuss Russia's proposals for mutual  cooperation. Although the Russians, through Defense Minister  Grachev, have expressed their agreement with the Partnership for  Peace, they have also pointed to its limitedness, which consists  merely of establishing partial military cooperation. They want  to conclude a separate agreement with NATO that would enshrine  cooperation among the military departments at the level of  relations between partners with global options and  responsibilities and also cooperation in conversion and  peacekeeping operations. The most contentious proposal from  Russia is for the introduction of mandatory consultations on all  issues concerning European and world security. In other words,  Russia would like to obtain the right of veto in all of the  Alliance's decisions, which was immediately rejected by the  defense ministers of the member countries.    That is to say, they are very much aware that, with the  gravity of Russia's agreement, NATO would lose its status and  capability for action and would become just another cumbersome  CSCE-type structure. Accorlding to Russia, the CSCE should play  the role of an organization that coordinates the activity of all  of the European security formations. If we take a look at the  CSCE's results in the security sphere, it would seem that the  Russians cannot mean such a proposal seriously. With a more  detailed perusal of all of the pressures that affect the  decisionmaking processes there, the impartial observer has to  come to the conclusion that absolutely everything is possible.  Fortunately, this does not apply to the West; so, although the  Alliance currently lacks more explicit U.S. leadership, it is  virtually out of the question that the foreign ministers will  express themselves in favor of Moscow's proposals. However,  whether we like it or not, Russia cannot be treated the same way  as the Czech Republic or Poland. Russia's geographical area, the  size of its population, and its widespread nuclear and other  arms potential entitle NATO to adopt a special approach; of  course, it is desirable for both the functioning of its  structures and its relations with the states of Central Europe  that this specific Russian feature is taken into consideration  under the conditions and arrangements within the Partnership and  not outside it.    In Istanbul, the NATO foreign ministers should weigh all the  aspects very carefully and knit together a special doctrine for  building stability not against Russia but with it, a doctrine  eliminating the dangers arising from Russian power-wielding  whims. The atmosphere of the subsequent negotiations between the  Alliance's ministers and the individual Central European  "partners for peace" will be determined by the outcome of the  talks on the Russian proposals. It is mainly the Czech Republic  and Poland, countries that are among the most serious contenders  for membership and justifiably seek NATO protection against the  threat from the East, that are extraordinarily sensitive to any  sign of increased Russian influence in this region. In our  country, this is felt even more by the citizens than by the  politicians. "What we are mainly interested in is ensuring that  closer ties between Russia and the Alliance do not mean even a  hint of any division of spheres of influence," emphasized Jozef  Zieleniec, in reaction to Moscow's demands regarding NATO. The  idea of any kind of direct influence being brought to bear on  our incorporation into West European structures and NATO, first  and foremost, by the Russian side is unacceptable for our  security.    The former Soviet satellites in Central Europe will have  enough difficulties in convincing the individual NATO members  about their contribution and gaining the unanimous agreement  required for admission by Article 10 of the basic document--that  is, of the North Atlantic Treaty. If I write about the  inadmissibility of direct influence being brought to bear on the  admission of the Czech Republic and other states into NATO, I do  so with the knowledge that the situation in Russia is indirectly  influencing this act in any case. It is slightly paradoxical  that the hopes of Central Europe for entry into the Alliance are  indirectly proportionate to the internal developments on the  Russian political scene. The current "enlightened" government of  President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, together with  the substantial majority support for the reform course on the  part of the population, is forcing NATO to adopt a cautious  approach toward the contenders for membership so that the  domestic position of the current Moscow leadership is not  complicated.    The feeling of danger to postcommunist Europe would be  increased along with a possible rise in the influence of the  antidemocratically oriented forces, and a new onslaught of ever  latent Russian imperialism and NATO could not, in its own  interest, ignore the much more emphatic hammering on its front  door. No one wants such development to the west of Russia. The  basis for genuine European stability is, at this stage, to seek  a suitable partnership with Russia with a view to its  involvement in all important structures, including NATO, and  that only at a later date, as opposed to the states of Central  Europe. Without faith in the future definitive transformation of  the "evil empire" into a civilized democracy, we would have to  turn to completely different models for the security arrangement  in Europe.</p>

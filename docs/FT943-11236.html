			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Carbon emissions show decline World emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use, thought to be the main cause of global warming, have begun to show a slight decline, according to the London-based World Energy Council. In a report to be published shortly, WEC says that CO emissions were equivalent to 6.09bn tonnes of carbon last year, down from 6.106bn in 1992. The fall was due mainly to a sharp decline of 249m tonnes in emissions from the former communist countries of eastern Europe. This more than offset the increase of 162m tonnes in emissions from the fast growing Asia-Pacific region. Emissions were also up in North America, the Middle East and Africa. But they were down in western Europe, mainly because of reduced coal consumption in Germany, the UK and Italy. The WEC says the declines in Europe may be temporary because the continent is moving out of recession. Nevertheless, the figures 'reinforce the view that increases in carbon dioxide have been partly reversed, and atmospheric concentration increases have recently slowed down'. The report says the Asia-Pacific region will have to be the focus of future efforts to reduce emissions.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. RESTARTS RELIEF EFFORT IN SOUTHERN SUDAN  </P> <P> A C-130 cargo plane carrying 15 1/2 tons of corn landed in the southern  Sudanese city of Torit as the United Nations started up relief operations after  a bloody ambush caused a three-day delay.  </P> <P> Paul Mitchell, a spokesman for the United Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan,  said the plane arrived in the beleaguered city Friday from Kampala, Uganda. He  also said the C-130, leased from and operated by the Miami-based Southern Air  Transport, will make three flights daily to Torit until it has delivered 1,100  tons.  </P> <P> The airlift and convoy are part of a massive, $132-million U.N. effort to stock  more than 110,000 tons of food and supplies in war-torn southern Sudan before  heavy seasonal rains begin in four weeks.  </P> <P> The first U.N. convoy in rebel-held southern Sudan was ambushed Tuesday as it  traveled west to Torit from the Sudan People's Liberation Army base of Kapoeta.  Eight rebel escorts were killed and the lead truck was destroyed. U.N.  officials have not assessed blame, but suspicion fell on government troops.  </P></p>

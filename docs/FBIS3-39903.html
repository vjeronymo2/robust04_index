			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Michael Fink </F> and Georg Nowotny; place and date not given: "`When Everything  Goes Wrong, It Is the Government's Fault'"]    [Text] [WIENER] The mobilization of the Austrians  conducted by opponents to EU membership, who range from the  extreme left to the extreme right, seems to be functioning well.  There are initiatives, meetings, and mailings all over the  place. Why does one get the impression that the opponents are  faring better than the supporters?    [Mock] It's human nature; it is simpler to oppose something.  The second point is that this phenomenon primarily occurs in  medium-sized and smaller states; consider the Danes, the Irish,  and the Portuguese. There is a fear that one will be swallowed  up when one becomes a member of a larger entity, that one will  lose one's identity, and fear can be turned into a very  effective political instrument.    [WIENER] The government's arguments tend to be based on the  intellect, and those of the EU opponents tend to stem from the  heart, from gut feeling. Should the government not rethink its  approach?    [Mock] There is definitely something to be said for that. I  believe one must convince people by using political arguments.  Economic, ecological, and financial issues play a part, but the  most important question is why Austria should belong to the  European Union at all.    [WIENER] So, why should it?    [Mock] First, it is the first practical chance for Europe to  avoid national wars between participants in integration. The  second argument is security. We should learn from the dramatic  events in former Yugoslavia that when it comes down to it, we  are alone. The third argument is that we do not want to become  a second-rate country that only carries out the wishes of others  without having any say in matters.    [WIENER] As far as security is concerned, many Austrians  fear that if their country is a member of the European Union and  the Western European Union, it will be drawn into foreign  conflicts that have nothing to do with Austria.    [Mock] We will never be drawn into anything of the kind by  the European Union. The European Union has neither decided nor  can it decide if we should participate in a war, because it does  not possess the authority to do so.    [WIENER] Nevertheless, the population does have fears of  that nature.    [Mock] Well, that is what I have to explain. It cannot be  done just through brochure's and posters; these media definitely  do not achieve the desired result. The government and those  groups that support a united Europe, from Gmuend to Leibnitz,  from Bregenzerwald to Marchegg, must speak continually to  citizens.    [WIENER] So, would you have had the emphasis in EU  advertising placed elsewhere?    [Mock] Yes, I would have done so.    [WIENER] So, what direction would you have chosen?    [Mock] I would have opted for political talks and political  arguments, and emphasized the importance of safeguarding jobs.    [WIENER] The chancellor has been much criticized for his  statement that Austria must join the European Union without any  ifs and buts. Does this kind of "either or" policy not reduce  our scope for flexibility?    [Mock] One has to acknowledge that a politician is also a  human being who has emotions. The fact that the chancellor  supports the conditions I put forward in Brussels shows that  Chancellor Vranitzky does not support an unconditional  membership on our part.    [WIENER] Many critics say that the government would stick  its head in the sand and not discuss what would happen if the  result of the EU referendum is a no?    [Mock] A head-in-the-sand approach would be wrong. In that  case -- as I always say -- we would not starve. However, we  would be in a much more difficult situation competitively.  There would be a whole list of very concrete disadvantages one  could list.    [WIENER] However, that is happening.    [Mock] One would have to formulate that differently, the  current discussion is far too polite.    [WIENER] The government could counter the horror scenarios  being put forward by EU opponents should Austria join the  European Union with horror scenarios about what would happen if  Austria does not join.    [Mock] One should, without creating horror scenarios, state  clearly what would happen. That is enough. Ninety percent of  the domestic textile industry would collapse. That would also  be the case with automotive industry supplies. Our current  unemployment rate of between 3 and 4 percent, which is very good  in international terms, would increase to between 5 and 7  percent. To maintain the same level, we would have to work  harder generally and work harder at restructuring in particular.    [WIENER] So, in the final period before the referendum, one  one should describe the disadvantages very clearly.    [Mock] The self-criticism that one should not formulate  matters in too populist a manner is often an admission that one  is unable to state things clearly and plainly.    [WIENER] The supporters of EU membership also have to  contend with the fact that part of the retail and wholesale  trade is afraid of tough EU competition.    [Mock] The basic problem is undoubtedly that the Austrians  are often too fainthearted. The reality of the past few decades  shows that we are better than we believe.    [WIENER] There are even businessmen who are members of the  Austrian People's Party [OeVP] and the Economic Federation  financing the opponents of EU admission.    [Mock] I have never asserted that short-sightedness is  restricted to the members of other parties.    [WIENER] What is better for admission to the European Union  -- a referendum before or after that Nationalrat elections?    [Mock] That is something about which I, myself, am unsure.  However, I would be inclined to prefer a referendum before the  elections, because the European Union is currently very ready to  accept an expansion of membership. The mood can change.    [WIENER] What will happen if you lose the referendum? Would  you then support another referendum, as was the case in Denmark  following the Maastricht flop?    [Mock] No, I would definitely not favor that, because then  citizens feel they are being mocked. However, I am in favor of  analyzing the mistakes that were made and those lay primarily  with the government. Irrespective of that, European unification  remains a fact.    [WIENER] So, if things go wrong, it is not the fault of  the people, but of the government?    [Mock] It is primarily the fault of the government. There  might also be other factors. One must be fair and admit that  among the opposition there are very different views about the  European Union. When the government and all the groups that  want a peaceful Europe really make an effort, then we will  receive the backing of the Austrians.    [WIENER] Could Austria obtain more in new negotiations if  the outcome were a no?    [Mock] One should not have illusions that the European Union  will make as substantial concessions as they made to the Danes,  because we have not joined. The European Union does have a  certain interest in seeing Austria join, but we would be  deceiving ourselves if we thought it could not exist without us.    [WIENER] Would a clear defeat for the government in the EU  referendum prompt you to resign?    [Mock] I will definitely not resign and I will continue to  struggle for European integration.    [WIENER] It is a question of the post.    [Mock] I have already suffered enough defeats and not given  up. One gives up if one has made a serious that will bring harm  to the country or something that would have benefited the  country is lost, and if one makes serious mistakes in carrying  out one's duties or breaks the law.    [WIENER] Regarding harm, you have always staked heavily on  the federal president as a unifying figure and as someone who is  a leading supporter of EU admission. Can that weapon still be  used following the scandal surrounding his marriage?    [Mock] I think a significant number of Austrians draw a  distinction between private and political problems. The  president continues to carry the same weight on this issue as  before. I do, of course, realize that what a politician does is  never completely private.    [WIENER] The republic's top crisis manager did not perform  all that splendidly in his own case.    [Mock] That it was not a pleasant matter, and was not  pleasant for the president too, is obvious. He also knows it  has tarnished his image, but he has retained all his capacity  for political action.    [WIENER] Observers say this affair has not only harmed  Klestil, but also the OeVP, which created Klestil, and has  benefited the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], that  is, Vranitzky.    [Mock] It is true it has not helped us but, at the same  time, the president is not a party functionary.    [WIENER] He is at least a figurehead for the OeVP.  Following the breakdown of his marriage, this symbol of  conservative hopes no longer quite shines in the same way as it  did a few months.    [Mock] Show me a politician who always shines.    [WIENER] The entire OeVP is currently in anything but a  strong position, it has maneuvered itself into a historical low,  and has give up seeking a leading position, even if only  verbally. As former party leader and honorary chairman, what  way out of this situation is there?    [Mock] Those responsible must give their full support to  party chairman Dr. Busek, and do so when the situation is  difficult, too. Second, a lot of work must be done on making  what our party stands for more clear-cut, so that people know  what the party wants. Over the past few years, our party also  undertook reforms that carried a risk of unpopularity: the  railroad reforms, the second taxation reforms, and privatization.    [WIENER] Evidently, the OeVP has been unable to convince  people that it is such an important reform party.    [Mock] There was not enough done to present our position, to  provide information. And things were expressed too  diplomatically to put it mildly. The citizen wants to know  where his party stands and what a politician's concrete position  is.    [WIENER] So, it is rather like the case of the EU  propaganda. Less intellect and more from the heart, more gut  feeling.    [Mock] Yes, exactly, and more precise statements.    [WIENER] In the case of cooperation with Haider's Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe], the course you are following is rather  different from that of Erhard Busek. Would an OeVP-FPOe  coalition be a possibility following the next elections?    [Mock] I also completely support Dr. Busek's course on this  issue. What I warned against was the systematic exclusion of  Dr. Haider as a quasi-Nazi. Whoever adheres to the rules of the  game has a right to be accepted as a democrat whether one likes  him or not. The second line of argument that I do not like is:  When the liberals and the socialists cooperate, then they are  reformed characters and liberals. When they work together with  us, they are Nazis.    [WIENER] So, is the OeVP-FPOe coalition....    [Mock] ...an option that cannot be considered at the present  time, because the grand coalition has addressed important  structural issues, partially solving some of them, and because  it faces important tasks.    [WIENER] If you suffer a major defeat in the elections,  would you be in favor of the OeVP going into opposition?    [Mock] Under certain circumstances, that would certainly be  an option to be considered.    [WIENER] The Austrians admire you for being so incredibly  hard-working and disciplined. Stress can also affects one's  health. How do you feel?    [Mock] I feel very well today, but I will soon feel much  better, because hopefully and in all probability, a positive  decision will be reached in the EU negotiations.    [WIENER] And that will affect your health?    [Mock] It will affect my feeling of well-being.    [WIENER] Would you consider remaining foreign minister under  a fourth Vranitzky cabinet if called upon?    [Mock] It depends on whether I feel fine. If one has not  slept well for three days, is constantly rushing around the  world, and things do not work out, then one naturally considers  how long one should remain in the government.    [WIENER] So, the decision also depends on the state of your  health.    [Mock] It will depend on the political situation, but also  on what one can still do after 30 years in politics.    [WIENER] But if it is possible, you would carry on?    [Mock] If it is possible, I would.</p>

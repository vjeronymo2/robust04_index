			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 22 Dec -- Overall, the Russian delegation  gives a positive assessment of the results of the two-day  Russian-Japanese consultations on the problem of preventing  Russian discharges of radioactive waste into the sea in the Far  East, that ended in Tokyo today. This was stated in an  interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Mikhail Kokeyev,  head of the Russian delegation, and deputy head of the  Directorate of International Scientific and Technical  Cooperation of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry.    He said that at the consultations agreement had been reached  in principle that Japan will provide emergency assistance to  take measures aimed at averting the need for the Pacific Fleet  to carry out new marine discharges of low-level radioactive  waste. For this purpose, it is planned, in particular, to  provide Russia with a special tanker to store waste. The two  tankers that the Pacific Fleet has at its disposal for this  purpose are already full. "Some other emergency measures are  also possible that Japan intends to take to render us  assistance," Mikhail Kokeyev noted. He let it be understood  that it was a matter of really emergency measures which could be  carried out within "the next few days or weeks." The head of  the Russian delegation stressed, that apart from emergency  measures, Tokyo will also give Russia assistance in implementing  long-term programs intended to avert the discharge by the  Russian Navy of low-level radioactive liquid wastes into the  waters of the world's oceans.    Mikhail Kokeyev noted that the reaction displayed by Tokyo  to  the discharge by Russia of low-level waste into the Sea of Japan  in mid- October had been constructive. "Japan did not limit  itself to expressing concern about this -- Tokyo immediately  stated that it was ready to give assistance to Moscow in  resolving this complicated problem," the high-ranking official  of the Russian Foreign Ministry stated.</p>

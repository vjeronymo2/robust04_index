			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Property: Facts and forecasts - The paucity of credible market analysis If a market should be judged by the quality of its analysis, property is still in the dark ages. This complaint is most often heard from fund managers, especially those who cut their teeth in equities or bonds. But the point is not lost on property professionals themselves. Mr Peter Evans, head of research at surveyors DTZ Debenham Thorpe, said: 'In terms of available data, the property market is like a third world country.' The culture of the industry is partly to blame. Agents have traditionally sold themselves on the basis of what they know, rather than how they interpret commonly-held information about transactions and market conditions. The culture of transparency which governs the equity and bond markets has simply passed by. The consequences could be profound. The long-term decline in institutional holdings of property is due, in part, to the paucity of credible market statistics and analysis. 'We certainly have not felt as comfortable with property as with other financial assets,' said one fund manager at a life insurance company. 'Defending investment decisions on the basis of gut feel is no longer enough.' It is also possible that the information gap has contributed to the extreme cyclical nature of the property market. This is a view shared by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Earlier this year RICS published research on the links between the economy and the property cycle. Mr Clive Lewis, then president, hailed the work as 'the best hope yet of finding a way to tame damaging boom and bust cycles'. Sceptics point out that research did nothing to prevent the 1987 UK stock market crash. Either way, though, investors' thirst for quality information and analysis is a commercial opportunity. The Investment Property Databank, set up 10 years ago, was the first to spot the requirement for raw data. Its work laid the foundations on which the first brave attempts at forecasting were built. Most of the big surveying practices now offer forecasting services, while independent forecasters have flourished over the past five years. The property establishment sees the introduction of forecasting techniques as step forward rather than a threat to the valuers' art. The Mallinson report on valuation, published earlier this year, came out broadly in favour of forecasting: 'We . . . see it as an area in which surveyors, with the aid of other skills, can offer valuable insight to clients. But we see (forecasting services) as distinct and believe they should be kept very carefully distinct from the practice of valuation.' This attitude is broadly shared by investors. 'We are inclined to use forecasts more and more, although the jury is still out on their performance,' said Mr David Hunter, head of property investment at Scottish Amicable. Forecasters see themselves as giving investors the tools to make better decisions - closing the credibility gap between property and other financial assets. 'Our job is to help property fund managers approach their asset allocation committees on equal terms,' said Mr Colin Barber of forecasting consultancy Barber White. Yet the limits of forecasting are a matter for hot debate. Some are doubtful about forecasters' ability to predict the market at all. 'All property market projections are based on macroeconomic forecasts which themselves have a poor record,' said Mr Chris Brown of Manchester consultancy Kenrick Brown. 'It is also possible that the factors which drive the property market change over time, but not in a linear way.' Investors are sceptical about using forecasts to guide anything other than broad decisions on asset allocation. Local markets react to local factors which can not be predicted,' said Mr Hunter. 'We would never buy a shop we did not like simply because the forecasts told us to.' Even zealots admit that forecasting down to regional or local level is tricky. 'As the scale becomes smaller, the task of forecasting becomes progressively more difficult,' said Mr Bryan MacGregor, professor of land economy at the University of Aberdeen. Factors such as new developments, which are especially difficult to predict, are much more important at local level. Moreover, economic data for particular towns is simply not available. If these problems can be overcome, though, forecasters see the biggest gains to be made at local level because these markets are least efficient. 'The market gets less efficient the lower down you go. We should be able to add more value at the level of a town or an individual building,' commented Mr Andrew Baum of Real Estate Strategies, the forecasting company now linked to fund managers Henderson Administration. So what of attempts to use rental forecasts and discounted cash-flow techniques to value individual buildings? Property companies increasingly use such methods when deciding whether to make strategic investments. Retailers such as Boots model underlying cash flows before deciding whether to buy or lease individual shops. Again, the Mallinson report came down in favour of greater use of discounted cash-flow techniques by the property profession. But it envisaged such methods being used in combination with - not in place of - traditional valuations based on market evidence. Some would like to go further. The collapse last year of hotels group Queens Moat Houses caused many investors to question property valuations in company accounts. Two firms of surveyors - Wetherall Green &amp; Smith and Jones Lang Wootton - came up with widely divergent valuations of the company's assets. The British Association of Hotel Accountants has since proposed a method for valuing hotels for accounting purposes based on discounted cash flow analysis. This was rejected by RICS last month, on the grounds that the worth of a property to an investor need not be the same as its open market value. The distinction is critical. It is the difference between underlying worth and open market value that forecasters and their clients are trying to identify and exploit. Whether they can do so successfully over the long term remains an open question. But if the growth of forecasting increases understanding of what drives the market - and helps investors feel more comfortable about holding property in their portfolios - it will have proved its worth.</p>

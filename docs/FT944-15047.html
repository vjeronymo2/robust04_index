			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher role not to be investigated One of parliament's most powerful select committees yesterday decided not to investigate allegations that Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime minister, received Pounds 12m in commission from an arms deal negotiated by the British government in the 1980s. As Labour MPs continued to put pressure on ministers to reveal more about the Al-Yamamah deal forged by the UK and Saudi Arabia in 1984, the all-party public accounts committee agreed that an investigation of Mr Thatcher's involvement would be outside its remit. Mr Robert Sheldon, PAC chairman, is understood to have told MPs at a meeting yesterday that the committee could only examine issues affecting taxpayers' money. He said newspaper allegations concerning Mr Thatcher had shown no impropriety as far as public money was concerned. Mr Sheldon told MPs that there would be no change in his decision to withhold publication of a report by the National Audit Office into the UK-Saudi arms deal. He assured MPs that the NAO report contained no reference to Mr Thatcher. As Labour MPs continued to raise questions about the Al-Yamamah deal Mr John Major insisted yesterday that there was no substance to allegations in a confidential document that Mr Thatcher had profited from the contract. The document, which was sent to the prime minister by Mr Jeff Rooker, a Labour MP, claims that sizeable payments were paid to the Conservative party and that Mr Thatcher and Mr Wafic Said, a Saudi businessman, acted as intermediaries. The document, dated May 2 1989, was sent anonymously to Mr Rooker, who at the time had been pursuing civil servants and ministers with questions about arms deals involving the Middle East. Mr Rooker agreed to keep the contents confidential but sent a copy of the memorandum to Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister. She replied that it had been 'passed to the appropriate authorities'. A UK defence industry source with close involvement with the Middle East confirmed last night that Munir Attalah, one of the individuals mentioned in the memorandum had played a key role as a middle-man in arms deals between the UK and Jordan in the 1980s, some of which involved Iraq.</p>

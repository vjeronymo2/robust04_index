			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Morocco still cautious despite economic progress: The stiff challenges facing a government widely praised for springing back from a debt crisis NINE years ago Morocco shared the fate of many Latin American countries. Like them it had borrowed heavily to finance large current account and public sector deficits, both of which, by 1982-83, exceeded 13 per cent of gross domestic product. The inevitable happened when, in August 1983, with virtually no international reserves left, Morocco was forced to reschedule its Dollars 13bn foreign debt. Today Moroccan leaders can claim solid progress on a number of fronts - the public sector's finances are broadly balanced, trade has been liberalised, growth has averaged 4.6 per cent a year since 1985, and foreign investment is increasing. A recent study by the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell concludes that, unlike any Latin American country, Morocco 'managed to push ahead with structural reform, while maintaining single digit annual inflation throughout and registering growth broadly in line with the country's output capacity.' It has avoided the severe financial dislocation that in Latin American countries kept the risk premiums on interest rates and currency high, long after the original financial problem had been resolved. External factors, most notably the more favourable terms of trade the country enjoyed after 1985, have helped. So has the strong support afforded by western creditors as Morocco rescheduled its Paris Club debt six times and its London Club debt three times. Despite its achievements, commended during a visit to the kingdom last month by Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president who promised that the Bank would extend Dollars 500m worth of loans annually for the next few years, Morocco faces some stiff challenges. Unemployment affects an estimated 20 per cent of the population and the imbalance in wealth remains a serious problem. The labour force is growing at about 3 per cent a year and a steady rate of growth is thus vital to avoid repetition of the rioting which occurred in 1981, 1984 and 1990. Compared with countries with similar per capita income, Morocco scores lower where child mortality, child labour and illiteracy are concerned. With 55 per cent of men unable to read or write, it is not surprising that labour qualification levels remain low and constitute a big handicap for the expanding export sector. Meanwhile, cuts in government spending mean than the quality and availability of free education and health, which are already low, have declined in recent years. Morocco still has a woefully inadequate telephone network. The macro-economic results of the past decade speak for themselves. Inflation has averaged 5.8 per cent, thanks in particular to a conservative monetary policy. Since December 1990 the central bank has relied on bank reserve ratios and domestic interest rates rather than direct credit ceilings for Moroccan banks. Savings have responded favourably. A current account deficit of almost 8 per cent of GDP in 1984 was turned into small surpluses in 1987 and 1989 but slipped back into a 2.5 per cent deficit in 1991. The share of the budget deficit in the GDP fell from more than 11 per cent to 3.1 per cent in 1991. The cuts, although initially needed, were so drastic that basic social and, to a lesser degree, material infrastructure were hit. The risks of such a situation are acknowledged by senior Moroccan ministers such as Mr Mohamed Berrada, who has held the finance portfolio since 1986. Hence much of the proceeds of the second structural adjustment loan, worth Dollars 275m, agreed by the World Bank in April, is to be channelled towards health care and education for the poor. Apart from its role in modernising Moroccan industry, trade liberalisation has helped contain inflation. More than 90 per cent of imports are now free from licensing and the balance should be freed by the end of the year. The maximum level of import tariff was reduced from 400 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent this year and average import tariffs are projected to reach 12 per cent by the end of 1992. Foreign investment, which increased by 80 per cent last year has also been encouraged by the abolition, 2 1/2 years ago, of the 1973 Moroccanisation Law and the rather more equal tax and legal footing foreign companies now enjoy with their Moroccan peers. Equally important is the emergence of a stronger, younger and more outward looking class of entrepreneurs.</p>

The solution is  to help them at home, according to Justice Minister Erling Olsen  (Social Democrat).    Justice Minister Olsen fears intense pressure on the Danish  borders as a result of emigration from the former Soviet Union.    "It is the nightmare of the entire western world," he said  against the background of the statements made by the Russian  refugee authorities that BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's Moscow  correspondent talked to. They estimate that 6-8 million refugees  from the former Soviet republics will inundate Russia in the  next couple of years. At present the Russians cannot accommodate  the many refugees who will put increasing pressure on the  Scandinavian borders.    "The pressure could be enormous. It will require very  stringent border control and it could be very unpleasant," Olsen  said.  <H5>  Foretaste </H5>   "A real migration could be a threat to the entire western  world. Television tells them about our living conditions. The  boat people who drifted ashore near Koge gave us a small  foretaste of what lies ahead. It is an enormous problem that we  have been warned about for some time.    ``And the solution is not to build a fortress around all of  Europe but to give them so much assistance that they would  rather stay at home. This will require economic sacrifices on  our part,'' said Justice Minister Olsen.    The Russian refugee authorities are urging the Scandinavian  countries and Germany to devote all their energy to a  cooperation with Russia that will stem the tide. Olsen admitted  that there are no concrete proposals for warding off the  pressure, but referred among other things to the Nordic Council,  which will take the matter up next month.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Speaker Seeks Statement on NTC"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr.  Shivraj Patil, today directed the Government to make a statement  as an agitated Opposition voiced fears that several lakh workers  would lose jobs as the crisis-ridden National Textiles  Corporation Mills [NTC] were on the verge of closure.    Raising the matter during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr.  Ram  Naik (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) said 11 NTC mills closed  down yesterday in Bombay as power supply was disconnected for  non-payment of bills.    The plight of the NTC workers in West Bengal was highlighted  by Mr. Sudarshan Roy Chaudhary, CPI(M) (Communist Party of  India-Marxist). He contended that about 1.60 lakh workers in the  State would stop getting their salaries from April one as the  NTC Mills would receive Rs. 10 [rupees] lakhs from the Centre as  against an expenditure of Rs. 30 crores.    Mr. Harin Pathak, a BJP member for Gujarat, said 1.5 lakh  employees in the powerloom and handloom sectors had gone on  strike protesting against a 10 per cent increase in excise duty  on cotton and polyester yarn.</p>

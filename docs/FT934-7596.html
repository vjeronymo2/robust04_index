			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Nigeria's new ruler orders clampdown NIGERIA'S new military ruler yesterday swept aside the democratic process and abolished all elected bodies, including the two main parties, in a fierce clampdown aimed at stifling any political opposition. General Sani Abacha, in his first broadcast to the nation since he seized power from Chief Ernest Shonekan on Wednesday night, promised to set up a strict military regime to restore stability. All political meetings and associations were banned with immediate effect. The former defence minister said he had set up a Provisional Ruling Council of senior army officers and some former ministers, with himself as chairman. He gave no names and did not say how long his government intended to stay in power. He announced the dissolution of the interim government, the abolition of all national and state assemblies, state governments, local government councils, the National Electoral Commisssion (NEC) and the two political parties created by the military regime of former president General Ibrahim Babangida. State governors are to be replaced by army brigade commanders or police chiefs. Gen Abacha appealed to the west for understanding, but his speech was a severe blow to western critics and Nigerians who had hoped he would institute moves toward democracy. In his speech he said a constitutional conference would be set up soon to 'determine the future constitutional structure of Nigeria,' but gave no timetable or any indication he favoured an early return to civilian rule. 'This regime will be firm, humane and decisive. We will not condone nor tolerate any act of indiscipline. Any attempt to test our will, will be decisively dealt with,' he said. He urged trade unions which have paralysed much of the country with a nationwide strike over fuel price increases to return to work immediately. Nigeria's new military strongman hinted at the possibility of wide-ranging reforms to much criticised national institutions such as the armed forces, police, judiciary and customs service, as well as three nationalised industries renowned for corruption - oil, telecommunications and electricity. But in a ten-minute speech he gave no details. In the only concrete move likely to appeal to democrats he said the four newspaper publishing houses banned by Gen Babangida in July would be allowed to re-open. He did not refer to tough registration laws which the press claim will drive many of them out of business. The newspaper groups include Concord Press owned by Mr Moshood Abiola, the deposed winner of the presidential poll earlier this year. Gen Abacha's takeover arose out of the political crisis left by Gen Babangida after he annulled the democratic presidential election held on June 12 when Mr Abiola looked set to become the clear winner. Yesterday Gen Abacha made no reference to the poll or to Mr Abiola. Few in Nigeria had been happy with Chief Shonekan's performance and his removal came as no surprise. 'If  you are going to rule Nigeria you have to have either a mandate from the people or a gun in your hand. Shonekan had neither,' said a leading banker in the commerical capital.</p>

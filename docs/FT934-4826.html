			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / BT to lose control of issuing numbers British Telecommunications will lose control of the allocation of phone numbers early next year under plans announced yesterday by Oftel, the industry regulator. The announcement came as Flextel, a small Cheshire-based company, launched a personal numbering service which it claimed was the first such service to charge only the calling party. Flextel is offering subscribers personal numbers they can take with them when they move. Telephone subscribers who move generally need to change their number unless they are remaining in the same area. Oftel said yesterday it would set up a numbering administration unit to start work in January, taking over responsibility for allocating blocks of numbers and 'nationally significant codes'. The move is in line with Oftel's policy of divorcing control of the national numbering system from BT to ensure fairer competition with Mercury and the increasing number of new operators. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'Numbering is an essential element in the development of a competitive market in new telephone services in the UK.' He said BT had tried to be even-handed in allocating numbers, but the new arrangement would 'reduce the risk of premature disclosure of commercially sensitive plans for new services requiring a number allocation'. BT said the plans were 'as expected', and that it had 'long been reconciled to losing responsibility for numbering'. Of more concern to BT are investigations of its directory inquiry service and directory advertising service, which includes Yellow Pages. The Office of Fair Trading is examining the first and Oftel the second. In both cases competitors claim that BT gains an unfair advantage from possession of the national numbering database. Reports are expected early next year. The report on directory advertising could lead to a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Flextel, which holds a government telecommunications licence, is gearing its service to small and medium-sized businesses without private networks, which are anxious not to have to change their numbers when moving offices. Personal numbers offering low-cost portability on a day-by-day basis are likely to be on offer within a year. A service is already on offer in the US and at least one private company, Numbering Viewed Worldwide, is developing a commercial service for the UK. The main hurdle is finding a mechanism for users to update a database linked to the phone network that does not require a long call to an operator. Oftel predicts that personal numbers will become 'an area of rapid growth', and is encouraging entrepreneurs into the field. Cambridge Cable also offers a service. Mr William Goodall, Flextel's managing director, said one in seven phone numbers was changed each year, so personal numbers would be 'a powerful tool enabling businesses to plan for both expansion and office relocation without risking the loss of customer contact'. The bulk of the cost of Flextel's personal numbers fall on those phoning them, who have to pay a premium rate of 15p per minute in peak hours. All calls, including local calls, are charged at that rate. There will be an annual fee of Pounds 24 per number.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wise words on Lloyd's risks ALTHOUGH profitability appears to be returning to Lloyd's of London, the risks for Names, the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital base, have never been greater. Lloyd's losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989, which were reported in June, were heavily concentrated among a minority of Names unfortunate enough to be members of the worst-performing syndicates. The pattern could be repeated in 1990 and 1991, so it is more important than ever for Names to know as much about the syndicates they are joining and the agent who will handle their affairs. Three new publications should therefore be of interest to Names. For the first time in its history, Lloyd's itself has published its own comprehensive statistical report on syndicate performance. Limelight: Lloyd's syndicate results 1991, a 600-page report, costs Pounds 30 and contains information on the breakdown of the separate classes of business written by syndicates which has not been previously available. The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM, 16 St Mary at Hill, London EC3R 8EE) is upgrading its syndicate statistics. The ALM guide contains slightly less statistical information than Limelight, but it does offer commentary on syndicate performance and prospects. The ALM has has also published a new guide (Lloyd's 1992 Members Agents Profiles) to the members' agency community at Lloyd's, which gives figures for the average returns obtained for Names by every members' agent and many other details. Both books, as well as the ALM's newsletters and other publications, are offered to ALM members as part of their Pounds 90 a year subscription. Meanwhile, the next issue of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, the longest-established guide to the market, is scheduled for publication next month. The Society of Names (the Old Rectory, Adstock, Buckinghamshire MK18 2HY), also publishes its own syndicate guides.</p>

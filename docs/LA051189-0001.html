			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: A CITY IN SEARCH OF A PIT  </P> <P> I have been searching for a consistent moral standard in L.A. by asking people  how they feel about pornography. Two were for it, three against it and one said  she wouldn't talk dirty with a stranger.  </P> <P> Of the two for it, one was a television producer and the other an autistic  savant who could name dirty movies back to the time Hedy Lamar appeared nude in  the film "Ecstasy."  </P> <P> The reason I went out searching for some kind of moral level was a ruling last  week by Judge David Kenyon that there is no obvious community standard in L.A.  regarding moral filth.  </P> <P> As a result, he threw out a case against a distributor of adult videos. How can  you judge a film to be pornographic, he asked, when everyone has a different  idea of what pornography is?  </P> <P> Size has a lot to do with it. In Argonia, Kan., for instance, with its  population of 591, it would be easy to set a standard by declaring that  anything your mother wouldn't approve of is dirty, and those who don't agree  with that get out.  </P> <P> But in Los Angeles, with its 13 million drifting souls, some of whose mothers  are topless dancers, taste varies to such a degree that what is slime to some  is chicken soup to others.  </P> <P> One of those I spoke with in pursuit of a definition was the Rev. Jess Moody,  pastor of the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys and God's best friend in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> A wily Texan who has parlayed down-home charm and an Oxford education into  leadership of 10,000 parishioners, Jess once claimed to have discussed with God  the possibility of moving his church from Van Nuys to Chatsworth.  </P> <P> God said go for it, but the neighbors raised such hell that God changed his  mind and said maybe you shouldn't go for it.  </P> <P> Anyone who has talked to God, however, is worth listening to, so I asked Jess  how he felt about moral filth. Asking a pastor how he feels about smut is like  asking a cat how he feels about being chased by a dog. While the dog might  consider it fun, it's not going to please the cat.  </P> <P> Jess came at me quoting the Bible, the Supreme Court, three teachers, a writer  and his daddy to support his argument that Judge Kenyon should have set the  community standard himself rather than leaving it up to the people.  </P> <P> "The man is a free-floating relativist," Moody declared with just enough fire  and brimstone in his voice to indicate he was not fooling around. "He ought to  be a ticket-taker at Dodger Stadium."  </P> <P> I was about to ask what a relativist was, but you don't goad a preacher on the  pulpit. Anyhow, he was beyond that.  </P> <P> "You know what you get when you let people decide the law?" he demanded. "You  get Jesus crucified and Plato forced to take Hemlock."  </P> <P> He defined Californians as not being discriminating when it comes to  pornography. Too many of us like it.  </P> <P> "He who digs a pit will fall into it," Jess said quoting from the Book of  Proverbs. Then he added cheerfully, "That ought to hold you for awhile."  </P> <P> I don't want to say anything to upset the ACLU and, God knows, I'd rather die  than appear unhip, but there does seem to be a lot of hot sex going on and it  isn't very subtle.  </P> <P> At one time, for instance, a movie, to indicate human fornication, would  portray a man and a woman in decent swimming attire kissing on a beach and then  pan away to sea gulls when the breathing got heavy.  </P> <P> Violins played while the sea gulls soared and sometime there was brass section  fortissimo at the proper moment, but that was generally that.  </P> <P> Now the camera dollies in for the kind of tight shots that would make a gunnery  sergeant blush and follows the couple scene after scene as they repeat the  performance on a roller coaster, a kitchen table, halfway up the steps of the  Jefferson Memorial and in the middle of the Piazza San Pietro.  </P> <P> And that's just the R-rated stuff. Take the same scenes, add horses, whips,  handcuffs and a guillotine and you've got what the porn kings are peddling on  videotape.  </P> <P> Judge Kenyon and Jess Moody are both a little bit right. I agree that Mom may  not be capable of setting a single moral standard for L.A., but it does seem to  me we ought to be panning away to the sea gulls at least once in awhile.  </P></p>

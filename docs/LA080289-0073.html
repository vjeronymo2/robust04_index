			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A special grand jury was impaneled to hear numerous allegations of safety  violations at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, including the  illegal dumping of hazardous wastes. Chief U.S. District Judge Sherman G.  Finesilver told the 23 grand jurors their only task during the 18-month term  would be "to determine what criminal acts, if any, were committed at Rocky  Flats nuclear weapons plant." The plant, which manufactures plutonium  detonators for nuclear weapons, is 16 miles northwest of Denver. About 75 FBI  agents and special officers from the Environmental Protection Agency raided the  plant on June 6 after a search warrant was issued on an affidavit containing  more than 100 pages of allegations. The affidavit accused officials and  employees of illegally dumping hazardous wastes into streams and altering  documents.  </P></p>

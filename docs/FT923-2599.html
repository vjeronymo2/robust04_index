			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Sell-off rebuff for party leadership THE Liberal Democrat conference yesterday rejected the party leadership's proposals to set up a rail holding company to franchise rail services and stations. The decision - by 314 votes to 309 - is a further rebuff for the leadership's emphasis on the market and competition. Representatives clearly rejected the assertion in the After Privatisation policy paper that the debate between nationalisation and privatisation 'belongs to history'. Mr Roger Liddle, chairman of the working group that produced the paper, said it was 'most emphatically not a free-market paper', and urged the party not to leave the Tories in sole possession of the rhetoric of competition. But speakers were applauded when they said the paper seemed to have been written by Conservatives and did not reflect the Liberal Democrat commitment to accountability and the community, and to the involvement of employees in their industries. They also criticised it for too readily accepting that the privatisations already carried out by the Tories could not be reversed and for entering too enthusiastically into the language of the market.</p>

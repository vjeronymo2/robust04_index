			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Anglo-Italian deal on toll motorway MIDLAND EXPRESSWAY, an Anglo-Italian joint venture, yesterday signed the agreement to build and run Britain's first privately financed toll motorway. The Birmingham Northern Relief Road, which will extend for 30 miles, will provide motorists with an alternative to the congested M6 motorway including Spaghetti Junction to the north of the city. The winning bid was submitted by a joint venture between Trafalgar House, the UK construction to hotels group, and Iritecna of Italy, Europe's biggest toll-road operator. The concession will run for 53 years. The road, which will run between junctions 4 and 11 of the M6, is expected to cost Pounds 270m to build - rising to Pounds 450m if finance charges are included. Tolls are expected to be equivalent to Pounds 1.50 for a car and Pounds 3 for a lorry at present prices when the road opens in the late 1990s.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: New York Philharmonic 150th anniversary concert The New York Philharmonic - the oldest orchestra in the western hemisphere - made its first noise on December 7 1842 when the gloriously named Ureli Corelli Hill raised his baton over a group of largely German immigrants to launch them into Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Right through this season the Philharmonic is remembering its sesquicentenary, notably with a stream of first performances that has already brought us Messiaen's final pictures of paradise, 'Eclairs sur l'au-dela. . .' But on the anniversary itself we were invited to celebrate the recent past and the present rather than to glimpse the future. In a hall swagged with gauze and tinsel, all three of the orchestra's surviving music directors were on the podium - in turn, to be sure - to conduct what was necessarily an oddly mixed concert, and one that could not quite hit the note of festivity determinedly expected of it. The best playing came at the start, in an addition to the scheduled programme, when the orchestra, unconducted, turned back with high pride to remember a fourth of its chiefs: Leonard Bernstein. His Candide overture went with supreme panache, and if the speed was not quite his dizzying own, the performance was an astonishing feat of ensemble playing, as well as a revel of opera bouffe fizz, fanfare and, in the answering strains of the middle section, expressive ardour in a Jewish mode. The obvious conclusion was that this orchestra barely needs a conductor. The second conclusion was that Bernstein remains, more than 20 years after he relinquished the part, a tough act to follow. Never mind that Zubin Mehta was - as we were reminded by the chairman, Stephen Stamas - music director for a longer period, having charge of the orchestra from the end of the Boulez regime (1971-7) until the arrival of Kurt Masur last year. Bernstein's association with the Philharmonic covered a full quarter-century, and his legacy - of recordings, of programming policy, of memories - is still potent. In contrast, it is as if the Boulez years had never been. All his innovations - the commitment to music as intellectual adventure, the 'Prospective Encounters' that took the orchestra downtown to play Steve Reich, the 'rug concerts' that imitated the informality of the Proms - were abandoned under his successor, and a sense of missed opportunity underlay his performance of La mer on this occasion. In its own way it was a rather remarkable turning over of the piece's grim inheritances: a low-string ostinato in the first movement, for instance, remembered Nibelheim. And the lack of buoyancy in the middle movement was astonishing, given Boulez's admiration, often voiced in word and as in deed, for its allusive continuity. The Boulez moment of dimmed glory was preceded by Mehta's display of showmanship in Till Eulenspiegel (a nice touch to tuck his hands quickly behind his back so that the players were left to give the last downbeat on their own), and followed by Masur in the 'New World' Symphony, one of the oldest jewels in the Philharmonic's crown of commissions. No doubt they have played it better at other times (straitened violin sound in the upper register remains a problem, especially in Masur performances), but surely never more forcefully. Masur's efforts to drive the first movement into sounding like a proper Germanic sonata allegro, with a strenuous first subject and a momentous development, made it seem that Dvorak was falling short in something he never attempted. Everybody got on much better when the energy was less fierce, in the slow movement and, most beautiful of all, the trio of the scherzo, where Masur showed what delicious effects he and his wind players can produce. There at least were the seeds of hope.</p>

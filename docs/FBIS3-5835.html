			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vientiane, March 11 (KPL) -- The first village based  detoxification and rehabilitation programme for opium addicts in  the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] opened this week in  Pha Lavek, Vientiane Province, according to a UN Drug Control  Program's [UNDCP] press release.    The UNDCP highland integrated rural development project  started the three week-long trial with support from a medical  back-up team from the northern drug dependence treatment centre  in Chiang Mai, Thailand.    Twenty-one addicts voluntarily enrolled at the new unit in  Nam Khian village, Pha Lavek, to take gradually reduced levels  of twice- daily administered opium tincture. Medical check-ups,  vocational training, and social activities are also part of the  programme.    The participants in the detoxification programme are  accompanied by community health workers from their own village  who will continue to assist with rehabilitation upon their  return home.    The team from Thailand, led by Dr. Charun Chittiwuthikan, is  providing training for health workers in detoxification  procedures, including the proper dosing of opium addicts to  minimise withdrawal symptoms.    Village elders and government officials joined project staff  and the community for the detoxification programme's opening  ceremony.    A village "shaman" and a "witch doctor" performed  traditional  ritual at the new unit, including discarding used opium pipes  into a nearby stream. Specially composed songs in the Hmong  language warning of the perils of opium dependency were sung,  and prizes for children's anti-opium art and a poetry  competition were presented.    Within the project area there are estimated to be 97 addicts  of whom 70 have said they want to end their drug dependency.  There are an estimated 40,000 addicts living in the Lao PDR.    Many of the addicts said they had become opium dependent  after taking the drug for a health problem and now wanted to  give up the habit mainly for economic reasons.    UNDCP's highland integrated rural development project, which  started in July 1989, is implementing development activities to  create economic and social conditions which eliminate the need  to grow opium for commercial purposes. Establishing an efficient  and effective community based health care system is an integral  part of the project.</p>

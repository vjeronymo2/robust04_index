			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Raising Fires - Theatre It ill behoves me to speak ill of a play that concerns farming folk near Manningtree, since the folk I myself come from are all farmers near Manningtree and since they present a valuable contrast to the popular conception of 'Essex person'. Indeed, Raising Fires, a new play by Jenny McLeod, is also about rural arson, and in my time I have stood by flaming strawstacks ignited by arsonists. But Raising Fires is not the play to raise Manningtree-consciousness. It is merely a muddled melodrama, and dismally close to mimicking the bygone witch-hunting depicted in Arthur Miller's The Crucible. Set in Elizabethan times (Manningtree is mentioned in Shakespeare), it shows how young Marshall Loder has married one woman, Ruth, to advance his own political career, though having made another girl, Tilda Hubbie, pregnant; and it then shows how the women of the community make Tilda out to be the witching culprit of the mysterious local fires. The twist is that Tilda is black. Tilda is conceived entirely as a pc victim - female, black, innocent, loveable, maligned. ('The first thing I remember is other people.') Men have used her for their various purposes all along (Minister Hubbie in adopting her, his son Daniel and Marshall Loder in making love to her); and now women pick on her too. 'Women look, men touch,' she says. But it is peculiar how long we wait until Tilda's colour is properly mentioned (nor is it ever seriously discussed); and yet that, in a trice, becomes the reason why she is picked on as a witch. The thumbscrews are tightened when Ruth Loder, aware that her husband has impregnated Tilda, bitterly testifies that Tilda is both witch and arsonist. Marshall Loder, a standard male hypocrite who wants political advancement through his wife's father and sex with Tilda, vacillates. What will he do? Actually, it doesn't matter, for he proves as helpless in the face of mob hysteria as Tilda. Tilda is packed off to her death. Someone ends by saying 'God - we will answer for this'. A more serious play might have shown them answering for it, or might have made Marshall Loder's dilemma more interesting (by making him a more interesting character), or might not kept its focus more thoroughly on Minister Hubbie (who promises damnation or paradise for the pettiest sins or virtues, but who has kept Tilda irresponsibly passive). But everything here is clumsy. The language commutes wretchedly between mock-period ('At such a sight the sickness inside me was so great', 'Four babies I had in my arms') and naturalistic modernity ('This is not what I need', 'I say 'Bugger the father''). The conflict between Minister Hubbie and Judge Fury suggests a church v. law conflict that is inadequately investigated. The roles that Daniel Hubbie and Grace Turvey play in the off-stage action are insufficiently clear. And the names] Hubbie this, Wife that; Grace here, Fury there. I cannot imagine why this play won a 1993 London Weekend Television Plays on Stage Award. Dominic Dromgoole, directing, keeps it lively, but he cannot provide depth. The same goes for his cast, which includes Robin Soans as Minister Hubbie, Julie Saunders as Tilda and Gary Love as Marshall Loder. And there is too much unnecessary shouting. In pub theatres, making the actors turn up their volume controls is the easiest way to achieve intensity, but also the cheapest. At the Bush Theatre, W6.</p>

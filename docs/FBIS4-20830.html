			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov, conducted by </F> Leonard Nikishin and Leonid Sharov: "Vil Mirzayanov: Getting To  Know Prison Brings You Closer to the Truth"]    [Text] OBSHCHAYA GAZETA covered the case of scientist  Vil Mirzayanov in a recent issue in connection with the  impermissibility of using overt blackmail, even if it is  "justified," in order to achieve justice. Vil Sultanovich is now  free. But justice has not been achieved. He agreed to meet with  our correspondent precisely because he is well aware of the  nature of the problem that presents itself: the correlation  between human rights, the law and power...    Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, officially your  case has not yet been closed, even though our judicial system  has, one must assume, expended quite a lot of effort on it. So,  like it or not, part of this interview will have to be devoted  to your impressions acquired in investigative offices, in court  and in prison cells.    Mirzayanov: Odd as it may seem, I turned out to be  more prescient than my lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. He believed that  the court would in the end find the strength to be objective and  unbiased. From Asnis' point of view, the court had every  opportunity to deal with the case fairly quickly. Under those  conditions we had a right to expect an acquittal.  Unfortunately... People in the know warned me that once the  investigation took a clear turn in favor of indictment nothing  good could be expected to come of it. But I still had hopes that  my case would reach the General Procuracy -- and there fall  apart, because even a blind man could see that it was completely  contrived. Nothing of the kind ever occurred. But then I came to  realize that justice cannot be expected from the courts. That  the KGB and the courts are the same in nature. That is my main  impression or lesson from all this. I no longer have any  illusions. About the fact that our institutions and official  agencies have become accustomed to doing shoddy work and being  paid big salaries for that shoddy work, just like in the courts  and the procuracy... They are one and the same. And that despite  the fact that what is at stake here are human beings' lives and  futures. Pity our people! Nothing has changed in this country.  We are all still in the hands of an inhuman regime. That is not  just an impression or a lesson -- it is a conclusion.    Correspondent: How did the investigation go? We at  least have some impression of the trial...    Mirzayanov: As I understood, it proceeded in the  usual fashion. That is to say, it involved a tremendous number  of violations. That is to say, just the way the investigator  wanted it, and the way those who gave him his orders wanted it.  My petitions were not granted even though they concerned  fundamental issues like getting expert opinions from more  competent and qualified experts. Oh, no -- why should they do  anything to help out the one being investigated? You ask that an  important witness be called, and they refuse. All terribly  cynical. Quite frankly, there is no way that what went on can be  called an investigation, i.e. a procedure with some connection  to the law.    Correspondent: Was your lawyer allowed to be  present at the preliminary investigation?    Mirzayanov: I had no lawyer at all until 11  November 1992. The people involved in the October events in  Moscow got lawyers instantly, as if they were just waiting until  they were needed. When I was in Lefortovo (my first jail time at  the start of the trial) the KGB persistently attempted to "set  me up" with one of their lawyers. I repeatedly refused. On 2  November I was released on the condition that I not travel. It  was only on 11 November that Aleksandr Asnis, who was chosen by  me, began to work with me, and the KGB only allowed him access  to the case with tremendous reluctance and after persistent  requests by the deputy general procurator.    Correspondent: Did anything change after the  investigation?    Mirzayanov: And how! The most important thing: the  lists of information containing state secrets. They were not  even included in the case file!    Correspondent: Excuse me for going back to an  unpleasant subject, but our justice system plunged you (their  term, incidentally) into prison life. Why do you think that was  done?    Mirzayanov: Out of habit, I believe. Many people,  very many, are "plunged," as you put it, into that. Either as a  show of force, or to demean them. Either answer fits. But I have  various impressions of prison. Yes, the filth is incredible and  there are rats in the corridors, drunken guards and beatings.  People stay in jail for three or four years without coming to  trial. Some cells hold 100 people, four times more than their  normal capacity. I remember that I spent my first days in jail  in a box that measured 16 square meters, and there were 50 of us  in there. We were given nothing to eat or drink. The lowliest  farm animals are better treated. You cannot actually eat the  stuff they do serve in prison. And the prison talk... And the  shock at what you are seeing and hearing, at the fact that you  are standing right next to a murderer. Or at finding out that  there are prisoners among you who were sent there for  psychiatric evaluation. But then I got lucky. The women had me  transferred from the holding cell to a "luxury" cell with just  four cots in it. But even there we had to sleep in shifts. I was  the seventh prisoner in the cell. Incidentally, sleeping in  shifts is something that has to be learned. I didn't get it  right away. But, generally speaking, people in prison are  ordinary people. They do not divide themselves up into the  guilty and the innocent. They are friendly. They are willing to  help you out, though there are plenty who want to provoke you,  too. People treated me normally, respectfully. People my age do  not last long under those conditions. I was surrounded mainly by  young men, under the age of 40. No one insulted me or made me  get up and move when I sat down. And in my cell all the guys  looked out for me, giving me tea and sugar... I remember the  members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency. In  Lefortovo I was right next to Lukyanov and Pavlov. They got fed,  that's true! Their meals were brought in from a cafe. Even  booze. Well, the other prisoners got supplied at the same time,  anyway. As soon as they were released, the very same day, the  usual prison food returned. They say the prison spent its whole  five-year budget feeding the State Committee for the State of  Emergency prisoners.    I would like to say that getting to know prison is not  something that ennobles a person, but it does bring you closer  to the truth.    Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, tell us frankly:  if it had not been for the noisy media campaign...    Mirzayanov: Yes, yes, you are right. Everything  that happened after I was thrown into Matrosskaya Tishina was  the result of the pressure brought to bear on state structures  by the press and television. I also want to thank the public  officials who came to my defense. But the whole horror of this  is that it took the extraordinary efforts, energy and emotion of  many people, it took a tremendous amount of righteous but, of  course, extra-legal pressure just to put a single trial on a  civilized footing. That could have been accomplished quite  simply using law and logic.    Correspondent: Do you feel that the Paris  International Convention on Chemical Disarmament signed in 1993  is defective? After all, it makes no reference to binary  weapons...    Mirzayanov: It is not just defective... I do not  know how the Americans feel about it, but from a professional  standpoint I find it completely oriented toward the past. It  does not guarantee any sort of secure future. It not only does  not ban binary weapons, it does not even ban any kind of  research in that field. The Convention only requires that  existing stocks of toxic agents be destroyed.    Correspondent: Binary weapons are particularly  tricky due to the fact that their components are non-toxic  chemical substances that are manufactured on an industrial scale  for other purposes. And, of course, the "binary" formula in such  cases is a closely-guarded secret. God forbid that such  relatively simple technology spread around the world, finding  its way into the hands of various dictatorial regimes. In your  opinion, is it not necessary for Russia and the United States --  the two powers that currently have such weapons -- to begin  developing joint measures to limit their proliferation? It would  probably be necessary to exchange information on binary weapons  and for both countries to pass a number of laws on this issue...    Mirzayanov: Definitely. Cooperation should occur  in any form dictated by the current situation. If, of course,  both sides really want to disarm chemically and not just get rid  of some old junk. Unless there is that kind of cooperation, the  USA and Russia simply will not be able to keep the peace. The  ease with which binary weapons can be manufactured makes it  possible for them to be obtained even by countries that are not  technologically advanced, secretly and with impunity. That is a  tremendous temptation. We must sound the alarm. It is for that  reason that I attach great significance to this opportunity to  speak via your newspaper, and I hope that the deputies of the  State Duma will approach ratification of the Paris International  Convention with great caution.    Correspondent: What do you personally intend to be  doing in the near future? After all, you lost your job in  January 1992 after your first statements to the press. As in the  past, the system in the "new" Russia punishes dissidents harshly.    Mirzayanov: The issues I have raised are far from  being resolved. An international ban on binary weapons, adoption  of measures to prevent their proliferation and a ban on research  in the field are all goals that will require a great deal of  effort to attain.    After getting some personal experience with the terrible  conditions under which prisoners are held at the Matrosskaya  Tishina Investigative Detention Center, I cannot remain  indifferent. Right now my name is somewhat well known, and I  want to take advantage of that fact to campaign for improvement  of prison conditions.    Correspondent: There is no doubt that your public  activities will be beneficial. But how are you going to support  yourself financially?    Mirzayanov: I will try to find work, and I will be  asking anyone I can for a job. I could work as a consultant, an  analyst or an experimenter -- I have had my doctor of sciences  degree for almost ten years. But I would not shun any job. If I  have to become a street vendor to support my family, then...    Correspondent: Did you receive any financial  support during all your tribulations? I do not mean just moral  support...    Mirzayanov: Of course. I was helped out by  relatives, and friends, and public organizations. Particularly  tangible aid came in the form of a prize from the Cavallo Fund  in the United States; that helped me hang on for almost a year.</p>

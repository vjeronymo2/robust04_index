			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Nato rallies to call of 'expand or die': The alliance meeting in Seville today will focus on enlargement Just over a year ago, US Senator Richard Lugar warned Nato there was only one way it could survive without a communist threat. It must go 'out of area' - gear up for peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations outside its own geographical limits - or else go 'out of business'. That was last year's slogan. When Nato defence ministers gather today in Seville, they will hear a new rallying cry, a new formula for extending Nato's area of operations. It is called enlargement. Instead of venturing beyond its frontiers, the alliance will be called on to extend those frontiers - to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (known as the four Visegrad countries) and possibly others. The calls will be led by Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister who is the most outspoken advocate of early enlargement, and wants a firm commitment to incorporate Poland by the year 2000. Mr William Perry, the US Defence Secretary, is also impatient. US officials want preparations for expansion to move into high gear this autumn, and they have started speaking about enlargement with the same missionary zeal that they brought until recently to the 'out-of-area' slogan. They are suggesting that Nato will have no reason to exist, or to expect US support, unless it expands soon. In the pithy language favoured by Senator Lugar, the new US message is something like 'expand or die'. In practice, however, the 'out of area' slogan has not proved to be a panacea for Nato, and enlargement is also likely to spark some acrimonious debate in Seville. Nato's most spectacular 'out of area' operation - policing the skies over Bosnia - is still proving to be a trying experience for the alliance. The problem is that by most legal interpretations, Nato can only go 'out of area' under a mandate from another organisation, such as the UN or the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. And Nato's US commanders have barely concealed their fury over the cautious attitudes of the British and French generals who command the UN ground forces in Bosnia. Only after some very blunt soldier-to-soldier exchanges over the past two weeks have tempers cooled. One of the first fruits of this frank dialogue over tactics in Bosnia was last Thursday's air strike against a Bosnian Serb tank. A second problem with 'out-of-area' operations, highlighted in a study by left-wing defence analysts in Washington, London and Berlin, is the contrast in the peacekeeping doctrines used by European and US armies. While British generals distinguish clearly between keeping peace by consensus and imposing peace by force, the US military tends to blur the two. If 'out-of-area' operations have been contentious, the emphasis on enlargement promises to be even more so. There are sharply contrasting views on the issue among German and US officials, and also within the Nato bureaucracy. In Washington, Bonn and other Nato capitals, the enthusiasm of some politicians for expansion is tempered by the caution of military officers, who are all too aware of the huge outlay of equipment and money that would be needed. Generals, more than politicians, remember that embracing new Nato members is more than a political gesture: it is a commitment to treat an 'attack on one as an attack on all'. The thorniest issue ministers will face is how far Nato should go in defying Russia, which in June became the 20th country to join Partnership for Peace, the Nato-inspired military co-operation programme. Moscow has made plain that it would view Nato's expansion to include the Visegrad countries - particularly Poland - as an unfriendly act, unless the alliance also embraced Russia, something which would transform Nato's character. There are senior US, German, and British officials who see Moscow's hostility as a reason for treading carefully on enlargement. Supporters of this view use two arguments. One is that Nato should take seriously - as a basis for discussion - Russian proposals for a grand partnership between a Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States and Nato. This view may be anathema to cold warriors but it has its backers, especially in the German foreign ministry. Another argument for caution is that by incorporating the Visegrad countries too quickly and slamming the door, Nato will appear to abandon both Ukraine and the Baltic states to Russian influence. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday Russian membership of Nato was 'not a serious proposition'. He stressed Britain's commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine, calling it a 'country whose independence plays a crucial part in the new geography of Europe'. he A wild card in the debate is Turkey. Ankara fears that Moscow's consent to Nato enlargement in northern Europe might be 'bought' with concessions to Russian influence on its borders. So Turkey, while supporting the idea of embracing the Visegrad four, is also suggesting that Romania, Bulgaria and Albania be admitted. But most of the ministers meeting in Seville would need to drink plenty of sangria before they viewed that idea with any relish. *Nato, Peacekeeping and the United Nations, a BASIC/BITS publication, Pounds 10, Dollars 15.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: United Saudi Commercial Bank up 21% UNITED SAUDI Commercial Bank reports a 21 per cent increase in net profits to SR152.7m (Dollars 40.72m) for the third quarter of 1992, AP-DJ reports from Manama. USCB said it has sustained growth in quarterly earnings 'despite an uninterrupted decline in interest rates and extreme volatilities in the world financial markets'. The bank said it had adopted a new strategy, diverting resources 'from low-yielding interbank assets to investment and customer loans, thereby improving net returns on available funds'. USCB loans and advances rose 55 per cent to SR3.40bn while investments surged 57 per cent to SR2.36bn. Total assets at the end of September jumped 16 per cent to SR9.00bn a year earlier. Shareholders' funds were up 34 per cent to SR765.1m 'due to retention of operation earnings', the bank said. However, customer deposits increased by only 11 per cent to SR5.93 bn. The bank said it lowered its provision for possible loan losses to SR22.5m from SR25m the previous year, due to an 'emphasis on credit quality and improvement in the bank's classified risk portfolio'. USCB was set up in 1983 out of a merger of the local branches of Bank Melli Iran, Banque Du Liban &amp; D'outre Mer and United Bank of Pakistan. The three banks retain a joint 30 per cent stake in the USCB, with Saudi private shareholders owning the remaining 70 per cent.</p>

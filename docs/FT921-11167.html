			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / North-west pit closure will cost 620 jobs BRITISH Coal announced the loss of 620 jobs yesterday with the closure of its 115-year old Bickershaw colliery in Lancashire, which has been losing money for the past six years. The announcement came as Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, both used speeches in Manchester to give radically different perspectives on the outlook for the economy and jobs. Mr Kinnock told prospective Labour candidates that employment in the north-west of England had fallen by 200,000 since 1979 - the worst drop for any region in Britain. His attack was backed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, and Mr Henry Macleish, the shadow employment minister, who said 2.4m manufacturing jobs had been lost since June 1979. Mr Howard, at a business lunch at Manchester airport, warned that Labour's minimum wage policy, payroll tax and backing for the European Community's Social Action programme would cost 240,000 jobs in the north-west region alone. 'The north-west will say no to Labour's jobs destruction package,' he claimed. Meanwhile at British Coal, Mr Terry Wheatley, group director, said: 'In view of the continuing failure to achieve production targets, potential geological problems affecting one of the coal faces and limited reserves remaining in seams of proven saleable quality, I see no viable future for the complex.' The move follows the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in the Yorkshire area last week, with four pit closures, and the announcement of 200 redundancies at the Trentham colliery in Staffordshire on Thursday. British Coal said its Hatfield colliery in Doncaster, which employs 437 people and has been under review since October, would stay open after it increased output. Critics say the spate of redundancies at British Coal is being announced ahead of a March deadline for employees opting for voluntary redundancy to receive a top-up payment of Pounds 10,000. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said: 'When this top-up payment was announced, we said it would lead to 10 pit closures and we've had four up to now.' The Bickershaw colliery has lost Pounds 35m in the past six years, including Pounds 11m since April. Mr Wheatley said the pit needed to produce 12,000 to 15,000 tonnes of coal a week if it was to meet targets, but had not reached them. He said there would be no compulsory redundancies. The Hatfield colliery was reprieved after it reduced losses of Pounds 8m to less than Pounds 5m. Granada Television is to cut as many as 100 jobs because of rising costs. Between 50 and 60 redundancies are expected, with temporary contracts not being renewed. The company successfully bid Pounds 9m a year for its north-west of England franchise, but also has to pay 11 per cent of its net advertising revenue to the Treasury.</p>

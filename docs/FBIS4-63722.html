			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part" of speech by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to </F> the Council of the Organization of Veterans in Kiev on 24 May--  recorded]    [Excerpts] Kravchuk on Ukrainian-Russian relations and  Crimea: Part one (stand on Crimea)    The Council of the Organization of Veterans held a plenum on  24 May to discuss arrangements to mark the 50th anniversary of  Ukraine's liberation from Nazi occupation and the 50th  anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War [World War II  on Soviet territory]. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk,  Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy, National Guard Commander  Volodymyr Kukharets, and other state officials attended the  meeting. Considering the importance of the president's address  in terms of various problems in Ukraine's domestic and foreign  policy, we are broadcasting the larger part of the speech.    [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] I am grateful to the  Organization of Veterans for raising the issue of Crimea and  offering to address the people of Ukraine on this issue because  your words and your voice will have a great impact. I am not  exaggerating. [Words indistinct] the situation is developing as  follows: We are acting in accordance with the Constitution and  the law. By we, I mean the president and the Supreme Council of  Ukraine. Believe me, I have not violated Ukraine's Constitution  and legislation so far. The Supreme Council resolution passed  last Friday [20 May] fully accords with the Constitution and the  law on delimitation of powers between the authorities in Crimea  and Kiev and with the law on citizenship. No one violated  anything. We will continue to act within the framework of the  Constitution, within the framework of the legislation, while our  power structures follow the laws and the norms adopted in  Ukraine.    We proceed from the main premise that Crimea is a  constituent  part of Ukraine. This has been recognized worldwide. On the  way here, I received reports from the world's biggest powers:  the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany. The  Russian foreign minister also declared this. They all are  united in the opinion that Ukraine's territorial integrity is a  fact of life, Ukraine's sovereignty cannot be violated, and that  the defense of territorial integrity, inviolability of borders,  and a country's sovereignty is a sacred duty of every individual  and every state. This is the bottom line, which no one is  allowed to cross. This is, as they say, the red line. When we  are involved in a discussion with Crimea, we say: Recognition  of the basic fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine,  and the same constitution and laws apply on its territory as on  the territory of Ukraine, open the door to any compromise, and  any economic, social, and political solutions.    But Crimea and its leadership [words indistinct] are also  violating their own laws, that is, laws enacted in Crimea, and  not only Ukrainian laws. Naturally, in this situation it is  difficult to take the settlement of the issue into the legal  framework.    Our delegation, led by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy, has gone to Moscow to settle the issue of the Black  Sea Fleet, which is very acute. There is some progress, and  there are difficulties. I hope, however, that both Russia and  Ukraine will have enough diplomatic ability and that their  attitude toward the situation will be sufficiently politically  discerning--taking into account all possible positive and  negative consequences--to resolve this problem properly in order  first to preserve peace in Crimea and second not to become an  apple of contention, as it were, between us; and for us to  settle it in a way that would make friendship, partnership, and  cooperation with our great neighbor Russia determine our policy  and be a priority in it.    You yourselves can see that this does not depend entirely on  Ukraine's position. I cannot help but talk today about the wild  and untruthful information that the Russian mass media is  disseminating. The mass media, however, is the mass media.    I cannot help but tell this audience, which is composed of  experienced, politically balanced, and intelligent people, that  the rhetoric at the state level in Russia, at the level of  representative and state power, is unacceptable to Ukraine. All  sorts of hints, all sorts of warnings to the president of  Ukraine cannot be recognized by the civilized world as according  with international norms if one should be guided by these norms.  Any president can issue warnings to his own structures, his own  ministers, his own government, and state and other structures  subordinate to him, but not to the president of another state.  This is not fitting. It is not a democratic approach and does  not do any credit to anyone resorting to it.    I want to be understood: I cannot help but pay attention to  such things when Mr. Sergey Filatov hints that someone provoked  the problems in Crimea in order to retain power. I would like  to know whose opinion is this? Is it Filatov's personal  opinion, or his opinion as chief of presidential staff, or is it  someone else's opinion? This is a serious issue. We do not  allow ourselves any attacks at the state level against our  neighbor, a state with which we want friendly, equal,  partnerlike relations for good, not for one day. Everyone must  consider that.</p>

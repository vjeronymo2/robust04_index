			<p>BFN     [Text] The Burundi interim president, Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya, has addressed again all the citizens on the  crucial issue of security over the whole territory in general  and to the mayorship of Bujumbura in particular. He launched an  urgent appeal to all the Burundians so that they all continue to  bring back durable peace in the country. Security is on the  agenda of all the consultation meetings which are being held  since a number of weeks.    Mr. Ntibantunganya first evoked the problem of disarming the  civil population, precising that after the expiry of the  ultimatum, the follow-up committee on the evolution of the  situation in Burundi after the tragic death of President  Ntaryamira had extended the delay. In his declaration, the  interim president indicated that the reasons for the disarmament  of the civilian population are multiple. The government will be  able to settle problems pertaining to peace and security.  Disarmament will allow to avoid suspicion between the nation  components.    The government intends to get the law on the arms detention  respected. The president-interim also thanked the nation's  Armed Forces for keeping loyal to legal institutions by refusing  to rally eventual putschists.</p>

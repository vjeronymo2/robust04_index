			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak warns of downturn SHARES OF Dalepak, the frozen foods and ready meals group, dropped 66p to 317p yesterday when it warned that difficult trading conditions and higher raw material prices would cut full-year profits. Interim results, for the period to October 31, showed a fall from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.6m at the pre-tax level, although sales rose 0.9 per cent to Pounds 21.4m and trading profits were unchanged at Pounds 1.7m. Heavy capital expenditure, which will reach Pounds 3.6m in the year, increased interest charges from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 125,000. Mr Michael Abrahams, chairman, said the full year would show 'a modest decline at the trading level' against last year's Pounds 4m. Analysts expected that higher interest charges would mean a larger decline in pre-tax profits, which were Pounds 3.9m in the previous year. Gearing would be about 40 per cent by the year end. However, Mr Chris Ivory, chief executive, said that the year was hard to predict because the group's fourth quarter was usually the strongest trading period and this year the benefits of new capacity would begin to be seen as well. He said sterling's fall had increased prices of imported meat by between 5 and 10 per cent, although vegetable prices had been more stable because of a glut of produce. About 70 per cent of Dalepak's raw materials are imported. Price increases were beginning to be made now. Consumers traded down from Dalepak's frozen meat grillsteaks, while supermarkets pushed their own label products aggressively. Although Dalepak makes these too, margins are tight. Next month Dalepak is re-emphasising its brand with a new logo and packaging. Earnings per share fell 8.2 per cent, from 10.13p to 9.3p, and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.5p. COMMENT The share price fall may look alarming, but probably reflects earlier over-optimism rather than deep concern now. Since Mr Ivory joined in 1988 profits have risen strongly, but recession and the power of the supermarkets have caught up with Dalepak. Next year should see the benefits from the factory expansion - sales of frozen vegetable grills were held back by lack of capacity in the first half but a new line was installed over Christmas - and a lower level of spending, so profit growth should resume. This year pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m would give a p/e of about 15.5 times, still a little high.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK avows support for Maastricht BRITAIN yesterday proclaimed its strong commitment to the Maastricht treaty providing for a European monetary and political union, while stressing that the treaty's objective was not to create a European 'super-state'. In a forthright presentation of the UK's policy to the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British minister of state for European affairs, said the treaty was both 'good for the Community and for Britain in the Community'. He added that the EC 'can ill-afford months or years of institutional paralysis at a time when it has heavy responsibilities to shoulder'. At the same time, he was at pains to underline the distinction made in the treaty between the 'core functions' of the Community's institutions and those areas, such as foreign policy, immigration and the fight against drugs, terrorism and crime, which remained subject to intergovernmental co-operation. On the controversial issue of EC frontier controls, Mr Garel-Jones said the UK accepted that there must be 'no systematic controls' over the movement of Community nationals.</p>

He went on the disabled list for a knee injury Aug. 5 for nearly a  month.  </P> <P> Ripken, who drove in the Orioles' first run with a sacrifice fly, broke the  game open with a two-run homer in the fifth for a 6-2 lead.

Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his 25th save.  </P> <P> The White Sox pulled within 6-3 on a run-scoring double by Ivan Calderon in the  sixth.

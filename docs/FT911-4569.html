			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Leading Article: A manifesto from the CBI WITH so many manifestos in the air, a British general election cannot be far away. On Tuesday, the Labour party published its draft policy paper. Yesterday, it was the turn of the Confederation of British Industry to set out its thinking on the way ahead in a mercifully rather briefer document entitled 'Business Agenda for the 1990s'. The most immediately striking feature of the CBI's publication is how far its recommendations are congruent with Labour's stated priorities. Both organisations emphasise the need to increase industrial investment, strengthen manufacturing, improve education and training, promote research and development and modernise the national infrastructure - all within the framework of prudent public expenditure policies. There are inevitably differences between the two positions, though in terms of measures specifically directed at industry these are mostly of detail and degree. CBI members no doubt still worry about the depth of Labour's new convictions, but the overall impression from the document is that British business finds the prospect of life under a Labour government far from unsettling. That, of course, says much about the changes which have taken place within the Labour party in recent years. But 'Business Agenda for the 1990s' also reflects changed attitudes in the CBI. A decade ago, it was clamouring for corporatism and interventionism as the solutions to recession and flagging competitiveness. Today, to its credit, the organisation has forsworn pleading for short-term palliatives and given pride of place to the reduction of inflation. Sterling parity 'Business Agenda for the 1990s' contains scarcely a whimper about the level of short-term interest rates or of sterling. Indeed, it explicitly endorses the maintenance of sterling's parity within the exchange rate mechanism as an essential competitive discipline and calls for the adoption of narrower bands. 'There must be no return to the cycle of inflation and devaluation which characterised the decades of Britain's relative decline,' it declares. It is equally forthright in rejecting trade protection and direct subsidies, while accepting that industry must shoulder much of the responsibility for improving its own performance by raising standards of management practice and training. This realism is welcome. However, 'Business Agenda for the 1990s' is not primarily a treatise on the virtues of economic liberalism. It is a lobbying document. And when it comes to making specific demands and proposals on behalf of industry, it is less coherent and rigorously thought through. Economic strength For instance, the high level of British gross domestic product devoted to consumption is lauded on page one as a sign of economic strength, only to be castigated a few pages later as a diversion of resources from savings and investment. The document is equivocal about corporate takeovers, lamenting their contribution to short-termism in Britain while also calling for a more open market in the rest of Europe. Its arguments for giving more emphasis to manufacturing are unconvincing. The CBI also, like both main parties, is less than clear how its demands for increased government investment in education and infrastructure and for tax breaks for industry can be financed within the framework of tight public expenditure. However, these are relatively minor inconsistencies. The much bigger question is how far British industry has absorbed the implications of the document's central message about the paramount importance of controlling inflation. In that respect, the government's priorities are set. The onus now is on the private sector. But the signals to date are mixed: this week saw statistics showing a stubbornly high factory-gate prices and a 14 per cent annual rise in executive pay. The CBI may protest that it cannot influence its members' actions. But it cannot expect to be taken seriously by governments until they are seen to be delivering on their side of the bargain.</p>

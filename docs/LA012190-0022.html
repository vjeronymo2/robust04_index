			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DESIGN;  </P> <P> ARTFUL ILLUSTRATIONS  </P> <P> TO KIDS, THEY'VE ALWAYS been as important as the text. Now children's book  illustrations are commanding respect from adults as well for both their  artistic and investment value.  </P> <P> Which explains the origin of Every Picture Tells a Story, a new L.A. art  gallery devoted to the show and sale of original art from children's  literature. Pencil drawings by contemporary artists such as Barry Moser ("Jump  on Over!") and Jane Dyer ("Piggins") sell for $100 ; larger, more elaborate  work by leaders in the genre -- Chris Van Allsburg ("Two Bad Ants"), Don Wood  ("King Bidgood") -- go for up to $10,000.  </P> <P>  Every Picture Tells a Story, 836 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles 90038; (213)  962-5420. ELLEN ALPERSTEIN  </P></p>

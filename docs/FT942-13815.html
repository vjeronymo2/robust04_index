			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Markets Report: Franc firm after rate cut The French franc finished the day firmer yesterday as the market gave an approving nod to a 10 basis point cut in a key short term interest rate, writes Philip Gawith. The Bank of France cut the intervention rate to 5.80 per cent and the 5-10 day rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent. The franc was trading at FFr3.4310 against the D-Mark before the cut - below its old ERM floor of FFr3.4305 - but then firmed to close in London at FFr3.427. In a day characterised by fairly low volumes and narrow trading ranges, the dollar was stable after weakening overnight. The US currency closed in London at DM1.6882 against the dollar from DM1.694 on Thursday. The D-Mark fell back slightly in Europe after its recent strength. It closed at Pta81.44 from Pta81.88 against the Spanish peseta and weakened slightly against the Italian lira, finishing at L958.4 from L958.7. In the UK, sterling had a better day with the Bank of England's sterling index closing at 80.5 from 80.1 on Wednesday. The pound was helped by stronger than expected retail sales figures. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC, said the French cut was braver than some people had expected, given the weak exchange rate. He said the move was 'welcome given that exchange rate grounds were not put above the needs of the real economy.' Economic growth remains sluggish, while unemployment is 12.1 per cent and rising. Mr Parsons said the cut was 'confirmation that the BOF may be independent of French politicians, but it is not independent of the Bundesbank. French interest rates are still set in Frankfurt.' Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor, told a news conference that the monetary policy council had based its decision on 'clear signs of non-inflationary growth'. He said the council would resist calls for lower short term rates as these would increase France's medium and long-term rates. 'A sudden and compelled cut in short term rates would have a negative impact on expectations as to the internal and external stability of the franc and thus do untold harm to the economy,' said Mr Trichet. Mr Lee Ferridge, treasury economist at Natwest Markets, said the market had been reassured that the French were not going to try and cut rates below German rates. The Bank of France's intervention rate is 22 basis points above its German equivalent, the repo rate, which is at 5.58 per cent. The rate cut had little impact on sentiment in the futures market. On the Matif, the June three month PIBOR future closed one basis point lower at 94.22. The December future fell by one basis point to 94.39. After looking at one stage as if it might test the key support level of DM1.6830, the dollar recovered to finish higher. The US currency did not get any support from the release of the business outlook survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. The market ignored the prices component of the survey, which rose to 33.1 from 16 in March. Against the yen, the dollar fell to a low of Y102.50, before recovering to close at Y103.545. The turnaround was based upon unconfirmed rumours of the Fed and the Bank of England intervening in the market to support the dollar. The US currency also gained support from comments made by Mr Lloyd Bentsen before Sunday's group of seven meeting. The treasury secretary said the US was not trying to devalue the dollar to increase access to Japanese markets. The market fears that the US administration might resort to this strategy to curb its large trade deficit with Japan. Trading in dollar/yen should have greater direction today after Japan's ruling coalition reached agreement on a common policy platform. This clears the way for the election of a new prime minister. Greater political certainty should help the dollar as it improves the prospects for passage of a stimulatory fiscal package, and enhances the chance of trade reform. Strong UK March retail sales figures dampened hopes of a near term rate cut and lent support to sterling. The UK currency finished a pfennig up at DM2.527 from DM2.517. It was a cent stronger against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4969 from Dollars 1.4858. Retail sales volumes grew, year on year, by 3.8 per cent against a median market expectation of 2.7 per cent. This merely compounded already depressed sentiment about the outlook for easier monetary policy. The June short sterling contract closed four basis points lower at 94.59 after touching an intra-day low of 94.55. The December contract was also four points down, at 93.85. Mr Parsons of CIBC said the fact that there was once again a positive yield curve for sterling did not mean that short rates would rise. In the money market, overnight rates rose as high as 10 per cent - nearly twice the base rate of 5.25 per cent - as the Bank of England sought to clear a large Pounds 2.3bn shortage. Recently, most daily shortages have been below Pounds 1bn.</p>

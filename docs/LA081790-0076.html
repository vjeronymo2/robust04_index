			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE SCHLEVES AND READY MIX  </P> <P> I loved the letter from Leona Thomason (July 22) about Tom and Pat Schleve and  Blue Star Ready Mix.  </P> <P> It is about time someone spoke out against people who moved onto a street  leading to a quarry and now are screaming their lungs out trying to get the  quarry closed. It is my opinion that people who move next to quarries,  airports, chicken ranches, freeways, dumps and other unaesthetic or unsavory  places generally pay less for their property because of those very  characteristics. To demand the closing of such establishments so that they may  profit from increased land values at the expense of businesses and their  employees is reprehensible and disgusting.  </P> <P> EVELYN BURNS  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

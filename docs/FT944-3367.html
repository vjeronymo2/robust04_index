			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / West's fears rise over Chechnya: Moscow urged to minimise bloodshed and search for negotiated solution to conflict Western nations are observing the Russian onslaught in Chechnya with mounting anxiety, but so far they are holding back from directly criticising President Boris Yeltsin or putting their relations with Moscow on the line. All pronouncements on the crisis from the main western capitals have stressed that Chechnya is legally part of Russia. But Nato governments have urged Moscow to keep bloodshed to a minimum and pursue a negotiated settlement. 'We insist on the need to search for a negotiated solution,' a French foreign ministry spokesman said. He added that, despite Chechnya's claim to independence, France viewed the territory as an 'integral part of the Russian federation'. Western nations could, if they chose, challenge Russia for a prima facie violation of the rules of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, including new provisions that were agreed only last week at a summit in Budapest. CSCE members are supposed to give 42 days' notice of military activities involving more than 9,000 troops or 200 sorties by fighter aircraft - a threshold that has easily been surpassed in the case of Chechnya. Last week's summit also adopted a code of conduct for military operations which provides a notional yardstick by which Russian behaviour in Chechnya will be judged. The code calls for constitutional procedures to be observed during internal security operations; any use of firearms should be 'commensurate with the needs for enforcement' and care should be taken to avoid harming civilians. However, no country has voiced any intention of raising these matters in the CSCE. Western observers are conscious of the worrying implications of the Chechnya onslaught for Russian policy on other fronts. Many of the Russian politicians whose views are most respected in the west have opposed the operation, which seems to reflect a victory for the 'war party' within the Yeltsin administration. Yet westerners are pointedly holding back from making any link between the fighting in the Caucasus and other east-west issues. 'By no means does Chechnya define the broad parameters of the US-Russian partnership,' said Mr Michael McCurry, State Department spokesman. The fighting in the northern Caucasus follows a distinct cooling in US-Russian relations because of President Yeltsin's outspoken opposition to any rapid Nato expansion eastwards, a stance criticised by US officials. Yet Washington's toughness over Nato has not so far been translated into toughness over the Chechnya question, which the US regards as less significant. Turkey is the one Nato member where the Chechnya fighting could strike a deep emotional chord. But Ankara is anxious to avoid compromising the territorial integrity of Russia while it is locked in a war with Kurdish separatists, whom it suspects are backed by Moscow.</p>

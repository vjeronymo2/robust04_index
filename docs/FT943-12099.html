			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Labour's green economic yardstick If Britain's Labour Party wins the next election, expect it to give a green tinge to the country's national accounts. In an environmental policy document published last week, the opposition party attacked Britain's current method of measuring economic growth through the gross domestic product: this failed to take account of the qualitative aspects of growth. If there is a disaster, this actually increases GDP because the money spent to remedy it is counted as production, while in reality the country probably ends up the poorer. Labour's policy document, launched by Chris Smith, its spokesman on environmental affairs, promises a number of steps which it believes would make the economy more responsive to the quality of the environment. First, a Labour government would launch a nationwide consultation exercise with the aim of reforming national accounting methods by 2000. Official statistics would be placed under the control of an independent body to avoid political manipulation. Second, Labour will develop a reformed measure of national income which would be published alongside the existing measures of gross domestic product. Third, it will develop a new range of indicators of National Economic Welfare (conveniently called New) which will measure resource depletion, pollution and a number of social indicators. And fourth, at a local level, Labour will encourage councils to consult residents to see what they most want public policy to achieve in the environmental area. The reformation of national income measures to incorporate green factors is not a new idea. The present government is already committed to preparing 'environmentally adjusted national accounts' under the European Union's fifth environmental action programme. But Labour aims to promote these beyond the status of a parallel set of accounts to become the main indicator of UK growth. 'The reason why GDP in its current flawed form is such a problem,' says Smith's paper, 'is that it is so widely accepted and used by economists and politicians as a totem pole around which all debate must dance. An alternative system needs to gain the same high level of credibility if it is to be useful.' Setting itself a completion target of 2000 could be ambitious. The earliest a Labour government is likely to be in power is 1996-97, which would leave it only a few years to complete a mammoth task. Just as difficult could be the New indicators. Some could be accurately measured, such as the volume of oil extracted from the North Sea or the amount of sulphur emitted to the atmosphere by power stations. But others would have to be more subjective, such as the state of the country's forests or the extent of biodiversity in Britain. The local indicators need not be all that sophisticated. The document cites the example of Seattle where residents were asked how they measured environmental quality.  They answered: how many salmon there were in the local rivers, and how often the mountains were not obscured by pollution. In the area of business, Labour would require larger companies to report on their environmental performance and strategy as part of a drive for greater accountability. Conspicuously lacking from Labour's programme, however, is any suggestion of a carbon tax, which it views as regressive. It is also guarded on the fashionable subject of switching taxation from labour to resources, so as to encourage better resource use and boost jobs.</p>

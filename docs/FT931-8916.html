			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: The price of credibility While it is helpful to have the Bank of England's detailed analysis of UK inflation, its new report only tells half the story. Without details of the Bank's view on the real economy, it is hard to tell whether it thinks the benign short term inflation outlook will prove sustainable. Given that output is severely depressed after a long recession, and that debt deflation is curbing consumption, it is small wonder that inflation is subdued. It would be more encouraging if the Bank was confidently predicting strong growth and low inflation two years from now. Unfortunately, it seems more likely that inflationary psychology has not been broken in the UK. Despite severe deflationary forces, the underlying rate remains near the top of the government's target range. Service sector inflation, wage rises and bond yields all reflect cynicism about the prospects of price stability. Importers are steadily increasing prices to compensate for sterling's devaluation. Under the circumstances the government's huge budget deficit is one more reason to worry: the prospect of inflation eroding the value of debt has tempted administrations before now. Perhaps the Budget will provide the long term fiscal strategy needed to give the current policy credibility. If it does not then even the justified expedient of relaxing the full funding rule might not bring much relief. Even if the supply of gilts is reduced, long yields will remain high if the markets believe that the government has caught the British inflationary disease.</p>

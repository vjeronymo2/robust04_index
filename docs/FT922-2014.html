			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Shorts to cut another 400 jobs SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, announced 400 job losses yesterday. The company blamed the redundancies on the recession and said they would affect all areas of its operations. Shorts, acquired by Bombardier, the Canadian transportation group, in October 1989, has given 90 days' notice to the Department of Economic Development. The company has ceased production of the FD360 commuter aircraft and is running down production of the 323 Sherpa military aircraft for the US Army and National Guard. Shorts said there would be some enforced redundancies but efforts would be made to keep them to a minimum. The company added: 'Basically, the reduction has been recession-driven. 'Some of our biggest customers, such as Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace and Boeing, have been scaling down operations, so there has been a knock-on effect.' The job losses come on top of 300 redundancies announced in January, but overall employment at Shorts is still ahead of the level at the time of its privatisation. The company is Northern Ireland's largest private employer with 8,200 in the province and a further 600 in mainland Britain, compared with a total of 7,500 at the time of the sell-off. Shorts has doubled turnover in the past 2 1/2 years to about Pounds 400m a year. The previously loss-making operation recorded a profit of Pounds 26m in 1990-91.</p>

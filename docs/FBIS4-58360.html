			<p>BFN     [Text] A source in the politburo of the Yemeni Socialist  Party issued a press statement yesterday, in which it expressed  regret that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih continues his tragic  play, after he had announced yesterday the killings of the 3d  Motorized Brigade and the 1st Motorized Brigade, in front of a  number of officers and members of the brigade who have been  detained during the criminal aggression on the 3d Brigade on 27  April, by using not less than four brigades with various  weapons. For three days he has been personally leading these  brutal massacres against the 3d Motorized Brigade, during which  he refused to listen to the national, Arab and international  forces demanding a stop to these massacres. After finishing his  assignment, he came to say that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has been  making a fuss in the world by contacting the Arab leaders for  stopping the battle. In his speech the president spoke of the  millionaires who keep their financial credits in foreign banks  when wanting not to be opening the door because its odor is  nasty -- but those who got used to nasty odors lose their sense  of smell. To refer some of the secret international settlers  for people to have [words indistinct] the leaders of the  influential family are among the elite of the richest men in the  world. The president used unfamiliar language in his speech in  which he spoke much about Islam, the region, the religion,  marxism etc. Perhaps this necessitated by the alliance with  Islam, but [words indistinct] in the speech, but it puts on the  speaker not his real garment. Then after that he spoke about  the separatists. We do not know who are the separatists. Are  they those who went to Sanaa with their children and families  and the best military equipment and the units they have,  according to what he said in his speech, or those who were  entrenched behind their (?fascist) systems to impose their own  projects, which led the country to this obstructive crisis. The  planned attack on the 3d Motorized Brigade is the president's  way of merging the Armed Forces.</p>

In order to make this election, the taxpayer must apply &sect;1.985&hyph;3 to that year and all subsequent years. In addition, each person that is related (within the meaning of &sect;1.985&hyph;3(e)(2)(vi)) to the taxpayer on the last day of any taxable year for which the election is effective and that would have been eligible to elect DASTM must also apply these rules to that year and all subsequent years. A taxpayer that has not previously elected to apply DASTM to its prior taxable years may make the DASTM election for the pertinent years by filing amended returns and complying with the applicable election procedures of &sect;1.985&hyph;2. Form 8819 shall be attached to the return for the first year for which the election is to be effective. A taxpayer that has elected DASTM for prior taxable years and applied the rules under &sect;1.985&hyph;3 (as contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 1.1000)) may amend its returns to apply the rules of this &sect;1.985&hyph;3. In either case, the DASTM election for prior taxable years shall be deemed to be made with the consent of the Commissioner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of method. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under DASTM, income or loss or earnings and profits (or a deficit in earnings and profits) of a QBU for its taxable year shall be determined in dollars by_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Preparing an income or loss statement from the QBU's books and records (within the meaning of &sect;1.989(a)&hyph;1(d)) as recorded in the QBU's hyperinflationary currency (as defined in &sect;1.985&hyph;1(b)(2)(ii)(D));  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Making the adjustments necessary to conform such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement to United States generally accepted accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles and tax accounting principles (including reversing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monetary correction adjustments required by local accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Translating the amounts of hyperinflationary currency as shown on such adjusted statement into dollars in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Adjusting the resulting dollar income or loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) and, where necessary, particular items of gross income, deductible expense or other amounts, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to reflect the amount of DASTM gain or loss as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined under paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Translation into United States dollars <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the amounts shown on the income or loss statement, as adjusted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) for the translation period (as defined in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(7) of this section) to which they relate. However, if the QBU previously changed its functional currency to the dollar, and the rules of &sect;1.985&hyph;5 (or, if applicable, &sect;1.985&hyph;5T, as contained in the April 1, 1993 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 1.1000)) applied in translating its balance sheet amounts into dollars, then the spot exchange rate applied under those rules shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to translate any amount that would otherwise be translated at a rate determined by reference to a translation period prior to the change in functional currency. For example, depreciation with respect to an asset acquired while the QBU had a nondollar functional currency shall be translated into dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the taxable year before the year of change to a dollar functional currency, rather than at the rate for the period in which the asset was acquired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost of goods sold. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The dollar value of cost of goods sold shall equal the sum of the dollar values of beginning inventory and purchases less the dollar value of closing inventory as these amounts are determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Beginning inventory, purchases, and closing inventory <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Beginning inventory. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Amounts representing beginning inventory shall be translated so as to obtain the same amount of dollars which represented such items in the closing inventory balance for the preceding taxable year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purchases. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Amounts representing items purchased or otherwise first included in inventory during the taxable year shall be translated at the exchange rate for the translation period in which the cost of such items was incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

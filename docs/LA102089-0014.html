			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOLDEN LEAGUE AWARDS SAUGUS FORFEIT VICTORY  </P> <P> Golden League administrators have awarded Saugus High a 2-0 forfeit victory  after its football game against Palmdale last Friday night was suspended after  a Palmdale player attacked a game official.  </P> <P> Principals and athletic directors of the six-team league met for six hours  Thursday at Quartz Hill High before reaching a consensus. Saugus Principal Mike  von Buelow and Coach Dick Flaherty had contended that Saugus should be awarded  the victory in the league opener at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> "We were looking for a fair and equitable decision," von Buelow said. "We  didn't come across any real precedent that was close to this. It was just a  matter of what would be the best thing to make sure this would never happen  again."  </P> <P> Von Buelow said that the league will release a statement today listing  sanctions against those parties involved but declined to be specific.  </P> <P> Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen could not be reached for comment. Von Buelow,  however, said that Palmdale officials were "extremely cooperative and helpful  in making the decision."  </P> <P> Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell, who was not present at the meeting, said that he  was not happy with the decision and declined further comment.  </P> <P> Flaherty, who has said that his team was not at fault and should therefore be  awarded the win, said he was pleased that the league awarded his team a  victory.  </P> <P> "That's the way it should have been," Flaherty said. "Regardless of what the  score was, an opportunity to finish the game was denied both teams. The team  that was at fault was not us.  </P> <P> "If I was a football coach and we were involved in the negative part of that, I  would demand that we forfeit."  </P> <P> Von Buelow said that he had mixed feelings. "I am (pleased) and I'm not," he  said. "It is a difficult thing to have to go through. But if this helps in this  not happening again, then I'm delighted."  </P> <P> After three personal-foul penalties midway through the fourth quarter, the last  two because of remarks directed from the Palmdale bench toward officials,  Palmdale senior Darius Wilson grabbed back judge Brad Woolley and threw him to  the ground.  </P> <P> Palmdale's bench and bleachers cleared and Wilson later was arrested in the  locker room by L. A. County Sheriff's deputies. Wilson, 18, has been suspended  from school and could face misdemeanor battery charges, according to the  Newhall district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Woolley, 31, who suffered a bruised back and shoulders, has said that he will  consider filing civil charges against Wilson.  </P> <P> Palmdale had outgained Saugus, 220 yards to 30, but had not penetrated the  Centurions' 20-yard line.  </P> <P> Palmdale had been charged with eight penalties -- including five personal fouls  -- for 100 yards. Saugus was penalized 54 yards.  </P> <P> The victory puts Saugus (4-2, 1-0 in league play) in a first-place tie with  Canyon (2-3-1) and Quartz Hill (3-3). Palmdale is 1-5, 0-1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND A scoreless Golden League football game between Palmdale and Saugus  highs Friday at College of the Canyons was suspended midway through the fourth  quarter after a Palmdale player attacked an official. Darius Wilson was  arrested by sheriff's deputies and has been suspended from school. He could  face misdemeanor battery charges. The game's outcome was unresolved until  Thursday's league meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Palestinians seek emergency funds Palestinians yesterday urged international aid donors to release funds to pay for the embryonic self-government in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, Julian Ozanne reports from Jerusalem. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian 'minister' for planning and economic co-operation, met World Bank and donors in Paris to plead for a quick cash injection, amid mounting concerns about a financial crisis. Palestinians say that unless donors disburse aid within days, the Palestinian administration will be unable to meet June salaries for policemen and civil servants. Mr Sha'ath presented the Paris meetings with a Dollars 381m (Pounds 254m) annual spending budget for the Palestinian National Authority. The Palestinians hope to raise Dollars 204m from taxes and customs and want donors to meet the Dollars 177m deficit.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (1): Facing up to international competition - Every segment of the Netherlands' finance industry is being penetrated by foreign competition. Amsterdam is having to work much harder than its bigger rivals just to hold its own as a European financial centre, reports Ronald van de Krol, who wrote this survey AFTER a spate of mergers in the Dutch banking and insurance sector in the early 1990s, the whirlwind pace of change has slowed down sufficiently for the Netherlands' financial community to take stock of its strengths and weaknesses and to prepare for the future. There is little doubt that the recent bout of consolidation has produced a far stronger Dutch financial sector, particularly when judged by domestic standards. But the problem is that the purely national market no longer exists. Competition at home from foreign banks and insurance companies is fierce, a legacy of the traditional openness of the Dutch market. Increasingly, the challenge of 'international' competition is one which Dutch banks and insurance companies are having to face - and win - on their own turf as well as on other European markets. The same is true of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The exchange, which lays claim to being the world's oldest, can no longer afford to feel content with the regular annual increases in turnover volume in Amsterdam, simply because the rise in trading in Dutch shares and bonds in London is showing even faster growth, as is the use of non-Dutch brokers. In the past, before the advent of data transfer by telephone line and the launch of screen trading in London, Amsterdam was, by rights and by definition, the natural 'home' market for Dutch securities trading. Now, however, the bourse finds itself forced to undertake a radical shake-up of its trading system as part of a new effort to establish itself as the main international marketplace for Dutch securities. With London continuing to siphon off Amsterdam's business, the bourse's ability to protect this basic function is by no means guaranteed, raising important questions about the future role of the Dutch capital in a more highly integrated Europe. Underlying the Amsterdam bourse's planned reforms is the recognition that it must encourage foreign securities houses to take part in Amsterdam's proposed new screen-based trading system even if they are physically based in London. By trying to inject Anglo-Saxon standards of competition and aggressiveness, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is, indirectly, challenging Dutch-based banks and brokers to become much more daring themselves by taking larger positions in equities trading and assuming greater risks. THE future of Amsterdam as a financial centre lies in the hands of Dutch institutions as much as it does in the intentions of London-based players. The question is: how committed are Dutch banks and brokers to Amsterdam, especially now that they too have built up stronger operations in London? After all, technology means that they could as easily trade Dutch shares from the British capital as they can from the Netherlands. Still, there are obvious virtues in having conservative financial institutions. Neither Dutch banks nor Dutch insurers have run into the same types of problems that have beset their colleagues in, for example, Scandinavia. And, with the exception of the collapse of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch truck maker, and a few other domestic cases, Dutch banks have so far not found themselves overly exposed to the worsening economic climate in Europe. As a sector, they have also tended to shun the cyclical property market. This innate caution translates into admirable financial stability. Central bank figures show that the average capital adequacy ratio of Dutch banks stood at 11.5 per cent at the end of 1992, well above the Bank for International Settlements' norm of 8 per cent. When the banks are forced into disclosing their hidden reserves in the late 1990s, these figures, too, are expected to confirm the sector's overall health. Because they are big, strongly-capitalised and conservatively-managed, the merged Dutch banks and the new hybrids - the 'bancassurance' groups spanning both banking and insurance - can certainly afford further geographic expansion. So far, however, growth abroad is still being hampered by the lack of suitable takeover candidates at reasonable prices, especially in the sector's 'home' market of Europe. ABN Amro, the Netherlands' biggest bank, has found it easier to expand by acquisition in the Chicago area than closer to home in Europe. With the opening up of Europe and the emergence of bancassurance, Dutch institutions are faced with many more opportunities - and dilemmas - than before. By comparison, the previous round of far-reaching consolidation in the mid-1960s was relatively straight-forward, with separate mergers creating big rival banks, ABN and Amro, and a large insurer, Nationale-Nederlanden. Acquisitions by ABN and Amro in the mid-1970s produced the famous but now defunct Dutch 'four-leaf clover' in which corporate finance was entirely dominated by four home-grown players: ABN and its investment bank Mees &amp; Hope, and Amro and its investment bank Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson. It was natural for Dutch companies to go to their Dutch banks for finance, and foreign competition was inconsequential. All that has changed. Firstly, the main two petals of the four-leaf clover fell away in 1990 with the link-up of ABN and AMRO, and this was followed up in April by the coupling of their investment banks into Mees Pierson. Secondly, the merger in 1991 of Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank, the country's third-largest bank, created the Netherlands' biggest exponent of 'bancassurance,' or 'Allfinanz,' blurring previous distinctions between banks and insurers. Rabobank, the co-operative bank, and Amev, the insurer, have also embraced bancassurance, though ABN Amro and Aegon, the country's other big insurer, have not. Finally, foreign competition has penetrated every segment of Dutch finance, from primary bond issues to lending. Anglo-Saxon banks, both those with offices in the Netherlands and those which serve the Dutch market from London, are particularly active. The prevalence of foreign banks in the world of Dutch finance has been heavily underscored by the upcoming partial flotation of the country's postal and telecommunications company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland. As part of the 1994 flotation, the biggest in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange's history, the Dutch government has already appointed Britain's NM Rothschild &amp; Son to act as its advisers. KPN, for its part, has chosen Goldman Sachs. Unlike France, where the choice of foreign advisers would have raised eyebrows, the selection has caused barely a murmur in the Netherlands. The flotation of KPN marks probably the last big privatisation in a country with few state-owned companies. In the long term, although the state-owned railways may eventually become a candidate for sale, the Netherlands and its financial community cannot rely on state sell-offs to swell the ranks of bourse-listed companies. This stands in sharp contrast to France and neighbouring Germany, where a long list of privatisation candidates offers a guarantee of continuous organic growth of their respective capital markets. In the end, the Netherlands simply lacks the large domestic hinterland that has naturally propelled London, Frankfurt and Paris to the forefront of European finance. From this perspective, it is all the more impressive that Amsterdam has managed to build up a role in European finance that is clearly out of all proportion to the country's size. But the handicap of size also means that Amsterdam will have to work much harder than its bigger rivals just to hold its own in Europe.</p>

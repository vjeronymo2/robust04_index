			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world sugar deficit forecast C. Czarnikow, the London Trade house, has increased its forecast of the 1993-94 world sugar production deficit to 4.39m tonnes from the 3.08m tonnes it was predicting three months ago. In the latest issue of its Sugar Review Cazarnikow says that the estimate for production has fallen by 1.5m tonnes from its February figure to 110.13m, while the consumption figure has been reduced by only 190,000 tonnes to 113.92m tonnes. To the resulting deficit of 3.79m tonnes is added a further 600,000 tonnes to allow for 'unrecorded disappearance'. Most of the latest cut in the production estimate is attributed to the 'continuing deterioration in the Indian crop'. Czarnikow notes that a feature of this year's market has been a tightening white sugar supply, contrasting with an ample availability of raws. This has been reflected at the London Commodity Exchange, where whites futures have risen by 13.7 per cent so far this year, while raws are up by only 10.5 per cent. The review says trends are beginning to emerge for the 1994-95 season and that although it is too early for detailed predictions, 'there are signs of quite strong recovery for new crops'.</p>

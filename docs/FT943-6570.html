			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Bankers worship the new orthodoxy: Unemployment is not their problem Central bankers from 19 countries gathered this weekend at the invitation of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the shadow of the Grand Teton mountains to discuss unemployment, and came away with a reassuring message: it is not their problem. A bevy of academic economists agreed that most of the high unemployment rates in industrialised countries was attributable to structural factors - principally, the way the welfare state distorts an unemployed person's incentive to work - and not to the cyclical, demand factors which are within a central bank's power to influence. Heads nodded piously in the audience as Professor Paul Krugman of Stanford University said that it was now all but universally accepted among academic economists, though still suspect to politicians and journalists, that there was a 'natural' rate of unemployment. A central bank could expand demand and push the actual rate of unemployment below this level, but only at the expense of accelerating inflation. Professor Krugman argued that there was a technology-driven trend towards inequality that Europe's generous welfare systems turned into lower employment and the US's more flexible labour markets allowed to pass into widening income gaps. Although Professor Charles Bean of the London School of Economics argued that a central bank could actually help to lower this natural rate by allowing a slight degree of additional inflation to accompany structural reforms, the overwhelming view was that monetary policy could influence only the short term rate of unemployment; in the long run, unemployment would tend to converge on its natural rate. 'Where employment is concerned, in the short run, macroeconomics is everything, and in the long run, macroeconomics is nothing,' concluded Mr Alan Blinder, once an academic economist himself but now the new vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. This is music to the ears of most central bankers, who have long been defending themselves against the accusation that they are buying lower inflation at the expense of higher unemployment. 'I am very happy with this general theme of the long run absence of any trade-off between inflation and unemployment,' said one senior Fed official. Another added: 'Not only is there no unemployment/inflation trade-off, but there are positive gains for employment from a low inflation environment.' The natural unemployment rate theory has precise implications for US monetary policy, for although Fed officials are not as precise in their estimate of this rate as Professor Edmund Phelps of Columbia University  - who estimates it at around 6.45 per cent in 1993 - they concur that it is very close to the current US unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent. 'Some people think we've passed it, some people think we have a little way to go. Very few people think we're very far from it,' said Mr Blinder. That implies that unemployment in the US has already shrunk to the point where any further decline could trigger pressure on wages and a rise in inflation, and so justifies the Fed's recent decision to raise interest rates - in the face of criticism from some Democratic members of Congress that this threatened to kill off the economic recovery prematurely. For the Clinton administration, which is not anxious to see excessive tightening of monetary policy, the Fed's certainty about the level of the natural unemployment rate creates a difficulty. 'Our problem in the administration is to prevent anything rash and sudden, and hope that if we can prove over the next two or three years that you can keep unemployment in the low 6s without accelerating inflation, then we can argue convincingly that the natural rate is lower,' one administration economist said. For Europe, there is much less certainty over where the natural rate lies, although most agree that it has risen substantially in the last decade. Nevertheless, it appears evident to US economists and policy-makers, though not to all of their European counterparts, that at least some of current unemployment in the European Union - perhaps 2 or 3 percentage points - is cyclical in nature, and that central banks could still do more to reduce unemployment by expanding demand.</p>

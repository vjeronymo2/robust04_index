			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M.K. Kaul] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The United Nations  International Drug Control Program Agency has recently disclosed  how the Pakistani drug lords were making fortunes through drug  exports. Its report titled The Illicit Opiate Industry in  Pakistan estimated that Pakistan's drug bosses earned roughly  $2.7 billion annually. And the export earnings which are half  this amount are as much as the country's legitimate commodity  export trade. [sentence as heard] Heroin production, goes on  the UN report, is most profitable in Pakistan with an  approximate turnover of $2.5 billion. It is a quarter of its  underground economy, the UN Drug Control Agency's deputy  director, (Alexander Seggar), is reported to have said in  Islamabad. He is cited to have said that domestic market itself  is very large, estimated to be a flourishing business of $1.2  billion.    Pakistan's most dreaded intelligence outfit, Inter Service  Intelligence, is known to push drug traffickers into Kashmir for  subversive activities after leading them up the garden path.  [sentence as heard] India lies in the middle of what is known  as the Golden Crescent, comprising Afghanistan, Iran and  Pakistan. From India, the drugs find their routes to the U.S.  and other Western countries and the enormous funds thus realized  come handy to finance terrorism in Kashmir. Just a few months  ago, the vigilant Indian security and paramilitary forces nabbed  subversives from across the border carrying huge quantities of  heroin and opium in the Jammu sector. The Border Security Force  authorities were surprised to find 13 kg of heroin and 11 kg of  opium in a single catch.    The politician-drug mafia nexus is an open secret in  Pakistan, a Central Intelligence Agency commission reports,  which gave out the details of drug bosses' connections with the  important politicians. [sentence as heard] The Pakistani  newspapers vied with each other in flashing the news about the  politician-drug lord nexuses. A crime boss of Lahore, who also  headed a drug syndicate, had close connection with the family of  a former prime minister as was traced by the U.S. intelligence  agency report. Though the family of the former prime minister  vociferously denied it, it did not carry much conviction even  with the people in Pakistan. Since the report was leaked just a  month ahead of the last Pakistani general election, it did its  damage to the former prime minister as his political outfit lost  rather cheaply in the poll.

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Australia confronts jobs crisis: Record unemployment is forcing a change in Labor government policy AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate rose to 11.1 per cent in June, the highest ever recorded by the government statistics bureau. The figure exceeds the most pessimistic market estimate and has forced a quick policy shift for the governing Labor party. Barely an hour after the figures were made public, a sombre Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, announced that the government would look at fiscal measures to help the unemployed get jobs. Over the past five years the government has focused its economic policy on keeping a tight rein on spending. It has dealt with the recession and unemployment largely through easing interest rates. Last Wednesday, the official interest rate was cut from 6.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent, the 13th cut since it peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990. But the government has now acknowledged that easing monetary policy has done little to stimulate the flagging economy. On Wednesday, Mr Dawkins urged Australians to spend the savings they would get from the interest rate cut. Economic pump priming was only tentatively embraced by the government earlier this year with an ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 890m) spending programme designed to create 800,000 jobs and reduce unemployment below 10 per cent by mid-1993 when it faces a general election. The full effect of the programme has yet to be seen but Mr Dawkins has foreshadowed huge spending measures in the 1992-93 budget to be introduced next month. He said yesterday the fiscal measures would be directed towards training, local infrastructure and help for industries in developing exports. There would also be special aid for regions with acute unemployment levels. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent in June represents 963,500 Australians unemployed. Worst affected were males between 15 and 19 years old, 31.8 per cent of whom were unemployed. Total male unemployment was 11.7 per cent. The climb in unemployment, which has been above the psychological barrier of 10 per cent for the past 10 months, had been helped along by severe job cuts in the services sector recently. While the manufacturing sector has been shedding jobs since the earlier days of the recession, some of the country's large banks, insurance companies, airlines and telecommunications companies have now started laying off workers in their tens of thousands. Big cuts have been announced by ANZ Bank, Qantas Airlines and the Australian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The effects of unemployment have also been felt in the government's budget for the last financial year. The preliminary deficit for 1991-92 was ADollars 9.4bn, double the initial estimate of ADollars 4.7bn. The government attributed the surge to the heavy fall in revenues caused by lower income and business tax revenues. On the other hand, the ADollars 1.2bn rise in outlays went mainly to higher social security payments. Now committed to kick-start the economy, the Labor government turns its back on the low deficit era it has carefully nursed. It also now faces the risk of losing the low inflation period which had given it the room to cut interest rates. The bad run of economic news this week has also prompted the government to revise down its growth target from 4.75 per cent to 3 per cent in 1992-93. The new gross domestic product target is in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast in May. The irony of the policy change is that Mr Paul Keating, a federal treasurer in the mid-1980s, led the country along the path of tight fiscal policy. Now as prime minister, he seems to accept that the policy has given him low inflation and manageable current accounts, but not necessarily a clear way out of the 'banana republic' economy he then warned about.</p>

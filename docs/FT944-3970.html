			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Will he, won't he?: If Jacques Delors decides to run in the French presidential election, he would start as favourite By his own account, Mr Jacques Delors has made his decision about whether to run as the socialist candidate for the French presidency. The outgoing president of the European Commission has promised to announce it to an expectant France some time before Christmas - perhaps as early as his prime-time interview on French television tomorrow. His countrymen, of all political persuasions, are on tenterhooks over his decision, which could determine the course of the election and possibly the country's political structure after the final presidential vote next May 7. If Mr Delors decides to run, he would start as favourite in the election. His candidacy would encourage the entry of another anti-European candidate from the right, and strengthen the claim of Mr Edouard Balladur, the gaullist prime minister, to be the standard-bearer of the governing coalition. Ironically, a decision by Mr Delors to stay out of the Elysee race could have even greater consequences by precipitating a political re-alignment on the French right. Mr Delors has acquired an extraordinary aura in his native France through his role in relaunching Europe over the past 10 years. He returns from Brussels to a country with a political system of weak parties and strong personal rivalries, which is currently deeply unsettled by corruption scandals at home, the pace of global economic change, and the growing insecurity on the European Union's borders. This is why Mr Delors continues to rise ever higher above his rivals in the opinion polls, even though it has been some time since he achieved anything markedly new in Brussels. An astonishing 69 per cent of respondents in a Louis Harris poll published this week said they 'would not exclude' voting for him, a far bigger catchment area than exists for his potential gaullist rivals, Mr Balladur or Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris. He also out-polls this pair in popularity among business leaders. Although business leaders might have been expected to be suspicious of Mr Delors' socialist ticket, they recognise that he presided over the creation of the single European market. If Mr Delors decides to run, it would make Europe the issue of the campaign. He would, inevitably, be the target for the slings and arrows of France's anti-Europeans. Mr Delors would do his best to avoid this, and the knowledge that he would fail could be the argument that tips the balance towards not running. But if he does run, he would draw in against him Mr Philippe de Villiers, the dissident conservative whose anti-Maastricht ticket scored well in last June's European Parliament elections. Equally certain is that ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whose chief remaining stock-in-trade is that he is more pro-European than the rest on the centre-right, would stay out. A Delors candidacy would frighten his two gaullist rivals, though the prime minister slightly less. The Balladur camp has been brandishing the threat of a Delors candidacy to promote their man as the only one capable of uniting centre and right to block this socialist menace. The prime minister has already marked his distance from Mr Delors by criticising Euro-federalism as outdated, and he would further sharpen this angle of attack. Mr Chirac would suffer worse from the candidacy of Mr Delors. No poll has ever shown the mayor of Paris beating the Commission president. If the dogged Mr Chirac were to drop out early, the Eurosceptic slot in the mainstream conservative spectrum might be filled by his ally, Mr Philippe Seguin, the anti-Maas-tricht president of the National Assembly. A long campaign would see Mr Delors' popularity fall from its present dizzy height. But he would almost certainly make it through the first round of voting on on April 23. If he won in the final two-man run-off on May 7, he would face a National Assembly in which the current RPR and UDF governing coalition holds 80 per cent of the seats. Unlike President Bill Clinton, who must live with a Republican-controlled Congress for the next two years, a President Delors would have the power to dissolve parliament. He would almost certainly use it to avoid cohabiting with a conservative government and parliament for three more years. Alternatively, he could try to prise France's pro-European centrists out of the current ruling coalition. But, if elections or alliances failed to give a President Delors a working majority, France would face a long impasse that might favour a fundamental revision of its quirky constitution. Some of those closest to Mr Delors are convinced he will decide not to run. This week he said he felt much better after making his 'entirely personal' decision. It would be entirely in tune with his contrarian temperament to be upbeat about a decision that he knows would be deeply unpopular. A No from Mr Delors would devastate the Socialist party, which has no other credible standard-bearer. Mr Michel Rocard was ousted as leader last June when he gained the party only 14.5 per cent of votes in the European Parliament elections. He will not return to the fray, even if the party wanted him. The man who replaced him as party leader, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, is too leftwing to appeal to voters in the centre. He is, in any case, due to stand trial in March for alleged illicit campaign funding. Mr Pierre Mauroy, mayor of Lille and President Mitterrand's first prime minister, is well-regarded in the party but not by the electorate at large. Mr Jack Lang, the flamboyant former education and culture minister, has ambitions, but no experience outside the ministerial portfolios he once held. Ironically, Mr Delors' own daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, who was the last Socialist labour minister, is perhaps the best of the younger crop of Socialists. However, her electoral hopes might suffer if there was a backlash among voters against her father's decision not to stand. The odds would be that no leftwinger would make it into the final run-off - for the first time since 1969. That would hand victory to a conservative - but probably at an awesome cost to the unity of the RPR gaullist party. Instead of attempting to kiss and make up after the first round vote, Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac would slug it out until the bitter end, possibly breaking up their RPR party in the process. In the past, Mr Balladur has publicly urged a merger of his own party with the centrist UDF federation to create a unified centre-right movement similar to those in the rest of Europe. He hates mention of this at the moment, because he knows it deeply disturbs the RPR. But if he were to win, he might well try to unite the pro-European part of the RPR with the UDF, leaving behind an anti-European gaullist rump probably led by Mr Seguin. Whichever way Mr Delors jumps, Europe looks like being the big issue in the French presidential campaign. It may prove the rock on which the French right breaks up, and re-forms itself.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> A BASIC ANSWER TO BASEBALL INJURIES;  </P> <P> HEALTH: SO-CALLED BREAKAWAY BASES WOULD PREVENT 1.7 MILLION INJURIES, SAVING $2  BILLION IN MEDICAL COSTS IF USED NATIONWIDE, A STUDY SAYS.  </P> <P> Baseball bases that move on impact would prevent 1.7 million injuries, saving  $2 billion in medical costs if used nationwide, a study has found.  </P> <P> The nonprofit Institute for Preventive Sports Medicine said the skyrocketing  growth of recreational sports has made amateur athletes' safety a major public  health goal.  </P> <P> "Recreational sports injuries are expensive to families, employers and the  entire community," said Dr. David Janda, director of the Ann Arbor institute.  </P> <P> So-called breakaway bases, attached to rubber grommets set in the ground,  release on impact, unlike conventional bases. A three-year study showed they  virtually eliminated the ankle, knee, leg, hand and wrist injuries caused when  softball players slide into bases anchored to the ground, the institute said.  </P> <P> Researchers initially compared injuries on fields at the University of  Michigan, some of which had stationary bases and some equipped with breakaway  bases, the health care organization said.  </P> <P> In more than 1,200 games, 45 players were injured sliding into stationary bases  but only two were hurt sliding into breakaway bases, Janda said.  </P> <P> The second phase of the study covered 1,035 games on fields using only  breakaway bases. Only two sliding-related injuries -- each an ankle sprain --  were reported, Janda said.  </P> <P> "Many communities and leagues, including minor-league baseball teams, have  begun to use breakaway bases and have reduced sliding injuries without  affecting the outcome of the game," Janda said.  </P> <P> The Detroit Tigers' London, Ontario, affiliate in the Double-A Eastern League  uses breakaway bases, and institute spokesman Gorden Blain said the entire  league might use them in 1991.  </P></p>

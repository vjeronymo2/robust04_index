			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (8): Lesson of the high capital ratio - Denmark: The banks DENMARK'S banking and other financial institutions are in a less worrying state than those in other Nordic countries. No leading banks have had to be rescued by the government, and the many smaller banks and savings banks which have found themselves in serious difficulties in the past few years have almost all been absorbed by larger colleagues without too much trouble. Nevertheless, the banks are not earning enough for their long-term health. The average return on equity was under 1 per cent and in both 1990 and 1991 loss provisions averaged about 2 per cent of loans and guarantees. Of the big four banks, which account for about 80 per cent of all bank business, the best performance was a 6.5 per cent pre-tax return on equity capital by the country's biggest bank, Den Danske Bank. The second-largest, the Unidanmark group, made a negative return of 9.6 per cent, while the Jutland-based Jyske Bank made a return of 0.8 per cent and Bikuben, flagship of the savings bank movement, reported a negative return of 0.04 per cent. It is generally accepted that the country has too many banks (with over 70 banks and almost twice as many savings banks), too many people working in them and too many branches. As the opportunities for stepping up earnings by widening interest margins and charging higher fees and commissions are limited, the way ahead lies through cutting costs and reducing personnel. The 1990 mergers, which turned the six largest banks into two super-banks, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark (the name of the group holding company: Unibank is the name of the bank), paved the way for rationalising the branch network. Danske is reducing the network from 750 to about 550-600, Unibank from 700 to 500. Both banks will have slimmed employment by 10 per cent by the end of this year as compared with the pre-merger levels. Danske, however, has recognised that the preliminary cost-cutting exercise was not sufficient. It announced last month that it would reduce staff by 20 per cent, from 15,000 to 12,000, over the next three years, setting the pace for the rest of the banks. The large insurance-based groups, Baltica, Hafnia and Topdanmark, are not performing well either, and this is not primarily a reflection of the results of the core insurance business. Shareholders are paying the price for adventurous managements, and criticism is rife of the failure of supervisory boards to keep a tighter rein on managements. Baltica and Topdanmark's managements were gripped in the mid-1980s by an urge to diversify their operations into banking, real estate agencies, vehicle rescue operations and even travel bureaux. None of these activities has been a success, and some have caused considerable losses while occupying valuable management resources. Hafnia has stuck more closely to the business with which it is familiar, but its earnings and financial position have been adversely affected by an unsuccessful attempt to gain control of Baltica by buying up a third of the equity and also by its heavy investment in Sweden's Skandia. The costs of these investments will be reflected in a substantial loss when the 1991 results are published. The investment in Baltica followed an attempt at an agreed merger between the two largest Danish insurers. It fell through because the two chief executives could not agree who should become top dog. 'In companies which are properly run, the chairmen of the supervisory boards would have arranged the merger first and dealt with the personality problems last, and would not have left the fate of the negotiations to the chief executives,' commented one of Denmark's most experienced bankers. The good news is that Denmark's bond-issuing mortgage credit institutions, which play a leading role on the financial scene, seem to have come through a troubled period, caused by falling property prices and new reserve and loss provision requirements, and can now look forward to quieter and more successful times. Both the largest institutions, Kreditforening Danmark and Nykredit, were back in profit in 1991. They expect to stay there. Danish bankers and officials have a number of explanations as to why the country's banks have survived the past few years with fewer troubles than their Nordic colleagues, even though the Danish recession, which began in 1986-87, was just as steep as in the other countries. Above all, the capitalisation ratio at Danish banks has always been high. The minimum legal capital ratio has been 7 per cent since the 1930s. The definition was even tougher than the figure suggests, as became apparent when the new BIS rules were applied to the Danish banks: the average capitalisation ratio under BIS rules turned out to be 13.6 per cent. It now averages 11.2 per cent and the legal minimum ratio is, for the time being, 10 per cent. For years, the banks complained that the capitalisation ratio placed them at a disadvantage internationally. 'But', said Mr Sten Rasborg, chief general manager of Unibank, 'We have subsequently had to thank Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the National Bank (central bank), for maintaining the high ratio.' Other factors which helped the Danish banks include the gradual liberalisation of the financial markets over a long period, starting in the early 1970s; an economic crisis in the early 1980s, including declining property prices, which gave the banks and the authorities valuable experience when they faced new problems in the late 1980s; and efficient supervisors with a long history of assessing the banks' big risks, which meant that the banks' asset quality was relatively sound. Times are still not easy, but the economy is staging a slow recovery and the banks generally expect to see bad loss provisions fall to more manageable proportions in 1992-93.</p>

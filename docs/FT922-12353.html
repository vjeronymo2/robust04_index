			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Pilot blamed for rig crash A HELICOPTER crash on a North Sea oil rig which killed six men in July 1990 was the pilot's fault, an inquiry report ruled yesterday. The helicopter hit a crane on the Shell oil installation Brent Spar and plunged into the sea killing the pilot, his co-pilot and four oilmen. Sheriff Douglas Risk said Captain David Anderton made his approach in such a way that the tail rotor was pointing towards the crane, which was out of his sight.</p>

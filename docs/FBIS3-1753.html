This was stressed by Wang Qun, secretary of the regional  party committee, during his recent inspection tour of Hulun Buir  League.    From 18 to 21 January, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional  party committee, and Zhou Weide, vice chairman of the region,  led responsible persons of departments concerned to make a  four-day inspection tour of Hulun Buir League. During the tour,  they inspected some shareholding cooperative enterprises and  township enterprises in Hailar city and Chen Barag Banner,  visited some households specializing in breeding milk cows and  some enterprises and households with difficulties, listened to  the reports on the situation of Manzhouli city and Ergun Banner  in foreign economic relations and trade, and had talks with  responsible comrades of Daxinganling Forestry Administration,  Yimin Coal and Electricity Corporation, Hailar Farm and Herd  Farm Administration, and Zalantun Pulp Mill. Comrade Wang Qun  spoke highly of the achievements scored by Hulun Buir League  Experimental Zone over the past six years and fully affirmed the  methods of Hailar city and Zalantun city in transforming the  operational mechanism of enterprises and invigorating the  management of enterprises.    On 19 January, Wang Qun, Zhou Weide, and other leading  comrades travelled, in spite of the piercing wind and the bitter  cold with a temperature of minus 30 degrees centigrade, to the  Tuanjie village in suburban Hailar city, where they visited  Zhang Shengxiang and Sha Yanju, who specialize in breeding milk  cows. Then, these leaders made a journey of more than 100 li to  Bayi gacha in Baorixile town in Chen Barag Banner to investigate  and learn about the situation of the village specializing in  breeding cattle. At the house of Zhang Shengxiang, a household  specializing in breeding milk cows, Comrade Wang Qun entered the  cow shed and the ensiling cellar and talked with Zhang  Shengxiang to learn about cow breeding and the management  situation. Comrade Wang Qun said to Zhang Shengxiang: You  should break with the traditional breeding methods left over by  our ancestors, engage in modernized and scientific breeding,  make more investment, seek high output, and increase economic  returns in order to take the lead in becoming prosperous. After  hearing the report on animal husbandry production of Chen Barag  Banner, Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play  to the advantages of animal husbandry, combine agriculture with  animal husbandry, combine the cropping trade with the breeding  trade, expand the scale, accelerate the growth of animals,  increase economic returns, and accelerate the development of the  commodity economy.    After hearing the reports on the opening up of border areas  and on the foreign economic relations and trade of Manzhouli  city and Ergun Banner, Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Border trade  is boundless and should develop in depth and toward a high  level. Border trade should aim at conducting economic and  technological cooperation to link itself with the international  market as quickly as possible. He said: We should pay attention  to studying the changes in the international market, gain the  initiative on the international market, and know how to deal  with changes in view of the objective situation. We should take  the road of integration, engage in import and development,  expand the scope of foreign economic relations and trade, and  extend ourselves to Northeast Asia in the east and to Western  Europe in the West. He demanded that Hulun Buir League should  record in 1994 a big breakthrough in developing foreign trade,  particularly in organizing economic and technological  cooperation, and should establish a number of economic  cooperation projects with foreign countries to bring along the  development of foreign economic relations and trade in the  entire region, border areas in particular.    In Zalantun city, Comrade Wang Qun talked with directors of  a  plywood plant, a starch plant, a pulp mill, and a silk factory.  Comrade Wang Qun stressed: To transform the mechanism of  enterprises and invigorate enterprises, the key lies in  leadership. Leaders should enhance their sense of reform and  understand that reform is the only way out and refusing to carry  out reform will inevitably lead to ruin. Leaders should  emancipate the mind to seek truth from facts and should rely on  the initiative of the vast numbers of workers and staff to seek  the operation and management methods that are commensurate with  the development of enterprises. At the same time, attention  should be paid to comprehensive coordination.    On the afternoon of 20 January, after hearing the work  reports by the party committee and the administrative office of  Hulun Buir League, Comrade Wang Qun emphatically dwelt on the  following five opinions. First, we should conscientiously  review and summarize the experiences gained by the Hulun Buir  League Experimental Zone over the past six years, affirm  achievements, find out where we lag behind, and continue to  pioneer the road of advance. He said: The Hulun Buir League  Experimental Zone has scored remarkable achievements in  construction and recorded quadrupling growth in many fields, and  the people there have really benefited and tempered from the  experiments with reform. The valuable experience of this  experimental zone is exactly the emancipation of mind and the  boldness in trying something new and going ahead. Whether we  can effect constant development depends chiefly on the  emancipation of mind and on the boldness in trying something  new. The achievements of the zone have been scored through the  emancipation of the mind and from the pioneering work. Second,  now we are confronted with the period of breaking a new path and  with the opportunity of rapid growth. We must seize this  opportunity to pioneer the road of advance and work hard in  unity to make the economic development of Hulun Buir League  march at the head of the entire region. Comrade Wang Qun  pointed out: Currently, we are confronted with many new  circumstances, new problems, and new difficulties. If we refuse  to make progress through hard work, we will lose the initiative  in breaking the new path. He said: Breaking the new path is  like a boat sailing against the current that must forge ahead,  or it will be driven back. It will not do to pace up and down  and to be muddled all day long. Hulun Buir League should seize  and cherish this opportunity to make best possible use of its  own advantages. Third, we should carry out reform and  experiments by leaps and bounds with a view to pressing forward  the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, foreign  economic relations and trade, township and town enterprises,  nonpublicly owned enterprises, and large and medium-sized  enterprises. Fourth, we should transfer part of the cadres of  party and government organizations who have good professional  quality and are good at management to the first lines of  production and construction to strengthen the capacity of first  lines, foreign economic relations and trade units, township  enterprises, and comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry  service trades so that they can keep pace with the development  of productive forces. Such cadres should not be left unused at  the organizations to waste their abilities. Such cadres should  be encouraged to become better-off first. At the same time, the  strengthening of the grass-roots units should be integrated with  organizational restructuring in order to actually streamline the  overstaffed organizations and help overcome bureaucratism and  improve work efficiency. Fifth, we should strengthen leadership  and combine political work with reform and opening up by  persisting in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and  being tough with both hands. We should strengthen the unity in  all fields, seek unity of thinking and action, and provide an  effective ideological and political guarantee for accelerating  reform and opening up.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo hits back at Washington the 'unfair trader' - Japan finds condemnation can create a useful stir among its trading partners AT LEAST one senior Japanese official welcomed Washington's anger at topping a new Japanese league table of unfair traders. The US scored more violations than Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries not generally cited as models of free trade. Having felt neglected by the international community, Tokyo has concluded that condemnation can create a useful stir among its trading partners, particularly the European Community and US. The release this week of a controversial report on Unfair Trade Policies should be taken as a promise of condemnation to come. The report, authorised by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), found that the US had abuses or misuses in nine of 10 trade categories surveyed. It was blasted by the Bush administration on the 'people who live in glass houses' principle and by US Congressman Richard Gephardt, who suggested that 'Japan doesn't have the credibility to call others unfair'. Conceding that Japan is deficient in various trade areas, indeed, that the country is a 'sinner', the government report, to be prepared annually, is intended to point the finger at Japan's major trading partners. In the past, a passive Japan hinted it would appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for a ruling on unilateral action taken against it by the US and EC, but Tokyo generally agreed to limit exports of cars, machine tools or textiles and complied with apparently dubious anti-dumping rulings. The 212-page Report on Unfair Trade Policies assesses the legal validity of such unilateral action, and finds, in most cases, that Japan has been sinned against. As such, the report is meant to be a warning that Japan will be less willing to accept voluntary restraint agreements and would be vindicated in any legal challenge against such agreements. But there are two sides to a voluntary restraint agreement, and Japanese companies and Miti have consistently buckled under US and EC pressure. A few days before the report was released, Japanese electronics companies agreed to provide confidential procurement information to help the politically-influential US semiconductor industry. Over the past year, Japan has assisted the US Eximbank in a co-operative financing programme that helps US companies win third-country projects, agreed to the introduction of a new five-year semiconductor pact, and set targets for purchases of US-made car parts. 'We do have our problems,' a Miti official said yesterday. 'But we think this report is important in establishing a legal framework for unfair policies. We are not really comparing the countries' performance because the report does not examine the degree of the problems in various countries.' Apart from finding that various US and EC actions are unlawful, the report emphasises that countries are hurting themselves by imposing restrictions on trade. But there is also a blunt recognition that trade friction is 'unavoidable'. 'Friction is a product of development, an unavoidable way-station on the road to further growth. Yet this is a difficult fact to grasp, perhaps because trade friction is simply one kind of economic growing pain, and growing pains are not easily recognised as such by those experiencing growth,' the report concluded. But the report implicitly shows that those growing pains are unusually concentrated in the US-Japan region: 'With the one exception of trade-related investment measures, the US employs unfair policies and measures in nine areas out of 10 cited in this report.' Those unfair policies include alleged quantitative restrictions on trade, discrimination against foreign products in government procurement, unilateral action against trading partners, arbitrary application of anti-dumping measures, arbitrary changes in tariff classification, and deficiencies in protecting intellectual property. Trade negotiators in Washington were no doubt bemused to find government procurement and intellectual property on the offence list, as these are two areas in which the US claims Japan is deficient and which have been the subject of constant negotiation in recent years. The EC also scored six violation points out of a possible 10, having allegedly failed on quantitative restrictions, government procurement, anti-dumping, arbitrary application of country of origin rules, tariff changes, and restrictions on trade in services. Italy receives particular attention for its tough restrictions on Japanese car exports, while France is cited for demanding that 40 per cent of films broadcast be French, a rule that invites another unusual if mild warning about European cultural development. 'These restrictive measures, ostensibly designed to preserve European culture, are claimed to be politically unavoidable. These provisions, however, have also been criticised as suppressing the dynamic development of European culture,' the report says. The Japanese government is determined to be more controversial, if gently so on the issue of culture. But the Tokyo now fond of sending toughly-worded letters to Brussels and Washington is yet to match these words with action on rice market liberalisation or on making transparent some of its own procurement practices.  --------------------------------------------------------          ANTIDUMPING DUTIES ON JAPANESE PRODUCTS                   1970 to end-March 1992  --------------------------------------------------------          Total   Duties    Duties     More    5-10  Less          cases   lifted   in effect  then 10       than 5  -------------------------------------------------------- US        64       13        51        19      9     23 EC        30       12        18         0      7     11 Canada    25       18         7         1      4      2  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Miti  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

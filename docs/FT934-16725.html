			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No theatres victim of review Sir, I enjoyed Antony Thorncroft and Richard Fairman's assessment of the future of London's orchestras ('The men of violins fight for the loot', September 25). On the whole the piece was incisive and well researched. However on the subject of theatre funding your correspondents were less accurate. To set the record straight, the Arts Council has never announced that a number of theatres would have their grants withdrawn as a result of the artistic review. This supposition was merely speculation which gained credence through inaccurate reporting. Your correspondents are correct, however, to identify the enormous public support for the arts in the UK which was prompted by this speculation - support which, I hope, will remain with the Arts Council as we and our colleagues in the arts fight against the proposed Pounds 5m cut by government which may well result in irreparable damage to those very theatres and arts organisations which are so vital to our cultural life in Britain. Anthony Everitt, secretary-general, The Arts Council of Great Britain, 14 Great Peter Street, London SW1P 3NQ</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / President plunges into sell-off debate: Christopher Bobinski and Anthony Robinson assess Poland's privatisation difficulties PRESIDENT Lech Walesa has re-emerged as a protagonist in the Polish privatisation debate, raising the political stakes in the latest attempt by the coalition government to gain parliamentary backing for its modified mass-privatisation plan. Changes were made to the government's long-delayed plan by Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister, after former communists and rebels from the right-wing christian national party had rejected the government's original bill on March 18. The contested aspects of the original plan included the role of foreign managers in the proposed investment funds which would handle the portfolios of privatised companies, and a demand for the free distribution of funds to pensioners and civil servants in lieu of higher salaries blocked in 1991. The former communist SLD party also argued that the privatisation scheme should be treated as an experiment and brought in step-by-step, after the management skills of the foreign-managed investment funds set up by the scheme had been tested. The government has responded by proposing that the shares of the first 200 companies be placed in a separate fund to be distributed free to pensioners and state employees. But the government decided not to give in to the anti-foreign investment manager sentiments of right-wing opponents, which include a handful of rebels from the National Christian Union (ZChN) who voted against the government of which they are coalition members. The liberal democratic congress, Mr Lewandowski's own party, has threatened to leave the government if the revised plan fails to win a parliamentary majority. This effectively turns today's expected parliamentary vote into one of confidence in the government. A government defeat could have led either to early elections, unwanted by most parties, or a reshuffle of the government coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. The potential for a period of political instability, triggered by the privatisation issue, has been increased by President Lech Walesa's decision to put forward his own privatisation proposal. He remains dogged by his 1991 pre-election pledge that privatisation would leave Poles 100m zlotys (Dollars 10,000) richer. The president re-entered the fray last week. He gave his blessing to a new political movement, the so-called non-party forum for reform. This is linked to the siec (network), which is based on 260 Solidarity organisations in the country's big factories and is widely perceived as a political platform for Mr Walesa himself. The meeting which set up the forum at Zdzieszowice, a coke works near Gorazdze, called on the government to drop a mass-privatisation programme 'which treats workers as objects'. In its place, the meeting suggested, Poles should be granted low-interest investment vouchers worth up to 300m zlotys. The vouchers could only be used to buy state property and would be essentially loans which would have to be repaid within 20 years. Mr Walesa told Mr Lewandowski that he saw the investment grant idea as complementary to the mass-privatisation scheme. But the privatisation ministry fears that launch of the alternative plan now could erode the government's majority in the vote on the scheme.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: State shake-up produces turnround at Nordbanken NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, showed the benefits of financial restructuring and lower interest rates yesterday when it disclosed a SKr2.5bn (Dollars 305.6m) profit for the first nine months. The result is a dramatic turnround on the SKr10.1bn loss recorded in the same 1992 period, when it was burdened by huge credit losses linked mainly to the collapsing real estate market. The improvement makes Nordbanken Sweden's most successful bank in terms of operating profit. It is bound to add to concern that the bank, the biggest casualty of the country's financial sector crisis, has received too much assistance from the state. It is expecting a full-year surplus of at least SKr3.2bn, compared with the record SKr16bn deficit it incurred in 1992. The performance should assist the government's plans to return the bank to the private sector as soon as possible. The bank's rapid return to profit is attributed to the hiving off of SKr67bn of problem loans into a 'bad bank' entity called Securum at the start of the year. However it has also benefited from cost-cutting and substantial capital gains on its bond portfolio in a lower interest rate environment. Loan losses shrank to SKr3.4bn in the January-September period from SKr12.3bn last time. Non-performing loans at SKr11.7bn are still SKr600m higher than at the year end, if Securum is excluded. Total operating income rose to SKr10.8bn from SKr7.1bn. This was after net interest income climbed to SKr6.8bn from SKr5.2bn, and bond portfolio gains saw 'other income' rise to nearly SKr2bn from SKr473m. A 1 per cent fall in costs, to SKr4.9bn, left the group with a profit before loan losses of SKr5.9bn, compared with SKr2.2bn in 1992. The bank said loan demand from companies and households remained weak. Its share for loans to companies has fallen to less than 16 per cent from more than 19 per cent following the sale of Securum. However its share of consumer lending has risen slightly to exceed 11 per cent. A SKr1.3bn perpetual debentures issue helped raise the bank's capital adequacy ratio to 10.4 per cent at the end of September, from 8.9 per cent at the year end. Nordbanken expects final-quarter operating profits to be at least as large as the SKr743m achieved in the third quarter. Mr Hans Dalborg, chief executive, said: 'The trend towards lower interest rates has been beneficial to the bank's borrowers as well as to the bank's earning capacity. It creates prerequisites for a continued stabilisation of market conditions.' Nordbanken is one of four candidates in final round of bidding for Gota Bank, which also collapsed into the arms of the state last year. 'Gota and Nordbanken have similar business strategies and would complement each other if they merged,' it said.</p>

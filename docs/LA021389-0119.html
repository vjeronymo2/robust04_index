			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 5 CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS CONFER;  </P> <P> SUMMIT STARTS WITH HOPE FOR PEACE, DEMOCRACY, PROGRESS  </P> <P> Five Central American presidents began a summit today with predictions that  their two-day meeting will contribute to peace, democracy and progress in the  troubled region.  </P> <P> The leaders appeared buoyed by the mere fact of being under the same roof after  six months of postponements, delay and dispute over the summit's prospects,  agenda and date.  </P> <P> "I am sure that we, with optimism, will analyze efforts we've made . . . and  search for favorable solutions that will promote peace and progress in Central  America," said Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte in brief comments  inaugurating the meeting.  </P> <P> He was flanked by Presidents Jose Azcona Hoya of Honduras, Daniel Ortega of  Nicaragua, Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica and Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of  Guatemala.  </P> <P> All except Ortega, who wore his green Sandinista army uniform, wore casual  attire fitting the climate and ambiance at this seaside resort complex 40 miles  southeast of San Salvador.  </P> <P> After Duarte's statement, the presidents began work in a closed session.  </P> <P> The chief executives will analyze the successes and failures to date of the  Esquipulas II peace plan, signed by the same five men in Guatemala on Aug. 7,  1987. The plan, also known as the Arias plan for its principal architect, was  designed to promote peace and democracy.  </P> <P> Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for the plan, said upon arrival that  the meeting will "re-establish our credibility with the Central American people  and the entire world.... Our peoples are tired. Without peace there is no  possibility of improving conditions of life for Central Americans. This is a  historic responsibility that we the five presidents have."  </P> <P> A decade of civil conflicts and economic depression has transformed the  once-promising region of 25 million inhabitants into one of the world's most  turbulent zones.  </P> <P> An estimated 160,000 people have been killed in the region's wars in the last  decade. Most Central Americans live in extreme poverty.  </P></p>

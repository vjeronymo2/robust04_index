			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 14, BNS -- The Lithuanian Foreign  Ministry confirmed reports that Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys  intends to go to Warsaw Friday [18 March] to initial the  Lithuanian-Polish agreement on friendship and cooperation.    The treaty will presumably be signed by the presidents of  Lithuania and Poland already this spring. The accord will come  into effect after it is ratified by the Lithuanian parliament  and when the sides exchange ratification documents.    Lithuanian and Polish experts last week completed editing  the  text of the treaty.    At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Gylys said the text  of the treaty will be publicly announced in accordance with "the  established order."    The minister admitted that Lithuania and Poland failed to  fully coordinate their positions on the 1920 occupation of  Vilnius and its region by Poland. But Gylys said an emphasis  should be laid on the future, not on the past. "The past is too  heavy a burden."    "Many wounds, as well as reasons to start polemics or even  conflicts, remained in the postwar Europe, but European states  rose above all this and chose integration," the minister said.  In his words, "if we will base relations with neighbors on  wrongs, we will become a zone of tension."    Minister Gylys emphasized the need to have "a strong  political basis" for solutions to practical problems. In his  opinion, the treaty will become such a basis.    Commenting on criticism that the accord does not include  sufficient security guarantees for Lithuania, Gylys said the  treaty clearly says that neither of the states have any  territorial claims and consider present borders inviolable.    The treaty was sharply criticized by MP Romualdas Ozolas,  head of the parliament's commission for regional affairs. The  lawmaker also made some sharp remarks about the Polish  ambassador to Lithuania.    Minister Gylys said such statements "practically insult  nations and diplomats accredited in our country." The minister  said he was surprised that Ozolas, who is the chairman of the  Lithuanian Center Union, expresses such "eccentric" views.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Italy in talks to buy fighter jets: Rome sees threat from Serbia ITALY is seeking to strengthen its air force, so as to offset a potential threat from Serbia, by buying or leasing fighters from its Nato allies. The Italian defence ministry has confirmed that discussions have begun with the US and British governments for the quick supply of at least 50 aircraft. The Italian air force is examining the suitability of either the General Dynamics F-16 or the interceptor version of the Tornado multi-role combat aircraft, in part produced by the Italian defence industry. This is the first such deal to be considered in recent years for a Nato air force. No price tag has been put on either purchase or leasing since the aircraft under discussion are already in the US and UK air force stock. There has been unofficial talk of a minimum value of L3,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The Italian government has become increasingly concerned in recent weeks over the belligerent tone of statements from Serb nationalists and military commanders. Italy feels vulnerable to the threat posed by the more advanced Russian aircraft of the Serbian (ex-Yugoslav) air force. Italy is not directly involved on the ground in former Yugoslavia but has allowed France, the Netherlands and the US air forces to use its bases to monitor the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Italy's front-line fighters are the ageing and dangerous F-104 Starfighters. Of 180 in the inventory only about 100 are serviceable and even fewer are fully operational. Two were lost on one day last month. The prospect of a sale or lease was broached with Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, when he visited Italy this week.</p>

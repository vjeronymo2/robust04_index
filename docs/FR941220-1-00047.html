			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is estimated that approximately 1.2 million people will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced exposure to sulfates as a result of PWSs' compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate MCL. The low and high estimates of reduced population exposure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on uncertainty in occurrence data, are 0.9 million and 1.7 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluating benefits is limited to estimating reduced population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure because there are inadequate dose-response data to estimate cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adverse health effects avoided. Consequently, potential benefits per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of diarrhea avoided are estimated rather than total benefits. Exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population is usually calculated by multiplying the number of systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failing the MCL by the average population served by each system. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different approach was used for sulfate, since only unacclimated persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and infants are affected. The affected population is in areas served by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems with sulfate levels of 500 mg/L or more, and includes resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants under one year of age, travellers, including infants, of all ages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visiting the area, new residents and houseguests that stay with residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Infants were assumed to accompany parents on pleasure trips but not on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business trips. Sources of population data were the National Travel Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center and the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Reports and fertility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistics. The Agency used the 1991 census data for the number of infants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> born in a year. The number of persons exposed is calculated by multiplying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability that the average traveler will visit a system with elevated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate levels. The Agency used the National Travel Data Center estimate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> travelers. The number of diarrhea cases avoided is based on the estimate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person-trips because each un-acclimatized individual is assumed to face  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple exposures to sulfate and potentially contract diarrhea more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once a year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This estimate of people exposed has uncertainty based on two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variables: the number of systems with elevated sulfate levels, and the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to model the traveling population. The best estimate of the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> travellers and resident infants with reduced exposure to sulfate at an MCL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 500 mg/L is 1.2 million people (including 27,000 infants). A logistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response function was used to characterize the statistical relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between sulfate levels in drinking water and the probability of an exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual experiencing a laxative effect. One weakness of this approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is that it assumes that consumption of either sodium sulfate or magnesium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate results in equivalent laxative effects. It has been reported that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnesium sulfate is a better purgative than sodium sulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uncertainty is also associated with the lack of toxicological data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the relationship between various sulfate levels and the resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laxative effect. There are insufficient data to plot a dose-response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function. As a result, the Agency is limiting its estimate of benefits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assumptions made in estimating benefits on a case by case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis are shown in Table 10. The value of an outpatient case in Table 10 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between $218&hyph;$273. For example, the value of a case of diarrhea in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident infant who is not hospitalized would be $55+$11 for the doctor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and medication, plus 8 hours of the care giver's time ($19&times;8=$152),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since it is assumed the caretaker would miss work. The total value for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case is $66+$152=$218. An additional $55 would be added in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a traveling infant for hotel and travel expenses lost. The range accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the difference between residents and travelers. The infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitalization cases cost between $3,608 and $3,828 per case. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is requesting comment on the assumptions used in the analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

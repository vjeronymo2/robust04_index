			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rover set to make profit after two years of losses - British Aerospace interim results ROVER Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, would be in profit for the full year in 1993 after two years of losses, Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman and BAe deputy chief executive said yesterday. In the first six months, Rover cut operating loss before interest from Pounds 31m to Pounds 19m. The loss included redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds 22m. Excluding the one-off rationalisation charge, Rover's trading performance in the first half improved by Pounds 34m and resulted in a small profit of Pounds 3m. Rover expected 'a significant recovery' in its financial performance in the second half of the year, said Mr Simpson. Production, which fell by 6.4 per cent to 200,872 in the first half under the impact of significant stock reductions, was expected to rise in the second half of the year. At the same time, the benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling, which were delayed by currency hedging arrangements, would be fully reflected in the second half. The UK car maker's first half performance was impaired by launch costs of around Pounds 10m for the new Rover 600 executive car, which was introduced in April. In the second half, Rover would benefit from strong UK sales in August, when its registrations grew by 23.7 per cent in an overall market, which rose by 17.8 per cent. Rover turnover rose by 20.1 per cent in the first half to Pounds 1.98bn (Pounds 1.65bn). The group has increased its market share in the UK in the first eight months of the year to 13 per cent from 12.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year, and profitability is being helped by an improving 'model mix' with an increasing proportion of sales coming from its larger Rover cars and four-wheel drive Land Rover vehicles. Rover is also performing strongly in continental European markets, albeit from a small base, despite the steep decline in overall European new car sales. In the first six months, Rover and Land Rover worldwide vehicle sales increased by 13 per cent to 202,100. UK sales rose by 14 per cent to 119,700, while sales in continental Europe rose by 5 per cent to 65,500. Total sales outside the UK gained 12 per cent to 82,400. Rover eliminated 1,740 UK jobs in the period with a reduction in the workforce to 31,398 at the end of June. The UK workforce has been cut sharply from 40,500 at the end of 1990. Land Rover however, added 300 jobs during the summer in order to increase output of its successful Discovery range, and Mr Simpson ruled out further job cuts in the second half of the year.</p>

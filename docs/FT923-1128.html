			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): Choice not so simple - Just-in-time stock control JUST-IN-TIME is Japanese, and its greatest attribute is its simplicity. Computer-integrated manufacturing is American in origin, and its curse is its complexity. And, as we all know who has been winning at manufacturing, let's dump the computers and go for just-in-time, right? If only the choice facing manufacturers were so simple, writes Colin Mcilwain. The just-in-time (JIT) philosophy has gained widespread credence in Europe over the past five years. But its emulation has often involved the intensive use of computers - in stark contrast with its original form in Japan, where JIT normally comprised an entirely manual set of techniques for optimising factory efficiency. Only now are some leading Japanese manufacturers resorting to intensive computerisation to manage the flow of work through their factories. Mr Ernie Stene is an industry specialist at IBM's manufacturing centre at Warwick. Not surprisingly, he takes issue with the view that Japanese manufacturers have benefited from their cautious approach to computerisation. The traditional Japanese JIT approach, based on so-called Kanban squares painted on the factory floor, has its limitations, Mr Stene says. 'The principle was wonderful, but the implementation of simple Kanban neglected the need for engineering change. So we put in electronic Kanban, which was still based on an MRP schedule.' MRP is the linchpin of most computerised production control systems used in Europe and North America. 'There's been a lot of mouth-music in this country about JIT, but not so much of it actually being applied,' he adds. This impression of more words than action is reinforced by Dr Dominic McKay, managing director of Fort Glasgow-based electronics fabricator Kinloch Electronics. 'My feeling is there is good deal more talk than there is implementation,' he says. Kinloch uses MRP to schedule work in its own factory, and electronic data interchange (EDI) to exchange information with its bigger customers. This would not be the case at a similar plant in Japan. 'Many of them produce only one product,' Dr McKay says. 'We have 500 different assemblies active at any one time.' As managing director of the Rover division of Redditch-based software house AT&amp;T Istel, Mr Cliff Shuker is responsible for implementing computer-based solutions to manufacturing problems at the car group, which has embraced JIT, especially in its relations with suppliers. 'Just-in-time in the west requires greater use of computer technology, because manufacturing is less predictable,' says Mr Shuker. 'In Japan, you don't see much evidence of computerisation or barcoding on the shop floor: if you ask them why they are building something, they'll say: 'That's the plan'.' The location of suppliers is an issue too, according to Mr Shuker. 'In Japan, they tend to be clustered around the car plant. In the UK, just-in-time deliveries may come via a warehouse close to the point of consumption. So the supply pipeline is more complex.' In the motor industry, not only are parts delivered on a just-in-time basis, but they are often automatically paid for without recourse to invoicing. 'Rigorous, computer-controlled just-in-time brings with it the confidence to self-bill,' says Mr Shuker.</p>

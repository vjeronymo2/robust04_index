			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W leads way in China drive Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, will today announce a telecoms development project in China which may mark a watershed in the opening of the market to foreign telecoms operators. The deal will involve Hongkong Telecom, of which C&amp;W owns a majority stake, in a joint venture with Chinese partners to expand telecoms services. Until now, China has maintained a state monopoly over telecoms services, although western equipment suppliers have long been established there. A leading Hong Kong analyst said the agreement would involve either a substantial loan from HongKong Telecom tied to an operating agreement, or a leasing arrangement, either of which might in time be convertible into equity. 'This is a watershed, which could lead within months to a far wider opening up of the Chinese telecoms to overseas operators,' he said. The agreement follows months of contacts between C&amp;W and China's ministry of posts and telecommunications and the Chinese government, during which the ministry nominated C&amp;W as its 'preferred partner' for future operations. China has ambitious plans to increase its number of phone lines from about 30m to at least 110m within the next decade. But state operators are believed to be finding it increasingly difficult to secure supplier finance for telecoms expansion, which has obliged them to move faster than expected on joint ventures with network operators.</p>

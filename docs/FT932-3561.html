			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / ICL faces action by ex-manager A FORMER ICL manager, linked to an investigation into alleged irregularities involving contracts placed with the company by the Ministry of Defence, said he was seeking legal aid to seek compensation in the civil courts for an alleged persecution campaign. He said he also wanted to sue his former employer, an ICL subsidiary, for wrongful dismissal and commission which he claims is owing. Ministry of Defence police raided ICL's offices in Slough, Stevenage and Basingstoke on Friday and removed documents. A ministry spokeswoman said she could not indicate when the results of the investigation would be made public. Mr Richard Livesey-Haworth, ICL's group executive director, said he was 'incredulous' at the suggestion that ICL, the UK company owned by the Japanese company Fujitsu, would persecute a former employee. He also said that the ICL main board would have had no detailed knowledge of the contracts in question. Contracts of the size under investigation would be solely a matter for the subsidiary concerned and would never come before the executive board. Only two individual contracts had been discussed by the board in recent years, each of them multi-million pound deals. Mr David May, formerly an MoD account manager for the ICL division ICTS, now a wholly owned subsidiary named Workplace Technologies, said he was made redundant after warning senior managers that the company would make excessive profits on certain contracts. He told the FT yesterday that he had not spoken to the ICL board. He also said yesterday that he had subsequently made these allegations to MoD police. Mr May worked for the subsidiary between 1990 and 1992. It supplies cabling and office services to customers including the ministry, whose account Mr May handled. Mr May said he took his story to The Sunday Times, which contacted the ministry. Mr Livesey-Haworth said yesterday that as the ministry had made no formal allegations of wrongdoing it was impossible to comment on Mr May's claims. In his opinion, however, the investigation had been instigated by 'a disgruntled ex-employee'. ICL would continue to co-operate fully with the investigation. ICL was, however, talking to its lawyers and would take action to protect itself against libel and slander, he added.</p>

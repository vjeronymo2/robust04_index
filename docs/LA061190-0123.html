			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: MAGIC MAY HAVE AIDED CUP VICTOR  </P> <P> Cameroon owes its World Cup success to physical prowess, but team doctor Pierre  Tsala Mbala says witch doctors and sorcerers may give the players a  psychological edge.  </P> <P> Witchcraft plays a major role in African soccer, even though officials have  tried in recent years to discourage ties between players and purveyors of  "traditional medicine."  </P> <P> Tsala Mbala said witch doctors are prohibited from physically treating members  of the Cameroon team, which shocked defending champion Argentina 1-0 in  Friday's opening match.  </P> <P> But the professor of human physiology said there is nothing wrong with players  seeking advice, predictions or good-luck charms from witch doctors.  </P> <P> "You cannot explain victories by magic," said Tsala Mbala, a specialist in  sports medicine. "But the magic is a little something extra for the players  psychologically."  </P></p>

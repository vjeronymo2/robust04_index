			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cezary Gmyz: "Fight Over MSZ Continues; Social </F> Origins Obstacle to Polish Diplomatic Jobs"]    [Text] A report issued by a subcommittee evaluating  personnel in the Foreign Affairs Ministry [MSZ], which was  obtained by ZYCIE WARSZAWY and a team from the "Pulse of the  Day" television program, accuses MSZ employees of being of  aristocratic or Jewish origin. The government failed yesterday  to adopt a new MSZ statute that would separate politicians from  clerks.    Incompetence, failure to take foreign language tests,  insufficient work experience in the diplomatic service, foreign  citizenship, social origins associated with landed aristocracy,  "Solidarity," Judaism, and having worked for "Radio Free  Europe"--these were accusations levied by the subcommittee  evaluating MSZ personnel against employees who accepted  diplomatic jobs after 1989.    The subcommittee's report, which will be presented at a  session of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission today, consists  of two parts.    The first part, which was written by the subcommittee's  members, speaks of the origins of the subcommittee, lists  certain criteria that diplomats should meet, and also lists  accusations concerning MSZ's personnel policies. The authors of  the report write that cases of employees being released from  duty after 1989 "bring to the surface the issue of  constitutional responsibility by the former and current foreign  affairs minister."    Another part of the report, the so-called supplement,  contains 11 appendixes that, according to the subcommittee's  members, were written by former and current MSZ employees, as  well as by people from outside the MSZ. Only two of the  appendixes, pertaining to several cats that were kept by one  ambassador in his residence, are signed.    The appendixes, which in effect amount to denunciations,  contain an assessment of the MSZ's personnel policies and of  foreign policy in general. The arguments that were listed most  often concern membership in a social group, having been abroad  before 1989, or being married to a foreigner. One of the  authors of the treaty with Lithuania is being reminded that his  father was a Stalinist diplomat, but the fact that the  individual himself is an outstanding historian and a former  member of the democratic opposition is not mentioned. Another  diplomat is said to allegedly be implementing the Vatican's  plans in the East because he worked for Vatican Radio in the  past. In one of the appendixes, the dissolution of Comecon and  the Warsaw Pact is regarded as a misfortune for Poland.    Because of suspicion that the appendixes contain slanders,  Professor Bronislaw Geremek, chief of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, refused to distribute the report's appendix to Sejm  deputies. "The appendix is an integral part of the  subcommittee's report," said Tadeusz Samborski, a member of the  subcommittee. "Professor Geremek's decision is unacceptable."    Aside from the coalition members, the document was signed by  Wojciech Lamentowicz, of the Union of Labor, and Andrzej  Micewski.</p>

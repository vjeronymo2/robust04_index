			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Raphael's women, work and legacy / Review of the exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland The women Raphael painted, it was observed long ago, were either his mistress or mother. On a casual look it is the Virgin Mary, image of ideal motherhood, who dominates Raphael: The Pursuit of Perfection at the National Gallery of Scotland. This scholarly yet accessible exhibition explores Raphael's creative process through paintings and drawings. It also shows how fully he lived up to the moral ideal for a Renaissance painter of passing on knowledge and skill to younger men. What is by Raphael, and what by Gianfrancesco Penni, Giulio Romano, or 'the workshop'? Numerous works in the exhibition raise these questions, especially the later drawings of figures in the Loggia di Psyche in the Villa Farnesina. Here, among the nude studies, may well be Raphael's mistress, if the story is true that the only way he could be kept on the job was if his mistress stayed. But are the drawings by her admiring lover, or by assistants eagerly copying their master's wonderful way with the female form? At the heart of the exhibition are the three Madonnas on loan from the Duke of Sutherland: the 'Holy Family with a Palm Tree'; the 'Bridgewater Madonna'; and the 'Madonna of the Passeggio'. All the preparatory drawings have been brought together from collections across Europe. Also on show is the 'Madonna of the Pinks', the Duke of Northumberland's little masterpiece which has only recently recovered art-historical respectability as being truly by Raphael. The Sutherland Raphaels are newly cleaned and conserved. The scientists' scrutiny has unearthed curious things. It seems clear that Raphael had no direct hand in the 'Madonna of the Passeggio', long suspected as being by a talented assistant, perhaps Penni. The composition is anyway less attractive than the other three Raphaels; St Joseph looks strangely farouche, staring back from behind a bush at his wife and child who are being humbly greeted by little St John the Baptist. There is no discomfort in knowing that the Virgin of the lovely 'Bridgewater Madonna' was at first placed in a flowery meadow, until Raphael enclosed her in a room without a view. However, it can be distinctly unsettling to discover things which an artist never meant us to know. A case in point is 'Holy Family with the Palm Tree'. In this lovely tondo St Joseph gives Jesus a handful of flowers, watched intently by Mary who so often has eyes only for her baby. This St Joseph looks younger than normal, thanks to his thick grey curls. The X-ray suggests that he was originally bald and that the top-knot was added later - presumably by Raphael. But why did he add it, and to please whom? This trichological riddle detracts from enjoyment of the picture and is one insight into Raphael's creative process I could have done without. Among the unexpected things in the exhibition is 'Mercury Bearing Psyche to Olympus', an air-borne confection of figures from the Loggia di Psyche by Rubens from the Duke of Sutherland's private collection. And how lovely to find again an enchanting drawing from Chatsworth, recently shown in London. It shows an ordinary mother holding a fidgety child firmly around the middle while she reads aloud. It was a boldly unconventional move to use late copies to flesh out Raphael's oeuvre. They hang in an anteroom, homage from an age when Raphael was often talked about as quasi-divine. The copy of the Madrid 'Madonna of the Fish' is by an restorer called Bonnemaison, alleged by Jacques Louis David to have scrubbed Raphael altarpieces with turpentine. Anyone who regrets the modern cleaning of the 'Transfiguration' can compare it with the sombre hues faithfully rendered in the 1820s by one Grigor Urquhart of Inverness. Inevitably, the exhibition conjures up the spectre of absence. Since 1946, the three Raphaels have been in the gallery as part of the Ellesmere, now Sutherland, loan. The Sixth Duke is now 79; to lose the loan would be a devastating blow to the NGS and, if it went overseas, to Britain's national heritage. The Sutherland pictures are exempt from inheritance tax while they are on public view. A private treaty sale would therefore avoid the demand for payment of inheritance tax exempted in the past. If this were allowed to happen, with an annual acquisition budget of only Pounds 1.2m the NGS would be in a hopeless position to secure the paintings. The Raphael exhibition highlights the uncertainty hanging over the residue of one of the greatest private art collections ever formed in Britain. As early as 1806, an ancestor of the present duke allowed the public to visit the huge collection at his London residence on St James's Square. For close on two centuries, then, these great paintings have been in the public eye, giving untold pleasure. Who can predict whether the same will be true a century from now?

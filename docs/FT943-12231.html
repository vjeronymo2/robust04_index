			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Siemens slips to DM1.2bn despite improved demand Foreign demand is continuing to fuel growth at Siemens, and there are signs that domestic orders are also improving, the German electrical and electronics group said yesterday. Total order intake in the nine months to the end of June increased 8 per cent to DM65bn (Dollars 41.6bn). Turnover rose 3 per cent to DM57.7bn, but net profits fell 6 per cent to DM1.25bn, according to an interim report. The deterioration in earnings, following an unchanged result after six months, was foreshadowed recently by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, group chairman, who said prices in some sectors had fallen 10 per cent or more. Investment income is also suffering in turbulent capital markets. The export order book was up 18 per cent at DM39.4bn, while domestic demand fell 5 per cent to DM25.3bn, after being 6 per cent down at the halfway mark, the report said. Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the troubled computer subsidiary, also benefited from a strong order flow in the third quarter. After a 6 per cent fall in the first six months of the current year, SNI's order book was down only 2 per cent at the end of the quarter. Sales were 4 per cent lower at DM8bn. The semiconductors division, recently reported to be in profit for the first time in a decade, lifted sales and order bookings by 47 per cent and 37 per cent respectively in the review period. However, public telecommunications orders were 4 per cent lower, and turnover was down 9 per cent. Traditionally the group's biggest source of turnover, the sector is still showing the affects of reduced German public sector spending. Power plant, the second-most important division, received a boost in the third quarter from orders from Taiwan and the UK. At the end of the review period, orders were 28 per cent higher than a year earlier, although turnover was 8 per cent lower. Yesterday's report gave no full-year forecasts, although group executives recently repeated earlier predictions of a 10-15 per cent drop in operating earnings for the full year, attributable to a weaker result from financial operations. Net income, bolstered by the sale of Siemens' pacemaker operations to a US concern, is expected to fall slightly short of last year's DM1.98bn. This year's planned payroll reduction of 20,000 jobs is proceeding according to plan. After adjustments for the first-time consolidation of the Sylvania lighting business in the US, numbers employed fell 6,000 in the third quarter. Some 4,000 of these job cuts were in Germany.</p>

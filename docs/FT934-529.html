			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A few stars in the east The cry of pain and hurt pride echoing from the Russian elections and the continuing conflict in Bosnia are reminders of the wrenching nature of the changes which have accompanied the end of the cold war. But four years after the summary execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator, which marked the bloody end of an extraordinary year, the overall balance sheet remains positive, by a large margin. Even the strong electoral showing of Vladimir Zhirinovsky should be seen in context. The Russian people, in all their diversity, were given their first opportunity to express themselves freely in a multi-party, multi-candidate election. The fact that so many expressed anger and frustration after a 75-year totalitarian nightmare and eight years of painful and disorientating disruption, without any relief in sight, is hardly surprising. The important thing is that Russians, for the first time, now have a legal, constitutional and peaceful way of expressing their views. This is a step forward of incalculable importance for a country where so often in the past repressed popular discontent has found violent issue through the pogrom and the blind savagery of the mob. That said, neither Russians nor the west can be complacent when contemplating what needs to be done to help Russia and the other former Soviet states chart a course for a democratic and prosperous future. Communist wreck Western governments and policymakers would be well advised to listen more carefully to the suggestions emanating from those central and east European states which were militarily occupied subject nations of the late and unlamented Soviet empire only four years ago. The largely inexperienced but courageous people who emerged from the wreckage of communism to take up the challenge of rebuilding their distorted economies and humiliated civil societies have gained much experience in a short time. They started with an invaluable insight into the working of the Soviet system and have picked up with impressive speed the skills and know-how required to run the infinitely more complex structures of a modern, law-based and market-oriented capitalist society. What their experience shows is that the necessary structural changes cannot be accomplished without a period of ultimately creative destruction. A large part of any Soviet-style economy, characterised by outsized monopoly producers, grotesquely bloated military industries, primitive banks and under-developed services of all kinds, simply has to be demolished, or drastically cut down in size. This inevitably brings with it a period of rapidly rising, and potentially socially destabilising, unemployment. Harsh realities Four years after facing up to this harsh reality, 'fast track' reforming states such as Poland, Hungary and Slovenia have unemployment levels up to 15 per cent of the workforce. The Czechs, with low inherited debt, a stronger industrial base and smart political leadership, have managed to prepare for resumed growth without either high inflation or high unemployment. Meanwhile, Poland has become the fastest growing economy in Europe, and all the central European states, with the probable exception of Slovakia, will be producing and exporting more in 1994. All have managed the painful return to economic growth while holding multi-party elections and forming functioning parliamentary governments. In September Poland even witnessed a remarkably smooth return to power of parties with their roots in the communist past after free and fair elections. Central Europe's experience is instructive for Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states where the military-industrial complex is so much bigger and structural change has hardly begun. It should also forewarn western policymakers that their top priority must be to focus on the overwhelming need to help set up and partially finance an unemployment insurance and retraining safety net for the inevitable casualties of structural reform. Otherwise Russia could fall into anarchy, which would put at risk all the gains made over the past four years by post-communist Europe.</p>

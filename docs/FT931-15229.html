			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / China forges Peruvian links with Dollars 312m steel accord: A 'vanguard' purchase transforms Lima's privatisation programme. But the trade balance is likely to remain strongly in Peru's favour CHINA made its largest single investment in Latin America with its recent purchase of Peru's state-owned iron producer, Hierro Peru, acquired by Shougang Corporation for Dollars 312m (Pounds 205m) Already China's largest steel producer, Shougang has set itself the goal of becoming world leader in steel production, projecting output in excess of 20m tonnes by the end of the century. The Peruvian purchase aims to ensure raw materials supply for the expanding steel industry. Shougang was determined to secure the iron producer as the offer price dramatically exceeds the Peruvian privatisation office's most optimistic expectations. It more than quadruples the entire revenue earned last year from sell-offs of state-owned assets. 'We should be jumping for joy,' said former Peruvian trade and industry minister, Mr Victor Joy Way, an expert in Asian trade and the son of Chinese immigrants. Mr Joy Way says several delegations of Chinese entrepreneurs have recently visited Peru. The Chinese are 'interested in investing in anything and everything,' he says. Electricity generation (possibly from Chinese-patented 'liquefied coal'), heavy machinery, petrochemicals and telecommunications are among possible priority sectors. Several factors have come together to allow the commercial alliance. Peru's economic and (relative) political stability plus progress towards curbing terrorism have coincided with greater Chinese openness and a need to seek raw materials and markets abroad. 'We in China find Peru more interesting every day,' said a senior Shougang executive at the auction. 'Many Chinese companies are preparing to invest here in the near future - we are just the vanguard.' Shougang's bid had Peru's new breed of economic liberals bristling at the irony of what is essentially state enterprise leading the field in their country's long-awaited privatisation process. But Shougang's investment - including a steel mill and associated industrial complex to manufacture spare parts - should provide a boost for Peru's recession-hit economy. One of Hierro Peru's attractions for Shougang is the deep-water port of San Nicolas which serves the Marcona mine. Shougang has a huge shipping fleet and, as iron output increases, will deploy 30 ships full-time ferrying coal and iron between Peru and China. Possibilities for future development of sea-freight services are virtually limitless, say Lima-based representatives. Shougang is one of China's largest conglomerates. Among more than a dozen different economic activities, its prominent interests are in steel-making, machinery and equipment manufacture, shipping, minerals processing and electronics. According to Shougang executives the conglomerate owns over a 100 factories and 16 transnationals in a dozen different countries. Its direct workforce exceeds 200,000. Shougang's current steel-making capacity is for 10m tonnes a year, and it produces 200,000 tonnes of machinery. It exports to some 40 countries, and foreign exchange earnings are expected to top Dollars 350m this year. Global sales are forecast to reach Dollars 4bn a year by 1995. Modern-day trade relations between Peru and China began in 1972, during the left-wing military government of General Juan Velasco. Since China is a leading buyer of Peruvian fishmeal, the trade balance has always strongly favoured Peru. Last year Peru exported products worth Dollars 291m to China; imports were only Dollars 33m. Chinese trade officials in Lima say this pattern is likely to continue. Increased shipping movements between the two countries could provide Peruvian minerals with an expanded outlet in Asian markets. Following a visit to China last year by President Alberto Fujimori several new credit lines were extended. These have recently resulted in a large purchase by Peru of Chinese tractors. In the next six months, Peru's tractor stock will be increased by around 40 per cent with the arrival of some 3,000 Chinese-built tractors worth around Dollars 25m. Many of the sewing-machines Mr Fujimori hands out on electioneering visits to the Peruvian hinterland are also Chinese-made. Shougang representatives in Lima say that, within a couple of years, Peru could be building sought-after 'Chinese' tractors for export to other Latin American countries.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Building societies: battling for savers DAVID BARCHARD asks Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, about its mortgage rate rise. Q. Why have you raised your rates? A. Essentially the government is stepping into the high street savings market and we have to retain the money we have from investors and have already lent out to borrowers. It has to be appreciated that essentially what we have done is an investment protection movement which forces a mortgage interest rate move. One might wonder what soundings the government took about the effects of such a high rate on bank and building society deposits. I don't know of any such soundings. Q. Is the demand for savings bonds taking away business from you or are you just taking preventive action? A. We have already noticed some withdrawals spread across small and large accounts but we wanted to make our defensive move before we lost much more money. Investors don't make out their cheques to National Savings when the money leaves our accounts, so we don't know exactly where it is all going but we can see that there is a definite outflow. Somewhere I have seen a claim that there has been a flow of Pounds 120m into National Savings in six days and that is quite a lot of money. If the government is trying to raise very substantial sums of money, and Pounds 1bn has been quoted as a possible target amount, then inevitably it must come out of bank and building society deposit accounts. Q. Why do you need to attract more funds when the property market is on its knees and the demand for new mortgages is flat? A. We don't need to attract more funds as such, what we want to do is to hold on to the funds we have already got. We are simply trying to have a fair crack at the whip and see that C&amp;G investors get as much for their money as those who are putting their savings with the government. Q. Are you just trying to protect market share? A. Not as such. Our mortgage market share is around 3.5 per cent. As far as the saving markets go we don't have figures for what the banks are holding, but we definitely don't think we are losing market share to our usual competitors. Q. Are you trying to widen the margin between the rate you lend and the rate you offer to savers in order to improve profits? A. The shift is basically the same on both sides and we will end up with the same margin at the end of this latest move. Q. Do you expect other lenders to follow suit? A. I think some will follow us in the short term and others will do later. Our rates increase will have come as a bit of a surprise to them and they will take some time to think out their position and respond to it. If they don't make some moves they can expect to see money flowing away from them towards National Savings. Q. Will higher mortgage rates finally kill off any hope of a recovery in the housing market? A. The key point here is that we have moved as little as possible and are talking about only a quarter of 1 per cent. We have got mortgage interest rates which are lower than they were at the beginning of the year. A marginal increase of that magnitude will have little impact on the housing market as a whole. Q. What would it take for rates to come down again? A. What we need is the government to lead rates down again. Setting a high interest rate for savings in the retail market is much more likely to force rates up. Q. Won't higher interest rates simply encourage more mortgage defaults? A. I don't think they will encourage them, but some may happen as a result. People tend to pay all of their instalment or none of it. Q. Does ERM membership make matters worse or better? A. If membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism involves beating inflation out of the system, it means inevitably that we are not going to see a quick recovery in the housing market. Q. What in your view needs to be done to stimulate the housing market? A. Assuming we can rule out some old-fashioned remedy such as a bout of 1970s-style inflation, we need some new government money to stimulate the bottom end of the market, for example by higher tax relief for first-time buyers. Another idea would be for the government to provide a guarantee for the top 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the loan to a first-time buyer. This gets over our problem with mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance and would enable lenders to make 100 per cent loans to first-time buyers again. Another point is that building societies are not allowed to raise all the wholesale funding they want from the money markets. The Building Societies Association has been pressing for some time for this limit to be removed or increased.</p>

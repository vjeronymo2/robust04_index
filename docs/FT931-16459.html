			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Latest Ford designed to be first 'world car' FORD unveils the Mondeo, a large family car, designed to be the US carmaker's first 'world car', today. The Mondeo, which will be produced in both Europe and North America, has been developed at a cost of around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.86bn) in Ford's most ambitious programme so far. It will replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in March, and the Ford Tempo/ Mercury Topaz in North America, where it will be launched in the first half of 1994. The Mondeo is being positioned in one of the most fiercely contested segments of the European new car market, where it will compete with General Motors' Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, the Volkswagen Passat and the Peugeot 405. This is the segment targeted by Japanese carmakers for their first European-built cars. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are all now producing the Mondeo's competitors at their new UK plants. At the same time, Citroen, the French carmaker, is launching its new Xantia range soon, to replace the BX in this segment and, later this year, Renault will also replace its ageing Renault 21. Rover is launching its new Rover 600 to replace the out-dated Montego in the spring. In Europe the Mondeo will be built at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium, which has a capacity to produce around 440,000 a year. In an important reform of its labour practices Ford is introducing for the first time in Europe three-shift round-the-clock working on the Mondeo assembly line at Genk. The Mondeo development programme has taken around 5 1/2 years and is the first time that Ford has developed a common, mainstream car for manufacture and sale in Europe and in North America. Most of the development has been carried out by Ford of Europe at its technical centres in the UK and Germany. The Mondeo will start production next year at Ford's Kansas City plant with a capacity to produce 250,000 cars a year. Ford claims the front-wheel-drive Mondeo will be the first car in its class to offer features such as electronic traction control to eliminate wheel spin and adaptive suspension damping to improve ride and handling.

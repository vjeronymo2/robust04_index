			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Cuts Untapped Petroleum Reserves: The Interior Department said it has  lowered by 40% its estimate of untapped and undiscovered U.S. oil resources,  reflecting in part the recent failures of promising drilling prospects in the  West and offshore. In its first report on undiscovered U.S. oil and natural gas  resources since 1981, the Interior Department estimated that the nation has 49  billion barrels of crude oil outside known fields that could be discovered and  put into production with existing technology. Eight years ago, it estimated 83  billion barrels of undiscovered crude. One barrel equals 42 gallons.  </P></p>

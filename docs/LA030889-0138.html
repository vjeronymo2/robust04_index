			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF HOUSING DIRECTOR'S CONTRACT PRACTICES ORDERED  </P> <P> An investigation into alleged improper contracting practices by Leila  Gonzalez-Correa, the executive director of the city Housing Authority, was  ordered Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> On a 12-0 vote, the council directed three city agencies to investigate whether  Gonzalez-Correa violated federal regulations on at least five occasions by  awarding more than $200,000 in contracts to her acquaintances and to political  supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley without seeking other bids.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa, in her first public statement since the contracting practices  were disclosed by The Times last month, charged in a letter to council members  Tuesday that the city attorney's office had signed off on the contracts.  </P> <P> "There was explicit concurrence by the Board of (Housing) Commissioners and the  city attorney in most of the instances of procurement cited in the press,"  wrote Gonzalez-Correa.  </P> <P> Records show, however, that in most instances the city attorney's office was  unaware that Gonzalez-Correa had issued the contracts. The city's investigation  was assigned to Chief Legislative Analyst William McCarley, City Administrative  Officer Keith Comrie and City Controller Rick Tuttle.  </P> <P> Findings of the inquiry, to be completed within 30 days, will be reported to  the council's Grants, Housing and Community Development Committee chaired by  Councilman Robert Farrell.  </P> <P> The probe is expected to focus solely on five contracts that have been  questioned, Comrie said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Probe May Widen  </P> <P> While he left the door open for the panel to investigate "anything else that  comes up," Comrie said the city is relying on the U.S. Department of Housing  and Urban Development to conduct a thorough examination of the city housing  agency's spending practices and procedures. "They will look at the entire  operation," he said.  </P> <P> On a motion by Councilman Nate Holden, who is running for mayor, the council  had initially considered ordering the city attorney to conduct the  investigation.  </P> <P> But as the vote approached the floor Tuesday, council members agreed that the  city attorney may have a conflict of interest, because the office serves as the  Housing Authority's legal counsel.  </P> <P> The three city agencies -- which lack formal investigative powers and do not  regularly monitor the housing agency's practices -- are expected to do "a quick  look-see," said one city official, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> "Essentially, it looks like it is going to be swept under the rug," the city  official said. "It's what the mayor wants . . . . "  </P> <P> Still, John Emerson, executive assistant to the city attorney, agreed that his  office should not be involved in the investigation. He said the three other  agencies were better equipped to conduct "what is essentially an operational  audit." And, he added, because there are questions concerning advice given  Gonzalez-Correa by the city attorney's office, it is better to have a "more  neutral" agency conduct the inquiry.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa, whose $100,000-a-year contract expires in October, continues  to receive the support of Bradley, despite recent criticism of her spending  practices and a controversial plan to sell the dilapidated Jordan Downs public  housing project.  </P> <P> In the memo sent to council members on Monday, Gonzalez-Correa said her  procurement activities were approved by the Housing Authority Board of  Commissioners and the city attorney's office in four of five contracts  exceeding $10,000.  </P> <P> However, Gonzalez-Correa failed to notify board members or the city attorney of  contracts in two of the four cases, Housing Authority records show.  </P> <P> In one case, Gonzalez-Correa said she received board approval to pay $46,000 in  consulting fees to an acquaintance from Texas, Joe Rocha. But she neglected to  report that Rocha had received an additional $25,735 without competitive bids  and without board approval, and he was paid $16,450 after the board had  instructed Gonzalez-Correa to stop using Rocha's services.  </P> <P> In calling for the inquiry, Holden said he wanted to "restore some integrity"  to the Housing Authority. But, he added in an interview, "We don't want to  indict anyone before we get the facts."  </P></p>

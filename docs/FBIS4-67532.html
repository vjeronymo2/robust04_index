			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yevgeniy Tkachenko] </F>   [Text] Chelyabinsk May 5 TASS -- Russian greens picketed  the building housing the Chelyabinsk regional admnistration  today in protest against the chemical plant ``Mayak's''  continuing processing of used fuel from atomic reactors. The  activists from the social movement ``for nuclear safety'' were  particularly incensed by the arrival of another train shipment  of such dangerous materials from Finland.    The environmentalists say that the processing of nuclear  waste is worsening the none-too-bright environmental picture in  Russia's Ural Mountains and demand that ``Mayak'' stop accepting  shipments for processing.    But spokesman for the plant Yevgeniy Ryzhkov told ITAR-TASS  that ``the plant's current load in processing used nuclear fuel  does not even reach half-capacity and causes no harm to the  environment.''    He added that ``the Russian authorities have to fulfill  contracts signed yet by the USSR and, what is more important,  the processing is the main financial source for the  implementation of large-scale environmental programmes in the  region.''    According to Ryzhkov, the Soviet and Russian nuclear  industry  produced a huge amount of liquid radioactive waste in their  45-year old history. It is difficult and dangerous to store it  for long periods. The only solution, he said, is to turn them  into compact, solid wastes.    The appropriate technology for such operations, the  specialist explained, ``has been created and is operating in our  plant. It is necessary only to increase the machinery's  capacity and build a few new furnaces. All this is being done  at our own expense, and the main source of money for `Mayak' has  become the regeneration of used fuel which is transported here.  One must take into account that the fuel contains from 90 to 95  percent uranium, which we put back into nuclear energy. And  fuel regeneration produces much less waste than the production  of nuclear fuel,'' he said.    Ryzhkov added that the shipment of used nuclear fuel, which  caused such a commotion among the ``greens'' in Finland and  Russia, had been successfully delivered to ``Mayak,'' unloaded,  and was being processed ``in a safe way.''</p>

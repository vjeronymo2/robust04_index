			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese bank to cut dividend Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's 11 commercial banks, is to cut its dividend for the first time in 33 years following heavy loan write-offs which threaten to push pre-tax profits sharply lower. The bank, based in the northern island of Hokkaido, is reducing its annual dividend by Y1 to Y6 per share. Since a dividend cut by a Japanese bank is almost unprecedented, the move confirms stock market speculation about the extent of the loan problems at Hokkaido. The bank has revised its earnings forecast for the year ended March 1994 and now expects pre-tax profits of Y6bn (Dollars 55m), down 68 per cent on 1992-93. Hokkaido is to write down its loan book by about Y120bn. Hokkaido aggressively expanded its loan portfolio during the economic spree of the late 1980s, along with other Japanese banks. The bank held Y400.4bn, or 5.4 per cent of its loans, in non-performing loans at the end of September, 1993. The bank said the figure had risen to Y500bn by March this year. Some of its larger clients include Kabuto Decom, a resort development company, and a number of non-bank financial institutions which face mounting debts. Japanese financial authorities, reluctant to allow banks to write off non-performing loans, have recently changed their stance, urging banks to clean up their balance sheets. The bank plans to record Y19bn of losses from selling bad property loans to buyers, including the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by banks to buy off non-performing loans. The bank said it would take a further two years to reduce the level of problem loans to manageable levels. Hokkaido is to suspend bonus payments to board members. Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, president, will retire to become chairman and take responsibility for the bank's financial problems. Mr Sadamasa Kawatani, vice-president, will become president.</p>

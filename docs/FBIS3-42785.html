But the Cities of  Tatarstan (Kazan, Chistopol, and Naberezhnyye Chelny) Remain  Among the `Cheapest' Cities of Russia"]    [Text] After the rather high weekly rates of inflation that  were recorded at the beginning and middle of the month, towards  the end of January these rates grew more slowly, and between 15  and 25 January prices increased by 3.4 percent.    Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year the rate of  inflation has already reached nearly 21 percent. During the  past week once again the greatest increase was observed in  tariffs on paid services, which increased by 7.6 percent.  Prices for foodstuffs increased by 3.8 percent. The growth of  prices for noncomestibles in January continued to lag behind the  increase in prices for services and foodstuffs, and during the  past week amounted to 2.2 percent.    The highest rates of inflation were recorded in the Uralskiy  and Severo-Zapadnyy rayons, where they reached 4.7 and 4.6  percent, respectively. For the last three weeks the lowest  increase in prices for basic consumer goods and paid services  were observed in the Severokavkazskiy region, where rates grew  by 2.8, 3.4, and 2.2 percent, respectively.    In Moscow the growth of consumer prices for goods and  services over the past week was higher than in Russia on the  average, amounting to 4.6 percent. The greatest price increase  in the capital was for foodstuffs, amounting to 5.8 percent. In  St. Petersburg the overall increase in prices for consumer goods  and services came to 3.5 percent.    Over the past week prices for foodstuffs increased by 3.8  percent, and since the beginning of January have increased by  20.6 percent overall. The weekly growth of prices in organized  marketing was higher than in unorganized marketing, amounting to  4.1 and 2.5 percent, respectively. On the whole during the past  week, as in the week preceding it, the greatest price increases  were for dairy products (7.8 percent), animal oil (5.2 percent),  and bakery goods and vegetables (almost 5 percent). Macaroni  and cereal products, eggs, and fish products were almost 4  percent more expensive than one week ago. Prices for  confectioneries and fruit grew by 2 percent during the week.  Prices for sugar have remained nearly stable since the  beginning of the year.    In unorganized marketing over the past week the increase in  the price of vodka was the greatest increase in any of the goods  under observation and, at 7.2 percent, was significantly higher  than the new rate in organized marketing stores, which increased  by only 3.1 percent.    The greatest increase in foodstuff prices over the last week  was noted in the Severnyy rayon, where in both organized and  unorganized marketing prices grew by 5 percent.    The average cost of an assortment of nineteen basic  foodstuffs as of 25 January amounted to 366,000 rubles, having  increased each week by 4.5 percent, and since the beginning of  the month by 19 percent.    Once again the cities of the far eastern region took first  place in terms of the cost of an assortment of nineteen basic  foodstuffs. Over the last week the increase in the price of  such an assortment in the cities of this region grew from 1  percent, in Komsomolsk-na-Amure, to 17 percent, in  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.    Over the week in Moscow the cost of an assortment of  nineteen  basic foodstuffs grew by 3.3 percent, amounting to 396,000 as of  25 January. In St. Petersburg the cost of such an assortment  increased by 1.4 percent, totalling 352,000 rubles. Among the  cities under consideration Moscow is in 36th place (a week ago  it was 33rd), and St. Petersburg is again in 60th place, as it  was a week ago.    Since the beginning of January prices for noncomestibles  have  grown much more slowly than those for foodstuffs and services.  Over the last week prices increased by (figure unclear)  percent, and since the beginning of the month by 10 percent.  During the week the greatest increase was observed in prices  for medicine and fuel, which increased by 7 and 6 percent.  Prices for footwear and tobacco goods remained virtually the  same as they had been the previous week.</p>

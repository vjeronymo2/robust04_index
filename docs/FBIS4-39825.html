			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 11 TASS -- The fourth anniversary of  the proclamation of the state sovereignty of the Russian  Federation, which is due on June 12, is in the focus of  attention of today's newspapers.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article on this subject, which is  entitled "Forecasts Not Coming True: Russia is not Flourishing,  but Neither has it Slided Down into the Abyss." The tactical and  even strategic importance of this day in the struggle of the new  centre with the old one, that of the Soviet Union, cannot be  overestimated, the newspaper writes. "Against the background of  the more and more obvious weakening of the Gorbachev  administration the idea of sovereignty as a cure-all, as about  the only hope for the revival, was gaining popularity and  support ... It has been repeated too often, but it is a fact  that Russia was virtually restored from ashes on more than one  occasion after far more serious upheavals. So, the hope is still  here."    The newspaper sets forth President Yeltsin's speech at the  Friday press conference, devoted to Russia's Independence Day.  The article is entitled "President Optimistic About the Future."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI frontpages the statement saying that to  ponder over this historic date means, in the first place, "to  ponder over the importance of this country. Even in the most  difficult of times Russians continue to think about the role  played by their country in the world. As a rule, such thoughts  develop into ambitious projects and undertakings, which shake  the foundations of this (and not only this) country and,  unfortunately, do not always bring the desired results. Voices  can be heard more and more often, which warn the authorities  against taking hasty 'ambitious' decision, no matter how  attractive they may look ..." The newspaper emphasizes the words  of Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of President Yeltsin's  Administration, that the coming anniversary confirms the fact  that "by gaining independence, the Russian Federation has been  preserved as an integrated state and continues to be  consolidated."    TRUD frontpages a report about President Yeltsin's press  conference under the headline "A New Political Reality has Taken  Shape in the Country." The newspaper quotes the president's  answer to the question of a TRUD correspondent about his  assessment of propsects of the establishment of social democracy  in Russia. Yeltsin's said: "I think there is a basis in Russia  for the development of social democracy. We shall have a true  social democratic party or movement."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA emphasizes Yeltsin's words that "I will  not surrender Chernomyrdin, even to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA." The  newspaper points out that Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays  obviously lost the battle to Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and was  publicly rebuked by the president, who asked First Deputy Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays to keep away from  Moscow's problems."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA strongly criticise Yeltsin's  performance on the post of the president. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA  carries excerpts from a manuscript of Leonid Velikodny, former  air force pilot, who describes the team of the authors of  perestroyka as "amateurs and saboteurs."    PRAVDA publishes an article on the same subject, stressing  that, in its opinion, the future of President Yeltsin is rather  bleak.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries a report about Yeltsin's press  conference under the headline "On the Eve of the Third  Anniversary of his Presidency, Yeltsin Announces All-Out Advance  of the Economic Reform, but Puts Luzhkov in Charge of  Privatization in Moscow."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries as well an interview with Kazakh  President Nursultan Nazarbayev, which deals with his plan of  creating an Euroasian union. According to Nazarbayev,  "Kazakhstan should never plan anything detrimental to Russia,  and it never will. This does not meet its strategic and historic  interests. It is in line with Kazakhstan's interest to be on  friendly terms with Russia, to be close to it and confident of  each other's goodwill. This is the strategic goal."    Jan Eliasson, head of the CSCE Minsk Group for the  settlement  of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said in an interview with  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that he welcomes "Russia's energetic effort  aimed at achieving ceasefire." "Russia's role in the region is  indisputable, and we should take advantage of its knowledge and  experience for settling the conflict," he said.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Sergey  Shakhray. He believes that federalism today is the only way to  preserve a stable political regime and the unity of the state.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Foster's seeks boardroom balance FOSTER'S Brewing, the world's fourth largest beer-maker, is to have three deputy chairmen in an attempt to balance the competing factions on its board, Mr Nobby Clark, chairman, said yesterday. Mr Clark said Mr John Elliott, deputy chairman since 1990, would be joined by Mr Koichiro Iwaki, representing Asahi Breweries of Japan, and Professor Fred Hilmer, an independent director. Mr Clark also said a board committee set up last year to discuss strategic options would be attended by Mr Ted Kunkel, who will take over in May as Foster's chief executive. Mr Kunkel, who is presently chairman of Molson Breweries of Canada, in which Foster's has a 50 per cent interest, was appointed last week to replace Mr Peter Bartels, who resigned after losing a boardroom struggle over dividend policy. The announcements reflect the increasing influence on the Foster's board of Asahi, which has a 19.9 per cent shareholding. They also confirm that the departure of Mr Bartels was not an unqualified victory for Mr Elliott, who had earlier sought his dismissal. The board's decision to appoint Mr Kunkel to the strategy committee means the management of Foster's will have more influence over the company's direction than under Mr Bartels, who was not a member of the committee. That could reduce Mr Elliott's chances of persuading the committee to speed up the disposal of about ADollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) in non-brewing assets which Foster's has said it wants to sell. Mr Elliott's private company, International Brewing Holdings (IBH), which owns 38 per cent of Foster's, has until May to present proposals to its bankers for the reduction of more than ADollars 2.5bn in debt. Mr Elliott and two other IBH directors have argued strongly for a rapid disposal of assets, possibly leading to a capital return to shareholders which would allow IBH to repay its debts. The IBH proposals were resisted by Mr Bartels and Foster's independent directors.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Observer: Pike landed Last Thursday Francis Pike dropped in for a board meeting of Drayton Far Eastern Trust, before heading to Chelsea register office to wed Lady Annabel Goldsmith's daughter, India-Jane Birley. Pike's new boss, Philip Tose, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank Peregrine Securities, flew in for the day to be best man. Without further ado, Pike left for Bombay, where he has 10 weeks before opening the doors of a joint venture between Peregrine and Indian tobacco company ITC. Pike had spent the last 14 years at fund managers Invesco, 24 per cent of which is now held by Peregrine. When management upheavals at Invesco a year ago made his position uncomfortable, Pike, who has spent much of his time in the Far East, took a call from his old friend Tose. Having created Hong Kong's largest independent merchant banking group in under five years, Tose's ambitions now stretch to repeating the success story throughout Asia. With the help of close associate Li Ka-Shing, lack of capital is not one of Tose's problems. Peregrine last year sunk Dollars 30m into South Korea in another joint venture, with commodities giant Dongbang. ITC, meanwhile, rejected several British merchant banks in favour of the Asian partner for its foray into financial services. An adaptable sort, 39-year-old Pike spent his first three months in Tokyo living in a Zen Buddhist temple before getting stuck into what he calls the 'gaijin ghetto'. But he is far from unworldly, as his blue Ferrari, fondly remembered by Japanese friends, demonstrated. In taking on the still formidable difficulties of the Indian market, he will not be stuck for more ways to make his mark.</p>

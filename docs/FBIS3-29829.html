Comrade Han Song-yong, member of the Political Bureau of the  WPK Central Committee and secretary of the party Central  Committee; functionaries concerned; and employees and three  revolutions team members of the mine were present at the meeting.    At the meeting, Comrade Han Song-yong delivered the WPK  Central Committee's thank-you message to the working class,  functionaries, and three revolutions team members of Songchon  Mine.    The thank-you message extended warm gratitude to the entire  working class, functionaries, and three revolutions team  members, who have achieved great results in producing nonferrous  metallic minerals, with revolutionary zeal and creative  activeness and upholding the party's revolutionary economic  strategy.    The thank-you message pointed out: After rising up as one,  upholding the party's militant appeal, the working class and  functionaries of Songchon Mine explored and mobilized internal  reserves and vigorously carried out a movement for technological  innovation, so that they could achieve proud results,  overfulfilling last year's production quotas in all indices of  products.    The message noted: With the revolutionary spirit of self-  relience and fortitude, the working class and functionaries of  the mine have arranged many high-grade iron ore fields and  equipped them with various facilities, so that they increased  the transporting, drilling, and picking capabilities and  consolidated the material and technological grounds for  increasing the mineral production.    The message noted: By vigorously carrying out a mass  movement for technological innovation, workers and technicians  prepared various tool production bases inside the mine, produced  ore crushers there, and introduced various precious  technologies, thus actively contributing to increasing the labor  productivity and developing the national mining in a chuche way.    The message highly assessed the working class,  functionaries,  and three revolutions team members of Songchon Mine who  increased the mineral production with fervent loyalty to the  party and the leader by displaying their revolutionary spirit  and militant strength, thus making great contribution to  accelerating the light industrial revolution and elevating the  people's living standard.    The message expressed the firm belief that the working  class,  functionaries, and three revolutions team members of Songchon  Mine will excellently repay the party's great confidence and  expectations with responsible accomplishment of their  revolutionary duties in overflowing revolutionary faith and  optimism and under the party's leadership.    Next, Han Il-kun, chief technician of the mine; Yi  Chong-kil,  leader of a platoon; Kim Won-sop, member of a three revolutions  team made speeches to express their resolve.    The speakers said that Songchon Mine could achieve great  results in producing nonferrous metallic minerals because the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il had clearly elucidated the road for the mine and wisely  led it. They stressed on the need to create a new turning point  in production, upholding the great leader's New Year's address  and the decisions made by the 21st plenary session of the Sixth  WPK Central Committee.    They mentioned the need to be firmly armed with our party's  chuche idea and keep vigorously advancing at the Chollima speed  of the nineties. They said that based on achieved results, the  mine will, above all, give priority to drilling, diversify the  way of transportation, increase the ore-dressing capacity, and  take measures for supplying materials, so as to normalize the  production of nonferrous metallic minerals at a high level.    They stressed that the mine will produce more minerals by  actively introducing advanced drilling, picking, and  ore-dressing methods, and by vigorously carrying out the  struggle to modernize machinery facilities and processing lines.    A resolution was adopted at the meeting.</p>

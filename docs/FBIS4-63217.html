			<p>BFN     [Text] Well informed sources state that June could see the  end of the relaying of Ostankino television and Mayak radio to  Uzbekistan.    Zafar Khakimov of the Uzbek national broadcast company would  neither confirm or deny this information to Interfax saying that  he did not have the relevant information.    In the meantime local television and radio workers have  already been told that in the near future Uzbek broadcasting  will be increased by a total of 20 hours per day to make up for  the loss of Ostankino and Mayak. To this end another 200 people  will be employed.    For Uzbek residents television and radio programs from  Moscow  are the main source of information about life in Russia, the CIS  and the world. Of the former Soviet and now Russian newspapers,  only RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, TRUD and MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA are  published in the republic.</p>

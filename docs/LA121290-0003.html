			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO LOS AMIGOS  </P> <P> This letter is to protest the sensationalistic tone of Louis Sahagun's story  about gang members in the spinal injury service at Rancho Los Amigos Medical  Center (Dec. 2). It is true that a significant number of our patients are  victims of gang violence.  </P> <P> However, the portrayal of the staff as "overwhelmed" and the implication that  gang warfare is an ongoing threat on the hospital grounds is a distortion.  </P> <P> In speaking with the reporter, I emphasized the fact that most patients are not  in severe psychological distress and that only a fraction become suicidally  depressed or suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. When specifically  questioned about real or threatened gang violence on the ward itself, I could  recall only one or two minor incidents in the last eight months.  </P> <P> In assessing new patients who are admitted with gunshot wounds, I am not  concerned (as I was quoted as saying) that "someone is going to come in and  kill them." Your reporter's insistent search for violence in our midst ignores  the most compelling reality. Many of our patients transcend the trauma behind  their disabilities and go on with their lives, using their minds and their  emotional skills to survive.  </P> <P> LISA GOLDEN, Clinical Psychologist  </P> <P> Spinal Cord Injury Service  </P> <P> Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Traders demand government compensation for Iraqi debts SEVERAL companies are demanding compensation from the British government for Pounds 150m of Iraqi debts for goods supplied before the invasion of Kuwait. More than 30 British companies which traded with Iraq before the introduction of sanctions in August 1990 face substantial unpaid bills which have seriously affected their operations. Many feel bitter that they were encouraged to trade with Iraq by the British government in the 1980s, but that Whitehall has turned its back on them now difficulties have arisen. They are also angered by the knowledge that funds held by the Iraqi government in UK banks are estimated to be worth Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 706m) and still earning interest which on its own would now be enough to pay their debts. Mr Omeir Cotran, chairman and managing director of OMC Group, a worsted-fabric manufacturer based in Huddersfield, says: 'We are in a very bad position. We are just surviving, but I am not sure for how much longer.' He has outstanding bills from Iraq for Dollars 1.2m, mainly from trade during 1989 and 1990 up to the imposition of sanctions. Since then, he has had to shed 30 of his 70 employees and close one of his two mills. Late last year, his bank scrutinised the company's diminishing cashflows and withdrew its overdraft facility. OMC traded with private-sector customers. But Iraqi government regulations during the 1980s required payments to be channelled through letters of credit issued against the Rafidain and Rashid banks, both of which are branches of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. The company used to underwrite its trade through the UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department. When the ECGD stopped offering long-term cover to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, OMC simply relied on the letters of credit. 'We thought this was very safe business,' says Mr Cotran. 'We thought there was no way we would not get our money unless the government went bust.' But while Iraqi customers paid money in advance to the banks which issued the letters of credit, repayments slowed during the late 1980s and ceased as a result of the worldwide freeze on Iraqi assets imposed when the UN imposed sanctions against the Baghdad regime. Mr Gregori Tchelbakian, founder of Apollo Fashions, a fashionwear company with Dollars 2.5m in unpaid bills, says: 'It's very frustrating to know that the Iraqi government owns money here accruing interest, while we are suffering.' Mr Saad Jadir, managing director of Dominion (England), an exporter of car parts with Dollars 10m in Iraqi unpaid debts, estimates that there are at least 60 companies with debts totalling Pounds 150m in a similar position. He has managed to document Pounds 50m in detail so far. He suggests two possible options. One is for the UK government to unfreeze some Iraqi assets on condition that the debts are repaid. The other is for interest on Iraqi deposits still frozen in the UK to be released to pay the debts. He also offers a third approach: persuading the Bank of England to underwrite lines of credit against the letters of credit issued. He has already held discussions with UK institutions on supporting such an idea. Appeals to the UK government so far have been frustrated by a ceaseless merry-go-round of bureaucratic buck-passing, he says. 'These companies should go to the Bank of England,' the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. 'They hold the purse strings.' It added that companies had to make their own commercial decisions about insuring against risks of non-payment. It said that while officials and ministers can sometimes 'put in a heavy word', no such diplomatic or economic links currently exist with Iraq, making these tactics impossible. The Bank of England has a unit created to consider the issue of Iraqi sanctions. A Bank official said, however: 'This is one for the Foreign Office. We are an executive arm. Our unit has no discretion whatever.' The Foreign Office, in turn, maintains that it merely implements the UN-imposed asset freeze, and adds that there is little indication that the attitude towards Iraq is softening. 'On the situation of British firms, you should ask the DTI or the Bank of England,' it said yesterday.</p>

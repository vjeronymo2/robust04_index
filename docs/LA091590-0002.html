			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL WASTE FOUND IN TRASH BRINGS NO ACTION;  </P> <P> HEALTH: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE NAVY, THE  SOURCE OF THE INFECTIOUS WASTE, INCLUDING AIDS TEST SAMPLES. SO FAR, HOWEVER,  THE NAVY HAS REMAINED SILENT ABOUT THE EVENT.  </P> <P> Nearly two months after San Diego County officials discovered a large cache of  illegally dumped Navy medical waste -- including AIDS blood-test samples --  behind a Normal Heights video store, none of the agencies involved in  investigating the incident revealed the problem to the public or took action  against those responsible.  </P> <P> The Times learned Friday that, on July 20, eight bags marked "BIO-HAZARDOUS  MATERIAL: CAUTION" were found in a trash bin behind Blockbuster Video in the  3500 block of El Cajon Boulevard. The translucent, 18-by-24-inch bags contained  several hundred used syringes, bloody bandages, bacteria cultures, and blood  samples used for AIDS and venereal disease tests.  </P> <P> "We had the case under investigation," said Linda Miller, spokeswoman for the  San Diego County district attorney's office and a member of the county's  Hazardous Waste Task Force. "At the end of the investigation, we turned it over  to the Navy, expecting them to handle it. The Navy said they were going to  handle it. I don't know what they've done -- they haven't made any releases to  the public."  </P> <P> Miller said the district attorney, working with Naval Investigative Service  agents, determined that a Navy hospital corpsman put the eight bags of waste  into the trunk of his car when he found himself locked out of a medical waste  disposal shed. His wife unwittingly tossed them into the trash bin of the video  store where she worked.  </P> <P> Miller said the results of the investigation were turned over to the Navy last  month.  </P> <P> But the "appropriate (Navy) command" has not yet received the NIS report, said  Navy spokesman Chief Petty Officer Martin Wicklund. "When it is reviewed by the  command, the Navy will take appropriate administrative and judicial actions as  necessary."  </P> <P> Wicklund declined further comment. NIS officials also declined comment.  </P> <P> A Navy official, who requested anonymity, said supervising officers will decide  next week how to handle this case. The Navy officials met several times last  month as well as this week with the district attorney's office and NIS  officials, sources said.  </P> <P> The cache of medical waste alarmed county health officials because of the  amount and the infectiousness of the material.  </P> <P> Miller said, "There were potentially infectious items in these bags. We know  people go through Dumpsters, especially in that area. We are lucky this didn't  create a serious health problem."  </P> <P> The find was one of the biggest caches of medical waste found in San Diego in  years, said Gary Stephanie, director of the county's Environmental Health  Services.  </P> <P> "This is major," Stephanie said. "If the Navy has all these procedures and  policies, and if they are not going to be followed, it's real serious. . . . If  this was a doctor's office, we would have asked the district attorney's office  to file charges."  </P> <P> Miller said investigators determined that, in July, working at the end of his  shift, hospital corpsman Wade Bliss was unable to open the locked disposal shed  used for hazardous medical waste. Bliss loaded the eight bags into his car  trunk and left them there. His wife Maria, who works at the Blockbuster Video,  saw the bags and dumped them into the trash bin at her job.  </P> <P> Store manager Steve King recalls finding the bags and being horrified when he  saw the red and black label: "BIO-HAZARDOUS MATERIAL: CAUTION." King believed  that they might have contained radioactive material and immediately called the  Health Department.  </P> <P> "It was really nasty stuff," King said. "I may walk down the beach and see  medical waste, but I don't figure I am going to see it in a trash can."  </P> <P> Bliss, who was unavailable for comment, has not been reprimanded for the  incident, sources said. Bliss, 24, is attached to the submarine destroyer  tender Dixon, which would have handled the medical waste not only for itself  but for several submarines that its crew was repairing.  </P> <P> Several waves of hazardous medical waste have washed ashore in the past year.  In most cases, officials have been unable to prove whether the waste was dumped  from Navy ships or, indeed, where it came from.  </P> <P> In May, three atropine injectors traced to a military depot washed ashore.  Later, syringes, prescription drug vials and intravenous tubing, as well as C  rations, dotted the shores from Carlsbad to Coronado.  </P> <P> But, in this recent case, officials were able to figure out what happened.  </P> <P> Because Bliss' wife Maria, 21, did not realize the seriousness of her actions,  the district attorney's office decided not to file charges against her, Miller  said.  </P> <P> "I had the impression this was something which, if it occurred several years  ago, no one would have raised an eyebrow -- but several years ago, we didn't  have the requirements for medical waste that we have now," said Cmdr. Steve  Epstein, a staff judge advocate for the 32nd Street Naval Base who had attended  a meeting in August about the incident. "We are living in a new age now where  we have to take care of things, and apparently that was not done."  </P> <P> Store manager King, meanwhile, has begun padlocking his trash bin.  </P></p>

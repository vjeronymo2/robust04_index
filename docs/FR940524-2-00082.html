The Index is comprised of 300 representative stocks of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE''). <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange believes that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of the Japanese economy and hedging against the risk of investing in that economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> First section stocks are distinguished from second section stocks by more stringent listing standards.

The CBOE represents that Index component stocks were selected by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. for their high market capitalization and their high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the industrial composition of the broader Japanese equity market. The Index is weighted by the market capitalization of the component stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The median capitalization of the firms in the Index on March 31, 1994, was  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=1 --> y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 340.1 billion. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The average market capitalization of these firms was US$7.5 billion on the same date using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalization of these firms ranged from US$875 million to US$76.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock accounted for 3.41% of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> US$3.3 billion at the exchange rate of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=7 f=1 --> y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 102.75 per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The value of the Index is determined by adding the price of each stock times the number of shares outstanding. This sum is then divided by a divisor which gives the Index a value of 100 on its base date of October 1, 1982. This divisor is adjusted for pertinent changes as described below in the section titled ``Maintenance.'' The Index had a closing value of 296.35 on April 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maintenance: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Index will be maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. To maintain continuity of the Index, the divisor of the Index will be adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component stocks. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The composition of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bass files lawsuit over Holiday Inn buy BASS, the brewery and leisure group, has filed a lawsuit in the US federal courts, claiming that it was misled about the condition of the Holiday Inn chain, which it acquired for Dollars 2.23bn two years ago. The lawsuit, in which Bass seeks unspecified damages, is thought to allege that Promus, the US-quoted casinos and hotels company which remained once Holiday Corporation's Holiday Inn business had been sold off to Bass, misled the group about the condition of many hotels, the nature of their leases and their compliance with various laws, including zoning compliances. Further allegations are understood to centre on potential liabilities at Holiday Inn which Bass claims it did not know about at the time of merger. It also claims that Promus is not adhering to the terms of a tax sharing agreement concerning pre-merger taxes on Holiday Inn hotels. Holiday Inn last night declined to discuss details of the lawsuit, but confirmed that it had been filed. There was no immediate response from Promus. Holiday Inn has been described as the world's largest hotel brand. At end-1990 it took in about 1,600 hotels and approximately 320,000 rooms in 48 countries. At Bass's annual meeting last month, Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, told shareholders that economic conditions in some parts of the US had continued to depress occupancy rates in some company-managed hotels, but that this had been partially offset by higher room rates.</p>

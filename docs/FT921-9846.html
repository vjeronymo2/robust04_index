			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: A magician's trick to increase expenditure on housing Sir, There is a very simple magician's trick which could increase expenditure on social housing without affecting the public-sector borrowing requirement ('Save the PSBR', February 6). It involves changing one clause in legislation which would give local authorities the ability to secure new loans for housing on their housing assets, without recourse to rates and revenues. (The government has facilitated this through recent legislation ring-fencing the housing accounts of local authorities.) The risk to lenders of such loans would then descend on effective management, including rent setting and rent collection, and maintenance, with properties having to be sold (to other social landlords) in cases of failure. This would be private sector risk as there would be no recourse to other parts of the authority or its income. This contrasts with the current situation where all local authority loans are secured on the rates and revenues of the local authority. There are two advantages of this approach which should be welcomed by all political parties. First, the Department of the Environment acknowledges that there is a backlog of repair which cannot be financed out of net rental income and current borrowing levels because of the concern about the cost of rent rebates if rents increase too quickly and the effect on PSBR. Second, the City would be selective in its lending decisions, financial institutions would evaluate the performance of local authority housing departments seeking finance and would advance loans only to those which could demonstrate that they were managing well from both a housing and financial point of view. What greater incentive for improvement? R Terry, CSL Group, Consilium House, City Forum, 250 City Road, London EC1</p>

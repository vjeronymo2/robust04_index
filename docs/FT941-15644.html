			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Swiss banks in secrecy clash Switzerland's private banks are balking at a government proposal obliging them to report suspicions of money laundering by their clients, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. 'It is not our task to be investigators for the authorities,' Bank Julius Baer in Zurich said. The 'obligation to denounce' promises to be the most controversial of several measures proposed to fight organised crime. There is already a widely supported proposal before parliament to give bankers the right to denounce a suspected criminal client, as well as recent directives from the Swiss Banking Commission and the Swiss Bankers' Association providing for sanctions against a banker knowingly dealing with criminals. The new measure seeks to extend the right to denounce into an obligation to do so.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Morton could take 36.1% stake in MMI MR BOB MORTON, chairman of Vistec, could take a 36.1 per cent stake in MMI, the financial and corporate marketing and communication group, following a refinancing. He is subscribing for 2.1m new shares at 5p and 75 per cent of the shares not taken up in a 3m offering to existing shareholders. Stratagem Group is subscribing for 900,000 new shares and 25 per cent of those not taken up. The refinancing is necessary as MMI's net assets are less than half its called up share capital. The offering is on a 1-for-2.88 basis at 5p each. Mr Morton's maximum holding could then be 5.3m shares, or 36.1 per cent of the enlarged capital with Stratagem having 1.65m or 11.2 per cent. The Takeover Panel has agreed to waive any obligation for Mr Morton to make an offer for the company, subject to the transactions being approved at an EGM. On completion of the placing Mr Morton will become chairman of MMI and could eventually make it a shell company for his private interests. MMI also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 383,000 for the 14 months to February 28, against profits of Pounds 317,000 for 1990. There is no final dividend (1p) making the total for the period 0.25p (1.25p). MMI's shares closed at 7p, down 3 1/2 p.</p>

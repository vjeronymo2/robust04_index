			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TREATMENT OF ART TEACHER PROTESTED  </P> <P> I am writing to protest the arbitrary action taken by the Palos Verdes  Peninsula Unified School District administration against one of our most  dedicated and outstanding high school teachers, Chizuko de Queiroz (Times, May  12). She has worked in the school district for 27 years and has been  chairperson of the art department for 10 years.  </P> <P> The entire school faculty sent a petition to Dr. Jack Price (district  superintendent) and approximately 200 of her students signed another petition  demanding to have their colleague or teacher return to the classroom.  </P> <P> The district administration removed her from the classroom due to a medical  opinion which is contrary to the teacher's own physician's evaluation and the  consistent evaluation of the district's appointed medical doctor for the last  five years. The teacher suffered an industrial (on-the-job) injury while  teaching in 1983. Since then she has remained teaching with the district where  her evaluations remained excellent.  </P> <P> The teacher was removed from the classroom several days after she complained at  a school meeting about overcharging her school supplies account. Was she  dismissed because she complained that the district purchased art supplies from  a retailer rather than a wholesaler at a cost of over $500 more?  </P> <P> This teacher should be returned to the classroom immediately.  </P> <P> BRIGITTE SCHUEGRAF  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

A survey shows that the airport accommodated 63,000 planes  and transported 7.6 million passengers last year without  airport-related incidents.    An official of the airport attributed the good results to  imposing ten measures to ensure safety and on-the-job  responsibility.    While reinforcing safety checks and inviting specialists to  give lectures, airport authorities have increased the number of  tours of inspection at the airport.    Last year the airport handled 1,310 passengers with  incomplete boarding papers and false identity cards as well as  193 persons without tickets. Numerous contraband goods were  also confiscated.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Survey of 3,000 teachers NEARLY one in five teachers in England and Wales expects to leave the profession within the next five years, but the great majority of teachers are satisfied with their positions, according to an independent survey of teacher motivation published yesterday. The survey of more than 3,000 teachers, conducted by a University of London research team, found four fifths of teachers dissatisfied with their status in the community, and two thirds complaining of an unmanageable workload. Almost half wanted to see a reduction in their working time outside school hours. The survey response rate was only 36 per cent, and the report warns that the survey may give undue weight to the opinions of the disaffected. However, the report gives little encouragement for government plans to extend performance pay for teachers. Only 3 per cent of the teachers surveyed believed it would have a significant positive impact on morale and motivation. The majority said the most important factors for their motivation were good relations with pupils and colleagues, management responsibility and helping pupils to achieve. What Makes Teachers Tick?

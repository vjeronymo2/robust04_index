			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] Government planned to cut the general export  incentive scheme (GEIS) by about half its present budget in the  1995/96 fiscal year, a Trade and Industry Department spokesman  said yesterday.    He confirmed that a R[Rand] 500m-R800m cut would be a first  step towards phasing out the incentive scheme, which was in  contravention of GATT. But at least some of the savings from  eliminating GEIS would be used to finance supply-side measures.    A plan to achieve the cut had not been finalised and  "several  alternatives that differ substantially" were being discussed by  the National Economic Forum's trade policy task force. A  decision was expected next month.    Industry sources said there was strong resistance from  sections of the business community to an approach suggested by  the Trade and Industry Department. It is understood the  department wants to change the criteria for qualifying, rather  than make an across-the- board cut.    The approach would harm industries that are especially  dependent on the export subsidies, particularly the steel  industry. A source said a battle was expected over the next few  weeks.    It is also understood industry is hoping SA will negotiate  an  extension of the benefits beyond the December 31 1997 cut-off.  Talk is that SA's trading partners are willing to allow the  scheme to continue for up to another three years. The spokesman  said an extension would have to be negotiated with the World  Trade Organisation.    The demand for GEIS subsidies has been growing rapidly.    The department said the R1,67bn budget in the past fiscal  year would have been exceeded if it had not been for the  "significant" backlog of claims.    The NEF has set up a subcommittee to look at supply-side  measures that could make up for the cut in GEIS.    These could include giving greater access to duty-free  imports.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / A bed of thorns for French partners FRANCE'S Socialist President Francois Mitterrand once said of his first cabinet meeting in cohabitation with a centre-right government: 'I was surrounded by men, 60 per cent of whom hated me and 80 per cent of whom fought against me'. However, by the end of the two-year period of cohabitation between 1986 and 1988 the wily president had not only out-manoeuvred Mr Jacques Chirac, the conservative premier, on the international stage, but thrashed him in the 1988 presidential elections. The critical question for Mr Mitterrand, and for the conservatives, now waiting with ill-disguised patience to return to power after the second round of voting for the parliamentary elections tomorrow, is whether the president will find it quite so easy to thwart the government in the next round of cohabitation. The French constitution is vague on the division of power between the president and parliament. French presidents, unlike their US counterparts, do not have a right of veto over new legislation. The president can refuse to sign decrees, but the government is permitted to bypass the president by implementing its proposals through parliament. Mr Chirac did this and went on to dominate the domestic agenda. However, Mr Mitterrand held sway in the international arena claiming that, as head of state, the president is responsible for foreign affairs and defence. The constitution is not clear on this issue. But Mr Mitterrand insisted on representing France at international summits thereby upstaging the unfortunate Mr Chirac. In theory President Mitterrand should be more vulnerable now than he was at the start of the last cohabitation government. He is older, at 76, and frailer following his prostate surgery last autumn. He may also lose his political power base if Mr Michel Rocard, former French premier, succeeds in his 'big bang' plan to abandon the Socialist Party, which Mr Mitterrand revived in 1971, to form a centre-left alliance with the ecologists. Moreover the conservatives are on course tomorrow to win up to 480 of the National Assembly's 577 seats. This should give them the highest majority of any French government since the early 19th century and make it even easier to force through domestic legislation. The scale of the majority may also strengthen the conservatives' claims that they have a mandate from the electorate to extend their influence over foreign affairs. However, the new conservative government's position may not be as strong as it seems. There are serious splits between the Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) on critical issues, notably in foreign policy. The UDF is more enthusiastic than the RPR about continuing the socialists' policy of forging close economic relations between France and Germany. It is also less aggressive than the RPR in its calls for the renegotiation of the agricultural reforms agreed last year by the European Community. President Mitterrand has in the past proved to be adept at exploiting such tensions. He fired his first shot this week by curbing Mr Chirac's calls for his resignation with a series of well-placed leaks that he might retaliate by refusing to nominate a prime minister from the RPR, Mr Chirac's party. These leaks have already caused chaos on the right. Mr Chirac has no wish to be prime minister again, believing that it might lessen his chances in the 1995 presidential elections. However he does want to ensure that the premier is an RPR candidate, ideally the apparently malleable Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Chirac has already started to back-track. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, has been making conciliatory noises to Mr Mitterrand in an attempt to use Mr Chirac's predicament to further his own prime ministerial ambitions. The hapless Mr Balladur has followed suit in a bid to repair the damage caused by his party leader. Yesterday's Le Figaro offered sound advice to all the conservatives. 'Watch out]' it said. 'The leaders of the RPR and UDF are walking into a minefield. Even the smallest of their disagreements will be used against them.'</p>

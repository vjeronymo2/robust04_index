			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexander Barrios, from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] There was student violence in Caracas for a fourth  consecutive day. The disturbances began early Tuesday morning at  Moran Avenue when students from the Jose de San Martin  Vocational School began protesting the death last Thursday of  German Sotillo, from the Fermin Toro School. The students also  protested over the announced hike in student transportation  rates which might begin within the next few days, according to  Juan Landaeta, a student from the Jose de San Martin Vocational  School. [passage indistinct]    The students detained a grocery truck, with license plate  number 624XCO, from the Diaz Supermarkets. After residents of  the area looted the truck, the students burned it. Five public  transportation buses were also detained for over three hours at  the Jose de San Martin School.    After several hours of clashes, the students tried to call  for a truce in exchange for the release of some of their fellow  students who had been arrested, but this did not occur.    Students from the Andres Bello, Santos, Michelena, and  Rafael  Urdaneta Schools later joined the protests at Mexico Avenue, in  front of the Andres Bello School. One store was looted during  this demonstration. The Metropolitan Police are conducting  investigations.</p>

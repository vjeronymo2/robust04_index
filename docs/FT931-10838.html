			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher dives in If the misunderstandings surrounding the mere announcement of a possible merger between Kingfisher and Darty are anything to go by, then the consummation of such a deal could prove a marriage made in hell. Though Kingfisher is being coy about the details, it appears embarked on a risky course. It could end up staking Pounds 1bn or so for a company about which it knows little, operating in a country of which it knows nothing. A link-up with Darty would solve the strategic conundrum of what to do with the weakly-placed Comet. Darty is an attractive business. It is the clear market leader in France with operating margins that must embarrass Comet. In time, considerable operating benefits could develop. The worry lies in the financial structuring of any deal. It seems improbable that Kingfisher would stage a heavy rights issue to fund the merger. It is more likely to offer staggered payments to lock in Darty's management, which owns most of the company. Darty's desire to secure its financial position is easy to understand. The French retail market is heading for tough times as the economy flirts with recession. Still laden with heavy debts from its buy-out, Darty's management may not wish to struggle through unaided. A stock market issue would be difficult. A merger with a deep-pocketed retailer must appear attractive. In his 10 years at the helm, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy has developed a near-legendary reputation for caution. It would be extraordinary indeed if he were to jeopardise it now when the downside risks are so glaring.</p>

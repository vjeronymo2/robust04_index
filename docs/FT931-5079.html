			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Extreme right makes sweeping gains in German elections GERMANY'S extreme rightwing Republicans stole votes from mainstream parties to make sweeping gains in local and city elections in the state of Hesse yesterday. The results stunned the Social Democrats (SPD), and gave an unexpected lift to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), especially in large cities. Against all expectations, the SPD share of the vote slumped by 7 per cent, while the CDU lost only about 2 per cent of its support, according to early estimates. The CDU displaced the SPD as the largest single party in the Franfurt and Kassel city councils, exit polls showed. In Frankfurt, the largest and richest city in the state, the Republicans, led by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former SS officer, took 10 per cent of the vote. In one depressed part of the inner city they gained 14 per cent. The CDU, which won 33 per cent against the SPD's 31 per cent share, ruled out any coalition with the Republicans. The likely outcome appeared to be a governing coalition comprising SPD, CDU and the Greens, the environmental party. Fewer than 70 per cent of voters went to the polls, compared with a 77 per cent turnout in the last election in 1989. Statewide, the Republicans collected an estimated 7.7 per cent, compared with less than 1 per cent for far-right parties last time. However heartening for the embattled Mr Kohl, the result - in one of the richest German states - will fuel domestic and international fears about the rise to respectability of Germany's extreme right wing. The result is likely to concentrate efforts by the government and opposition in Bonn to fill the political vacuum at the centre before next year's wave of state, European and federal parliamentary elections. The ruling coalition and opposition are at present hopelessly divided on a range of issues, including a solidarity pact to pay for German unification and the apparently unstoppable flood of asylum seekers. Voters are also increasingly anxious about the economy's slide into recession and rising unemployment. While the Republicans gained support for their policies of containing immigration and deporting 'criminal foreigners', other smaller parties also benefited from protest votes. The Greens, which are not currently represented in the federal parliament, increased their support in Frankfurt from around 10 per cent to almost 15 per cent. The liberal Free Democrats failed to take enough votes to gain representation on the city council, but they improved their standing statewide with an estimated 6 per cent of the vote.</p>

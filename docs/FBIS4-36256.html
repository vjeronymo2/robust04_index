			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to the Knesset -- </F> live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Regarding the letter: I  have written no letter to 'Arafat. I made no promises to  'Arafat or to the PLO. I never promised to establish new  Christian institutes. Since I am certain Knesset Member [MK]  Matza feels strongly about Jerusalem, I suggest that we do not  tell the whole world that here in the Knesset there are people  who are willing to give up on Jerusalem. This is totally  unfounded. Jerusalem is dear to us all, and I am speaking to MK  Ze'evi as well. [passage omitted]    I would like to describe the Israeli Government stand --  past, present, and future -- regarding Jerusalem. According to  the view, stand, and action of the Israeli Government, Jerusalem  will not be divided, and we will accept no division of  Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be no Berlin; no wall will be erected  in it and it will not be split in two. It will remain united,  according to the map the Knesset ratified, under Israeli  sovereignty. It will not be part of the autonomy, and the  autonomy institutions will not be run from Jerusalem. This is  our position, and this is the purpose of our struggle. Before I  start debating with the Likud, I would like to tell MK 'Imanu'el  Zismann: The problem with Jerusalem is that there are two  religious worlds that hold Jerusalem sacred -- the Christian and  the Muslim worlds. I believe we reached a truly historical  agreement with the Vatican in Jerusalem as it is -- united,  Israel's capital, under Israeli sovereignty. This kind of event  takes place once in every 1994 years, and it happened this  January. Also, we want to tell the Muslims that we have no  intention of hurting their religious feelings or institutions;  not theirs, not the Christians', and there is no need to mention  the Jews because this is our capital. It is self evident.    We made a supreme effort to salvage Jerusalem from the  autonomy, and everything we see is the result of an effort, not  just a story about how someone tried to fix this, that, or the  other. We did not want to fix anything. To the best of my  knowledge -- and I know about this more than anyone -- we came  up with the idea of Jericho only to avoid the demand that the  autonomy institutions -- some of which already were in Jerusalem  -- be placed in Jerusalem. I am very sorry that people here mix  various political matters together. Not everything is a  document. When negotiations are held notes, documents, and  things are exchanged.    I would want to tell MK Dan Meridor: There is no question of  credibility; there is a debate over interpretations. Dan, with  all due respect, your interpretation is totally unfounded. The  document does not speak of institutions that will be  established. As a lawyer and one who speaks of honesty, you  should be honest. No commitment was made to the PLO or to  'Arafat. This is an attempt by the opposition to portray the  government stand in reverse. I do not mind you doing that, only  it does not bolster Jerusalem.    Now I would like to comment on what 'Arafat said, why  Minister Shahal denied it, and why it is credible. In  Johannesburg, 'Arafat said that he did not want to sign the  document in Cairo before he receives a letter about Jerusalem.  But the letter had existed before Cairo. It was no accident  that the letter was written to Holst. It was written to Holst  to tell 'Arafat: You have nothing to do with this. No  commitment was made to 'Arafat regarding institutions that will  be established in the future. The letter only describes the  state of affairs as it was when the letter was written. There  are thousands of letters in the Foreign Ministry; do you want me  to disclose them all? This is not a document; this is a letter.  MK Meridor should know the difference between the two. The  letter was not written to 'Arafat to avoid establishing a link  between Jerusalem and 'Arafat. The words PLO or PLO  institutions do not exist in the letter. It mentions East  Jerusalem because it does not pertain to the autonomy. You are  making an attempt to reverse the facts.    Now, why Shahal was right. 'Arafat said three things that  are not true: One, that he did sign in Cairo because he was  given a letter in Cairo; no letter was given to him in Cairo.  Two, 'Arafat was given no letter regarding Jerusalem. Third,  the things that were written to Holst were stated from this  podium as well. [as heard] [passage omitted]    Hence, I hereby determine that nothing was kept secret from  the Knesset; that nothing was promised to the PLO; that no  letter was sent to 'Arafat. There is a matter of interpretation  and I would like to say clear things about this as well.  Several reporters were offended, and thus they joined those  charging us with a lack of credibility. There is no credibility  problem. We spoke the truth. When things were presented to the  Knesset, there was no such letter. Had there been one, we would  probably have appended it to the documents despite the fact that  it is a letter and not a document. This letter was not marked  secret, confidential, or top secret. It was published as it is.  [passage omitted]    I would like to add one more thing. If the Palestinians  attempt to establish a political authority beyond that which  existed when the letter was written, they have no [word  indistinct] to do so. If they are illegal, they will be canceled.    [Passage omitted] With the permission of the speaker, I  would  like to opine that the world today is divided along different  lines than in the past. Almost all matters of importance have  no boundaries. Almost all of those that have boundaries, their  boundaries lost much of their importance. What are the  important things in our world today? Science, technology,  economy, ecology, and freedom, and they have no boundaries. In  fact, even strategy today is measured in ballistic boundaries  more than by geographic borders.    Furthermore, as a result of the borders' losing their value  and the rising value of relations, the three major factors of  international policy making lost much of their importance. The  three were political parties, armies, and superpowers. Almost  all of the events in the past decade took place without the  three. Russian Communism collapsed not due to military  operations, the establishment of a party, or superpowers's  intervention. A communist and television toppled communism. In  South Africa, a tremendous event took place: The black rights  were made equal to those of the whites, ending skin color as a  racist distinction. This was done without superpowers, armies,  or parties. Peronism was toppled by a Peronist. Here in this  region as well, most of the work was done without armies,  superpowers, or parties.    I say that there are many conclusions to be drawn from this.  The question is where Israel is headed? Backwards or forward?  If Israel wants to move toward the world that has completely  changed, if we want to buy the correct admission ticket, we need  bulldozers to move the conservatives among us to see the world  as it is.    I would like to tell the religious MK's sitting in front of  me: I believe the most difficult struggle for us in the next  century would be to preserve Israel's tradition and uniqueness.  It will be no less difficult a struggle than defending our  borders. To me, the Jewish nation is based on homeland and  tradition. We must prepare for both, and we will do that with  the utmost possible stamina. I know that in this ever changing  world, Israel could not have found its right place had it not  changed itself. What we did in Jericho and Gaza is a historical  and realistic enterprise of the first rank which gives Israel  the necessary fuel to march in this changing world and defend  our historic values, land, the Jewish nation and the residents  of Israel. [passage omitted]    Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset: I will now answer the  query by MK Ya'aqov Shefi [on the relations with the new Italian  Government]. It is inconceivable for Israel to make compromises  with fascism, racism, dictatorship, and discrimination of any  kind. The problem is how one goes about examining this in  complex cases. How do you distinguish between the policy of a  government and policies attributed to some of its members? At  the same time, I would like to say something that is not very  pleasant. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion in the past  we were forced to make compromises with these principles. We  maintained diplomatic relations with a country that professed  racism in the most formal way, namely apartheid. We had  relations with countries that were ran by ugly dictatorships  with cruel murderers at their helm, such as the USSR. I have  not yet recovered from this. We have very complicated problems  being the Jewish nation and the State of Israel. I will not  lie. We are trying hard to observe those principles, but -- and  not only us -- countries maintain diplomatic relations not  because they are in love with some other countries, but because  they believe diplomatic relations would distance the threat and  pressure that country to change its policy. [passage omitted]    As for the question from MK David Magen [regarding the  possible establishment of a Palestinian state]. Let me tell  you: The problem was born in the Camp David accords. That was  the first time the State of Israel gave the Palestinians the  title of the Palestinian people [last three words in English].  When you create a Palestinian people, it is like asking that  this nation demand a Palestinian state. I would also like to  say that anyone believing you can hold 120,000 people in prison  without them crystallizing into a nation is wrong. Had we  remained in Gaza, the number would have grown even further.  Therefore, I have been and am opposed to a Palestinian state, I  am for a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation. I have never made  my position secret, nor did I ever change it. I am only telling  you that the first time autonomy was introduced -- full autonomy  for the Palestinian people and their right requirements [last 10  words in English] -- it was done in the Camp David accords. Do  not run away from this. Be honest once and for all. [passage  omitted]    I would like to thank MK Dalya Itzik for her question  regarding the missiles in North Korea. The United States has  warned us that one cannot trust North Korea in either word or in  deed. It said that, considering the U.S. strength and comparing  it with ours, we should allow it to head the campaign against  the building of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and  selling them to other countries. You are asking me, in terms of  political logic, who is better suited to head this campaign, the  United States or Israel. I will tell you, after seriously  considering the answer, it is better that the United States do  this. And it does. The United States has now garnered the  support of the United Nations. This struggle concerns us all,  and we trust them. We have no reason to doubt the United  States. We know the U.S. intentions, we see its acts, and I  welcome everything it does.

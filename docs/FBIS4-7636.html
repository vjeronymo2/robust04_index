			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Benjamino Andreatta </F> for PULS by unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given: "Italy Interested in Stability in Macedonia"]    [Text] Just a few days before the parliamentary elections  in Italy, Italian Foreign Minister Benjamino Andreatta gave an  exclusive interview for the weekly PULS (to be published  tomorrow) in which he answered a number of questions related to  political events in Italy, in Europe, and, in particular, the  war in Bosnia. Of course, the accent was on the situation in the  Balkans, more precisely on the situation in the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  in its dispute with neighboring Greece, as well as on general  relations between Italy and Macedonia.    On the importance of the new transport corridor -- the  corridor linking Italy, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and  Turkey, Benjamino Andreatta stated: "Italy is very favorably  viewing the project for the construction of a trans-Balkan  east-west railway and highway corridor that could be a basic  component for pursuing cooperation between the states in this  region, as well as with the surrounding states, one of which is  Italy, due to its geographic position. The initiative was  renewed at the recent meeting in Sofia attended by  representatives of transport ministries of the interested  countries, when the `Memorandum of Understanding' was signed,  confirming the commitment and good will for the realization of  this project."    "The realization of the corridor," Andreatta emphasized,  "would enable Macedonia to be better and more equally included  in the system of European transport networks. Soon the BERS  [not further specified] organization will send a mission to  Skopje to determine priority spheres of involvement."    Commenting on the development of relations between the two  countries, the Italian foreign minister also said:    "As you know, Italy has actively contributed to the  stabilization of the new republic born after the dissolution of  the former Yugoslavia, by assisting its gradual involvement in  international life and activities. It is doing so with the firm  belief that the association with Macedonia will have a positive  effect on the realization of a gradual and desired stabilization  of the entire Balkan region. In this context, Rome decided to  establish diplomatic relations with Skopje on 16 December of  last year. As a matter of fact, even before the establishment  of diplomatic relations with Italy, continuing activity for  support of your country had begun in the relevant international  organizations, in reply to requests for economic aid submitted  by the Macedonian Government. Parallel to that, Italy  persistently supported the admission of your country to the  Central European Initiative within the purview of supporting and  approaching Macedonia, and it also expressed its wholehearted  support to its admission to the CSCE [Conference for Security  and Cooperation in Europe] which has, unfortunately, not yet  been accomplished, due to the opposition of some member states."    "On the basis of such premises," Benjamino Andreatta pointed  out, "there is a lot of room for strengthening bilateral  cooperation, particularly on the economic and cultural plane.  We will dedicate our attention to that in near future, with the  hope that in the meantime conditions of stability and peace will  be reestablished in the Balkans, that will ease the  intensification of bilateral cooperation with all the countries  in the region, including the Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia."    About the dispute with Greece, as well as its implications  on  security in the region, the Italian foreign minister emphasized  that Italy was deeply concerned about the possible negative  consequences on stability in the region after the restrictive  measures undertaken by Athens. "Italy," Andreata emphasized,  "together with the other European partners, never misses the  opportunity to present that concern to Athens." He also pointed  out that the Italian side looks forward to the resumption of  direct negotiations between the two sides as soon as possible,  in order to create prerequisites for a gradual normalization of  bilateral relations between Macedonia and Greece. "In that  regard, it will be necessary, more precisely it will be  indispensable for both the sides, to demonstrate the needed  flexibility," Andreata said in his exclusive interview for PULS.</p>

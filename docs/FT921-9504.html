			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: EC plan for carbon tax may become test case THE European Community's plan to introduce a carbon tax could become an important test case in the mounting conflict between trade and environmental interests. The plan is still in its early stages, but Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's environment commissioner, has made clear that he wants to have a firm proposal to display at the Rio earth summit in June. He expects that event to provide a forum for thorough debate of the issues. The tax is by far the most ambitious environment measure ever contemplated. It will affect 350m people and drive up the cost of the most basic industrial commodity, energy. Its fate is therefore a focus of intense environmental interest. The tax would be imposed on all carbon fuels - oil, gas and coal - and on other fuels in proportion to their energy content. The aim is to cut harmful emissions and help combat global warming, in addition to encouraging energy saving. The tax would be introduced at the rate of Dollars 3 a barrel of oil, and increased by Dollars 1 a year until it reached Dollars 10. Mr Ripa di Meana hopes to start it next year, but that schedule may prove too tight politically. The tax would affect trade in two ways. First, it would unilaterally raise the cost of EC exports and thereby blunt the Community's competitiveness in world markets. For this reason it is strongly opposed by a wide swathe of EC industry. Second, as non-EC countries see it, it would create a kind of invisible trade barrier by adding to the entry cost for outside businesses seeking to set up production plants within the EC. This barrier would be especially high for companies from the third world who had not adjusted their technologies to the rigours of a highly taxed market. Because of all these conflicting pressures, prospects for the tax are far from clear. In its favour, a wide range of EC ministers - finance, economic, environmental and energy - have supported it in principle. They could hardly do otherwise because of the tax's self-evidently worthy aims. Mr Ripa di Meana's dilemma is that he is keen to win approval for a measure that will show that the EC is serious about safeguarding the environment. But he also knows that, by itself, the EC's carbon tax would make little difference. At the moment, the EC accounts for only 13 per cent of world carbon dioxide emissions, and many large sectors of EC industry like steel and cement would be exempt. It will only have meaning if the EC's example prompts other countries to follow suit. That means mainly the US and Japan, but the chances of either of these two enacting a similar tax are very remote. The US has a deep antipathy to energy taxes, and Japan argues that its pollution regulations are already tough enough and it does not need any taxes on top of them. Similarly the third world does not appear ready to enact energy taxes; many countries take the view that this is the responsibility of the gas-guzzling industrial countries.</p>

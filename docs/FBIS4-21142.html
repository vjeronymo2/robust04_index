Galindo said that efforts are being made in Panama to  cooperate in the antidrug-trafficking struggle and that the  United States has exaggerated in saying the contrary.    "We are all intent on ending drug trafficking and money  laundering once and for all in our country, because it is  difficult to say it will end, but it is incorrect to say nothing  has been done," he said.    The presidential candidate said there are authorities who  are  trying to fight narcotrafficking, but he added there are groups  of criminals who attempt to evade the security system, because  Panama is a country with vast coasts along both oceans, which  makes it even more difficult to control.    Galindo also mentioned the charges against the former  government. He said Panamanians cannot live permanently in the  past but must learn from experiences from the past and look to  the future, because otherwise "we will be living in the past,  and the future will be the one that will lose."</p>

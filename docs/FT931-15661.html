			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Freshfields heads league of takeover advisers FRESHFIELDS, the City of London solicitors' firm, has emerged as the leading adviser to companies and financial advisers involved in UK public takeovers in 1992. The firm was involved in 14 UK public bids with a combined value of Pounds 4.94bn, according to a league table ranking lawyers by the value of takeovers in which they acted as advisers. The table produced by Acquisitions Monthly magazine shows that the four leading firms finished the year comfortably ahead of the rest. Norton Rose was second for its role in 14 deals with a combined value of Pounds 4.54bn, Linklaters &amp; Paines third with 15 deals worth Pounds 4.47bn and Clifford Chance fourth with nine deals worth Pounds 3.89bn. All four owe their rankings to their involvement in either the Pounds 3.7bn Hongkong and Shanghai/Midland Bank deal or the Pounds 3.1bn merger between Reed International and the Dutch publisher Elsevier. Freshfields' top ranking confirms its position as the leading mergers and acquisitions law firm, having finished second in 1991 and first in 1990. The firm has strong links with merchant banks and acted for financial advisers in six deals worth Pounds 1.54bn last year. Notably, it acted for Barclays de Zoete Wedd on Tomkins' Pounds 933m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall and for Baring Brothers on TI's Pounds 469 takeover of Dowty. Slaughter and May, by contrast, slipped to seventh place last year after finishing first in 1991. The 20 most active UK law firms - acting for companies as opposed to financial advisers - were involved in 92 UK public takeovers in 1992 with a combined value of Pounds 23bn compared with 145 deals worth Pounds 15bn in 1991, 200 deals worth Pounds 24bn in 1990 and 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn in 1989. This demonstrates the steep decline in merger and acquisition activity since the end of the 1980s.  ----------------------------------------------------------------        LEGAL ADVISERS TO FINANCIAL ADVISERS OR COMPANIES              INVOLVED IN UK PUBLIC TAKEOVERS: 1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Law Firm                         No. of deals    Value, Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Freshfields                        14              4,942 2 Norton Rose                        14              4,539 3 Linklaters &amp; Paines                15              4,471 4 Clifford Chance                     9              3,894 5 Richards Butler                     2              1,718 6 Herbert Smith                       8              1,447 7 Slaughter and May                  10              1,361 8 Ashurst Morris Crisp               10              1,093 9 Gouldens                            3                818 10 Simmons &amp; Simmons                  6                685  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Ranked by value of transactions based on completed and failed offers for UK public companies and including only those advisers involved in two or more transactions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Acquisitions Monthly.  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / East European consumers take national shape BULGARIANS may not have much to cheer about, but at least they have twice as many freezers as Poles. On the other hand, Poles, on average, have twice as many video-recorders as Czechs and Slovaks. European Russians stand twice as much chance of having a domestic telephone than Hungarians. But none of the newly independent east European countries can boast more home satellite dishes than Hungary. These findings appear in 'The East European Consumer'*, a report published yesterday by Mintel, the UK's leading market research analyst. Mintel questioned about 1,000 people in each of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and European Russia, from a wide range of occupations and locations. The survey suggested that Czech, Slovak and Hungarian households were the most likely to be equipped with the more basic consumer durables, such as a washing machine and television, while European Russian and Bulgarian homes came bottom of that particular ladder. When it comes to one of the greatest status symbols of all - a personal motor car - the picture in east Europe is as varied as with other luxury items. Car ownership is at its highest in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, with 207 and 204 cars per thousand inhabitants respectively; in Russia the figure is closer to 84. By contrast, car ownership is about 600 per thousand people in the US and just over 400 in the UK. The survey also revealed widely different attitudes on leisure activities. Czechoslovaks were found to be keenest on sport, with one in four of the sample having a sporting recreation, against just one in ten Bulgarians, who topped the list for those spending time in cafes and bars. Listening to Western radio was found to be most popular in Czechoslovakia and European Russia. Mintel also tried to gauge more intangible aspects of life for the region's consumers, by asking questions designed to ascertain feelings of optimism versus pessimism, and of being risk-inclined or cautious. It found that while 'there is considerable variance in the responses', the overall view from the region was one of 'cautious optimism'. Optimism about future economic prospects was found to be at its highest in Hungary and Poland, and reached lowest ebb in European Russia. Czechs and Slovaks evinced the least inclination to take risks - perhaps, hazards the study, because 'they certainly have the best equipped households in the survey' - while the Polish sample indicated the highest number backing risk-inclined statements such as: 'There's not enough excitement in my life' and 'I would gladly live in another country.' Mr Peter Ayton, Mintel's senior European analyst, said that while crucial statistics, such as those relating to personal disposable income, were either inaccurate or unavailable, the study offered a 'guide to the relative prosperity of the region.' Within the region - with a population of some 328m, against the EC's 327m - the study pinpoints a wide range of economic data, from gross domestic product per capita to washing machines and other consumer durables per household. *The East European Consumer 1992; published by Mintel International Group, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

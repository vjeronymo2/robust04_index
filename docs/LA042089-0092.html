			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FAILS TO OUST BOARD OF AILING SAN PEDRO PENINSULA HOSPITAL  </P> <P> A month of controversy over who should control financially ailing San Pedro  Peninsula Hospital ended in less than half an hour Tuesday night when an effort  to replace the present 15-member board of directors collapsed.  </P> <P> Members of San Pedro Peninsula Health Services -- the community corporation  that owns the hospital and elects the board -- overwhelmingly voted to support  the present board. As a result, a dissident group of corporate members never  offered its expected motion to recall the board and elect its own proposed  slate of directors.  </P> <P> In making the motion of support, John Greenwood, a former member of the Los  Angeles Unified School District board, called hospital directors heroes and  said they have provided a "strong voice of leadership" in solving hospital  problems that led to an estimated $8 million in losses during 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Of 229 corporate members who packed the hospital auditorium for the special  election meeting, only six opposed the motion of support in a show of hands.  </P> <P> Robert L. Hansen, chairman of the dissident Committee to Save San Pedro  Peninsula Hospital, conceded that the group lost its battle to persuade the  community that the present board is unable to solve the hospital's problems.  The committee has contended that those problems could lead to bankruptcy or a  takeover by a profit-making chain.  </P> <P> At the same time, Hansen said he believes the committee members who  successfully petitioned for the meeting succeeded in their purpose of informing  the community about the hospital crisis.  </P> <P> "The severe financial condition of the hospital is now open and obvious to all  of the current board of directors, whose duty it is to correct the condition,"  he said.  </P> <P> Larry Orosz, hospital board chairman and an emergency room physician at the  hospital, made a strong case for the board. "The board has not done a perfect  job, but it is willing to learn," he said in opening the meeting. "This is  better than replacing them with others that we do not know," Orosz said,  referring to the committee's proposed slate of directors.  </P> <P> Launched more than a month ago when petitions were filed calling for the  special board election, the fight for control of the hospital got into high  gear last week when the hospital board and executives labeled the election  meeting a "hostile takeover" attempt that could destroy the 64-year-old  community hospital.  </P> <P> Hospital officials have said steps already are being taken to put the troubled  hospital back in the black. They also speculated that the dissident group might  be planning to sell the hospital or bring back the former president, Rodney  Aymond, who was forced to resign Jan. 25 after the board blamed him for  management problems. Hansen denied those charges.  </P> <P> Despite the acrimony that preceded it, Tuesday's meeting had an atmosphere of  conciliation.  </P> <P> "A lot of good has come out of this," Orosz said in his opening statement. "One  benefit is that attention has been brought to bear on (the hospital's)  problem."  </P> <P> He said "there will be better communication" with the community, including  annual or semi-annual meetings of the corporation, which Orosz said has not met  for at least 15 years. Corporate members have voted for hospital directors by  mail.  </P> <P> Hansen said harmony is needed to solve the hospital's financial crisis, adding  that the committee "will support the corrective action of the board of  directors" while remaining "vigilant and concerned."  </P> <P> However, Tuesday's atmosphere of conciliation is not being extended to a  lawsuit filed last week in Long Beach Superior Court by a group of San Pedro  cardiologists aimed at identifying authors of an anonymous nine-page document  circulated in San Pedro during the hospital battle.  </P> <P> The document asserts that the hospital pays above-market rates to physicians  for certain contract services and that a "power group" of physicians benefiting  from these contracts controls the hospital for their own benefit. The citizens  committee denied authorship, but Hansen said the committee agrees with the  document's contents.  </P> <P> Dr. Bruce N. Goldreyer, chief of staff at the hospital and a member of the  medical group that was named in the anonymous document, said the suit will be  pressed because it "bears no relationship" to the hospital corporation or  makeup of the hospital board.  </P> <P> "It is a conspiracy to interfere with my ability to practice, to defame me and  my practice, that began before the recall attempt," Goldreyer said. He said he  believes some people associated with the citizens committee are involved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE KEY PLAYERS  </P></p>

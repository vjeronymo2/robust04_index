			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> CARROLL OFFERS GRACEFUL SET AT WESTWOOD MARQUIS  </P> <P> Barbara Carroll, who opened a six-week engagement Tuesday at the Westwood  Marquis, has credits as a pianist that go back to the 52nd Street era. In those  days, she was strictly a be-bopper, probably the first woman to embrace the new  movement of that time.  </P> <P> She has since settled into a more conservative style in which grace and  delicacy have taken over where energy and drive once dominated. Harmonically,  however, she has developed to the point where she can bring out all the  richness of a Gershwin or Sondheim melody.  </P> <P> Three numbers into the set she began singing. The balance of her show was  divided about equally between vocals and instrumentals. Carroll lays no claim  to her mastery as a singer. If she has a vibrato it is imperceptible, since she  never holds on to a note long enough to need one. Yet her treatment of the  antic humor in "I Wish I Were in Love Again" managed to fit the material  perfectly. Her attempt to sing a Billie Holiday blues was entirely too dainty.  </P> <P> That Carroll is a talented composer came to light late in the set, when she  offered a touching waltz, "Too Soon," in tribute to the late Bill Evans. More  original pieces along these lines, and fewer like the dull Cy Coleman songs  from the new Broadway show "City of Angels," would be welcome.  </P> <P> So too would a bass player. Though she prefers to work alone, there can be  little doubt that a strong bassist would help immeasurably in bringing to  Carroll's performance a swinging essence that was not too often noticeable. The  loneliness of the long-distance pianist was never more obvious than in the  final number, "Cute," with all those empty breaks.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, just as she has found a perfect niche in her regular job at the  Carlyle Hotel in New York, Carroll seems well attuned to the requirements of  the Westwood Marquis. Her opening night attracted some of the same patrons who  have heard her on Manhattan's East Side, and who are clearly charmed by her  unpretentiously pleasant delivery.  </P> <P> She will be at the Marquis Tuesdays through Saturdays.

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Support likely from French investors Mr Christian Cambier, the French head of the association for Eurotunnel shareholders, expresses resignation on the subject of yesterday's rights issue. 'We have no choice', he said when asked if individual shareholders would subscribe to the proposed capital increase. Mr Cambier, who represents an estimated 1,500 of Eurotunnel's 600,000 shareholders, expressed dismay at the decline in the company's share price but said that investors in the company were 'a special breed'. The French, in particular, he claimed, 'have a faith in this kind of grand project. They have stuck with it and they believe it it will succeed'. The attitude of Mr Cambier and his compatriots is critical. French investors hold more than 60 per cent of the shares in Eurotunnel, the majority, like in Britain, dispersed among individuals. In responding to the rights, however, their faith will put to the test. Like their British counterparts, the French underwriters had privately expressed concerns about the capital increase. 'There was some tough talking but we think the terms are acceptable and we are quite confident that investors will respond.' In the event, a group of French heavyweights have been signed up for the underwriting. Headed by Banque Indosuez, the lead managers include the recently privatised Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned Credit Lyonnais and the French arm of SBC. The co-lead managers include Credit Agricole, Banque Paribas, and the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state financing institution which is one of Eurotunnel's largest investors with about 2 per cent. Many of their target institutional investors appear ready to grin and bear the burden of the issue. 'They will face a lot of pressure to support the issue, including from the French government', said one broker. He believed that shareholders such as the recently privatised Union des Assurances de Paris would throw their weight behind the capital increase. 'There is a lot of political capital at stake in this project. I think the bigger investors, like some of the underwriters, will have been made aware of this.' One insurance company said it would be looking at the prospectus very carefully. 'It may be cheaper to reduce our stake now than later', he said. What is already clear is that a bumpy and uncertain ride is in prospect. With so many small shareholders it is hard to predict the outcome. 'The fact that the value of the shares has fallen so far from the peak in 1989 will provoke a lot of resentment. There is also a feeling that underwriters have added to the downward pressure on the shares to increase their returns. But if shareholders have stuck with it this long, they may see little point in bailing out now,' argued one analyst.</p>

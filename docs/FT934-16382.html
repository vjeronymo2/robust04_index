			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading OPTIMISM continued in derivatives trading with a mix of rumours of an early interest rate cut mingling with relief at the stemming of the Russian crisis, Christine Buckley writes. The December contract on the FT-SE 100, in good health after the previous day's performance, began trading at a strong premium to the cash market. It pushed up to reach a day's high of 3,127 though that peak was short-lived and most of the high-level trading centred around 3,124-25. Trading talk in the morning had Salomon as a keen buyer in a market that the large institutions largely watched from the sidelines. Independent traders took the most active roles and interest was keen from US buyers. Volume was steady at 8,656 contracts. The arrival of sellers in the afternoon sent the contract drifting and December closed at 3,118 - a 13 point lead over the fair value premium to cash. Some words of caution were uttered by bearish traders who felt that the continuation of Monday's enthusiastic buying of the December contract meant that the market had run ahead of itself. Traded options saw good activity with volume jumping to 46,462 lots, more than 20,000 up on the previous session. Of the stock options Asda was highest at 10,493 with confidence in the food retailers buoyant after a recent strong buy note by BZW.</p>

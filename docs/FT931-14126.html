			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / NHS managers urged to woo private sector NATIONAL Health Service man-agers should work more closely with the private sector, according to a government circular. A letter from Mr Gordon Greenshields, NHS director of finance, going today to hospital and health authority finance managers, calls for more joint ventures with the private sector, leasing arrangements and market testing the possibilities of contracting-out patient and support services. The letter, which tells managers to be 'innovative and receptive' to new ideas for increasing the use of private finance, is the department's response to the announcement in the Autumn Statement of arrangements to ease the use of private capital in the public sector. But it reflects the view of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, that the government has taken the sting from the controversy over NHS reforms, and can promote private sector investment without reviving allegations that it wants to privatise the service. Mrs Bottomley said yesterday that the guidance to managers was intended to 'break a few windows' and encourage more collaborative thinking between public and private sectors. 'The old apartheid between the public and private sectors should be buried,' she said. 'The NHS is not for privatisation and it is not for sale. Where there are opportunities for the NHS to involve the private sector in cost-effective initiatives that benefit patients they should be taken.' Mr Greenshields' letter says the greater scope for using private capital in the NHS will mean 'additional resources for health care.' Managers will be told to consider joint ventures in areas such as waste incineration, energy conservation, patient hotels - facilities for people recovering after treatment who no longer require intensive nursing - and other accommodation that could be used by NHS and private patients. Leasing will not count against hospitals' external financing limits or cash allocations, provided it gives better value. Expensive medical equipment like scanners, computers and transport are among areas the department considers suitable for leasing. Market testing of services with significant capital costs is being encouraged. The NHS's laboratory services - regarded by some managers as offering scope for considerable efficiency improvements - will be among the candidates for market testing. The guidance to NHS managers follows talks between Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, and representatives of potential private sector partners.</p>

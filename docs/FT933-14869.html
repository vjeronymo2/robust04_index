			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cliveden to seek public listing THE CLIVEDEN Group, which runs the Buckinghamshire country house as a hotel, (pictured above), is to seek a public listing after reversing into Ifico, a former insurance broker. The house and gardens were donated by the Astor family to the National Trust in 1942. Granted an 80-year lease by the NT, the Cliveden Group have spent some Pounds 12m refurbishing the house. The company achieved a 66.8 per cent occupancy rate and Pounds 207 a night average charge on the 31 bedrooms in the financial year to last October. It made an operating profit of Pounds 427,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.83m but reported a retained loss of Pounds 456,000. Ifico, which became a shell company after selling its insurance broking businesses in 1991, hopes to regain its listing once the transaction has been completed.</p>

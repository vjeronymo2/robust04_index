			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Despatches: The beach is the bottom line - Copacabana Beach / Christina Lamb dons a dental-floss bikini to celebrate 100 years of sun-worship FOR the first 25 years of my life I lived under the misguided impression that beaches were fun but limited places where one went to toast one's body and unwind with the latest paperback before returning to London the colour of a walnut, to the envy of one's pallid friends. Then I moved to Rio de Janeiro and discovered the true meaning of a beach. More precisely, I discovered Copacabana, perhaps the world's most famous beach, which this week celebrates its 100th anniversary. The subject of numerous songs, the name of bars the world over, the birthplace of bossa nova and even the inspiration for a Walt Disney character, Copacabana may be a little shabby these days but still remains Exotica Incarnate and the soul of Brazil. A sweeping crescent of white sand lashed by the Atlantic and backed by craggy hills (nowadays scattered with slums) between a military fort and the Sugarloaf mountain, Copacabana is more than a beach, it is a way of life. Seething with activity almost 24 hours a day, its 4km of sands act as Brazil's best singles bar, open-air nursery, sports fields, aerobics studio, concert venue, the Rio equivalent of housewives' coffee mornings and even the setting for business deals, as well as home to some of Rio's many down-and-outs. My first encounter with the Copacabana phenomenon can only be described as brutal. I had secured a seafront apartment, thrilled by the realisation of a lifetime dream of being gently awoken by the sound of crashing waves. Day One I realised my mistake. Barely had morning broken when I was jolted awake by the earsplitting twanging of a lorry parked outside my window, stacked with amplifiers blasting rock music and sending shudders through my apartment. Pulling on a few clothes (beachwear in Rio can only be described as minimalist), I ventured outside. For as far as I could see the beach was swarming with people - not lying in deckchairs or on towels reading books or sunworshipping in a normal manner, but all involved in some form of activity. These were not tourists. Most foreigners have been frightened off Rio by the tales of pickpocketing and 'dragnet' operations in which bands of streetchildren armed with knives and shards of glass sweep the beach clean of wallets, sunglasses and even sneakers. Instead they were almost all Cariocas - natives of Rio - at play in the city's largest backyard. Two years on I remain astounded by the same daily display. In a bustling scene, a series of bronzed musclemen, surfboards under arm, scatter small children flying bird kites, as they rush into the waters to 'catch' the next wave. Curvaceous women in scarlet lipstick and dental floss bikinis strut along the shore. Everyone is an enviable shade of brown - here skin cancer are dirty words and telling a Brazilian it is fashionable to be pale these days could result in an unfortunate incident. Revelling in air filled with laughter and the aroma of salt and coconut oil, wrinkled old people lower their sagging bodies into the shallows. Groups of beer-guzzling and pot-smoking teenagers squat in the sand puzzling over the meaning of life. Spiritualist groups ceremoniously place small offerings of quails eggs and empty perfume bottles on mounds of sand or cast roses and cosmetics to the waves to please the vain goddess of the sea. Activity reaches a peak at weekends. True Cariocas even have a 'beach address' where they can always be found on Saturday mornings. In among everything hawkers wind their way selling natural sandwiches, foam biscuits, suntan oil and green coconuts. Even the police wear bermuda shorts. At the top of the beach loud cheers emanate from the vigorous volleyball and football matches underway. Exercise bars have been fitted from which grunting athletes practise monkey-like swings. There is so much activity to fit in that some years ago the authorities had to widen the beach through a land fill and install floodlights so that play could continue through the night, when the beach becomes the preserve of prostitutes clad only in G-strings and open jackets baring all to passing motorists. Most bizarre of all is the assortment of people standing with one leg in the air or jerking their arms skywards as they jog in what could be mistaken as audition time for Monty Python's Ministry for Silly Walks. All this in the name of beauty. Brazilians are big on body culture - they are obsessed by the rear end. Not for nothing is Rio's main bikini shop called Bum bum. All across the city gymnasiums pound morning to night with people preparing their body for display on the beach - there are more than 40 studios in Copacabana alone. I tried one for a time with the aim of keeping fit rather than sculpturing my backside but the teacher was relentless. 'Bottoms are not for sitting on girls]' she shouted, if we dared let up on the fight for the perfect buttocks, 'they are for showing off'. If one is too impatient, or simply a lost cause, there is always plastic surgery. Rio has 500 registered plastic surgeries and number one favourite op. is not the nose job but the bottom tuck - perceptible only by suspiciously firm peach-shaped buttocks with narrow scars in the centre, often covered by tattoos. But Copacabana beach is not just for the body beautiful or those who can afford to cheat. Long gone are the days of black tie balls at the Copacabana Palace attended by such notaries as John F Kennedy, Eva Peron, Charles de Gaulle and Gene Kelly, and when Copacabana beach was an essential stop for Hollywood stars. Under Brazilian law beaches are public goods which cannot be fenced off and, since Rio's populist Governor arranged bus routes direct to Copacabana from the poor northern slums, its beach is no longer the preserve of the middle class. It is the one facility accessible to all in the world's most inequitable society. Today the beach has an important social function and many Brazilian sociologists believe it explains why, in spite of lurching from crisis to crisis in which the poor become poorer, the country experiences little social unrest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the </F> Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), by Salim  Badawi; from the "The Event" program; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Badawi] We began our interview with Dr. Habash with  a question about the nature of the PFLP's opposition to the  peace process. Does he oppose the principle of peace, or just  the proposed peace plans?    [Habash] In fact, we oppose the current peace plan which is  proposed by the U.S. Administration. Instead, we propose a  peaceful solution to the Palestine question based on full  compliance with UN resolutions. There is a difference between  the letter and spirit of UN resolutions and the U.S. plan  proposed to settle the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli  conflict. We want a peaceful solution to the conflict.  Concerning our concept of this solution, we believe that it  should pass through two stages; a stage at which this solution  must be based on all UN resolutions, and at the same time, we  want a strategic solution to this conflict. The strategic  solution to the Palestine question is based on a democratic  Palestine. This is the PFLP stand toward the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict.    [Badawi] What can you say about the self-rule plan and the  agreement which was prepared in Oslo and signed in Washington?    [Habash] We strongly resist this agreement, because it does  not meet the minimum level of Palestinian demands. I do not  want to talk about this plan's violation of the [PLO] Charter.  Neither do I want to talk about the fact that this plan does  not touch on the phased solution which is based on the  self-determination, the state, and repatriation. However, I  want to say that this plan, the Gaza-Jericho agreement leaves  all major issues without a solution. The repatriation issue is  left without a solution, the settlements issue, the Jerusalem  issue, and borders are all left without a solution. The  Gaza-Jericho agreement does not provide a solution for any of  these issues.    [Badawi] But, the text of the agreement leaves the  definitive settlement of these points to future stages. Do you  doubt the credibility of this agreement, or that it will be able  to secure self-rule and later a state for the Palestinian people?    [Habash] When this agreement postpones all these basic  points  to a future stage, who will decide the solution to all these  issues? We say that the solution will be on the basis of the  balance of powers. How can Yasir 'Arafat solve the question of  Jerusalem, the question of settlements, and borders when he  loses his principal weapons? The question of borders now  represents a major problem. What will 'Arafat's stand be when he  faces the question of settlements, when he has to tackle the  issue of Jerusalem, and when he also has to tackle the question  of self-determination and all the other basic issues for which  the Palestinian people have struggled?    [Badawi] Dr. Habash, is your participation in an expanded  Palestinian front, which opposes the Oslo agreement, and which  includes the Islamic movements, part of a short or long-term  strategy ?    [Habash] At present, there is a U.S. imperialist onslaught  to  settle the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict on  the basis of the U.S. version. All forces should pool their  efforts to confront this onslaught. This requires a long time.  With respect to the confrontation of this onslaught, we support  the establishment of a front which may last for a long time and  whose objective is to defeat this onslaught. Thus, our alliance  may be considered a tactical one if viewed from this angle, and  if one views it from a strategic angle, meaning it seeks to  confront this onslaught and triumph over it, then this needs  much time.    [Badawi] But all observers ask: What makes George Habash  close to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad?    [Habash] Our agreement with Hamas now is not based on  ideological principles, it has political basis. Whether in  Palestine or in the Arab world, we agree politically on fighting  against this onslaught which is embodied by the American  solution to the Middle East issue. This is the basis of our  agreement with Hamas and all the other political Islamic  factions which confront this onslaught.    [Badawi] Dr. Habash, do you expect the recent Geneva summit  between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad to have any effect on the  opposition methods you adopt against the current settlement plan?    [Habash] I do not think so. This is because our struggle in  the PFLP, and this also applies to Hamas, is based on struggle  inside the occupied territories. Concerning this issue, Syria  still strongly supports the intifadah. Therefore, I do not  believe that we are facing a great division between the Alliance  of Palestinian Forces and Syria. Moreover, we must consider  that despite the Geneva summit, Syria continues to demand the  implementation of all UN resolutions, not only with respect to  the Golan, but also with respect to Lebanon and the occupied  territories, including Jerusalem. This means that this issue  will be a long drawn out one, especially since we must take into  consideration the intransigent Israeli attitude. What was  Israel's attitude in light of the summit and its results?  Israel's answer was to hold a referendum. To me this looks  like an attempt to escape from the process on the Syrian front.    [Badawi] But are you not worried about the return of Syria  and Lebanon to the negotiating table following a freeze of  several months in the bilateral talks? Doesn't this reinvolve  you in political isolation?    [Habash] No. There were negotiations while we were in Syria  and there has been an implicit alliance between us and Syria  since the Madrid conference, taking into consideration that it  is an indication of this process. [sentence as heard] Despite  this, there has been a kind of alliance between us and Syria.  [sentence as heard]    [Badawi] Dr. Habash, on what are you counting to tip the  future equation in your favor in and outside the territories?    [Habash] We primarily depend on two basic factors: The first  is an objective one; our understanding of the Zionist scheme.  The Zionist scheme fully conflicts with the basic concepts of  our Palestinian and Arab national rights. This is the first  factor. The other factor on which we depend is our masses, our  Palestinian and Arab masses. These masses will never accept the  hegemony of the Zionist onslaught and its designs, and the  attainment of its objectives in this manner. From this premise,  we feel that no matter what the obstacles and the difficulties,  and the Palestinian or Arab defeatist stands, our Palestinian  and Arab masses will ultimately triumph over this scheme, the  scheme of injustice and aggression that the Zionist authorities  represent.    [Badawi] Dr. Habash, my last question: If the Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho takes place in April, will  George Habash go back to the occupied territories?    [Habash] I will return in one instance. I will return when I  return with my people. It is inconceivable for me to isolate  myself from my people. Thus, if an agreement takes place--and  the issue of the withdrawal is far-fetched because there will be  no withdrawal, only redeployment--even if this redeployment  takes place, we will pursue our struggle on the basis of freedom  and independence, on the basis of the national program, the  program consisting of repatriation, self-determination, and the  establishment of the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its  capital.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Soeryadjayas sell 42% stake in Astra THE Soeryadjaya family yesterday sold over 100m shares in Astra International, which dominates Indonesia's vehicle sector, to a 19-member consortium in a deal worth at least Rp1,000bn (Dollars 484m). In a flurry of trading yesterday, 102.5m Astra shares, 42 per cent of the company, passed through the market at Rp10,000 a share. The sale valued the shares at about 30 times estimated 1993 earnings, compared to the market average of 15 times, and coincided with further bad news on vehicle sales. Astra yesterday revealed sales down 30 per cent year-on-year in the 12-months to last November to 101,309 units. The Soeryadjaya family, founders of Astra and, until last month, its majority shareholders, still hold an estimated 12.4m shares. They may be forced, however, to sell this stake to repay depositors of their privately-owned, bankrupt Bank Summa, which was ordered into liquidation in December owing Rp1,600bn. Details of yesterday's transactions have not been released but brokers believe the four main purchasers, taking 49m shares, were companies controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon; Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who runs the Salim Group; Mr Henry Pribadi, head of the Napan plastics and petrochemicals group; and Mr Murdaya Po, who runs Berca, a light indus-try and electronics group. Brokers say Bank Danamon, a publicly-listed bank, has taken 5m shares, while Bank Exim and Bapindo, both state-owned banks, have bought 10m shares each. State-owned companies now own 27 per cent of Astra. While yesterday's sale has resolved the company's ownership crisis, brokers say Astra still faces hard times. The high sale price, 'increases the likelihood the new owners will restructure the company, perhaps by selling-off assets,' said one foreign broker. The sale was at a premium to Astra shares traded on the regular market which closed last week at Rp9,000 a share. Bankers to Astra, which has loans and facilities from foreign banks of more than Dollars 900m, remained cautious about the ownership change, having earlier expressed reservations about some of the buyers. Those looking to Toyota, Astra's principal joint-venture partner, for a lead were disappointed. The Soeryadjayas have placed 20m Astra shares in escrow while negotiating with Toyota for their sale. Toyota had expressed reluctance to buy the shares until the identity of other new shareholders was confirmed. A Toyota official said yesterday the company remained undecided as to whether to buy the shares and is 'still considering . . . whether, or how, to assist Astra International'.</p>

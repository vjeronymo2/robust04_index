			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Up against the limits: The causes of economic deadlock in Poland Poland, erstwhile standard-bearer for radical economic reform in eastern Europe, has run into a political quagmire. Hampered by Poland's disastrous political divisions, all too clearly revealed in the fragmented Polish parliament, Poland's new finance minister, Mr Karol Lutkowski, yesterday proffered his resignation. The resignation followed weeks of increasingly acute debate over economic policy within the centre-right coalition government led by Mr Jan Olszewski. That debate came to a head at the weekend after the government presented parliament with an economic plan that Mr Lutkowski argued risked reigniting hyper-inflation and undoing the economic and financial progress made in the past two difficult years. What is now clear is that the radical reforms of the first two post-communist governments went beyond the willingness of the populace to support them. Those governments were dominated by passionate believers in free-market policies who argued that state enterprises which failed to react positively to market stimuli should be allowed to fail. The present government lacks that conviction. It is cobbled together from a collection of Christian democrat and peasant parties, supported in the new parliament by a shifting alliance from among the 29 parties which won seats at last October's first free general elections. Those elections were fought under a system of proportional representation which has magnified Poland's political diversity, but compounded the difficulty of building broad political support for the hard sacrifices needed to transform Poland's economy on market principles. This became apparent during last year's election campaign when the tough economic stabilisation policies backed by the International Monetary Fund and pursued by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister in the first two post-communist governments, were attacked in increasingly populist terms by the parties which now form or support the new government. Mr Olszewski illustrated the general tenor of the government's economic thinking when introducing his government's programme just before Christmas. 'If we want to maintain a democratic system we must convince the public that the reforms are spread justly,' he said. Subsequently he promised that future economic policy would no longer 'be built on the rubble of state enterprises', and promised that what he called 'the good climate for swindlers, crooks and thieves is coming to an irrevocable end'. The main architect of the government's new economic strategy is Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, a former central planner who emerged as the strongest internal critic of the stabilisation programme carried out by Mr Balcerowicz. Mr Eysymontt argues that previous governments did not pay enough attention to the social and economic consequences of their market-oriented policies. These curbed hyper-inflation, and stabilised the Polish currency, the zloty. But they cut subsidies and opened up large swathes of Polish industry to fierce competition from imported goods made cheaper by the rise in the zloty's value against the dollar and other currencies. Faced with rising unemployment and a rapid build-up of bad debt by Polish enterprises, Mr Eysymontt argues that more attention must be paid to supply-side measures to boost investment and exports without rekindling inflation. In order to square this difficult circle, Mr Eysymontt advocates a form of incomes policy. Workers would be offered greater employment, but would have to pay for it by accepting tougher wage controls and higher sales taxes, which would translate into a 5 per cent decline in real incomes this year after a 2 per cent rise in 1991. It is far from clear that such an incomes policy would work under Polish conditions, where most state-owned enterprises are controlled by strong workers' councils hand in glove with communist-era managers. The reaction of both to market-oriented policies has often been to cut output and raise prices rather than to cut costs and increase efficiency. It is equally unclear whether the aim of preserving employment in the old state dinosaurs even makes sense. Nevertheless, the new government's message accurately reflects the ambivalence with which many Poles view the past two years of extraordinarily rapid economic and social change. On the positive side, the Balcerowicz reforms curbed hyper-inflation, restored value to the zloty and sparked off a retail and trading revolution which has filled once empty shops. With extraordinary speed a brash and entrepreneurial Poland has intruded into the old egalitarian but fundamentally immobile system. Poles who for years traded illegally throughout the former Soviet bloc jumped at the chance to lease or buy former state-controlled shops and retail outlets. However, while the flood of imported consumer goods and a rapid redistribution of incomes has left some Poles better off than ever before, millions more are feeling disoriented and defenceless. The most aggrieved sectors of society include those employed by, or laid off from, state sector enterprises. In the past industrial workers in the large and medium-sized state enterprises were the most tenacious working-class supporters of the old Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and the church. They expected better things from their heroic struggle against communism. Instead, workers in state enterprises have seen their pay held below the 70 per cent annual inflation rate by the hated 'popiwek' wages tax, which only applies to state enterprises. Many have lost their jobs, as unemployment has risen from virtually zero to 2.14m over the past two years. Unemployment is expected to exceed 3m by the end of 1992. Last year's 11.9 per cent fall in industrial output from the state sector means that, overall, production in the state industrial sector is 35 per cent below 1989 levels. Nearly 40 per cent of the 8,500 enterprises still owned by the state or by local authorities are loss-making. Many, including most of the 200 enterprises which formerly depended almost exclusively on trade with the now defunct Comecon market, are bankrupt and only keep alive by not paying bills or taxes. Yet another consequence of liberalisation has been a rash of big financial and banking scandals. These have underlined fundamental weaknesses in the legal and regulatory structure of the banks and other institutions inherited from the former communist state. The collapse of state industry and the largely unknown potential of the new entrepreneurs have meant that some 40 per cent of bank loans are non-performing. Understaffed and inexperienced, the banking system is a priority target for western technical assistance and privatisation. Meanwhile, the government, which used to obtain 85 per cent of its tax revenue from state enterprises under the primitive communist tax system, is owed Zl 23,000bn in uncollectable company taxes, which swells the budget deficit. This is likely to prove inflationary in Polish circumstances, given the government's inability to sell long-term debt. Ironically a high proportion of the taxes owed come from non-payment of the 'popiwek'. The fact that a tax levied on former communist managements for giving in to wage demands made by powerful workers councils is in practice frequently not collected merely underlines the fragility of the economic management tools in government hands. It also underlines the importance of moving as fast as possible away from an economy so heavily rooted in the inherited state-controlled industries. This government, like its predecessors, has pledged to speed up the pace of privatisation. It plans to introduce a complex system of mass privatisation by early summer under which more than 200 enterprises will be handed over to special investment funds run by foreign banks and institutions. By the end of this year more than 50 per cent of the economy, including the farming sector which remained largely in private hands throughout the communist era, should be in private hands. Mr Eysymontt's main innovation is to insist that the 50 per cent which remains in state hands must be taken better care of until it can be restructured or hived off. Since pioneering the dash for market reform in eastern Europe, Poland has felt the constraints more keenly that any of the new democracies. There is no desire to turn back, but the new government is testing the limits on its freedom of action. The outcome will be closely watched by all the post-communist states.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POLAND'S TROUBLED ECONOMY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1989      1990      1991*      1992*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP (% change)                      0.2     -11.6       -9.0       -8.0 Industrial production (% change)   -0.5       -24      -11.9      -14.0 Trade balance (Dollars m)            12     2,065        -29     -1,000 Services balances (Dollars m)    -1,855    -1,396     -1,500     -1,600 Current account (Dollars m)      -1,843       669     -1,529     -2,600  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank, Central Planning Office, CSO, OECD     *Bl estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within ACYF, the Children's Bureau's Division of Child Welfare plans, manages, coordinates and supports child welfare services programs. It administers the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program, the Child Welfare Services Program, the Independent Living Program, the Child Welfare Research, Demonstration and Training Program, the Adoption Opportunities Program, the Temporary Child Care and Crisis Nurseries Program, the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program and the recently enacted Family Preservation and Family Support program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Children's Bureau's programs are designed to promote the welfare of all children, including those disabled, homeless, dependent, abused or neglected children and their families. The programs aid in preventing and remedying the neglect, abuse and exploitation of children. The programs also encourage the strengthening of the family unit to help prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families, and reunify families, where possible, when separation has occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part I_General Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federally funded child welfare resource centers have been in existence for over a decade. In 1982 the Children's Bureau supported ten Regional Child Welfare Resource Centers as well as several national specialized centers to operate three year projects. In 1985 the Children's Bureau funded six National Resource Centers for a three year period to provide leadership to the field through the identification, collection, development and utilization of models and promising practices, systems improvements, training programs, and other resource materials on effective methods of addressing child welfare service program needs. Each Resource Center focused on a priority area of child welfare services: family-based services, foster care, adoption, youth services, legal resources, and management and administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Centers were directed by the Federal government to move towards self-sufficiency. Although this criterion of self-sufficiency was met, certain critical core functions which proved vital to the States_short-term consultation, information dissemination, and the development of programs, practices, and resource materials on emerging issues_could not be provided without ongoing Federal support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988 and 1989 the six Resource Centers received continuation funding to insure the ongoing availability of these core services. In 1990, the Children's Bureau employed a competitive process to again fund National Centers in the same six priority areas to make sure resources in key areas would continue to be available to the field. In 1993, a National Adoption Resource Center was funded for a five year project period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

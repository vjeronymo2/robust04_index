			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food sector active The turbulence surrounding the dramatic bid developments continued to reverberate through the food sector, although turnover was well below Thursday's hectic session. The focus of attention remained on whether Tesco would return to the fray to counter J Sainsbury's Pounds 210m bid for William Low. The Scottish retailer, which had climbed 60p in the first four sessions of the week, was steadier yesterday closing a penny down at 323p, still well above Sainsbury's 305p cash offer. However, turnover, below recent levels which had peaked on Thursday at 11m shares, totalled just over 500,000 yesterday. However, the support for the price, continues to point to the market's expectation that Tesco will come back with a higher offer. Analysts suggested a counter-offer of around 325p a share - although there were also a few siren voices hinting of a Tesco withdrawal. Shares in Tesco, which began the saga two weeks ago with an agreed Pounds 154m for Low, slipped 1 1/2 to 231 1/2 p. Sainsbury also weakened, closing 3 1/2 to 407 1/2 p. The spotlight also fell on William Morrison Supermarkets, the shares being bid up 5 1/2 to 139 1/2 p with turnover a sprightly 2.1m. But food specialists were highly sceptical of the speculation, in view of the large, albeit minority, shareholding by the Morrison family.</p>

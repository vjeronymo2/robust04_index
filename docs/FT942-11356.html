			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Alcatel subsidiary in new probe Mr Pierre Guichet, chairman of Alcatel CIT, the French telecoms equipment manufacturer, has been placed under judicial investigation in a case concerning alleged overcharging of France Telecom, one of the group's principal customers, the company said yesterday. Alcatel CIT, a subsidiary of Alcatel-Alsthom, one of France's largest industrial groups, said in a statement it had not overcharged or forged billing for France Telecom and expressed surprise at the investigation. The origins of the affair date back to last year, when two employees of Alcatel CIT were accused by the company of manipulating prices for equipment ordered by France Telecom. Alcatel CIT agreed in November to pay France Telecom a sum of about FFr60m (Pounds 7m) to compensate for the losses arising from the manipulation of prices and the damage to relations between the two companies. Alcatel CIT said it had written a letter to the investigating magistrate criticising the procedure being followed in the case. Mr Guichet was placed under judicial investigation for the overcharging case immediately after having being questioned about allegations that he had work done at his home by companies working for Alcatel CIT. Alcatel CIT said that Mr Guichet had himself paid for the work at his home and that no charges had been brought concerning this subject.</p>

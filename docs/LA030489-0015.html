			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FONDLING STORY: PRESS TRIPPED UP BY RUSH TO BE FIRST IN PRINT  </P> <P> It is a Washington journalist's worst nightmare: an explosive Page One story  that rocks the White House, only to have the source turn out to be someone with  a history of psychiatric problems.  </P> <P> It happened this week to Washington Post investigative reporter Bob Woodward on  a story that an Air Force sergeant had reported drunkenness and fondling of  women by Defense Secretary-designate John Tower. The story appeared Thursday  not only in the Post but in the Los Angeles Times and numerous other newspapers  that subscribe to the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service.  </P> <P> And the credibility of more than that story was called into question.  Particularly troubling, both to journalists and to government officials, was  the incident's lesson about what can happen when the nation's major newspapers  compete to be first into print.  </P> <P> </P> <P> False Stories Planted  </P> <P> Officials in Washington, trading on their high rank, commonly try to plant  stories that sometimes are blatantly false, journalists admit. And some  journalists believe that, because of the intensity of competition to be first  with the news, the nation's newspapers allow themselves to be used as bulletin  boards on which officials signal and manipulate one another.  </P> <P> Especially at the White House, "with so many reporters competing for so few  nuggets of news, reporters are more willing to run into print with  unsubstantiated and in many cases incredible pieces of information," said  Walter Robinson, White House correspondent for the Boston Globe.  </P> <P> Often, said New York Times White House correspondent Bernard Weinraub, "with  the competitive nature of it and the person who is saying it, you go with it."  </P> <P> The origin of Woodward's story remains unclear. Robert Kaiser, the Post's  assistant managing editor for national news, refused to disclose how the Post  learned that the retired sergeant, Robert Jackson, had told the FBI and the  Senate Armed Services Committee that, on two occasions in the 1970s, Tower had  appeared drunk and fondled two women at Bergstrom Air Force Base near Austin,  Tex.  </P> <P> Before publishing the story, Kaiser said, the Post confirmed that Jackson had  indeed given his account to the FBI and the committee and that the account was  in the FBI volume that the Senate was studying in relation to Tower's  nomination.  </P> <P> But, on Thursday, the Air Force issued a report saying Jackson had left the  service after being diagnosed as having "a mixed personality disorder" and that  he was not assigned to the base in Texas in 1975 on the only occasion that  Tower had visited it.  </P> <P> Regardless of how Woodward's story developed, examples are legion of the impact  of high-ranking officials on the Washington press corps.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser, Robert C.  McFarlane, once leaked a plan to arm Nicaragua's Contras with Korean weapons,  hoping to generate support for the idea. One reporter on the receiving end of  the leak -- he asked not to be named -- thought the plan had little chance of  being approved but felt compelled to publish it anyway because of McFarlane's  rank.  </P> <P> In December, 1986, White House sources opposed to then-Chief of Staff Donald T.  Regan planted several stories suggesting that Regan was trying to mastermind a  cover-up of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> Last fall, when President-elect Bush was considering naming John H. Sununu as  his chief of staff, Sununu's rivals planted a story saying Bush was considering  a troika of aides to run the White House staff. It was apparently an effort to  get Bush to consider that approach, but Bush named Sununu anyway.  </P> <P> In 1984, the Los Angeles Times ran a story from a highly placed White House  source that the Administration was actively considering supplying El Salvador  with advanced jet fighters. The story was leaked by someone in the  Administration who was alarmed by the plan and wanted to derail it.  </P> <P> In truth, the story was false -- the official had misunderstood the  Administration's intentions.  </P> <P> But an even more authoritative source at the National Security Council then  confirmed it anyway, knowing it was a mistake, apparently because it served  some purpose of his -- perhaps to pressure Salvadoran rebels or members of  Congress.  </P> <P> "What an Administration's highest council's are planning is often not something  you can go out and independently confirm," said Times national security  reporter Doyle McManus. "That's why on that kind of story you have to be as  explicit and precise as you can about your sourcing, to make the distinction  between what you know to be true and what you're told."  </P> <P> Now it is Tower's confirmation fight that is gripping Washington, and reporters  generally understand that those who leak them information from the confidential  FBI report on the defense secretary-designate are doing so for a purpose.  </P> <P> Assessing the purpose is not always so easy. Many journalists in Washington  this week wondered whether the Post had been set up by Republicans who knew  that the story written by Woodward -- and thus the entire case against Tower --  would be discredited.  </P> <P> The Post took that possibility seriously, prompting Kaiser to question Woodward  about the source of the story.  </P> <P> Democratic sources were peddling the story about Tower to other reporters  Wednesday, and the New York Times tried to confirm it but could not.  </P> <P> "A couple of our reporters had picked up some pieces of that story, but they  didn't have enough," the New York Times' deputy bureau chief, Philip Taubman,  said. He said he did not know what the New York Times would have done if its  reporters had learned as much as Woodward had.  </P> <P> Kaiser said the Post had not tried to confirm whether others could corroborate  Jackson's account of Tower's behavior, only that his allegations existed. Nor  did it check his reasons for leaving the military.  </P> <P> "Even the FBI didn't check out his service record," Kaiser said.  </P> <P> Why didn't the Post take more time? Competition was one factor.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the standards (of verifying news) are different with the time  constraints," Post White House correspondent Ann Devroy said. "If you are  trying to find out what is in the FBI report, it is not going to do much good  if you find out three weeks from now."  </P></p>

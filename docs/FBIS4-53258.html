			<p>BFN     [Text] While warm feelings of Army-people harmony overflow  in the construction site of the Pyongyang-Hyangsan expressway,  the soldier builders of the Korean People's Army unit to which  Comrade Tong Myong-nam belongs are accelerating the construction  project entrusted to them.    The functionaries and employees of Kim Chong-tae Electric  Locomotive Complex visited the construction site overflowing  with the soldiers' revolutionary zeal. They wholeheartedly  congratulated the soldiers who are registering brilliant  exploits in the Pyongyang-Hyangsan Expressway construction site.  They vigorously encouraged the soldiers, offering the soldiers  the gifts and the facilities and materials for construction  which they themselves made with inner reserves they found.    The soldier builders were filled with the resolve to  complete  the project ahead of the target date promised to the supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

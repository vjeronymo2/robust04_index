			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Israel and PLO sign crucial deal on self-rule Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night signed a crucial security agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule. The deal, signed by Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will give much-needed momentum to the peace process after months of delay and bickering. The full details, set down in a three-page set of principles and an eight-page agreement, were not released. Mr Peres said they included resolution of the two most sensitive security issues - control over the Egypt-Gaza and Jericho-Jordan border crossings and security arrangements for Jewish settlers in Gaza which would divide the strip into three zones. Officials said this meant exclusive Palestinian control in the largest zone, exclusive Israeli control in another zone around the Jewish settlements and joint patrols, under Israeli control, in a third smaller zone. Mr Peres said there was agreement in principle on the third main obstacle of the past three months - the size of the Jericho area - but a final decision would be taken only when Mr Arafat met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister. Mr Osama el Baz, political adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, said the two sides had agreed an area 'a little more than 55 sq km'. The agreement, however, fell short of bridging all the security issues, leaving problems not resolved in Cairo to be negotiated under a new document of principles called the 'Cairo document' which was also signed last night. Mr Arafat said he had agreed to work with Mr Peres to overcome the remaining problems. 'We are sure we can create a new era for our people,' he said. 'We can say that Palestine and the name Palestine have returned to the map of the Middle East.' Further talks are expected to resume next week in Paris and in Cairo. After lengthy talks, Mr Peres and Mr Arafat initialled the documents shortly before midnight to loud applause at the Al-Itahidiya presidential palace in front of President Mubarak. The agreements, negotiated according to one Israeli official 'paragraph by paragraph, line by line, word by word', broke a deadlock over the most difficult obstacles preventing implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. It will unblock suspended talks on economic relations and the transfer of civilian administration to Palestinian hands. Once the remaining issues have been resolved, expected within two to three weeks, the stage will be set for Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to sign a comprehensive protocol in Cairo, starting an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho which was to have begun last December 13. Although last night's documents must be approved by the Israeli cabinet and the PLO executive committee, this is expected to be a formality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Government of  "Honduras rejects an invasion of Haiti," a high-ranking Honduran  official has told U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and  Southern Command Chief General Barry McCaffrey.    Honduran Vice President Walter Lopez Reyes told NOTIMEX that  "Honduras disagrees with a forceful invasion of Haiti" and that  he voiced this position to the U.S. military leaders who arrived  in Honduran territory today.    Perry and McCaffrey arrived at the Palmerola Military Base,  where they met with Foreign Relations Minister Ernesto Paz,  Government Minister Efrain Moncada Silva, Vice President Walter  Lopez Reyes, and Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua  Elvir.    Lopez Reyes made assurances that the government of President  Carlos Roberto Reina would be willing to cooperate with a  mission to restore peace in Haiti requested through a UN or OAS  resolution. He said that military leaders in the Clinton  administration have never asked Honduras to support an invasion  and that they only requested our "opinion" on the Haitian  situation.    Another topic discussed by the Honduran and U.S. officials  was the future of the U.S. base in Palmerola, located in the  central Department of Comayagua. This installation was built in  1983 when anti-Sandinist armed groups in Nicaragua, known as  "contras," used Honduran territory as a base to launch their  armed operations with U.S. financing and aid.    This base legalized the U.S. military presence in Honduras,  and its construction cost over $30 million. "We talked about  the future of Palmerola as a regional counternarcotics training  center," Lopez Reyes pointed out. Honduras is unable to  maintain this base, and thus, the vice president admitted that  it could hardly be transferred to Honduran hands. Palmerola  will also be used by the U.S. National Guard and Army Reserves  to train in engineering and civilian-military operations, Lopez  Reyes added.    He denied that the United States will transfer to Honduras  the 82d Airborne Division, which invaded Grenada in 1983,  because there has been no thought of transferring the Southern  Command (headquartered in Panama) to Palmerola, as was reported  in this capital.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will head for Puerto  Rico today, after visiting Panama and Honduras, and he will  return to Washington on Sunday.</p>

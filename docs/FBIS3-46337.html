			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506) from Shenzhen: </F> "Shenzhen Abolishes Three-Year Tax Exemption Preferential  Treatment for Enterprises Engaged in Three Forms of Import  Processing and Compensation Trade Set Up This Year"]    [Text] Enterprises from Hong Kong and Taiwan that are  engaged in three forms of import processing and compensation  trade are less and less welcomed by Shenzhen Special Economic  Zone [SEZ]. Such enterprises founded after 1 January this year  will no longer be entitled to the three-year tax exemption.    Zhang Jiashou [4545 1367 1108], deputy head of the foreign  affairs department of Shenzhen City Tax Bureau, pointed out at  an exclusive interview with this reporter yesterday that in the  past, the SEZ exempted enterprises engaged in three forms of  import processing and compensation trade from business tax on  their processing fees for three years. With the introduction of  the new tax regime this year, this preferential policy has been  canceled. Though it remains valid for factories that were  previously eligible for this tax remission treatment, similar  enterprises founded this year will no longer be entitled to the  same treatment.    He pointed out: This new measure has no impact on solely  foreign-funded enterprises from Hong Kong and Taiwan, joint  ventures, and cooperative enterprises. Because the recipients  of processing fees are usually mainland factories, basically,  this new measure is not expected to dampen the investment  interest of Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers to any noticeable  extent.    He explained that Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers  normally  transport raw materials to the mainland for processing. The  consigned processor may be a mainland factory. Once the  products are finished, they will be handed over to the Hong Kong  or Taiwan manufacturer for export. In such an operation, the  taxpayer should be the mainland factory, not the Hong Kong or  Taiwan manufacturer.    He said: "Whoever is consigned processing, and receives  processing fees for it, must pay business taxes. The rate of  the processing fee is up to the manufacturers to decide and has  nothing to do with the tax bureau."    He emphasized: If, because of the implementation of the new  measure, an enterprise engaged in three forms of processing and  compensation trade attempts to understate processing fees, it  will be considered a tax evader once discovered and will be  called to account.    This new measure may increase the tax burden on mainland  factories and, in turn, may have an impact on the Hong Kong and  Taiwan manufacturers to some degree. This policy can be seen as  a sign that enterprises engaged in three forms of processing and  compensation trade are no longer welcomed by the SEZ.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Svenska Handelsbanken drops 80% SVENSKA Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank, reported yesterday that operating profits fell 80 per cent to SKr441m (Dollars 81m) in the first eight months of 1992 from the comparable period last year, writes Chris Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Credit losses rose 86 per cent to SKr3.94bn as a result of the protracted recession and the deteriorating property market. The losses correspond to 2.1 per cent of total lending at the end of August. The bank made a loss of SKr223m in the second four months, after reporting operating profits of SKr664m in the first four months of the year. This was because the latest period saw a further SKr615m of losses stemming from loans to Gamlestaden, the collapsed finance company. Svenska Handelsbanken's total share of losses relating to Gamlestaden now exceeds SKr1.1bn.</p>

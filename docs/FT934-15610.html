			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / New boys braced for store wars: Neil Buckley on a row between UK supermarkets and newly arrived warehouse clubs Mr Paul Moulton, the head of Costco Europe, a subsidiary of the US group, jokes about his recent visit to the UK Department of Trade and Industry to discuss plans to bring warehouse clubs - which offer cut-price goods to members in no frill stores - to the UK. 'Who did I have to speak to?' he asks. 'A guy named Sainsbury.' The reference is to Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister and cousin of Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of one of the UK's biggest retailers, J Sainsbury. Mr Moulton does not imply any impropriety in the relationship between the group and the DTI: his point is that, for outsiders trying to enter the UK retailing market, chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are powerful and ubiquitous opponents. Now the 'big three' chains have taken the unprecedented step of launching joint legal action against their potential competitor. The High Court will next week hear an application from the three for the quashing of planning consent for Costco's first UK warehouse club, at Thurrock, Essex. They say it was wrongly assessed as a wholesaler, rather than as a retailer. The superstore chains have instigated legal action, on the same grounds, against another warehouse club project by UK cash-and-carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock at Wednesbury, west Midlands. The 'big three' say they are opposing the clubs on a point of principle in planning law. But Mr David Poole, chief executive of Nurdin &amp; Peacock, accuses the big three of a 'sinister' attempt to 'strangle warehouse clubs at birth'. Nervousness on the part of the big grocers caused by the arrival in the UK of a new breed of retailer is understandable. In the US, the five biggest warehouse club chains have grown from virtually nothing to sales of more than Dollars 28bn last year. Their combined operating profits exceeded Dollars 760m. The concept of warehouse clubs is simple. They use large sheds to sell a range of about 3,500 goods, from cat food to camcorders, at low prices - 25 per cent or more below high street prices - to a limited membership of trade customers and individuals. Costs are kept low by selecting cheaper sites that many retailers would reject and cutting frills, such as expensive fittings. The clubs make money by shifting large volumes and from the Dollars 25 to Dollars 35 annual fee levied on members. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has forecast that the clubs could 'turn the UK retail scene upside down' and achieve sales of Pounds 2bn a year within 10 years. As supermarket margins in the UK are typically two to three times higher than in the US, warehouse clubs would not have to cut their margins as much to undercut the opposition. But if this spells uncertainty for UK retailers, the stakes for Costco are also high. Its drive to expand overseas is prompted partly by the much tougher conditions which US warehouse clubs face at home. Increased competition has led to saturation in some areas, while general-purpose outlets such as Costco are being challenged by a new generation of clubs specialising in products such as electrical goods. Last summer, Price Co, which pioneered the warehouse club business, was forced into a distress merger with Costco. The big three UK supermarkets insist fear of competition is not the reason for their battle against Costco and N&amp;P. They say it is unfair that warehouse clubs are classified as wholesalers. Planning consent is easier to obtain for wholesalers than for retailers because less detailed information is required on, say, the impact on other shops or the environment. The supermarkets say that in the US individuals, as opposed to businesses, account forabout 35 per cent of warehouse club customers and a higher percentage of turnover. 'We are not interested in denying warehouse clubs their place in the UK market,' says a spokesman for the big three. 'We are just asking for everyone to have to play by the same rules.' The government has tried to clarify the dispute. A department of the environment planning policy guidance note, PPG6, advises local authorities that 'planning decisions should regard (warehouse clubs) as retail uses'. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, told Conservatives in Blackpool last week he would 'clamp down on shops which masquerade as warehouses to avoid planning restrictions'. But PPG6 does not have the force of law and has been disregarded by Hertsmere borough council, Hertforshire, which last month awarded wholesale planning permission for a second Costco warehouse club, at Bushey, outside London. Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco say they want to establish a legal definition of warehouse clubs as retailers to confirm the government's policy guidance. For Costco, Mr Moulton disputes that warehouse clubs are retailers, saying that Costco is aiming to attract business from trade customers. He expects most customers to be small independent shops, restaurants and cafes. But Mr Moulton says the food superstores' case is largely based on allegations that Costco failed in some cases to follow planning procedure to the letter. 'It is over process rather than issues,' he says. Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco are, he believes, trying to obstruct Costco. Even if Costco lost next week the long-term future of warehouse clubs need not be jeopardised. It could delay and push up the cost of Costco's projects at Thurrock and Bushey, and N&amp;P's project at Wednesbury, forcing them to submit new applications for planning consent. Future developments may take longer and cost more in the planning stages. But the advantage warehouse clubs have in being able to use cheaper sites will remain. Mr Richard Hyman, chairman of Verdict, the retail research company, says: 'Will a negative judgment put their costs up? Yes. Will it make them pay a bit more for their land? Yes. Will it stop them? Definitely not.' However, the fears that the big retailers may have about the new arrivals could be unnecessary. Verdict estimates that, in the foreseeable future, the clubs are unlikely to account for more than about 2 per cent of the total retail market. 'Evidence in the US is that the clubs cream off a little bit of business across a range of sectors,' says Mr Paul Morris, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. Moreover, the big three's campaign could have backfired. One senior executive of a warehouse club operator says: 'A few months ago, I was sitting with the marketing director wondering how on earth we could educate the British public about warehouse clubs. The supermarkets have done the job for us.' Some retail industry observers believe that the big three retailers' action reflects wider problems. The recession, customers'price sensitivity, the influx into the UK of other cut-price operators such as Aldi of Germany, and the increasing number of stores chasing sales in a fairly static market, have put extra pressures on the large supermarkets. 'They are feeling very vulnerable,' says Mr Hyman. 'In no other retailing sector have the leading players had such control. But for the first time for a decade, these people don't know what is going to happen six or 12 months down the line.' Critics who see the big supermarkets' joint efforts to halt the warehouse clubs as evidence that they are really a cosy cartel may be exaggerating. Yet the vigour of their response suggests they may fear a bigger threat to their dominance of food retailing than they have so far been ready to admit in public.

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading NEWS OF the increase in German discount rate led to a sharp retreat in stock index futures after a strong performance early in the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Speculation that there would be no rise in German interest rates, coupled with favourable corporate news, brought a firm opening in the September contract at 2,504. It continued to move forward for the rest of the morning session, unaffected by the release of economic data at 11.30am, and pulled the underlying cash market higher. By 1pm the contract was trading at 2,537. The lunchtime news from the Bundesbank disappointed the market, leading to a sharp fall in the contract to 2,489 by 2.30pm. Bargain hunters towards the end of the session, however, helped September rally from the day's low and it closed at 2,506, up 2 from its previous close and around 5 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover, at 10,066 contracts, was an improvement on recent levels. In traded options, volume soared to 41,528 contracts, with the FT-SE option recording a total of 16,628 trades ahead of today's expiry. Asda was the busiest stock option with 5,027 lots transacted.</p>

Vice Governor Wen Shizhen gave  a summing-up speech on seizing the opportunity, greeting the  challenge, developing reform, and pushing the whole province's  economy to a new stage.    Wen Shizhen said: Big reform will bring big emancipation and  development of the productive forces. Under the situation in  which difficulty and opportunity have coexisted, the key to  successfully carrying out economic work lies in our mental  state, good or bad. If we can maintain a sober mind, enhance the  sense of urgency and responsibility, turn pressure into  motivation, strengthen spirit, and advance despite difficulties,  we will surely be able to seize the new opportunity, greet new  challenges, and realize new development.    Wen Shizhen touched on the following views on pushing our  province's economy to a new level this year: Conscientiously  carry out reform of the financial and tax system, actively  broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure, and do a good  job in financial and taxation work; rationally determine the  base figures of revenue and expenditure, and make good  arrangements for 1994 financial budget; fully understand the  major significance in reform of the tax system, turn pressure  into motivation, and actively cultivate new tax sources;  concentrate efforts on raising the economic efficiency of  enterprises, and while paying attention to large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, exert efforts to develop  tertiary industry and township enterprises; and actively guide  enterprises to expand foreign export trade, and raise the level  of creating foreign exchange.    Wen Shizhen pointed out: This year is crucial to our  province's reform and development. Particularly, the state has  successively issued a series of major reform measures within a  very short period of time. To guarantee the real implementation  of these reform plans in our province, we should change work  style, make earnest efforts to do practical things, work  creatively, advocate the practice of handling official work on  the spot, promote the habit of conducting investigations and  studies, care for the living of the people, pay attention to  solving difficult problems and hot topics in society, and  guarantee the smooth implementation of the state's all sorts of  major reform measures.    Governor Yu Qifeng and Vice Governors Guo Tingbiao and Gao  Guozhu attended the conference on 21 January.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / France curbs welfare spending The French government has made progress in its attempts to curb welfare spending, but the social security accounts may need extra funding to avoid cashflow problems in the first half of 1995, according to a report released yesterday. The report by the social security accounts committee forecast that the deficit on welfare spending, which includes health, pensions and family benefits, should narrow to FFr50.5bn (Pounds 6bn) next year, from about FFr54bn in 1994 and FFr56.4bn in 1993. According to the report, however, the deficit would still exceed existing borrowing conditions agreed with the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution. The government, which wrote off social security debts of an accumulated FFr110bn last year by transferring them to the central state budget, has so-far resisted a further injection of funds. Prior to the write-off, the government implemented cost-cutting measures in the state pension scheme and in health spending aimed at balancing the social security accounts.</p>

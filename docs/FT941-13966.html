			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Aluminium talks fail to lift cloud Disappointment at the failure of leading aluminium producing countries to reach agreement on curbing oversupply left the metal's prices at a low ebb on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. The three months delivery price had risen by nearly Dollars 12 to Dollars 1,217.50 a tonne on Monday in anticipation of the producers' meeting, which was scheduled to run for two days and was widely expected to result in a multilateral agreement to cut world aluminium production by about 10 per cent - 1.5m-2m tonnes. Most of that rise was lost after the talks began in Brussels on Tuesday, however, as a total news blackout left traders groping in the dark. Further modest losses were registered during the second day, partly in response to indications that Russia, the main source of a flood of aluminium into the west since the collapse of the Soviet Union, was proving determined not to shift from its opening offer. Hopes were rekindled, however, by news that the talks were to continue on Thursday. 'We decided we would keep talking while we were still making progress,' said one delegate. The apparent confidence of delegates at the opening of the third day of negotiations further revived LME dealers' spirits and three months aluminium bounced to Dollars 1,214 a tonne in the morning. However, the sight of decidedly grimmer faces emerging for the midday recess brought an abrupt turnaround in market sentiment and the price fell back to Dollars 1,186.75 at the close. But the optimists were not done. Yesterday morning's announcement that there would be a midday statement sent the price to Dollars 1,218 a tonne, only to fall all the way back to Dollars 1,189 at the close, down Dollars 16.25 on the week, after the announcement simply said that the talks would continue, possibly over the weekend. Further negotiations will have to be conducted by telephone and fax, however, as most of the delegates, including the Russians, have gone home. Disappointment with the Brussels talks cast a shadow over other LME contracts yesterday, but copper and lead still ended the week with substantial gains. Copper's early strength seemed to be entirely due to speculative activity, traders said, but lead benefitted towards the end of the week from reports of increased replacement car battery demand in the US as a result of the recent extreme cold in the eastern half of the country. At the London bullion market the gold market held its own until taking a tumble yesterday. Chart-inspired selling helped to push the price down to Dollars 385.25 a troy ounce yesterday, off Dollars 7.05 on the day and Dollars 4.75 on the week. Dealers dismissed any link between the weakness of gold in London and New York with a television programme claiming that 1,240 tonnes of gold had been stored by Ferdinand Marcos, the late Philippines' dictator, in Switzerland. 'The market was lethargic and had been all week. It wanted to go down and needed an excuse,' one analyst told the Reuter news agency. 'This got blown out of all proportion.' At the London Commodity Exchange coffee was a big loser in midweek, when the March futures position fell to Dollars 1,168 a tonne at one stage. But it staged a partial rally on Thursday following Brazil's announcement that it would roll-over producer debts, against which it is holding coffee as collateral, removing the immediate threat of that coffee reaching the open market.  ------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium               +5,700    to    2,514,625 Aluminium alloy            +40    to       47,320 Copper                  -4,600    to      607,575 Lead                       -75    to      309,100 Nickel                    +924    to      128,478 Zinc                   +15,700    to      978,525 Tin                     unchgd    at       20,745  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

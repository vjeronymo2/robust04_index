			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelting to continue at Avonmouth Four weeks after acquiring the UK's sole lead-zinc smelter, at Avonmouth, for ADollars 107m, MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, is calling for a 19 per cent cut in the workforce, changes in working practices and increased metal production. However, employees were assured yesterday that, although the European zinc industry is discussing the co-ordinated closure of a smelter, MIM had no intention of shutting Avonmouth. Mr Alan Pugh, managing director of Mount Isa Holdings (UK), said the new management wanted to lift annual production from Avonmouth to 120,000 tonnes of zinc. The rated capacity of the plant was only 105,000 tonnes but recently it had operated at an annual rate of 111,000 tonnes, he said. Lead production is to be boosted from 45,000 to 55,000 tonnes a year. MIM, which bought the plant from Pasminco, another Australian company, has started consultations with the unions and is asking for at least 115 volunteers for redundancy from the present workforce of 610. Mr Pugh said that about 40 per cent of the redundancies would be among managerial, supervisory and support staff. The remaining employees would be asked to adopt more flexible working practices 'to match the best in British industry'. Increased productivity and extra metal production should improve operating profit by Pounds 7.5m 'to lift Avonmouth from a position of marginal profit to a world-class, low-cost producer of high quality zinc and lead that provides an acceptable return on investment'. Analysts suggested that Avonmouth was safe from closure once MIM took it over. The smelter uses the ISP (Imperial Smelting Process) technology, which has the capability to process complex feedstocks, including the mixed zinc and lead concentrate to be produced from 1995 at MIM's 70 per cent-owned McArthur River project in the Northern Territory of Australia.</p>

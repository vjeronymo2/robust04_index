			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa said he is resuming his bid to become president of  Peru, which is struggling with economic chaos and a growing leftist insurgency.  Public opinion polls showed Vargas Llosa favored by 44% of the voters, more  than double the figure for his principal rival, Alfonso Barrantes, a Marxist  and former mayor of Lima, the capital. Earlier, Vargas Llosa had withdrawn from  the race because of squabbling between the two parties of a center-right  coalition that nominated him for president. The parties settled their dispute  over the weekend.  </P></p>

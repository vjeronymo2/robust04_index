			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Fujian Province, in  southeast China, is boosting aquatic production to make up for  its grain shortages.    Although boasting a 3,300-kilometer coastline, Fujian has  few  cultivated areas, averaging 0.033 hectares per capita.    The provincial government has taken the lead in the country  in reforming its fishing system and lifted prices on aquatic  products since 1990.    As a result, its aquatic products output reached 1,903  million kilograms last year, ranking third in the country and  averaging 60.5 kilograms per capita.    According to Zhang Wenliang, director of the provincial  bureau of aquatic products, the output value of Fujian's  fisheries will lead in Fujian's agricultural output value in the  year 2010.    In addition to aquatic production, Fujian is paying  attention  to the development of deep-water fishing, offshore oil pumping,  mining and tourism.</p>

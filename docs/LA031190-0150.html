			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STASTNY HAUNTS FORMER TEAMMATES AS DEVILS BEAT NORDIQUES  </P> <P> The New Jersey Devils were seeking a little more offensive strength when they  obtained Peter Stastny from the Quebec Nordiques this week.  </P> <P> The veteran center, in just his second game with his new club, turned on his  former teammates Saturday night at East Rutherford, N.J., and led the Devils to  a 9-3 victory.  </P> <P> Stastny, who had spent his entire 10-year career with the Nordiques, had two  goals and an assist, and the Devils moved into second place in the Patrick  Division.  </P> <P> Washington 4, Philadelphia 3 -- For 17 consecutive seasons, the Flyers have  made the NHL playoffs. There is a very good chance the streak will end soon.  </P> <P> For the second night in a row, Dino Ciccarelli scored the winning goal in the  third period and the Capitals extended their unbeaten string to four games  (3-0-1).  </P> <P> With 10 games left, the Flyers are six points out of fourth place, the final  playoff spot in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> Buffalo 5, Hartford 0 -- Daren Puppa stopped 31 shots to hand the Whalers their  first shutout at Hartford, Conn., in more than two years.  </P> <P> Although it was his first shutout this season, Puppa improved his record to  28-14-6 and moved the Sabres to within four points of first place in the Adams  Division.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 2, Minnesota 2 -- Just when it appeared that goaltender Jon  Casey would lead the North Stars to victory at Bloomington, Minn., a bouncing  puck led to a tie.  </P> <P> There were less than nine minutes left in regulation when Casey went behind the  net to play the puck. It skipped away from Casey and out to Brian Mullen, who  gave the Rangers the tie.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 3, Boston 3 -- The Islanders' winless streak didn't end, but  they did rally for a tie at Uniondale, N.Y.  </P> <P> With Doug Crossman figuring in all three scores, the Islanders (0-10-2 in the  last 12 games), earned a point against the team with the best record in the  NHL.  </P> <P> Detroit 3, Montreal 3 -- The Red Wings led, 3-2, but with 35 seconds left in  regulation and goaltender Patrick Roy removed in favor of another attacker, the  Canadiens tied it when Mike McPhee put in a shot from above the right slot.  </P> <P> Toronto 3, Edmonton 2 -- Vince Damphousse scored twice, and the Maple Leafs  became the first team to score 300 goals this season.  </P> <P> St. Louis 2, Chicago 2 -- Brett Hull scored his 66th goal and the Blues held on  for a tie at St. Louis to retain first place in the Norris Division.

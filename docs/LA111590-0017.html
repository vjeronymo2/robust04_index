Socha, 28, a graduate business student at Cal State Dominguez Hills,  is charged with 28 counts of robbery, kidnaping and sexual assault.  </P> <P> He denied all of the charges at an arraignment Wednesday in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Arthur Jean ordered Socha to remain in custody without  bail and scheduled a Jan. 2 trial.  </P> <P> At Socha's preliminary hearing last month, four women identified him as the man  who sexually assaulted them in August and September in Long Beach and San  Pedro.

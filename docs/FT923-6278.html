			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was good general demand reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Landed new seasons Assams met a ready response and sold at prices in line with expectations. Brightest East African teas and medium descriptions proved irregular and often tended easier with quality. Brighter Central Africans remained fully firm but the remainder showed a decline. Offshore good competition with selected brighter teas dearer. The highest price realised this week was 202p for a Rwanda pf. 1. Quotations quality 175p/kg, good medium 134p/kg, medium 125p/kg, low medium 78p/kg.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- NATO is standing firm  after expiry of its ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs to pull back  heavy weapons from the eastern town of Gorazde but is not  sabre-rattling, British envoy John Weston said here Wednesday.    In comments to journalists on the Bosnian Serbs' apparent  compliance with the NATO ultimatum, under threat of air strikes,  the ambassador said: "We're very pleased, yes, but there is no  gung- hoism in this alliance. We're firm but not gung-ho." The  sequence of events showed that the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization could make a contribution to the United Nations in  Bosnia when required "and do it properly and effectively,"  Weston said.    Asked about air strikes on other UN protected zones, he  refused to spoeculate, adding: "I just hope the lesson has been  learned. I think we're building on the valuable experience of  Sarajevo. If it's working also in Gorazde, so much the better."    "By 2:01 Brussels time (0001 GMT), when the deadline for the  withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons from the 20  kilometers (12-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde expired,  there was evidence of compliance with the NATO ultimatum," A  NATO spokesman said early Wednesday.    As a result of this evidence, NATO southern commander  Admiral  Leighton Smith and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] "have agreed  that airstrikes are not necessary for the moment," the spokesman  added. "We will however remain vigilant and we reiterate our  determination to conduct airstrikes in coordination with  UNPROFOR if Gorazde and other safe areas in Bosnia are attacked  or existing exclusion zones are violated".</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Canadian Government Bonds: Rollercoaster ride may turn even bumpier CANADA'S bond market is on a wild ride. Since early September, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has swung between a 1992 low of 7.07 per cent and a peak of 8.05 per cent. The gap between three-year US and Canadian issues has seesawed between 107 and 309 basis points. Price changes of a dollar or two a day no longer raise eyebrows. The market could become even more volatile over the next few weeks, with both direction and amplitude depending largely on the outcome of Canada's constitutional referendum on October 26. Mr Andrew Pyle, an analyst at MMS International in Toronto, predicts that yields could climb to new 1992 highs in the next few days as uncertainty about the vote mounts. A Yes victory next Monday, endorsing the constitutional package known as the Charlottetown agreement, would almost certainly ignite a massive rally in Canadian bonds. Although the Charlottetown pact by no means defuses all Canada's political tensions, its acceptance would be a severe setback to Quebec separatists, and to the various other regional and special interest groups campaigning against the agreement. Judging by opinion polls, the Yes side has made some gains in the past week, but the No forces remain well ahead in several key provinces, notably Quebec and British Columbia. In the event of a No victory, holders of Canadian bonds will find themselves torn between a bearish political outlook and generally bullish economic trends. The separatists are likely to push for an election in Quebec. If they win that, they have promised another referendum on the specific issue of independence for the francophone province. At the very least, a No vote next Monday will keep Canadians pre-occupied with the national unity issue for years to come. Even so, bond market optimists argue that a thumbs-down to the Charlottetown agreement will do no more than delay and stretch out an inevitable resumption of the two-year slide in interest rates. Canada's inflation is running at a miniscule annual rate of 1.3 per cent, the lowest among the leading industrial countries. Nor is it expected to accelerate much for at least the next 12 months, with real gross domestic product forecast to rise by no more than about 1.5 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent in 1993. Foreign investors do face the risk that gains in bond prices could be wiped out by a further drop in the Canadian dollar, which has slid by more than 10 per cent from its November 1991 peak of 89.30 US cents. The Bank of Canada has so far been reluctant to allow sudden, big falls in the currency. Many market players are confident that it will continue to smoothe the dollar's decline, if necessary by temporarily pushing up interest rates, as it has during the European currency crisis and the run-up to the referendum. On balance, the prevailing view is that, whatever shocks are in store over the next few weeks, the long-term outlook for bonds remains favourable. Mr Clive Coombs, who runs a Canadian bond mutual fund for AGF Management of Toronto, says that 'as long as you can sit tight for the next month, the fundamentals are tremendous.' Mr Coombs expects yields to fall by at least 50 to 75 basis points over the next 12 months. Burns Fry, the Toronto securities firm, concluded in its weekly fixed-income review last week that 'any price weakness remains a buying opportunity'. Investors took that advice after Standard &amp; Poor's cut its rating on Canada's foreign-currency debt last week from Triple A to Double A-Plus. Bond prices tumbled by as much as CDollars 2 immediately after the announcement, but they had recovered the loss by last Friday.</p>

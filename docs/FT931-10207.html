			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / G7 finance ministers to meet in London FINANCE MINISTERS from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will meet in London on February 27 at the invitation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. The UK Treasury announced yesterday that the meeting, which will also be attended by G7 central bank governors, would be informal, 'with no expectation of decisions or initiatives', and that the ministers did not intend to issue a communique afterwards. The ministers and governors are expected to discuss how best to boost activity in the world economy when recovery in the UK is uncertain and the economic outlook for Japan and continental Europe bleak. While the G7 has reason to be pleased about signs of recovery in the US, America's trading partners may express concern about signs of protectionism in Washington since the Clinton administration took office. Russia's problems may also be raised. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, has sought a meeting with his colleagues from Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada before the next scheduled G7 gathering on April 29 in Washington. He has said he wants to breathe new life into the group, which recently has tended to be a forum for bickering rather than international co-operation. The London meeting will be a first opportunity for Mr Bentsen and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the recently appointed Japanese finance minister, to meet the other G7 finance ministers. It is unusual but not unprecedented for the G7 to meet without issuing a communique. The most recent occasion was in 1989.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Modest rally in the blue chip stocks A CAUTIOUS and somewhat faltering rally on the London stock market yesterday reflected hopes that, following the Bundesbank's action this week, the next cut in UK interest rates will not be long delayed. A temporary respite from the flow of company trading results took some of the pressure off the market as it waited for next week's list of corporate and economic data. But the recovery was erratic, and the Footsie twice came close to re-testing its overnight levels before closing 5.8 up at 3,037. Towards the end of the session, rumours of another sizeable rights issue call revived, with the hotels group in the frame this time. The FT-SE Index has fallen by a further 20.3 points this week - the first leg of the trading account. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, up 7.4 at 3,476.3 yesterday, reduced the week's setback to no more than a few points. The announcement that Banque Indosuez was closing down the institutional investor side of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, two long-established names in the London stock market, confirmed rumours that have circulated for some weeks. However, the French bank's decision underlined the pressures still felt in the marketplace despite the return to generally profitable trading volumes in equities. Government bonds had a quiet session, although at the close the longer dates were extending recent gains and small rises in near-dated stocks indicated hopes of a cut in base rates sooner rather than later. Little attention was paid to statistics on the UK trade gap for the second quarter of the year. A further gain in Glaxo shares represented about a half of the overall gain in the Footsie. But Glaxo was well balanced by weakness elsewhere in drug stocks as the US dollar weakened. SmithKline Beecham suffered again from doubts over the UK stock market index rating of the units. Against this background, there was little optimism to be discerned behind yesterday's share price rally. SG Warburg referred in its weekly client briefing to the 'cautious tone' of many of the companies reporting trading progress, stressing that overseas earnings are a key element. Seaq volume fell to 596m shares yesterday from 726.8m on the previous day, with non-Footsie stocks making up around 64 per cent of the total. retail, or customer business, strengthened to a worth of Pounds 1.56bn on Thursday.</p>

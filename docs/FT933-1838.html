			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Record sales of securities help boost economy OVERSEAS institutions bought record volumes of UK financial securities in the second quarter, helping to finance the current account deficit. During the period non-UK groups purchased securities including government gilts and corporate stocks and bonds worth a total of Pounds 13.82bn. This was almost two thirds of the Pounds 21.39bn figure for the whole of last year and well up on the previous quarterly record of Pounds 8bn seen in late 1987. Non-UK groups bought gilts worth Pounds 4.58bn in the second quarter, in response to large issues of the securities by the Bank of England to finance government borrowing. Overseas investments in securities formed part of the capital inflows which helped to finance the second quarter's Pounds 2.68bn current account deficit. The current account deficit, mainly accounted for by an excess of imports over exports of merchandise goods and oil, has to be balanced by a flow of cash into the UK on the capital account. In the first quarter the deficit on the current account was Pounds 2.99bn, while for the whole of last year it was Pounds 8.62bn. The Pounds 3.3bn deficit on merchandise, or visible deficit, during the second quarter was partly offset by a Pounds 621m surplus on invisible trade  -payments of interest, profits and dividends. The second-quarter invisibles surplus was a slight improvement on the first quarter's Pounds 512m. Last year the invisibles surplus totalled Pounds 4.79bn. In the second quarter service industries earned a net Pounds 1.13bn on overseas trade, compared with a Pounds 1.47bn surplus in the first quarter. The UK had net earnings in the second quarter of Pounds 684m on invisible trade. The comparable figure for January to March was Pounds 356m.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / British Gas offers poor service, say rivals FIVE OF the UK's leading independent gas marketing companies expressed their anger in a letter to British Gas yesterday about alleged poor standards of service from the company's transportation arm. British Gas is required to transport gas owned by rivals along its pipelines as a way of introducing more competition. But the independent shippers say British Gas does not have adequate systems to deal with the changing market. The five companies say they have been waiting since October for monthly meter readings by British Gas so that they can bill their customers. 'We've been severely damaged by this,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica. 'The present system is too cumbersome and complex to work in the current market.' Mr Donald Young, managing director of gas transmission at British Gas, said: 'We're moving heaven and earth to sort out this problem. The number of sites involved has grown from 6,000 in October to 27,000 on February 1.' Mr Young said there were 'teething problems' with the system to handle the extra business. British Gas has been caught on the hop by the rapid development of competition in the industrial and commercial market. Rival shippers supply nearly half of the market for firm gas (where supplies are not subject to interruption), which represents half the overall industrial gas market. The rival shippers, however, suspect that British Gas's poor service reflects antipathy towards competition. Their letter notes that while the independents are suffering delays on meter reading and billing, British Gas's own customers are receiving that service in a timely manner. Mr Young denied the claim. He said: 'We are working flat-out to make sure competitors get all the back-up they need from us.' The shippers' letter to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, stresses that they have made many complaints to the company's transportation arm, but that, rather than improving, the service has become worse. Ofgas, the industry regulator, says it has received numerous complaints about transportation. It is looking at the introduction of a list of service standards to which British Gas would have to adhere in its dealings with shippers.</p>

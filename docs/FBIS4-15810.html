			<p>BFN     [Text] Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the Rukh, held a  press conference today devoted to the results of the  second-round legislative elections. The conference aroused so  much interest that Mr. Chornovil jokingly said it was not a  conference, but another meeting with the electorate of which he  conducted more than 200 during his campaign. The main result,  according to Vyacheslav Chornovil, is that the elections took  place, and the Ukrainian people should be credited with this  fact. The Rukh faction held its ground in the new parliament.  In the elections, Rukh positioned itself in the center of the  political spectrum, rejecting both far- right and far-left  slogans. Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Rukh tried to handle  its rivals and opponents in a correct manner, which cannot be  said about them. The elections showed that our democratic and  national movement has a long way to go yet before achieving  unity. Those forces, Mr. Chornovil stated, did not participate  in the elections as a united front. For example, divisions  between Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party deepened, and a  similar tendency is visible in the case of the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists, which diverges the principles of  democratic nationalism, on which its cooperation with Rukh was  based.    Mr. Chornovil then focused on the flawed Ukrainian electoral  legislation and violations reported during the recent voting.  One could see that particular concern of the Rukh leader was  aroused by the fact that Kiev is left without its legislative  core. The elections here were simply torpedoed. Vyacheslav  Chornovil stated that Rukh will not allow this to happen in the  next, third-round elections, and will vigorously fight for every  vacant seat in the parliament so that Kiev is represented by  democratically oriented deputies. Democracy cannot do without a  lobby in parliament.    [Begin Chornovil recording] There are quite a few  independent  democrats, or candidates whose independence have not yet been  established. Some were in the power structures, and thus stayed  out of parties. I think the uniting of democratic forces will  be considered, unless some of the hot-headed national democrats  shatter this unity. There have already been such attempts. By  the way, I would like to see the newly elected Supreme Council  carried away by political discussions, which is probably  something that our communists will seek. It will be a bad thing  if we start squabbling over national symbols or some other  political issues. Perhaps we will have to look for [words  indistinct] to resolve the serious problems with which Ukraine  is presently faced. [end recording]</p>

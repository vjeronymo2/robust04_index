			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Cadbury set to weaken trade unions Cadbury, the confectionery arm of Cadbury Schweppes, is planning to weaken the trade unions at its plants through a new strategy for its 5,000 UK employees, according to internal company documents obtained by the TGWU general union. An internal company paper says: 'The role of the trade union needs to be marginalised by greater focus on direct communication and consultation but without an overt statement to this effect.' The paper is a summary of the 'personal values agreed by senior factory managers' at a meeting on September 29. The leaked document suggests that the company will need to reduce its workforce, and says it may have to consider a 'potential downsizing scenario'. It also says: 'Employee support for the trade union should . . . decrease over time. However, it is not likely that the trade union would be derecognised, given the likelihood of downsizing. A redefined role for the trade union is therefore required.' The company adds in the paper that for those groups whose unions have been derecognised, 'it is important they are not exploited by the company as this would lead to pressure for renewed trade union involvement'. Cadbury also intends to investigate 'how involvement can continue without formal union structures'. Cadbury's other plans include 'severing the link between the retail price index and pay and replacing collective bargaining with individualised arrangements' tied to skill, competence and performance-related salaries'. The company also wants to make level one of the national vocational qualification the skill standard for all production workers. Mr Brian Revell, the TGWU's national secretary for the food industry, said the new strategy was disappointing. 'It is certainly not consistent with the company's respectable Quaker image of the past,' he said, and suggested it was being 'basically . . . manipulative'. Shop stewards from Cadbury unions are due to meet this weekend to discuss their response. The company said last night that Cadbury was 'looking at possible options for the future'. It aims to shift consultation away from the unions, and says it also wants to establish 'a performance-focused culture' in its plants with a 'revaluation of the balance between basic pay for the job, payment for skill enhancement and pay associated with sharing in the success of the business'. The document adds: 'A key issue for the near term will be the need to reduce numbers if volume growth is not achieved and plant efficiencies continue to improve.'</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Kohl to bolster Yeltsin despite debt issues CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany to Moscow last night, hoping to demonstrate his strong support for President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a summit which is overshadowed by festering disagreement concerning outstanding Russian debts. The event is likely to prove diplomatically sensitive, with Mr Yeltsin in a battle to assert his authority at home, while Mr Kohl is unable to make the sort of financial pledges he used to give so willingly to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has been forced to join in the top-level talks, because of the failure by the two sides to resolve two key financial questions. The first concerns outstanding debts owed by Russia to the former East Germany, amounting to some DM17.6bn (Pounds 7.16bn). These debts were accumulated in transferable roubles, the internal currency of the Comecon state-trading organisation. Germany is insisting they must be honoured. 'These are debts owing for goods delivered by East German enterprises to Russian enterprises, and they have simply not paid up,' a German Finance Ministry official said yesterday. 'We recognise the enormous difficulties Russia is facing, and we are willing to give whatever help we can in supporting the restructuring process, but we are not prepared simply to write off the debt.' The second issue concerns compensation payments for the facilities left behind by Soviet troops departing from East Germany. Mr Yeltsin has claimed anything up to DM8bn for these buildings, military air strips and other structures. But the German government insists they have nothing like that market value. 'We have agreed to pay the market value, but the Russians have some difficulty understanding what that is,' an official said. The German side says that far from having any intrinsic value, most of the facilities will have to be demolished, and widespread environmental pollution cleared up, at a cost running into billions of D-Marks. In spite of months of negotiations, the two sides still appear far apart on the amount of compensation payable. The German side is not planning to talk in detail about Russia's request for a comprehensive debt rescheduling, currently under negotiation with the Paris Club of creditor governments. 'That is a matter for the Paris Club, and the only contribution we can make is to improve the atmosphere,' the German official said.</p>

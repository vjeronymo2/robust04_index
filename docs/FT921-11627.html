			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Anger over Pounds 3bn loss forecast for Lloyd's FORECASTS that insurance losses at Lloyd's of London could amount to more than Pounds 3bn over the next three years provoked consternation at the insurance market yesterday. It had been expected that the 1989 year, for which Lloyd's will report results in June, would produce losses above Pounds 1bn. But the scale of 1990 and 1991 losses forecast yesterday by Chatset, the independent research group, surprised market insiders. Chatset suggested that total losses for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 years may exceed Pounds 3.1bn, which compares with deposits and reserves of around Pounds 4.4bn at the end of 1990. Names, the individuals whose assets make up the market's capital base, deposit with Lloyd's an amount equivalent to 30 per cent of their stamp capacity - the amount of premiums they are allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules. Losses of this scale would damage the market's solvency, although Lloyd's can still call on the personal wealth of its 22,500 Names to meet claims. 'Lloyd's is going to need a massive injection of cash,' said Mr Charles Sturge, the co-editor of Chatset's reports. Chatset suggested that urgent action was needed to bolster the the market's central fund, out of which claims are paid if Names are unable to meet commitments. The fund currently totals some Pounds 450m. The group's grim predictions came as the market's leadership grappled with the implications of implementing wide-ranging reforms recommended by a task force just over a fortnight ago. The figures produced an angry response from underwriters on the market who believe they exaggerate the size of 1990 and 1991 losses. Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association representing more than 150 Lloyd's agencies, described the 1991 predictions as 'completely and grossly inaccurate. By any stretch of the imagination they are crystal ball gazing.' Mr Archard took issue with Chatset's estimates for 1990 (a loss of more than Pounds 1bn compared to a forecast loss of Pounds 1.35bn in 1989) and 1991 (a loss in the region of Pounds 750m). Chatset's forecast that Lloyd's may need an average of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 600m each year to top up reserves for US asbestosis and pollution claims is also hotly contested by insiders at the market.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: Lower interest rates and lower expectations - Wall Street THE headline on the front page of the New York Post, as it often does, said it all. Next to a big picture of President Bush were the words: '10 million Americans out of work. George may be next." The headline helps explain why the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 20 points on the day the Federal Reserve instigated an interest rate cut that the market had been crying out for for the past two weeks. Question: If the market has been desperate for a rate cut, why didn't it welcome the Fed's move on Thursday? Answer: The Fed only cut interest rates after a dreadful set of June employment figures, and investors were more pessimistic about what the highest unemployment rate for eight years might do to President Bush's chances of re-election than they were optimistic about what lower credit costs might do to aid the economy. Recent reports have said that the White House is divided over what line to take on the economy - should it be guardedly optimistic or should it try to keep a lid on expectations? - but recently, it is clear, the President has favoured the former. Only earlier this week he complained vigorously that the media was distorting the true economic picture so much that people were unaware of the good news about the recovery. Bush's optimism looks dangerously foolish in the light of the June jobs data, and both political and economic pundits were quick to say afterwards that in the modern era no sitting President has won re-election with the economy in such a poor state. In spite of Bush's obvious failings, the investing community appears to favour him over either Bill Clinton or Ross Perot, so it was no surprise that the market greeted Thursday's damaging employment news so gloomily. The stock market was not just thinking about politics on Thursday, however. There was a good technical reason for the fall in stocks. The Dow had risen more than 70 points in the first three days of the week in anticipation/hope of a policy ease, so when the rate cut came, it was already fully priced into the market. There was also a fundamental factor at work. If the economy is as weak as the employment data suggests, then expectations about corporate earnings may have to be quickly revised downwards. Economists have already had to lower their forecasts for second quarter output growth in the light of recent poor economic statistics. Gross domestic product grew a modest 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and having originally expected second quarter GDP growth to exceed that, economists are now talking about second and third quarter GDP growth of between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent. It is now quite possible that for all of 1992 GDP will grow at an annual rate of no more than 2 per cent, which would make it the slowest post-recession recovery since the Second World War. Wall Street analysts will have to do some similar trimming to their corporate earnings estimates. With the labour market in such a poor state - the June employment report showed payrolls falling, the jobless rate rising, working hours declining and average earnings flat - consumer demand is likely to be weaker than expected. If consumers are not spending much, and equally worrying, not saving much either (the consumer savings rate is about 5 per cent, well below the rate normally required for a robust recovery), Corporate America is not going to enjoy the profits growth everyone had anticipated. US companies cannot even look abroad for help. Export sales are poor, even with a weak dollar, because foreign demand for US goods is being suppressed by the wobbly global economy. So where does the market go from here?. The last time the Fed slashed interest rates (in late December), stock prices took off in an orgy of buying as investors rushed out of lower-yielding assets and into equities in the expectation that capital growth would be strong on the back of rapidly improving corporate earnings. Do not expect a similar reaction this time. Since the robust economic and earnings recovery anticipated by those who bought stocks after the December rate cut never materialised, investors will be reluctant to make the same mistake twice. This time, they will probably wait for hard proof of better corporate profits before committing more funds to equities, which means the market could be in for a long, dull summer.  -------------------------------- Monday      3319.86  +   37.45 Tuesday     3318.52  -    1.34 Wednesday   3354.1   +   35.58 Thursday    3330.29  -    23.81 Friday      Market closed  --------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The representative of  the North Korean general mission in Paris, Pak Tong-chun,  commenting on possible U.N. sanctions against his country, says  Pyongyang is prepared to go to war or resume dialogue on the  nuclear issue.    In an interview with the daily LIBERATION, Pak said Thursday  that the Korean peninsula is at "a negative turning point."    If the United States and its allies including France imposed  economic and other sanctions, North Korea would regard it as a  declaration of war, Pak said.    "As North Korea is ready to wage an all-out war, it is also  ready to resume dialogue," he said. "This is not just idle talk."    He also threatened that a "catastrophic situation" would  develop on the Korean peninsula if the United States and South  Korea resumed their annual military exercise Team Spirit.    "Dialogue is always possible," Pak stressed, "but Team  Spirit  will have to be cancelled before it can take place."    U.N. sanctions against North Korea or deployment of Patriot  anti-missile missiles in South Korea could force Pyongyang to  withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he added.</p>

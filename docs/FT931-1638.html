			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (7): Changes create problems - Reforms have revitalised the banking system THREE years into a radical reform programme, the Czech government has yet to reap the fruits of its efforts to transform a centralised financial system in which banks were little more than a conduit for distributing money, into a competitive and efficient financial services sector. Reforms have already changed the Czech Republic's banking system beyond recognition from what used to be essentially a cash economy, in which money transfers took weeks if not months, and where credit cards and cheque books were unknown. But much remains to be done to achieve western standards. 'There are three main problem areas. The legal environment is incomplete; on the operational side there are still considerable delays and the introduction of new technology has been slow; and risk assessment is poor and information on which to evaluate risk is unreliable,' says a senior foreign banker. The recent spectacular and rapid expansion of the banking sector also highlighted a shortage of qualified staff and led to widespread poaching. Only about half of bank employees have been in banking for more than a year, and there are few experienced operations staff. Mr Richard Salzmann, chairman of Komercni Banka, the largest commercial bank, explains. 'Five years ago there was one big bank, the Statni Banka, which was the central bank and a commercial bank at the same time. About 70 per cent of the Statni Banka's reserves were taken from the Czech and Slovak savings banks. In 1990, it was split up into four banks (including an independent central bank and Komercni Banka). After that, many more new banks were created.' Today there are about 70 banks including several foreign institutions active on the rapidly expanding Czech market. Komercni Banka provides a good example of the pace of developments. In 1990, it had 7,500 employees, 83 branches, and around 5,000 clients consisting of state companies and agencies, and co-operatives. Today, it has 16,000 employees, 450 branches and around 300,000 clients - about half the Czech Republic's 700,000 bank accounts. That experience was repeated across the spectrum of Czech banks which were joined by the arrival of a large number of foreign banks including Creditanstalt of Austria, Citibank of the US, Barclays of the UK, ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, BNP-Dresdner Bank, among others. The foreign banks benefited from their ability to offer better and faster services than local banks. But while their arrival on the Czech scene helped to shake up the local market, they have only a small portion of the market which continues to be dominated by the big Czech banks. Government hopes that opening the market to foreign banks would stimulate competition have been disappointed. It is early days yet, and the Czech banks face a number of challenges. Under the previous communist regime, the banking system accumulated a large volume of bad debts - often the result of loans extended to companies on government orders. Many of these loans will never be paid back. To overcome this crippling burden and to give the banks a fresh start, the government decided to clean up the banks' balance sheets in one fell swoop by allowing them to hive off the greater part of their non-performing loans and transfer them to the Konsolidacni Banka (Consolidation Bank), an institution specifically created to absorb these debts. In 1991, about one third of Komercni Banka's CzK250bn assets was disposed of in this way. 'The idea was to concentrate all bad loans into the Consolidation Bank. We also sold to the bank some other bad debt which might be redeemable in the long term,' Mr Salzmann says. The Consolidation Bank, he says, is the 'dustbin of the financial system'. The hope is that the Consolidation Bank will be able to get some of the loans repaid, and sell some of the bad debt on the market. The rest will have to be repaid by the National Property Fund, an institution established to handle the privatisation process and which has become a large shareholder in a large number of companies. But in spite of this cosmetic clean-up of the banks' balance sheets, another problem looms. Next month a new bankruptcy law comes into effect which could result in a wave of business failures. The collapse of markets in the former Comecon trade bloc, recession in the west, and a severe decline in domestic output, have left a large number of companies deeply in debt to one another due to lack of funds. 'This has been a lousy way of compensating for the shortage of liquidity in the market,' says one banker. No-one knows the exact volume of inter-company debt and estimates vary widely between CzK200bn and CzK300bn. But a large number of bankruptcies would be a blow to the commercial banks whose main lending is to companies. It would also affect the savings institutions which remain a principal source of funding for the commercial banks. Banks are also under pressure to meet tough new capital ratio requirements of 8 per cent of lending assets by the end of this year, and for the first time, they are being audited to western standards - which it is hoped will reveal a true picture of their financial health. All of which will accelerate the drive to raise productivity, and the quality and range of services. Most banks are investing heavily in new technology, and foreign institutions have been called upon to help with training programmes for staff that range from risk assessment to management skills and how to deal with people. 'We can't change everything overnight. It is an unprecedented task, but the banks must come under pressure too,' says Mr Ivan Kocarnik, finance minister. The government does not hide that it would like the banks to make a more sturdy contribution to the economic reform process. It now looks as if they will have no other choice.</p>

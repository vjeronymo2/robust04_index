			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief to focus on core business Mr Kajo Neukirchen, called in last Friday as the new chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, is set to refocus the troubled German metals, mining and industrial group on its core businesses. In the first statement from the conglomerate since sweeping management changes took effect last week, it said the restructuring would lead to a flow of funds into the group, hinting at the partial or outright sale of some of the group's 250-plus subsidiaries. The statement, which did not go so far as to say what would constitute the group's newly defined core businesses, came too late to influence the group's share price. This fell by more than 10 per cent yesterday amid uncertainty about the scale of the problems at the company, Germany's fourteenth largest industrial group. The shares dropped DM31.20 to close at DM255. They have nearly halved in the two weeks since the group announced that it had negotiated new lines of credit to stave off a liquidity crisis. Metallgesellschaft said Mr Neukirchen had flown to New York immediately after his appointment to get a picture of the financial problems at MG Corp, the New York-based trading company whose difficulties triggered the crisis and led ultimately to the ousting last Friday of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive, together with five boardroom colleagues. Teams of specialists placed at MG Corp in the past two weeks had succeeded in analysing and limiting the group's problems, the group said yesterday. Further details were not forthcoming but 'the problems (of MG Corp) will be dealt with professionally in the coming years,' the statement said. Implementation of a solution to the problems had begun on Monday this week and Mr Karl von der Heyden, former finance director of RJR Nabisco, had been appointed as MG Corp chief executive, Metallgesellschaft said. Two weeks ago Metallgesell-schaft said MG Corp had had to make margin calls (cash-calls) as a result of dealings in oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At the time, Metallgesellschaft and its bankers said the liquidity squeeze caused by the margin calls was temporary, a technicality triggered by the sharply falling oil price. But investigations proved the difficulties to be more than a mere technicality and it is now inevitable that Metallgesellschaft will need a major capital injection. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner bank, large shareholders in Metallgesellschaft as well as creditors, are continuing to provide liquidity support.</p>

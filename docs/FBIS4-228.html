			<p>BFN     [Text] The five-day old state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal  faced its first major test today. A protest march by thousands  of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters in Empangeni went  ahead under the watchful eye of a strong security force  contingent without any incidents of violence; but large sections  of the crowd, which assembled at an open field before the march,  refused to lay down their traditional weapons in defiance of the  emergency regulations. This report from Veronica van der  Westhuizen and cameraman Koen Marnewijk:    [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] Bus loads of people  arrived from all over Zululand to mourn the death of more than  50 Zulus who died in Johannesburg on Monday last week. They  also turned out in force to show their support for King Goodwill  Zwelithini. Security force members were present in large  numbers at an open field where the group gathered before the  march, but they proved to be no deterrent to the IFP supporters  who alighted from busses openly displaying traditional weapons.    [Police Legal Services spokesperson Major Margaret Kruger]  As  you can see they are trying to take them off as they come of the  busses, and what I think they envisage doing is asking the  organizers to please speak to the people and explain to them  what has happened. We will then ask the organizers who have  been cooperating with us all along to not allow ... [changes  thought] to ask the people not to display and carry the weapons  during the march.    [Van der Westhuizen] An attempt by a couple of policemen to  confiscate the weapons failed. The police then held a meeting  with the local leadership in an effort to persuade their  followers to leave their weapons behind while marching. IFP  organizer Mr. Reginald Mkhize then asked the people to do so.    [Mkhize] Due to the fact that the state of emergency came to  us... [changes thought] Whilst in our hand we have the permit  to hold this march, we could not get enough time to tell our  people not to bring those so-called dangerous weapons. For that  reason we are trying our best to take whatever is dangerous and  keep it into our bakkie [pickup truck] so that our people are  not seen carrying them.    [Van der Westhuizen] The crowd expressed its dissatisfaction  and only a few sharp objects were handed in. The march then  proceeded through the heavily guarded streets of Empangeni.  Police and the army were stationed outside properties along the  route and barbed wire was put up in front of premises housing  the local ANC branch. A memorandum was then handed over to  representatives of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC].  In it the IFP strongly attacked the IEC, saying that it was a  product of what it called the ANC-dominated Transitional  Executive Council.    [IFP spokesman Muzi Gwala] If the IEC makes it possible to  force the installation of the polling booths in our areas before  our demands are met, I am afraid the people will use even their  own teeth to tear them down.    [Van der Westhuizen] The IFP's demands included the  postponement of the election and a federal state. The IFP says  if their demands are not met the IEC would find it difficult to  maintain peace and stability that could lead to free and fair  elections. The IFP also warned that they would ensure that the  April election would not take place even if it meant losing  their lives. [end recording]</p>

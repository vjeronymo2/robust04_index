			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOLSHOI TROUPE ARRIVES FOR ITS ISRAEL DEBUT  </P> <P> Bolshoi ballet dancers arrived Sunday for their eagerly awaited debut in  Israel, deftly brushing aside questions about the future of diplomatic ties  between Israel and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union cut ties with Israel after the Israeli-Arab War in 1967, but  in the last two years, relations have warmed with an exchange of consular  delegations and increasing contacts. The Bolshoi's performances this month are  the first in Israel.  </P> <P> "It is very important that people will have the opportunity for contact and the  contact with this language (of dance) helps other contact," said Natalia  Bessmertnova, the Bolshoi's prima ballerina.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Rich History  </P> <P> As for Israel, Bessmertnova said she is excited to be performing in a country  rich in history and before a new audience.  </P> <P> Choreography director Yuri Papkov said the purpose of the visit is artistic  rather than diplomatic, but he added, "We are very experienced dancers of the  Bolshoi, and wherever there are beginnings of some kind of relations, the  Bolshoi is one of the first (there)."  </P> <P> The company of 50 dancers includes performers from the Bolshoi as well as other  troupes in the Soviet Union. They are scheduled for more than a dozen  performances in Caesarea, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem this month, nearly two years  after negotiations began for the Soviet dancers to travel to Israel for the  first time.  </P> <P> Of the 36,000 tickets available for the performances, only 4,000 remain unsold.  The first performance will be staged on Wednesday in a seaside amphitheater  beside the ruins of Caesarea.  </P></p>

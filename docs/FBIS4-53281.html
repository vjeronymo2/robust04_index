			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar TV Network in  Japanese at 1100 GMT on 8 May, in its "Sunday Project" program,  carries a 30-minute live roundtable discussion on Japan-U.S.  ties and framework talks. The discussion is moderated by  Soichiro Tahara. Guests include Kyoto University Professor  Masaaki Kosaka; Hajime Takano, chief editor of INSIDER magazine;  Kenichi Omae, head of Heisei Restoration Group (Heisei Ishin No  Kai); Bill Totten, president of Assist Corporation; and  Yoshihiro Tsurumi, New York City University professor.    The first 11 minutes of the discussion are devoted to former  Justice Minister Nagano's remarks on the Nanjing massacre in  China and Nagano's resignation.    At 1111 GMT, Tahara begins to review the series of events  took place during the Hosokawa administration over the  Japan-U.S. framework talks. Noting the recent report of the  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tahara asks Omae if Japan-U.S.  economic ties have reached the worst situation possible. Omae  says that economic relations between the two countries are good,  that most U.S. companies in Japan are doing well, and that the  USTR, contrary to the true state of affairs, is creating a  commotion. He continues to say that the USTR is a "tradesman"  representing a very small number of U.S. companies having  difficulties in Japan. He adds: "The policy of truly  first-class companies is not to use the USTR." Tsurumi also  says: "Japan-U.S. relations are not bad at all as far as the  economy is concerned. It is true, however, that for political  reasons, many people in Japan and the United States are stirring  up the situation." Tsurumi then says that the Clinton  administration is bashing Japan to avoid criticism by U.S.  citizens directed at the U.S. Government and that "the $60  billion trade deficit with Japan is a lie." Asked what he  thinks of Omae's comments on the USTR, Totten says: "The USTR  is accepting bribes in addition to using U.S. citizens' tax  money. The money Motorola and other companies pay to the USTR  is bribe money in terms of Japanese law. Americans calling it  lobbying." Omae and Tsurumi urge Japanese politicians to  realize the true intentions of the United States and not to  respond to their unfair demands.    On resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  Tsurumi  says: "There is no reason for Japan to resume the framework  talks." He reiterates that Japan will gain nothing from  resumption of the framework talks and states: "It is the  Clinton administration which will be in trouble if the framework  talks do not start again."    Citing the examples of U.S. discussions with China over  human  rights and Singapore's refusal of President Clinton's demand for  Singapore not to cane an American youth, Omae says that the  Japanese Government should resolutely refuse the USTR's recent  three-point demand for resumption of the framework talks.</p>

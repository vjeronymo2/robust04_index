			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: The Telegraph Minority shareholders in The Telegraph may still be smarting over the handling of the company's investment in Southam but they should have less complaint with Mr Conrad Black's diversification into Australia. Following the Australian government's loosening of restrictions on foreign ownership, The Telegraph has spent Pounds 23m increasing its stake in the John Fairfax group of newspapers from 15.3 per cent to 18 per cent with an option to buy some more. Having been laid low by poor management in the 1980s, Fairfax has staged a spirited recovery under new ownership. Its shares have climbed to ADollars 2.31 from ADollars 1.38 since their flotation in April 1992 as the group's profitability has revived. At the time of The Telegraph's own flotation, investors grumbled about the low dividend yield given the maturity of the business and its declining customer base. Yet the Fairfax investment may reveal there is greater growth potential than had previously been assumed. Mr Black's idiosyncratic management style can have its bonuses too.</p>

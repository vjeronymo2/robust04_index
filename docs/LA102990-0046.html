			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTY MAY PROVIDE EMERGENCY RIDES  </P> <P> Ventura County employees who car-pool would be guaranteed a ride home when  their travel plans are disrupted, if a new policy is approved by the Board of  Supervisors on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The proposed policy is aimed at encouraging the county's 6,000 employees to  leave their cars at home and car-pool, van-pool, ride the bus, bicycle or walk  to work.  </P> <P> A ride home would be guaranteed if the employee had to work overtime  unexpectedly, had to leave early because of illness or a family emergency, or  if the car-pool driver was called away from work.  </P> <P> Under the policy, employees might use a county vehicle to drive home or even  call a taxi if they could not find a ride with another employee. If 1,500  employees participate in the county's ride-sharing program, no more than 150  rides home are anticipated, officials said. The cost, including cab fare, would  be less than $5,000 a year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Golotyuk: "Russian Border Troops Dig In In </F> Expectation of Assault: New Type of Outpost Set Up on  Tajik-Afghan Border"]    [Text] Moscow Border Detachment,  Tajikistan--Colonel-General Andrei Nikolayev, commander in chief  of the Russian Border Troops, left Moscow yesterday on a flight  to Dushanbe. The Russian Border Troops leadership had decided to  hold a session of the Main Military Council in Tajikistan. This  unprecedented event--such military council sessions have not  been held in the field for a very long time--illustrates yet  again the enormous importance that Moscow attaches to the  situation on the Afghan border.    Even so, there has already been more than enough evidence in  the past couple of weeks that the Tajik-Afghan border is today  one of Russian's most important borders, even though it is  separated from Russia itself by thousands of kilometers. On a  trip to Dushanbe, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev visited the  Moscow Border detachment. It was also visited by Russian Defense  Minister Grachev, who had come to Tajikistan to see maneuvers by  CIS collective peace-keeping forces. The exercises are being  held with a view to the possible need to repulse a massive  invasion of Tajikistan from the south, from Afghanistan. The  situation on the border even worries Patriarch Aleksiy II of  Moscow and All Rus, who has told Russian soldiers serving in  Tajikistan that the "inviolability of the border of Tajikistan  protects the inviolability of the borders of Russia, as well as  of Ukraine, Belorussia and other countries." "We have to hold  these lines, we will not retreat," Lieutenant-General Tymko,  chief of the Russian Border Troops General Staff, told the  assembled personnel of the Moscow Border Detachment's  much-suffering Outpost No. 12. One gets the impression that if,  God forbid, the Tajik-Afghan border were to be breached, it  would spell the end of Russia.    It is a strange border, to say the least. For a long time,  the very men serving here could in no way figure it just what  sort of border were they defending. The border of the Soviet  Union? But it hasn't existed for a long time. Russia's border?  Russia is far away. The border of the CIS? That's an abstract  notion altogether. This vague situation persists in part to this  day. Border markers with the inscription "inviolable" continue  to stand along the Pyandzh River to this day, they were built to  last. Posters and signs at the outposts say: "CIS Borders Are  Inviolable!" On the faded signs, "CIS" stands out with a fresh  coat of paint; under it one can clearly make out the initials  "USSR." But no one here pays attention to such trifles here any  more. A quite different peculiarity of this border is more  prominent now--the fact this it is becoming increasingly less  like a state border and more and more like a forward defense  line.    Outpost No. 12 has been rebuilt--the very one that was  seized  and destroyed last July by fighters who slipped in from  Afghanistan. Well, it's not exactly the same. The old outpost is  about four kilometers away. Its half-destroyed structures can be  discerned with a powerful stereo-telescope. You can't go up  close, the area is heavily mined. In actual fact, there really  isn't an outpost here. Thin barbed wire along a line of trenches  covers the top of a 1.5-kilometer hillock. There are a pair of  dug-in tanks, an armored personnel carrier, dug-in mortars and a  few dugouts that afford a person at least some protection from  the penetrating mountain wind and sporadic shelling. And a  Russian flag on a bent flagpole proudly flies above all this. It  is a completely new type of border outpost, a creation of the  post-Soviet era. It is a forward post on the border of a Russian  sphere of influence.    The new Outpost No. 12 has been moved about six kilometers  back from the actual border. That area is a no man's land  partially controlled by the border troops and partially  controlled by their counterparts on the other bank of the  Pyandzh--mujahedeen groups, and the armed Tajik opposition. In  effect, several enemy staging grounds are scattered around new  Outpost No. 12; despite constant skirmishes, efforts to dislodge  the fighters have been unsuccessful. In April the border troops  plan to finish mining the main trails leading from the Pyandzh  to the outpost. In the meantime, they are nearly surrounded. At  night, fighters approach to within range. And they fire on the  outpost and launch rockets at it. They can also do this in the  daytime. Last week two tank crewmen from the outpost who had  gone for water (the only source is a depression half a kilometer  below the outpost) encountered some fighters. Fortunately, they  were able to safely escape. With sentries posted about, the men  sit at their posts for three or four weeks at a time, becoming  filthy and half-wild. Then they get a brief R&amp;R, and it's  back  into the mountains.    Officers and soldiers are in chronic short supply. "Where  and  what is in supply in our country?" said Lieutenant Colonel  Masyuk, shrugging philosophically. Masyuk has seen everything  in his two years as commander of the Moscow Border Detachment.  (Incidentally, it's curious how a person undergoes a  metamorphosis on the Tajik-Afghan border. At our last meeting 18  months ago, Masyuk was a typical career border officer, albeit  one serving in a hotspot, it's true. Now he is more like a  combat officer fighting in a border zone than a border soldier.  Routine border service is now painfully distant from the Moscow  commander's responsibilities: Mining strategic areas, conducting  reconnaissance, setting up a zoned defense, drawing up  operational plans). As for his subordinates...    Yes, the undermanned force has clearly gotten a few  reinforcements. The border detachment's half-extinct compounds  have been invigorated somewhat. A few families sent to Russia  during at the height of the tension in Tajikistan have returned.  The Moscow Border Detachment has even opened a mini-school for  officers' young children. But the number of those who serve here  on a permanent basis is becoming fewer and fewer. The border  detachments are switching to a system of getting officers based  on a so-called "tour" method. They are sent here from other  Russian border districts for six to 18 months. "At least a  person knows for sure that this hell is going to end sometime,"  some of them told me. However, a temporary worker is temporary.  The detachments have given these officers an unflattering  (excuse me) nickname--"tampexes." I don't think one need explain  the meaning.    "The timing of the Main Military Council field meeting is no  accident," explained Lt-Gen Tymko. "The hardest time to guard  the state border--summer--is beginning, and the situation here  is especially unstable at that time. And judging from how much  combat equipment and manpower are concentrated on the opposite  bank of the Pyandzh, this spring can't help but give rise to  special apprehensions. Intelligence has reported unprecedented  preparations by the mujahedeen and opposition fighters to storm  the border. We have to be ready to not only guard it but also  defend it."    Incidentally, guarding and defending are fundamentally  different notions. The concept of border service has always  proceeded exclusively from the mission of guarding a border. A  border soldier with a dog on patrol, a neatly plowed observation  zone, an insidious intruder hobbling across the border on cow  hooves--all that is from the realm of guard duty. But the border  realities here constitute pure defense, for which the border  troops have never been trained, for which they were never  intended. The most the border guards are supposed to do is to  engage an enemy advancing from the adjacent side and hold him  until regular army units arrive. The "green caps" on the  Tajik-Afghan border began fighting such battles several years  ago. And they continue to hold their position, waiting for the  army to move up. But what army? From where?</p>

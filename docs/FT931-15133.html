			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: FNFC considers Pounds 47m rights issue THE board of the First National Finance Corporation is discussing with its advisers a possible rights issue of convertible preference shares to raise about Pounds 47m. The results for the year ended October 31, 1992 will be announced tomorrow. The board said that the loss before taxation will be in line with market expectations. Extraordinary items in the second half, which relate to a revaluation of the group's own premises, write-offs in the discontinued property division and a disposal were about half the level of the first six months. No ordinary dividend is being recommended for the year.</p>

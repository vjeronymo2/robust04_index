			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Spring Ram falls on profit warning SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms company which was once a stock market darling, lost half its market value yesterday as it warned that 1992 pre-tax profit would be a third less than expected. The company said the pre-tax figure would be not less than Pounds 26m, down from a restated Pounds 36.2m in 1991. Analysts had predicted Pounds 37m-Pounds 40m. The share price fell from 129p pre-Wednesday's suspension to 63 1/2 p yesterday, valuing the company at Pounds 232m compared with its May 1992 peak of Pounds 651m. Spring Ram's announcement followed haggling with its auditors over the implementation of more conservative accounting principles. Questions about the company's financial controls and accounting methods have undermined its credibility before, most spectacularly last November when false accounting was revealed at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary. Yesterday's announcement listed Pounds 12.9m of deductions to the pre-tax profit figure that the group would have announced under its old methods. The biggest item was Pounds 5.6m of profits that the group had planned to take in 1992 but which had to be pushed back. Analysts expressed unease about this and were confused by the explanation that it was due to a draft accounting standard. Some shareholders suggested that Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, should resign. Calls for the group to appoint non-executive directors were reiterated. Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said yesterday the group planned to appoint two. The profit shortfall was due to new accounting standards. The group was surprised that so many companies had reported under FRS 3 before the deadline and had only recently decided to follow. Pre-tax profit grew from Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 37.6m, before restatement, in 1991, on turnover of Pounds 194.2m. The results are to be announced on Monday. Details, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein and 'Amira Hess] </F>   [Excerpt] Yesterday, Fatah announced the establishment of a  branch of Force-17 in the territories. The declaration was made  in a leaflet disseminated in Hebron to mark the 29th anniversary  of the establishment of Fatah -- 1 January.    The establishment of "the militia of Force-17 at this time  is  part of a well-defined work plan," the leaflet notes, "and is  not an attempt to jump the leading wagon or ask for power or  leadership positions -- as some believe. We chose this date to  make the declaration in order to express our adherence to and  confidence in all branches of the Palestinian leadership. We  will use our full force to serve the leadership and provide our  people with stability and security. We renew our pledge of  allegiance to the Palestinian revolution."    The authors of the leaflet further explain that Force-17 in  the territories will be a pillar of support for "the best men of  our nation." In the past, the force served as Yasir 'Arafat's  personal guard, but later on 'Arafat distanced himself from the  members of the force. The leaflet promises that "today, we  begin our journey for the construction of security for our  Palestinian nation."    Palestinian sources have estimated that behind the leaflet  are hawkish Fatah elements which are not pleased with the  decision to end terror attacks against Israeli targets,  especially after the settlers' riots and the freeze in the  negotiations.    According to the sources, another possibility is that the  Fatah central leadership wishes to demonstrate determined  presence in view of the eroding support for Fatah among the  residents of the territories. Fatah also wishes to prove to  Israel that, should the negotiations with Israel fail, its  leadership has other options. About a month ago, Fatah Hawks  squads were set up in Hebron. Unlike the original squads in  Gaza, the Fatah Hawks in Hebron are not made of armed fugitives,  but of activists of the al-Shabiba youth movement. The fact  that Fatah Hawks squads, and now Force-17, were established in  this region indicates a radicalization of Fatah in the Hebron  region, mainly in view of exacerbating confrontations with the  city's settlers.    Another leaflet Fatah disseminated yesterday to mark the  anniversary of its establishment says that the struggle must  continue in all forms -- on the battlefield and at the  negotiating table.

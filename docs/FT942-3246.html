			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin America's vegetable export drive runs into trouble - Excessive use of pesticides is generating new problems and threatening markets When a shipload of vegetables from the Dominican Republic was turned away by US port officials last October, shock waves were felt throughout Latin America. The vegetables - including tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, onions, celery and peas - were considered to have too high a level of pesticide residues. The last ten years have shown a huge growth in the export of vegetables from Latin America to the US. With pressing debt problems, Latin American countries have looked to their fields as a source of foreign earnings that could get them off the debt hook. Encouraged to grow vegetables and fruit for export, farmers regarded pesticides as the way to guarantee that their produce arrived in top-notch condition. But agriculturists in Latin America are now warning that the concentration on export crops has led to the neglect of basic foods, such as beans, for local people and that heavy pesticide applications are leading to the appearance of new pests and viruses, causing serious damage to crops. Chile was the first Latin American country to embrace export crops. In 1980 it exported about the same amount of beans as it grew for local consumption. By the early 1990s the production of beans for export, such as black, white and pinto varieties, was running at 55,000 tonnes a year, compared with 20,000 tonnes grown for local consumption. The country's expansion of fruit and other export crops brought about an increase in pests that acted as carriers of viruses, says Mr Francisco Morales, head of the virology unit at the Colombia-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. 'As a result, bean production in Chile is increasingly affected by epidemics of new viruses or strains of viruses, such as bean yellow mosaic virus, and alfalfa mosaic virus.' In 1970 Brazil grew soyabeans on 1.4m hectares of land; by 1988 the crop covered 10.5m ha. 'The boom in soyabean cultivation coincided with one of the worst virus epidemics that Latin American agriculture has ever suffered  -golden mosaic disease, caused by a virus transmitted by the whitefly,' says Mr Morales. The big increase in the whitefly pest 'is directly related to the abundance of soyabean', he points out. The pest has seriously affected traditional bean-growing areas. Consumption of beans by Brazilians is today little more than half its 1981 average of 28kg per person. Mexico and other Central American countries have sharply increased their exports of vegetables, especially tomatoes. 'The expansion of vegetable crops in these countries has resulted in the appearance of new virus problems,' says Mr Morales. In some tomato-growing areas, pests have increased beyond control, causing major epidemics. 'The farmers grow export crops but are often not sure how to do it,' he points out. 'When the market price is high for the export crops some are earning more money than from beans alone. But the international market demands fruit and vegetables with no blemishes and farmers use incredible amounts of pesticide, which eats into their profits.' Most of these pesticides are not approved for use on the crops the farmers are growing, Mr Morales alleges, and they often do not have the knowledge to apply them correctly. They apply them at the wrong times, including right up to the harvest and frequently over-use them. 'Dependence on chemical pesticides has become almost total,' he points out. Some ten years ago, about 90 per cent of the money that Latin American countries spent on agriculture research went on food crops, especially beans, which contribute about 30 per cent of the protein consumed by the continent's 200m low income families. There has now been a total change: only about 20 per cent is devoted to food crops while goes on export crops. In some countries, research into food crops has been completely abandoned. 'Governments are more interested in how they use land for export crops, and scientists are being switched to work on these crops,' says Pastor Corrales, a plant pathologist. Beans are the chief victim of this trend. Land that once grew beans now grows vegetables for export. As a result, farmers are often growing just enough beans for themselves, but none for the market. In towns and cities beans are often scarce. Every Latin American country apart from Argentina, Chile and Ecuador has become a net importer of beans, with some countries importing them from China. With the US likely to tighten still further its regulations on pesticide residues in food crops, Latin American farmers will either have to apply less pesticide to their export crops or return to growing food crops. And while US port officials can block the produce, they cannot stop the winds. Mr Morales points out that tomato viruses, which have recently emerged in the Caribbean, are now being seen in Florida - 'probably blown there by the winds'.</p>

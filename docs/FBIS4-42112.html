			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that Cyprus is  not seeking free entrance into the European Union [EU], but  wants to fulfill the expectations of its role and its  contribution to the world order being created.    Addressing a high-level conference on EU law which began  this  morning in Nicosia, the president said Cyprus is fully committed  to its European orientation because it believes in the role, the  mission, and the need for the EU. He added that Cyprus asks for  nothing more than to be a republic that applies to the whole of  Cyprus' territory, something that cannot happen now because of  the de facto division imposed and maintained by the presence of  Turkish troops and settlers.    European personalities, distinguished judges of the EU  court,  senior officials, and academicians from EU member states are  participating in the two-day conference.</p>

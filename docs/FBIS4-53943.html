			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter Chang Yun-yong: </F> "Outstanding Individually, Weak Organizationally"]    [Excerpts] The place: the export promotion section of the  Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy  [MOTIE]. In the recent government reorganization, the name of  the Trade Bureau changed from Commercial Trade Bureau and, with  this change, the bureau has yielded its leading position among  all the bureaus of the ministry to the International Trade  Policy Bureau. Nevertheless, the Trade Bureau, and its export  promotion section in particular, is still regarded as the cream  of MOTIE.    In the days when "building an export-oriented state" was a  catchphrase, the Trade Bureau racked its brains to map out  export strategies. For anyone seeking to make his way as a  trade and industry bureaucrat, this bureau was the gateway he  had to go through to get on the "elite track." The elite  bureaucrats in MOTIE who have passed through this gate during  the past several decades proudly recall the hard times they went  through and the exploits they performed during their service  with the Trade Bureau as the most glorious part of their  "career."    Even now the finest talent in this ministry are drawn into  the export promotion section. But this section, the veritable  command post for the nation's export and import business, does  not have on hand much statistical data that are essential to  keep abreast of the trends of world trade. [passage omitted]    Employees of MOTIE's export promotion section get such data  from the Korean Traders Association or the Korean Trade  Promotion Corporation. They need the help of the Bank of Korea,  the Korea Development Institute, the Korea Institute for  Industrial Economics and Trade, and other semi-government  research institutes for information on the domestic and  international economic trends they need in working out export  measures. In a word, they are fighting in the battlefield of  world trade without even a single military map. [passage  omitted]    When it comes to various research materials on exports and  imports published by world organizations or academic  institutions, the situation is all the more deplorable. These  materials are almost beyond MOTIE's reach in most cases.    Says a young grade 5 official: "When we request a budget  allocation to get those materials stressing that we cannot do  without them, we are turned down in most cases. The reason  given is that there are not enough budgetary resources. The  section which is supposed to have overall charge of imports and  exports does not have the latest research materials, and even  the most basic statistical materials for that matter, to consult  when it wants to check on the current and future trends in  trade. It has to beg other organizations for them. Naturally,  the section's analytic ability is weak. Under these  circumstances, how do you expect to create conditions conducive  to widening our horizon?"    The young official laments that his organization is apt to  be  "information-blind" when it has little opportunity to keep  abreast of (or get materials on) the cultures of advanced  countries.    The slogan "internationalization" has become a buzzword of  our time uttered even by children. This slogan began to spread  late last year at the initiative of senior officials and the  press. President Kim Yong-sam set forth internationalization as  a major goal of our government for this year. The  Administration is in step with this policy. A government-wide  campaign to remodel the mindset toward the economy is under way  in gear with the campaign for internationalization. Ministries  are vying with each other to have their employees revamp their  way of thinking through retraining courses offered on a  commission basis by private corporations reputed to be leaders  in internationalization.    Reflecting the definition that internationalization in its  narrower sense means "economic internationalization," economic  ministries are more active in their efforts for  internationalization than others. Under the policy of  modernizing economic structures, deregulation is under way in  all areas as if it were the "order of the day," with each  ministry mapping out diversified strategies for  internationalization.    However, many critics are skeptical about the role and  function of the government in leading the internationalization  drive. To begin with, there is controversy over the concept.  But internationalization is of great significance as a  strategic means for national survival in the age of a borderless  economic war. To survive in the age of a global village, we  should exert an effort to adapt our way of thinking and systems  to international changes and elevate them to advanced  international standards from a national strategic point of view.  To adapt ourselves to the changing international situation and  to survive in it, it is imperative to do away with  ultranationalism and isolationist practices and search for the  loftier common good of the world and accept it on our own. This  idea holds good as the concept of internationalization.    From this point of view, the role of the government as the  steward of the national economy should be highlighted. The  private sector is the runner, but it is the duty of the  government to make it run well. Under an incompetent and  uninformed government, the private sector--the command post of  the borderless war--would sink in the high tide of opening up to  the outside world, directly endangering the very survival and  prosperity of the country. If any regulation is binding the  hands and feet of private enterprises and making them powerless  in the borderless economic war, the government should lose no  time in easing such regulation; and when obstacles stand in the  way of our enterprises in their efforts for  internationalization, it should actively remove them. [passage  omitted]    In fact, economic laws and systems have been established and  have operated as if their purpose were to block rather than  stimulate free business activity. In the name of protecting our  industry, the government imposed so many cumbersome conditions  on foreign firms trying to enter our market that foreigners  brand Korea as "a country with the worst investment conditions."  [passage omitted]    Some critics go so far as to brand our government a "force  resisting internationalization." This criticism is directed at  the state of affairs in which the government, instead of leading  the effort to revamp outmoded systems and ease various  regulatory controls, is playing only a passive role, unable to  free itself from isolationist thinking.    In some quarters there is a manifestation of the extreme  distrust that officials are fettered so much by departmental  egoism that they are reluctant to deregulate, or they are  concerned so much about their job security that they are  absorbed in devising still more controls. Of all government  organizations, the economic ministries, such as the Economic  Planning Board (regarded as the originator for all economic  policies), the Ministry of Finance [MOF], and MOTIE become the  main target of criticism whenever internationalization becomes  an issue. This is because when we hold "economic  internationalization" or "the internationalization of policy" as  the cardinal point, these ministries are the principal agents in  implementing internationalization policy.    Objectively, it is valid to say that the economic ministries  have a better sense of internationalization than others. For  one thing, these ministries are crowded with the elites who  passed the difficult higher civil service examination, and by  the nature of their business they have had ample opportunity to  come into contact with developments abroad in the age of the  global economy. Yet they remain the target of criticism because  they are not playing a positive role in the vanguard of the  drive for "economic internationalization."    True, underlying this criticism is the view--and the eager  expectation based on it--that the success of  internationalization depends on the efforts of the economic  ministries to remake themselves.    Before determining why they are being criticized as "a  backward group in the internationalization drive," we should  first examine their objective conditions. We cannot  categorically condemn economic bureaucrats, for quite a lot of  them are working hard in their own way with a sense of duty to  the state. [passage omitted]    The stark realities of absurdly low government salaries  compared with those in private firms, and the ever- increasing  jam in personnel appointments are far more serious than the  general public thinks.    The economic administrative bureaucracy is regarded as an  elite group among all classes of our society. These outstanding  people huddle together all night mapping out national policies.  But one wonders why these ministries are regarded as backward  when it comes to internationalization.    Each official is outstanding individually, but as a group  the  ministries are not. This proves that their organization has  internal structural flaws. It is no exaggeration to say that  the nature of the bureaucracy and its inefficiency are principal  factors impeding the internationalization of the government  organization and its devoted personnel.    The climate that causes "information blindness," and the  kind  of customary practices in MOTIE's export promotion section cited  above are points worthy of note. [passage omitted]    Private enterprises are constantly making efforts to adapt  to  changes by giving full play to their creativeness. But the  bureaucracy still hangs on to old ways when the country was in  the initial stage of a development-oriented economy. In this  age of radical change, the gap between "running enterprises" and  the "crawling bureaucracy" is bound to widen. Economic  bureaucrats argue that their ministries were ahead of private  business in internationalization until the mid- 1980's.    "In the early 1980's it was easier for the economic  ministries than for other ministries to obtain foreign data and  meet with foreign businessmen and collect information from them.  But with the arrival of the period of surplus balance of  payments in the mid-1980's, private enterprises began to turn  their eyes overseas relying on the know-how and resources they  had accumulated."    Says a section chief in the Economic Planning Board: "Those  enterprises which previously depended chiefly on government  assistance in export-import activities now began to speed up the  pace in setting up overseas branches and to dispatch their  employees for on-the-spot training overseas, thereby making  themselves internationalization-minded."    While doing business overseas, they gained access to  information and were able to turn out a large number of  personnel versed in the languages of their host countries. As a  consequence they naturally had ample opportunity to get  accustomed to the way of thinking and behavior of foreigners and  the cultures of advanced countries. On the contrary,  bureaucrats complain that they could find relatively little  opportunity to get in touch with the advanced cultures partly  because of budgetary constraints and partly because of the  public sentiment that "looks askance at government employees  traveling abroad."    Argues a grade 5 MOF official: "Government employees often  talk about internationalization. But what other sources of  knowledge on internationalization do you think they have except  papers written by domestic scholars and newspaper articles? They  have little opportunity to travel abroad, much less to train  overseas and get accustomed to foreign lands and people. Under  these circumstances, it seems too much to demand that they get  rid of their narrow outlook."    The above explanation of why the bureaucrat lags behind big  private corporations in awareness of internationalization is  valid to some extent. Samsung, which ranks at the top among our  big business groups, has sent hundreds of its employees abroad  at its expense each year for the past several years. Needless  to say, this is patterned after the management style of advanced  Japanese enterprises. But certainly, it is a radical idea. Now  many other firms are following suit?    When these corporations send employees abroad, they  encourage  them to get acquainted with as many people in their host  countries as possible and learn their customs, without worrying  about the company business. Our firms have come up with the  idea that going abroad and adapting oneself to the culture of  the host country will in itself provide an opportunity to  cultivate an international sense. This is proof that our  corporations are adroitly taking measures to promote "the  internationalization of human resources," and through it "the  internationalization of ability."    What about the bureaucracy? In a word the climate of our  officialdom is keeping its members ignorant of what is going on  in the outside world. While private firms are actively sending  employees abroad for work or study at company expense, the  government--because of all kinds of restrictions--fails to  provide an adequate opportunity for its employees to go abroad.  Private citizens have been free to travel abroad since the  mid-1980's when the government liberalized foreign travel  restrictions. But for government employees, foreign travel is  still beyond their reach in most cases.    In this connection, one must mention problems relating to  the  screening of applications for official travel abroad and  government employees' overseas training. In fact, civil  servants' foreign trips are currently restricted by the  screening system. All overseas trips for official business  require advance approval. Even when a government employee wants  to take a vacation abroad with his family, he has to get the  approval of the head of his organization. [passage omitted]    Government employees study abroad under various  arrangements:  the government-wide program under which personnel are selected  by the Ministry of Government Administration for study abroad at  state expense; the program of each ministry under which it sends  its selected employees at its own budgetary expense; the use of  an IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]  credit (under the jurisdiction of the MOF); the use of  cooperation funds of foreign countries; the use of special funds  including those tied to special trade contracts; the use of the  Humphrey and Fulbright Funds and various university scholarships.    The number of government employees sent abroad under the  Ministry of Government Administration's program of study abroad  at state expense is very limited, with only about two for each  ministry on average. That is why the competition is so keen  that in major ministries where many employees have passed the  higher civil service examination--such as the Economic Planning  Board, the MOF, and MOTIE--officials have to prepare for several  years to get selected for study abroad. [passage omitted]    Another major problem is the failure to assign those  employees who returned after studying abroad to the right jobs  and make the best use of them. There are quite a few employees  in MOTIE who have returned home after studying law overseas.  They studied law abroad to make the best use of their expert  knowledge in the area of trade and commerce. But for  administrative reasons of personnel management, these employees  upon their return from abroad are often assigned to positions in  industrial fields rather than in the field of trade and  commerce. In this way they are deprived of the best opportunity  to make the best use of the expertise which they studied so hard  to acquire.    The sector of MOTIE that deals with trade matters may be  said  to be "the vanguard of internationalization." The ability to  speak English is an essential requirement, but the time is gone  when a man with only a good knowledge of the English knowledge  could pass as a trade expert. To be able to resolve complex  trade issues and promote national interests through sticky  negotiations, one needs to have expert knowledge on the matters  on hand. It is not an easy thing to find people with an expert  judicial knowledge in our government sector which deals with  trade. When a legal problem crops up, the government could use  international lawyers in our country, but these lawyers cannot  participate in the policy-making process. [passage omitted]    A grade-v official made this comment: "As a matter of fact,  there is little chance of training trade experts among  government employees under the current personnel policy and  method of organizational management. When a trade expert is  transferred to an industrial department, his transfer should be  temporary for the purpose of gaining experience there to deepen  his expertise on trade. But in our country, that is not the  case. Our government pursues a personnel policy of  mass-producing generalists. [passage omitted] What is more  deplorable is that those who returned home from abroad after  studying law are assigned to jobs which have nothing to with  their specialities in law."    In MOTIE, there is a trade expert who has a license to  practice international law. But he is working in the industrial  sector (electronics) of the ministry.    Young grade-v officials who have gained a vision for  internationalization while handling trade matters argue that the  current overseas training programs should be shortened from the  current one- to two-year period to three to six months. The  reason is that what is needed is not lectures on theory but a  practical course that will give trainees an ability to resolve  pesky trade disputes through negotiations. [passage omitted]    The following are the words of a certain bureau chief who  once served as a international cooperation officer at MOTIE:    "An international cooperation officer must handle all kinds  of negotiations: UR, OECD ship-building, and multilateral steel.  He must go to Geneva or Brussels each time there is a  conference. When I was on an official trip, a Japanese official  gave a dubious look when he saw me. He said to me, "You must be  very powerful." I just laughed it off. But I felt ashamed  inside. In Japan's case, the officials attending specific  negotiations are seasoned veterans with years of experience in  their specialty. In our country, when an official takes charge  of negotiations after drifting from place to place under the  government's personnel management practice, he attends  negotiations in every field. This can be found only in the  bureaucracies of developing countries."    The organizational structure of our government and the  inefficient way of performing official business are other major  factors that make government employees blind to the needs for  internationalization. Our government still maintains the same  organizational structure established in the 1960's when the  country was absorbed in economic development. Government  functions are not rationally distributed among ministries, and  this often generates interagency squabbles going beyond the  level of controversy, impeding efficiency.    In competing with foreign countries, information on them is  essential. But the total number of government employees  stationed abroad is slightly over 200 from 21 ministries and  agencies. These officers use their positions as stepping-stones  for promotion and are more interested in accommodating  high-ranking officials on overseas trips than in prompt  reporting of accurate information on their host countries.    Working conditions of government employees is poor compared  with that of private firms. Private firms have introduced  various office automation systems, But the computer terminals in  ministries and agencies are primitive. [passage omitted]    Private firms already have high-tech systems and are  generating paperless reports and holding conversations and  making decisions via computer. On the contrary, government  employees prepare each report on dozens of sheets of paper and  submit it to higher authorities. [passage omitted]    It is unreasonable to force only the economic ministries to  remold their thinking when the public's thinking is not remolded  to an advanced level. [passage omitted]    Our people are not happy about foreign firms remitting their  profits to their home countries. When our firms want to invest  overseas, the public feels that a large amount of foreign  currency is going to flow out of our country. Economic  bureaucrats maintain that unless the exclusionist sentiment  against foreign countries, the vague subconscious delusion of  persecution against internationalization, and blind patriotism  are corrected, legal and institutional improvements cannot be  carried forward effectively. [passage omitted]    An Economic Planning Board official made this point: "Before  stressing the need for pushing the internationalization of the  bureaucracy, there must be a clearly defined concept of  internationalization in the Administration." According to him,  internationalization is constantly being discussed in the  bureaucracy, but there is no clear guideline on how to carry it  forward.    According to the same official, the internationalization of  ministries should be pushed forward by fully reflecting public  opinion and only after going through interagency consultations,  but currently, the atmosphere is swayed by one word from the  president. Faced with an internationalization motto  unilaterally decided at the top and conveyed to the bottom, each  ministry unfolds its own strategy without consultation with  others. Many economic bureaucrats argue that this leads to  confusion of policies and discord among ministries. [passage  omitted]</p>

A. No. HAR&hyph;89&hyph;2869, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint filed by the United States in October 1989 seeks to recover past, unreimbursed costs under Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9607, incurred by the United States in connection with response actions taken at the Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Superfund Site (``Site'') located in Elkton, Maryland. Maryland Sand, Gravel and Stone Company, (``Maryland Sand Company'') the owner and operator of the Site, was sued along with four other defendants. The proposed decree represents a partial settlement of this case, resolving only the United States' claims for past response costs against the Maryland Sand Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this consent decree, the Maryland Sand Company will pay the United States $25,000 in partial reimbursement of the United States' unrecovered past response costs. The settlement is based on a demonstration by Maryland Sand Company of its inability to reimburse the United States for any additional response costs. Under the terms of the decree, Maryland Sand Company will also provide the United States and its representatives, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, access to the Site for purposes of conducting and overseeing CERCLA response activities. The United States has specifically reserved its right to seek further relief from Maryland Sand Company on claims for future response costs, and for claims for natural resource damages, criminal liability and other claims that are outside of the scope of the complaint filed in this case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of thirty days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O.

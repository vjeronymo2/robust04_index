			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 LATIN NATIONS CONDEMN VOIDING OF VOTE  </P> <P> Latin America's major democracies Thursday condemned the Panamanian  government's nullification of its election as a step that moves Panama "even  further from the democratic community of Latin America."  </P> <P> The seven countries reiterated, however, their commitment to "nonintervention  and self-determination" in Panama, an apparent reference to intense U.S.  efforts to drive Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, from power.  </P> <P> The members of the Group of Eight, now composed of just seven countries since  Panama's suspension in February, 1988, issued a joint communique that said, in  part:  </P> <P> "We declare our profound consternation at a situation that can distance the  government of Panama even further from the democratic community of Latin  America at a historic moment when free, popular expression advances in an  unprecedented manner in our region."  </P> <P> Although the seven nations remain sensitive to U.S. intervention in domestic  political issues, they also are wary, based on long experience, of attempts by  the region's armed forces to interfere in politics. Argentina, which has  presidential elections Sunday, has weathered three military uprisings in two  years.  </P> <P> Noriega, who heads the Panama Defense Forces, is the de facto ruler of Panama.  His regime nullified Sunday's election after international observers accused it  of widespread voting fraud on behalf of Noriega's favored presidential  candidate.  </P> <P> The group of Latin American nations, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,  Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, has emerged as a significant regional  voice. Four of the seven -- Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay -- returned to  democratic rule in the 1980s after military dictatorships.  </P> <P> Some Latin American officials had criticized the United States for failing to  consult and seek joint action last year after Noriega, in effect, deposed  then-President Eric A. Delvalle. President Bush phoned several Latin American  leaders Wednesday to consult with them on the current situation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Disastrous and a Disgrace'  </P> <P> In Buenos Aires, Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, the current president  of the U.N. General Assembly, declared bluntly to reporters that the Panamanian  election was "disastrous and a disgrace. I hope the new (electoral) process,  which should be initiated as soon as possible, will have the necessary  guarantees to allow (democracy) to be consolidated.  </P> <P> "What has occurred in Panama seems impossible and unacceptable, to the point  where the Panamanian authorities have seen themselves obligated to annul these  elections,".  </P> <P> The Argentine election will bring the nation's first transition from one  elected leader to another in 61 years. With civil liberties entrenched since  the restoration of democracy in 1983, there are no concerns about fraud.  </P> <P> Carlos Andres Perez, the recently elected Venezuelan president, said he feels  profound concern over developments in Panama, and he expressed Venezuela's  "solidarity with the legitimate election results, which represent the majority  will of the Panamanian people."  </P> <P> Perez criticized the interference of the Panamanian armed forces in the vote  count and "altering" of the results. He said Latin American countries are  consulting on possible options, and he called for an emergency meeting of the  Organization of American States to consider possible action. An OAS statement  in Washington said the meeting will be held today.  </P> <P> In Havana, the Cuban Foreign Ministry denounced any possible U.S. military  intervention in Panama, saying such an action would create "an inevitable and  explosive reaction among the people of our (Latin) America."  </P> <P> Also on Thursday, the European Community condemned the annulment of the  election, saying the move implied "the non-acceptance of the sovereign will of  the Panamanian people," Reuters news agency reported from Brussels.  </P></p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (1): Funds pour into new growth regions - While economic progress in the developed countries has slowed seriously, expansion in the rest of the world has generally been rapid, and often accelerating A potentially dramatic new phase in the development of the global economy, in which growth is shifting towards poorer countries, is becoming ever more clearly detectable. It is being matched and stimulated by a massive strategic move by international investors into the so-called emerging markets. It is estimated that last year close to Dollars 40bn was invested in emerging market equities by international investors, especially Americans; meanwhile, eurobond issuance by emerging markets borrowers approached Dollars 30bn. Although many of the emerging equity markets are still very small, taken together they now have a capitalisation of some Dollars 1,300bn. For some asset allocation purposes they can be regarded as constituting the third largest market in the world, after the US and Japan. Following the big share price advances typical of 1993, when the average emerging market equity return was nearly 70 per cent, holdings of emerging market stocks by foreigners may now be worth Dollars 160bn, according to Baring Securities. As for debt instruments, Chase Manhattan estimates that the value of tradeable emerging market debt is almost Dollars 250bn. Of this a little over half consists of Brady bonds, the form into which many billions of dollars in bank loans have been restructured in a securitisation process - notably in the cases of Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela. These large and active capital markets have developed in the space of only a few years. Until the late 1980s many of the Latin American countries were still insolvent and cut off from the bond market, while international equity interest in emerging markets was limited to a few specialist investors and pioneers. Now even the staidest institutional investors are making significant allocations to what used to be regarded as fringe markets. The rewards for investors who were quick to spot the potential of emerging markets have been substantial. The average increase in share prices in dollar terms since 1990 has been 120 per cent, and secondary market prices for external debt have doubled over the same period. Buoyancy in the emerging markets contrasts with the fact that economic growth in the developed world has slumped seriously as the recession which first damaged the US transferred to Japan and continental Europe. According to the OECD, the aggregate growth achieved by its members last year was about 1 per cent (and zero excluding the US), the worst outturn for the developed world since the second world war. Growth will only pick up to around 2 per cent in 1994, says the OECD. Yet expansion in the rest of the world has generally been rapid, and often accelerating. China has been generating growth in GNP of 13 per cent, and although this is surely unsustainable, and according to some is statistically exaggerated, many south-east Asian nations have maintained growth in the 6 to 8 per cent range for extended periods. The output gap between rich and poor countries remains immense - but perhaps that is also a measure of the growth potential of the developing nations. China and India today have about a half of the world's population but less than 10 per cent of output, on conventional measures. Mr Arnab Banerji, chief investment officer of Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets, enthuses about the potential for the developing countries. 'Three billion people will have a growth rate of 6 1/2 per cent for the foreseeable future,' he says. 'It's the biggest investment theme of our time.' The emerging markets boom can be seen as an inverse consequence of the slowdown in the developed world. As first the US and then Japan and Europe have decelerated, surplus savings have been generated. Now the capital is pouring into the emerging markets. They have always had a surplus of cheap labour but now they have available imported capital and transferred technology, too. This potent mixture is producing a surge of economic growth. But this is only happening because of the collapse of the barriers which formerly cut off the developing world. Arguably the global economy is returning to normal after many years of division and distortion. Suddenly the late 20th century economy is beginning to look more like that of the late 19th century. 'These are not so much emerging markets as re-emerging markets,' says Mr Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities. There are clear parallels with the late 19th century when Britain, as the leading industrial nation of the day, began - along with other European nations - to pump large sums into (especially) North and South America. By 1914, British investors owned 27 per cent of the equity market in the US, the leading emerging market of the day. Britain's share of global industrial production tumbled from about a third in 1870 to only 13 per cent in 1913, while the US expanded its share from 23 to 36 per cent over the same period. A similar transfer of output and capital now appears to be taking place, although these days the US is on the other side of the fence. 'Developing country growth rates are set to rise further,' says Mr Sushil Wadhwahi, international equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. 'It is not unreasonable to expect the total output in developing countries to exceed OECD output in the next 10 to 20 years.' Many of the emerging markets remain the same as a century ago. Mr Howell points out that the international stocks listed in the first Financial Times in 1888 included Western &amp; Brazilian Telegraph, Central Uruguay Railway and Imperial Ottoman Bank. So why is this shift taking place now? It seems that the political environment has changed fundamentally. The event that more than any other symbolised the change was the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soviet communism collapsed, and with it the model of centralised state economic planning that had held so many poor country governments in thrall - if only for the opportunities such an approach provided for the exercise of political power and the practice of corruption. Most third world nations are now turning to market-based economic policies, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but with little practical choice. There is some irony in that Latin American countries regarded the tearing down of the Berlin Wall four years ago with dismay. Capital would flood from western Europe and the US into eastern Europe, they reasoned, and would be diverted from Latin America because of its financially chequered history. It has not worked out at all like that. Political clouds still loom over eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, while in the third quarter of 1993 alone US investors poured some Dollars 3.8bn net into Latin American equities. Other factors have played an important part. The ending of UK controls on overseas investment in 1979, for instance, stimulated cross-border flows to an important degree. In contrast, most Continental European investment institutions remain shackled by controls. Now American and, to some degree, Japanese investors are becoming active buyers of emerging equity markets, seeking better growth prospects than are available in their sluggish domestic economies. They are also seeking higher returns in emerging bond markets, as an alternative to the very low interest rates in their domestic bond markets. It is all very reminiscent of the approach of the managers of Foreign &amp; Colonial, Britain's first closed-end investment trust (and after 125 years now its biggest) when it was floated in 1868. Its Pounds 1m portfolio of emerging market government bonds yielded 8 per cent, compared with only about 3 per cent on UK Consols at the time. Now, late 20th century American pension funds are chasing high returns in much the same way and in much the same countries. F &amp; C today has its own specialised emerging markets offshoot, managing assets of Dollars 1.3bn One other essential condition for the triggering of the newemerging markets boom was that the Latin American debt crisis should be resolved. The tangle arising from the misguided bank lending of the 1970s was finally unravelled in most cases by 1990. According to the Institute of International Finance in Washington, commercial banks now hold no more than 40 per cent of emerging markets debt, down from 55 per cent in the early 1980s. The dangerous concentration of risks within the banking system has been largely dispersed. However, six significant debtor states with total commercial bank liabilities of Dollars 135bn, including Brazil, Peru and Russia, have still to agree restructuring deals. If and when they do, the scope for activity through the international capital markets will be still further enhanced. It is now back to basics in the finance of emerging markets. The theory is that it is much sounder for the securities markets to finance private sector organisations than for banks to lend to governments. All the better if foreign investors can ride alongside domestic investors and thereby gain political security. This can be achieved through voucher-based privatisation schemes, as in eastern Europe, mutual fund promotions, as in India, and the growth of domestic pension schemes, as in Chile. The US and Japan have matured from emerging to developed status during the 20th century. The emerging markets boom reflects the increasingly confident view of global investors that many more poor countries will follow the same path to prosperity during the next few decades.</p>

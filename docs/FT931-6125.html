			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / PM hints at small-business aid MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday offered a broad hint that small businesses will be among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions in the March 16 Budget. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister agreed to pass on to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, a call from a backbench Tory MP for the Treasury to recognise that small businesses offered the best hope of renewed job creation. His response was technically noncommittal, but Mr Major's supportive tone reinforced expectations among the government's supporters that a promised 'Budget for jobs' will concentrate on measures to encourage the creation and expansion of small companies. Tory MPs believe Mr Lamont will increase personal taxes through an extension of the value added tax net. But they think that he will then use some of the additional revenue to promote investment, exports and employment. Last month the Confederation of British Industry tabled a 10-point plan for small business which it said could be implemented within the tight constraints imposed by a soaring public sector borrowing requirement. It is understood that the CBI was encouraged to make its submission during earlier informal contacts with Whitehall. Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the employers' organisation, is a frequent visitor to 10 Downing Street. Among the CBI recommendations were larger capital allowances, higher corporation tax thresholds, new exemptions from capital gains tax and measures to improve the availability of equity finance for small businesses. The package would cost about Pounds 500m in the first year, although that would rise to closer to Pounds 1bn in later years. Mr Lamont is also under pressure from the Conservative back benches to relax further the rules on inheritance tax and raise significantly the VAT threshold. In parallel Tory MPs have been lobbying for a reduction in the uniform business rate as the most effective way to ease the financial pressures on small businesses in the south and south-east.</p>

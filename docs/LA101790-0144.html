			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY RACES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES DOMINATE CAMPAIGNS IN OLD OIL BOOM TOWN  </P> <P> Environmental concern -- never before a big political item in this one-time oil  boom town -- is the overriding issue in this year's city election.  </P> <P> Ten candidates are competing for four City Council seats in the Nov. 6  election, which also features two city ballot measures and a race for the  elected position of city attorney.  </P> <P> Pro-growth vs. slow-growth and protection of parks and beaches are among the  environmental issues being debated by the City Council candidates.  </P> <P> Political observers say several factors led to this election being a focal  point for environmental protectionists in Huntington Beach. The most notable  was the Feb. 6 oil spill from the tanker American Trader, during which nearly  400,000 gallons of Alaskan crude soiled the beaches.  </P> <P> Another factor was the cliffhanger success of a new citizens' group in getting  a parks-protection initiative qualified for the city's ballot.  </P> <P> The oil spill catapulted then-little-known Mayor Thomas J. Mays into the  political limelight, ultimately leading to his successful bid in the June  primary for the Republican nomination for the 58th Assembly District seat. The  oil spill also brought the city national attention and focused attention on  citizen-group efforts to save the city's wetlands.  </P> <P> The parks initiative, nurtured by the new group Save Our Parks, took months of  grass-roots work. Measure C qualified for the ballot in a squeaker, after  initially being declared short of enough petition signatures. The measure would  forbid sale or lease of any parks or beaches without a citywide vote.  </P> <P> The City Council majority, by a 4-2 vote, put a rival item on the ballot:  Measure D, which would forbid sale of park and beach land without a citywide  vote but would allow lease of those lands by a majority vote of the council.  </P> <P> In the council race, Councilwoman Grace Winchell, first elected four years ago,  is the only incumbent seeking reelection. Mays and councilmen Wes Bannister,  the Republican nominee for state insurance commissioner, and John Erskine are  not seeking reelection.  </P> <P> Winchell is a strong supporter of Measure C; she and Councilman Peter M. Green  voted against putting rival Measure D on the ballot.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and slow-growth advocates say they hope to reelect Winchell  and at least two new council members.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Amigos de Bolsa Chica, two major environmental  groups, have endorsed three candidates: Winchell, former Planning Commissioner  Mark Porter and Huntington Beach Union High School District President Linda  Moulton Patterson.  </P> <P> Winchell, Porter and Patterson oppose the proposed Pierside Village project and  any other new commercial development on the city's beaches. They also oppose  Measure D, which -- by allowing leasing with just a City Council vote -- could  bring misuse of city beach land, they say.  </P> <P> The other City Council candidates are former Mayor and Councilman Jack Kelly;  former Police Chief Earle W. Robitaille; incumbent Planning Commissioner Edward  G. Mountford; a Long Beach marine safety officer, Dirk Voss; George Arnold, a  self-employed entrepreneur; Tony Passannante, a pharmacist and business owner,  and Steven J. Roy, a carpenter.  </P> <P> Former City Administrator Paul Cook's name will appear on the ballot, but he  has withdrawn as a candidate.  </P> <P> Kelly, Robitaille and Mountford all emphasize support for continued downtown  redevelopment.  </P> <P> Kelly said he is worried about the "emergence of no-growth factions, which  could retard public-safety levels and undermine (city) revenue flow."  </P> <P> Mountford said he will seek a way to terminate the lease that allows oil  tankers to unload off the city's shores.  </P> <P> Voss and Arnold oppose new commercial buildings on the beach and criticize  development decisions made in recent years by the council majority.  </P> <P> Passannante supports downtown redevelopment and favors Measure D.  </P> <P> Roy could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In addition to the City Council race, incumbent City Atty. Gail C. Hutton,  first elected in 1978, is seeking her fourth term. She is being opposed by Paul  Eugene Mann, a former law instructor at the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's  academy.  </P> <P> Hutton said the main issue is her record of service, which she says has  provided the city with "responsible and cost-saving legal leadership."  </P> <P> Mann contends that Hutton has a poor record of service, that she is not  respected by other city departments because of delays in processing legal  requests and that she has spent too much money hiring outside counsel to  represent the city.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned about the money our city attorney gives away to outside counsel  for jobs that should be done by the city attorney and her deputies," Mann said.  "I don't think the taxpayers have any idea how much money is wasted."  </P> <P> Hutton said that her department is among the most frugally operated in the  county and that she spends relatively little money on outside attorneys.  </P></p>

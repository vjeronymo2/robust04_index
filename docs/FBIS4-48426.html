			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled Malawi as a  one-party state for 30 years, has been defeated in the country's  first democratic elections.    By last night, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, of the United Democratic  Front, the UDF, had received 960,000 votes in the presidential  election, compared with Dr. Banda's 418,000. In the  parliamentary election the UDF had taken 74 seats compared with  56 won by Dr. Banda's Malawi Congress Party. The Alliance for  Democracy had won 36 seats. The results of 11 constituencies  were still outstanding. The UDF said it needed 89 seats as a  minimum to gain a working majority of 51 percent. This meant  that the party needed 15 more seats. The official results are  expected today.    Preliminary results of the presidential election put UDF  leader, Bakili Muluzi, ahead -- with President Kamuzu Banda only  third behind the Alliance for Democracy's Chakufwa Chihana.</p>

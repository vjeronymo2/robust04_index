			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the time needed to make competitive awards under part C of chapter 1 and under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act, the Secretary proposes a 30-day comment period for these proposed regulations. As described in the ``Summary of Major Provisions,'' the Secretary already has revised the proposed regulations in response to the extensive comments received on the draft of these proposed regulations that was distributed to the public on December 20, 1993. In addition, the Secretary will make this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) available through electronic bulletin boards on the date of publication of the NPRM in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The access numbers for the electronic bulletin boards are as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> DIMENET Access Number: (508) 880&hyph;5412  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSA BBS Access Number: (202) 205&hyph;5574  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Distribution through the electronic bulletin boards will ensure timely availability of the NPRM. Therefore, the Secretary believes that the public interest will be served best by allowing the public 30 days to comment on the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Major Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the major provisions in these proposed regulations. The summary identifies changes in the regulations that are mandated by changes in the statute. Other changes described in the summary are regulations proposed by the Secretary. In addition, significant changes made to the proposed regulations as a result of public comments received during the public meetings and teleconferences are discussed in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Secretary proposes to change all references to ``individual with a severe disability'' to ``individual with a significant disability.'' The Secretary proposes to define an individual with a significant disability to mean an individual with a severe physical or mental impairment whose ability to function independently in the family or community or whose ability to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment is substantially limited and for whom the delivery of IL services will improve the ability to function, continue functioning, or move toward functioning independently in the family or community or to continue in employment, respectively. This definition is derived from the definition of an ``individual with a severe disability'' in section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The Secretary is concerned that the term ``severe'' has largely negative connotations and associations in common usage and believes that the term ``significant'' may be preferred by persons with disabilities. Consequently, the Secretary proposes to use the term ``significant disability'' as a synonym for the term ``severe disability'' in referring to an individual's disability. No change in meaning is intended by this change in nomenclature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 57938) soliciting comments on this proposed change. The comment period on the ``Nomenclature NPRM'' expired on December 13, 1993. The Secretary received only 37 comments on the change proposed in the ``Nomenclature NPRM,'' with no clear majority in favor or against. These commenters expressed a wide range of views on the proposed change. Commenters favoring the proposed change generally expressed the view that the term ``significant'' is less pejorative than the term ``severe'' in referring to an individual's disability and, thus, would support a more positive philosophy. These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the IL services and CIL programs authorized by title VII of the Act. Commenters opposing the change raised several issues. Some suggested that the proposed change is not technically accurate and that a change in meaning would result despite departmental assurances to the contrary. Others suggested that the proposed change would be confusing and burdensome to implement and that the proposed change should be made through legislation rather than through rulemaking. These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the VR services programs authorized by title I of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also on October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM (58 FR 57942) on the indicators of minimum compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act. The ``Indicators NPRM'' notified the public of the ``Nomenclature NPRM'' and advised the public to limit comments on the proposed nomenclature change to the ``Nomenclature NPRM.'' However, many of the comments received on the ``Indicators NPRM'' also included comments on the proposed change in terms from ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Of the 102 comments on the ``Indicators NPRM,'' only 4 expressed concern with the proposed change of the term ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Approximately 28 commenters specifically approved of the proposed change and 24 commenters used the new terminology in their own comments, implicitly indicating their approval of the proposed change. That is, these 24 commenters used the term ``significant'' instead of the term ``severe'' in their comments, even though they did not specifically approve of the proposed change. The remaining 50 commenters expressed no views on the proposed change and did not use either of the terms ``severe'' or ``significant'' in their comments. Based on the number of comments received from the IL community supporting the proposed change from ``severe'' to ``significant'' in the ``Indicators NPRM,'' the Secretary proposes to substitute the term ``significant'' for the term ``severe'' in this NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further support for changing the term ``severe'' to ``significant'' in this NPRM is based on the fact that Congress totally revised title VII of the Act when it passed the 1992 and 1993 Amendments. The argument that it would be burdensome to implement the proposed change (e.g., because of the need to revise existing forms and reporting formats) is inapplicable to implementation of the changes made to the IL programs by the 1992 and 1993 Amendments because the major changes to title VII of the Act have necessitated major revisions to the regulations implementing title VII. Thus, States and other recipients of funds under title VII will have to make extensive revisions (e.g., in existing regulations, forms, and reporting formats) to be consistent with these changes and substituting the term ``significant'' for ``severe'' as part of these revisions would not add any significant additional burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

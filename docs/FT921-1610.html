			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Liberalisation: a policy for insurance OBSTACLES TO THE LIBERALISATION OF TRADE IN INSURANCE by Robert Carter and Gerard Dickinson Harvester Wheatsheaf (for the Trade Policy Research Centre) Pounds 14.95, 208 pages OF ALL the service industries due be liberalised as a result of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations, insurance is one of the most tricky. This is not only because of the complex nature of the business. Foreign participation in a country's insurance industry tends to be particularly sensitive because it involves the collection and mobilisation of national savings as well as protecting residents from risks. This book offers a concise but broad-ranging description of the issues concerned. Though only about 11 per cent of non-life insurance premiums world-wide are written by foreign suppliers, foreign supply of reinsurance amounts to 33 per cent. The authors argue that there would be substantial benefits from liberalisation. The balance of payments risks are smaller than many developing countries fear, while consumers would gain from greater choice of product, lower premiums and, sometimes, more expert advice on loss prevention. The more useful aspect is the way in which Carter and Dickinson show why the right of establishment is so essential to any effort to liberalise the direct insurance industry and why regulatory differences matter so much. Foreign suppliers can suffer discrimination in a number of ways, ostensibly because this is necessary to protect the customer. They may, for example, be subject to greater capital requirements or barred from certain types of business. The description that is built up of the obstacles to trade in insurance is one that will come in handy for any layman trying to understand insurance in the context of the overall debate on trade in services. That said, there are drawbacks. One suspects that this book has been rather hastily dusted down after a long period of mouldering on the shelf while the Trade Policy Research Centre sorted out its own problems. Thus it is somewhat surprising to see references to the Soviet approach to insurance and to 'communist' countries like Hungary. Equally, too little is made of the difficulties of committing federal governments to liberalise when, as is the case with the US, it is the individual states rather than central government that are responsible for regulation. Nor does the book dwell on the context of US determination to break into the potentially lucrative markets of South-east Asia which has been a potent force behind the Gatt discussion. It does, however, provide insight into the way the European Community has struggled to open up its internal market. It ends with some practical advice from two authors long familiar with the industry. First, it would be better to seek regulatory equivalence rather than outright harmonisation of regulation; second, regulators should be prepared to accept the principle of home country control for insurance sold across frontiers.</p>

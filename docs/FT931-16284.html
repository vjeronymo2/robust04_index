			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Traffic figures hurt BA A VEILED profits warning from British Airways (BA), together with disappointing air traffic figures, prompted forecast cuts across the board and led the shares to slide 20 to 288p. The stock was one of the biggest casualties in the London market in percentage terms - down 6.5 per cent - and, at 26m shares, recorded its highest daily turnover for nearly a year. The airline announced that its December 1992 passenger load factor, the figure which reflects the percentage of aircraft seats taken up, fell 1.1 percentage points from a year ago to 66 per cent. BA also produced a very cautious statement which pointed out that first class and business class passengers were staying away and that there was a general surfeit of seats. Finally, there was growing realisation of the extent to which sharp currency shifts in September may have hit full-year profits. Most securities houses, including BA's joint brokers SG Warburg and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, cut profits estimates. Warburg came back by Pounds 40m to Pounds 220m for the current year and by Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m for next. Holiday bid The much-heralded bid for Owners Abroad from its smaller rival Airtours sent shares in the two holiday tour operators in widely different directions. The market was almost unanimous in the view that the bid will have to be increased if it is to succeed. Brokers recommended Owners shares on the likelihood of either an increased offer or a rival bid. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court said: 'It will be an exciting joint venture if successful, but Airtours will probably have to pay around 150p a share to get it.' Paribas said the possibility of another bidder and the probability of a higher offer meant investors should sell Airtours and buy Owners. Shares in the latter climbed 11 to 120p in big turnover of 12m. Airtours dropped 19 to 302p. There were also hints of a boardroom split at Owners, a development which analysts thought might increase the chances of success for an increased offer from Airtours. According to some specialists, discussions between the two companies were first initiated last summer. But the talks broke down and Owners then went on to agree a tie-up with LTU, the German travel group. This deal, which seems to have finally forced Airtours' hand, was to be voted on tomorrow, but has been postponed. LTU is now being tipped as a potential white knight. ICI again strong Shares in ICI performed strongly for the second day as Zeneca, the company's pharmaceuticals arm, announced it had submitted a new drug for regulatory approval in Italy, Europe's biggest antibiotics market. ICI jumped 24 to 1109p. Zeneca said its new antibiotic, Merrem, was the first of five compounds to come through its development pipeline and that Italian approval would open access to other EC countries. It expects Merrem to be launched in Italy early next year. A US new drug application is expected later this year. Smith New Court estimates that Merrem will generate sales worth between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m within five years. Analysts said the news was expected but it followed a strengthened recommendation from agency broker James Capel on Tuesday. Zeneca is to hold a meeting with analysts on Monday to discuss biotechnology prospects. Tesco became the latest food retailer to report a surge in sales in the period leading up to Christmas. Analysts, fearing that the group might have been trapped between resilience at J. Sainsbury and discounting at Kwik Save, had been preparing to downgrade. Instead, the reverse happened, with BZW moving from a sell to a hold while other houses also largely responded positively. Tesco said its like-for-like sales growth in the four weeks to Christmas was 1.5 per cent, lagging Sainsbury's 5 per cent but ahead of market expectations. Several houses were active in buying the stock yesterday, sending the shares forward 13 1/2 to 271 1/2 p in turnover of 13m. However, NatWest Securities retained their 'weak hold' stance for the stock, believing that the sales growth gap between Tesco and Sainsbury will widen this year. Kwik Save is expected to announce its sales figures officially today. They are widely believed to be between 13 and 15 per cent up from the same period last year. The shares advanced 17 to 803p. Sainsbury added 2 at 579p, while Asda gained 4 at 63p. It is expected to declare a like-for-like sales rise of one per cent. There was only limited interest in the banks sector. Barclays lost 7 more to 379p as the market's persistent worries about property losses once again triggered a debate about the bank being in a position to maintain the final dividend. Switching from Barclays to NatWest helped the latter edge up 3 to 422p on 3.2m traded. The sale of a block of 1.5m Royal Bank of Scotland at 208 1/2 left the shares 2 off at 209p. Merchant banks mainly retreated, although Singer &amp; Friedlander edged up 2 to 52p on heavy turnover of 13m. The composite insurance sector, shaken on Tuesday by news of the oil spill off the Shetland Islands, staged a good rally, led by Royal Insurance, up 6 at 284p on 3.6m traded. JIB took up the running in insurance brokers, closing 6 higher at 175p. The recent strength of sterling took the shine off Sedgwick, which eased 2 to 180p. BP was the busiest stock in a generally very quiet oil sector, with the shares managing a minor improvement, up 1 1/2 to 238p, in the absence of any cash-raising exercise. Turnover, however, was a poor 4m shares, although their was some brisk activity in the traded options market. Specialists said BP had put up a creditable performance in view of the recent flurry of US selling and the worrying decline in crude oil prices in recent days. Dealers reported further switching from the regional electricity companies(recs) and the power generators into the water stocks. Among the latter, Wessex added 6 at 595p, South West 3 at 494p and Thames 2 at 498p. Anglian lost 4 to 492p after Kleinwort Benson told clients to switch into Thames. National Power receded 4 to 273p and PowerGen 3 to 274p. Norweb, 480p, and Yorkshire, 491p, were both 7 easier and the weakest performers in the 'recs'. Racal Electronics was among the best performers in the electronics area of the market, the shares rising 10 to a record 179p after a number of buy recommendations from leading UK broker houses, notably Kleinwort Benson. Turnover in Racal shares was a hefty 5.4m. There was no shortage of strong risers in the electronics sector. Volex climbed 11 to 410p. Cray Electronics was 7 firmer at 116p - the highest level since July 1989 - on exceptionally high turnover of 8.2m shares. Motor issues rose on expectation that December car registration figures, due today, would show a 30 per cent increase over the same period of 1991. T. Cowie put on 10 at 174p, further boosted by a raised profits forecast from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Evans Halshaw gained 19 at 238p. Sears added 3 1/2 at 101p as the company hosted a series of meetings and told analysts that flat pre-Christmas trading was offset by subsequent buoyant sales. Retailer Burton saw exceptionally heavy turnover as dealers reported good two-way business and a large agency cross by Cazenove. The shares held at 78 1/2 p with 25m traded. Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 16 more to 613p, leading to speculation that it might have to announce bid terms for Evode today in order to calm shareholder concern. An analyst said it would need to announce a rights issue of some Pounds 150m to fund the bid, but another argued that a paper offer worth the equivalent of 100p a share need not be dilutive. Wassall, which rescinded the 'final' from Tuesday's final 95p a share hostile bid, was steady at 207p, while Evode added another penny at 105p.

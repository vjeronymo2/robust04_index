			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Vice Foreign  Minister Jorge Bolanos said the restoration of Canadian aid to  Cuba reflects that country's rejection of any measure aimed at  isolating the nation.    We intend to maintain and develop ties between the two  countries, Bolanos said, adding Cuba is Canada's first trade  partner in the Caribbean and Central American region.    Praising the decision, the Cuban vice foreign minister said  the resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 due to Cuba's  presence in Angola, opens a new phase in our bilateral  relations, which "have always been prominent."    Bolanos said the main issue in this decision is the  political  effect it will have. The formal announcement of the restoration  of aid to Havana was made in this capital by Christine Stewart,  Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, who  spoke against isolating the island.    According to Bolanos, Stewart invited, on behalf of Canadian  Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina to Ottawa, and the invitation will be honored sometime  this year.    Canada, as Mexico, never severed its commercial or  diplomatic  ties with Havana and has expressed opposition to the blockade  the United States imposed more than 30 years ago.</p>

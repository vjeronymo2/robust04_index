			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: . . . but Cadbury leaves a bitter taste While the corporate governance bandwagon is gaining momentum worldwide, signs of resistance are emerging in Britain. The problem is not apparent from the numbers. A survey updated last week by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed that of the 87 FT-SE 100 companies producing annual reports for financial years between December 1992 and April 1993, a record 90 per cent now make disclosures on the subject. More than 72 per cent also provide some sort of statement of compliance with the code of conduct launched last December by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. This is during the period before a statement of compliance became mandatory for quoted companies - for year-ends after last June. But a number of the reports express misgivings. Commercial Union warns that implementing some aspects of Cadbury's recommendations 'may lead to excessively elaborate procedures and disappointed expectations'. 'Most of the advice has been long on accountability and short on encouraging efficiency and enterprise,' writes Lord Hanson dismissively in his chairman's statement. BTR reports: 'The introduction of a code, however well-intentioned, cannot ensure integrity or competence.' There are greater concerns among smaller quoted companies, many of which complain the code is too costly or irrelevant for their operations. 'The majority of companies want to be seen to be endorsing Cadbury whole-heartedly,' says David Pimm, director of Coopers' corporate governance support unit. But he adds that many have had difficulties interpreting the code's guidance on how to define 'independent' non-executives, for instance. Some are also concerned about elements of the code, such as the danger that the provision for non-executives to take independent professional advice may represent 'a blank cheque'. Most important, under pressure from industry, guidelines have been delayed on reporting two of the most vital elements of the code - the statement on internal controls and on whether the company is a 'going concern'. There have been more than 17 drafts of the first of these and they are unlikely to be issued until early next year. The London Stock Exchange - which can threaten to de-list companies failing to provide a statement of compliance with the code - has reassured company directors that they will not have to comply with these aspects until the guidelines are released.</p>

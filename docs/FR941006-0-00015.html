			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uniformly, commenters were strongly opposed to reducing the WIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibles data by the CSFP caseload, particularly with no reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for non-WIC eligibles participating in CSFP. Commenters felt that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deducting CSFP caseload from the WIC eligibles would improperly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce estimates of income eligibles. They also stated that it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inequitable to no longer adjust the deduction to account for non-WIC eligible CSFP recipients. Most commenters suggested retaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the method used in the current formula. However, several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested perhaps there are States that could report WIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibles actually served by CSFP and then that data could be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine income eligibles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the concerns raised by commenters, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided not to adopt the proposed rule. Instead, the method used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the current regulations for deducting the CSFP participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for WIC from the WIC income eligible data base will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Performance Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department also proposed to revise the 95 percent performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard which reduces the current year grant for any State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that does not spend at least 95 percent of its food grant. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is concerned that expenditure of only 95 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant is too generous in the context of a fully funded program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department is sympathetic to the difficulties of rapidly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing States in meeting the 95 percent expenditure level, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies with relatively stable funding and participation do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> face the same difficulties. For State agencies at or exceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their fair share level, expending less than the 95 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated food funds is likely to indicate they have funds they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot use. The Department proposed to retain the 95 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for State agencies receiving less than their fair share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation, and to increase the performance standard to 98 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those at or over their fair share level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of commenters were adamantly opposed to two different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standards for over and under fair share State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, most commenters felt the 98 percent performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard was much too stringent and unrealistic due to food cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluctuations, infant formula rebates, variations in participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other factors not directly controlled by the WIC State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of these comments, the final rule deletes the proposed two-tier performance standard for over and under fair share State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. However, the Department continues to be concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unspent funds be directed to States with documented need,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially as State demographic and socioeconomic situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluctuate from year to year. This is particularly critical in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full funding environment. Therefore, the Department has decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain a uniform performance standard, and to gradually increase it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over time. Accordingly, paragraph 246.16 (e)(2)(i) in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule establishes a 96 percent performance spending standard in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and a 97 percent standard for fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 1997 and beyond for all WIC State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, prior to applying the performance standard, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations in section 246.16(e)(3)(i) allow for exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the grant of food funds that are spent forward into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> succeeding fiscal year as authorized by section 246.16(b)(3)(ii),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (iv) and (v). Since spentforward funds are merely unspent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds that the State agency can retain, the Department proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they should no longer be excluded when assessing spending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. A few commenters opposed this provision, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department continues to believe that spendforward funds should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be deducted when calculating the performance standard. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction has led to the current situation in which there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant amounts of unspent money moving from one fiscal year to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another. If not rectified, this will compound the extreme pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will be placed on all Departmental discretionary spending in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to meet the commitment to WIC full funding. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule retains this provision as proposed. Any food funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backspent under section 246.16(b)(3)(i) or converted to nutritional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services and administration (NSA) funds under section 246.16(g)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to be excluded from the food grant for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the performance standard. These two reductions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate in that they reflect food funds actually expended in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current year, and not merely reserved for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

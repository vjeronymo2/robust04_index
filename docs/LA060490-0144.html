			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRACK BOYCOTT BY JOCKEYS GETS RESULTS  </P> <P> Scratches and complaints at Longacres Racetrack have ebbed dramatically, three  days after several jockeys withdrew from riding for one day to protest what  they said were dangerous conditions at the rain-soaked track.  </P> <P> The protesting jockeys Thursday included some of the premier riders at  Longacres: Vicky Aragon, Gary Boulanger, Frank Gonsalves, James Corral and Tim  Camargo.  </P> <P> Frustrated trainers also scratched 21 horses from Thursday's nine races after a  thunderstorm drenched the track. On Sunday, they scratched 11.  </P> <P> The track was sloppy Sunday but apparently much better after being sealed, or  rolled.  </P> <P> Gonsalves said the surface was greatly improved despite periodic downpours  since the boycott. The change was "like night and day," he said.  </P> <P> One horse, a 3-year-old maiden that was galloped during a Thursday workout, had  to be killed when it snapped the bones in both front legs.  </P></p>

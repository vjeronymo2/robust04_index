			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Flinty foe of market friction - Sir Bryan Carsberg, UK director-general of fair trading, talks to Hugo Dixon Sir Bryan Carsberg, the UK director-general of fair trading, is making himself unpopular with large swathes of British industry. This month he has referred three industries to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on anti-competitive grounds: ice-cream companies, the home-valuation market and the record industry. The latter followed widespread complaints about compact disc prices. As Sir Bryan approaches his first anniversary in the job, an ever-increasing number of industries is coming under investigation. Doctors, the perfume business, condom manufacturers, the ITV companies - even the Financial Times's data-base service - have been referred to the MMC. He has also started his own investigation into office-equipment leasing, and proposed controversial disclosure rules for the life assurance industry. Sir Bryan originally made a name for himself as an enemy of monopolies during his eight years as director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, when he pitted himself against British Telecommunications' dominance in the newly privatised industry. His current job has given him the responsibility of investigating monopolies, cartels and other restrictive practices throughout British industry. In doing so, Sir Bryan, once an accountancy professor at the London School of Economics, admits he is often tempted to tear up his textbooks. Adam Smith's model of many players in 'perfect competition' with one another is comparatively rare, he says, while oligopoly and monopoly are common. Sir Bryan acknowledges that it would not be sensible to try to turn oligopolistic markets into 'Adam Smith-type models'. But he argues that it is possible to tackle 'frictions' that stop the market working as well as it might. By focusing on such frictions, he hopes to encourage more competitive markets which, in turn, he believes would benefit customers through lower prices and more choice. Sir Bryan's most potent weapon is to refer a case to the MCC, which then reports on whether the practice in question is against the public interest. In deciding whether to make a reference, Sir Bryan has to exercise his judgment. This reflects the fact that there is a dispute among economists on where to draw the boundary between anti-competitive practices and acceptable business behaviour. Most of the controversial cases where Sir Bryan has acted can be sorted into three families. First, restrictive distribution arrangements - in which a manufacturer refuses to supply certain retailers or attaches conditions to the supply of its products. Sir Bryan's concern is that these arrangements may be used to keep competing manufacturers out of the market or prices artificially high. Such was the consideration behind the probe into the ice cream industry, where there is a widespread practice of supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to small retailers provided they are not used to stock competitors' products. Another example is last November's referral of perfume manufacturers which were refusing to supply their fragrances directly to Superdrug, a discount retailer. Both probes have been challenged. Wall's, the main focus of the ice cream investigation which followed complaints by rival Mars, argues that it should be allowed to reap the rewards of investing in its distribution outlets. The perfume makers meanwhile say that they must be allowed to choose retailers to ensure their products are sold in high-quality surroundings. In the case of perfumes, Sir Bryan responds: 'It was not in my mind to prevent manufacturers maintaining quality standards. It was much more a question of whether they were applied objectively. Superdrug was prepared to do the same as Boots in terms of quality.' A second type of case involves alleged exploitation of copyright. While Sir Bryan acknowledges that copyright law is necessary to 'give encouragement to intellectually productive activity', he is concerned that the monopoly control it gives can be abused. This was the thinking behind his MMC referral last month of FT Profile, which has refused to allow competitive data-bases to stock FT articles. Copyright considerations - in particular, the ban on imports of recorded music from the US, where wholesale prices are lower - also underlie the MMC's investigation of compact disc prices. The FT has argued that it would be unfair to require it to make its text freely available to competitors while being denied the right to publish electronically foreign papers such as The Wall Street Journal. The music industry says that the right to ban 'parallel imports' is essential to exploit intellectual property rights and hence encourage investment in new artists. A third group of cases involves failure by marketers to provide full information about their products. Sir Bryan believes that competitive markets only work properly if consumers know what they are buying and how much a product or service really costs. Otherwise they can be hoodwinked into buying inappropriate goods. These were the concerns which led to Sir Bryan's assault on the lack of transparency in charges and benefits in the life assurance industry. They also explain his investigation of office-equipment leasing, following allegations by customers of high-pressure sales techniques, in particular by photocopier suppliers. In such cases, the question is whether Sir Bryan is guilty of 'nannying' consumers. If he tries to protect people from their follies, will they ever learn to be shrewd buyers? Shouldn't the principle of caveat emptor apply? Sir Bryan admits there is 'an element of nannying' but argues that he has to make a judgment about the 'practical balance of economic power' in cases such as these. 'It would be nice to think that people came out of school with a working knowledge of life assurance,' he says. But, given that they do not, 'by the time they have learned, it is already too late'. He also argues that even fairly shrewd people can be hoodwinked: 'One hears of leading competition lawyers who got caught on photocopier leasing.' Sir Bryan's vigorous approach to rooting out alleged anti-competitive practices has provoked disappointment and anger among companies being investigated. They argue that he is taking an excessively interventionist line. While there is no sign that he lacks the courage to carry through his investigations in the face of such criticism, the efficacy of his actions will largely depend on how other bodies react. It is too early to say whether the MMC will back his views on what constitutes anti-competitive behaviour. The commission typically takes nine months to complete its investigations and has yet to report on any of Sir Bryan's monopoly references. On mergers, it has made two reports  - concluding in one case that the merger was against the public interest and in the other that it was not. There is also a question of how much support he will receive from ministers, in particular from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. So far, the signs are not very encouraging. In February, Mr Heseltine twice overruled Sir Bryan's advice that proposed mergers should be referred to the MMC: the merger of GEC's and Philips Electronics' infra-red defence businesses, and Airtours' bid for rival holiday company Owners Abroad. Mr Heseltine also decided last month not to move ahead with a proposal to outlaw abuses of market power, despite advice from Sir Bryan. Instead, he decided to beef up the existing approach - under which practices are not deemed anti-competitive unless an MMC investigation finds them to be so. Sir Bryan, however, professes not to be worried by these developments. He explains the two merger decisions by saying that these were issues on which it was possible to have different opinions. Similarly, he understands why a desire to reduce industry's regulatory burden prevented the government taking a tougher line on abuses of market power. 'I don't actually think the government is going soft on competition policy.' But, even if the government's commitment to competition were to waver, Sir Bryan would be determined to continue his fight against market frictions: 'If I thought a case was a good one to go to the MMC, the thought that ministers might not agree would not divert me.'

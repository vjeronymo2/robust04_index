			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Zulus warn of resistance to new order: At least 12 people have been killed in the violence Hundreds of heavily-armed Zulus fired handguns and rifles into the air outside the seat of the government in Pretoria yesterday as the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, met Presidient F W de Klerk inside to warn of Zulu resistance to the new constitution. King Goodwill, accompanied by a delegation from the Zulu royal family and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as well as some 15,000 of his followers, issued what amounted to a final warning that his supporters will not take part in the April vote unless constitutional changes are made to guarantee ethnic Zulu self-determination. As one young man in the crowd began to explain to me the importance of Zulu self-determination, a shot rang out. The young man repeatedly assured me: 'Don't worry, be happy' as hundreds of men around us shot into the air. The Pretoria gathering exacerbated high tensions in the townships around Johannesburg, where fighting took place between mainly Zulu hostel dwellers urging a work stay-away and township residents who sought to attend work. Police said at least 12 people were killed, including one stabbed to death at the rally. Final constitutional amendments must be agreed by next Monday to be passed by parliament before the constitution is signed into law on January 31. After months of fruitless negotiations, officials from Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha party and other right wing groups will meet the government and African National Congress tomorrow for a final round of talks aimed at reaching agreement before the deadline. Inkatha negotiators were last night not hopeful of a deal. King Goodwill's statement to President de Klerk insisted that participation in the elections would mean 'national suicide' for the Zulus because the constitution did not guarantee sufficient regional autonomy. 'The Zulus cannot accept that any majority in the rest of South Africa has the right to decide our future.' He issued a veiled threat of secession, asking: 'If we are not welcome in the new South Africa through self-determination, then why should we remain part of that kind of South Africa?' Inkatha is due to make a final decision on participation in the elections next weekend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Russian's Debts"] </F>   [Text] Wherever Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the right-wing  winner of the Russian elections, appears, he is bound to leave  everybody confused. During his stay in Austria, the Russian  went to Graz to have his skin and eyes examined at the local  hospital. After the treatment he casually disappeared -- without  paying -- it has now been reported. (Initially the doctors kept  quiet -- out of politeness toward their "prominent" guest?) Now  the director of the hospital wants to send a bill for the amount  outstanding to Moscow.</p>

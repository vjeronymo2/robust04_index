			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GAMES PREVIEW;  </P> <P> HART AND CANYON TO RENEW RIVALRY  </P> <P> Hart and Canyon highs, which have formed one of the area's most prestigious  football rivalries through the past seven falls, reluctantly will meet in the  semifinals of the L.A. Games' passing tournament Sunday.  </P> <P> Although the offense is limited to a passing attack under the L.A. Games'  format, the contest likely won't pass without its share of emotion.  </P> <P> The schools meet in a traditional nonleague game that attracts 8,000 to 10,000  spectators, and one meeting a year is enough as far as Hart Coach Mike  Herrington is concerned.  </P> <P> "We really don't like to play (Canyon) during the summer," Herrington said.  "It's a pretty emotional game. We're big rivals and people make a pretty big  deal over it."  </P> <P> The winner of the 8:30 a.m. game at El Camino College will meet the winner of  the Morningside-Westchester game in the final at noon.  </P> <P> Hart, which must replace all of its starting skill-position players from last  year's 9-1 team, has not reached the L.A. Games semifinals since 1986. This  year Hart has beaten Fremont, 13-0; San Marino, 7-6; and Granada Hills, 14-13.  </P> <P> Junior quarterback Ryan Connors has played well in place of Rob Westervelt, who  will play at Weber State in the fall. Connors, 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, led  the sophomore team to the Foothill League championship last season.  </P> <P> Canyon Coach Harry Welch has been impressed with the Cowboys' stingy defense  and explosive offense. Canyon outscored Notre Dame, North Torrance and Kennedy,  88-26, in reaching the semifinals.  </P> <P> "Our defense has been aggressive and we've had good intensity," Welch said.  </P> <P> Numerous area schools will compete in other sports today.  </P> <P> In baseball, City Section 4-A Division champion Chatsworth will play Tustin in  a noon quarterfinal at Redondo High. The winner will play in the semifinals at  3 p.m at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Royal will play North Torrance in a quarterfinal boys' soccer match at 9:30  a.m. at El Camino. In girls' soccer, Chaminade faces Torrance for the  championship at 10 a.m., also at El Camino.  </P> <P> In the fourth round of the boys' basketball tournament, Cleveland will play  Locke at 10 a.m. and Crescenta Valley will meet Manual Arts at noon in El  Camino's south gymnasium. In the north gym, Pasadena will play Carson at 11  a.m. and La Canada will meet Morningside at noon.  </P> <P> Three area schools are among the final eight competing in the girls' basketball  championships at Locke High. Channel Islands will play Cerritos at 10 a.m. and  Buena will meet Simi Valley at 11 a.m.  </P> <P> In water polo, Harvard and Pasadena are among the final eight teams that will  play at Harvard High today. The host school will meet Muir at 8 a.m. and  Pasadena faces San Gorgonio at 11:30 a.m.  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Patchy recovery in hotel business Recovery in the hotels business is patchy and inconsistent, a survey issued yesterday by tourism consultants Horwath Consulting says. Higher-priced hotels in London, charging Pounds 56 to Pounds 85.50 a room, were busier last year than in 1992, with occupancy rising from 53 per cent to 57 per cent, but average room occupancy in England was 48 per cent, the same as in 1992.</p>

The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Ed Bricker, 2/22/94, LFA&hyph;0349 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ed Bricker filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Office of Inspector General (IG) of a request for information submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Eight of the documents responsive to Bricker's requests were withheld in their entirety pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), and certain material in 18 other responsive documents was withheld pursuant to the same two exemptions. Subsequent to the filing of Bricker's Appeal, the IG informed the Office of Hearings and Appeals that it had adopted new policies regarding its withholding of information under the two exemptions. The IG stated that because these policies were not in place at the time of its initial determination, an additional review of the documents at issue would result in more information being released to the appellant. In light of these changes, the matter was remanded to the IG to conduct a further review of the documents so that additional information could be released. In all other respects, the Appeal was denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

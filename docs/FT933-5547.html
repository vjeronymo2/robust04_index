			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US dairymen turn against marketing board US DAIRY farmers, fighting a rearguard action against the introduction of bovine somatotropin (BST), a genetically engineered hormone that increases milk production, have turned their wrath on another target: the National Dairy Board, which promotes the sale of the sector's products. A Dairy Board drive to 'educate' the US public about the safe use of BST infuriated whole groups of American producers. Already concerned that they were not getting sufficient returns from the Dollars 75m they were paying the board each year, they launched an angry campaign to 'Dump the Dairy Board'. After receiving a 16,000-signature petition from dairy farmers across the country, Mr Mike Espy, the US Agriculture Secretary, called a referendum on the Board's future for August 16. The result will be known some time this month. The Dairy Board was proposed by congress in 1983 and approved in a national referendum of dairy farmers. Producers pay a 15 cent assessment on every hundred-weight of milk sold - one-third funds the board's activities and two-thirds goes to regional and state dairy associations. According to the Economic Research Service in the US Agriculture Department, advertising activities conducted by the board for the eight years of the programme increased fluid milk sales by about 4.3 per cent over expected sales The results have been less impressive for cheese. Sales increased by an average 2.4 per cent over expectations, despite an estimated Dollars 288m poured into advertising. 'We all felt the National Dairy Board was squandering money on poorly designed advertising campaigns and excessive salaries,' says Mr Francis Goodman, one of the leaders of the opposition. 'It wasn't providing farmers with better income.' A board official says, however, that executive salaries are consistent with other salaries in farm trade associations. These can run well into the six figures. Mr Goodman sees the attack on the board as another skirmish in a war for control of agriculture. Individual farmers have long been losing control of their programmes to agribusiness and large corporate interests. Milk co-operatives, formed to help farmers get higher prices for their milk, are now viewed by many dairymen as part of agribusiness and opposed to the higher prices the producers need to survive. They have launched a court battle against a USDA ruling that allows co-operatives to vote on behalf of their members. Eight-six co-operatives announced that they would cast 70,866 votes - nearly half of the eligible voters.</p>

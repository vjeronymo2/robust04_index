			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Paris Club meets on pact to delay Soviet debt payments WESTERN creditor nations met yesterday to finalise an accord to delay until the end of this year repayment of principal on the former Soviet Union's official debt. The meeting between the Paris Club of 17 creditor nations and a delegation from Vnesheconombank, the Soviet bank for foreign economic affairs, follows the end of the November agreement by the Group of Seven industrialised countries to allow deferral of about Dollars 3.6bn in repayments of principal due by the end of 1992, and to ask other creditor nations to follow suit. Since then, eight of the republics have confirmed that they accept responsibility for the foreign debts and bank creditors have agreed to delay repayments of principal on commercial debt. Lionel Barber adds from Washington: The US supports early consideration of membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belorussia, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia, Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, said yesterday. The US is establishing diplomatic relations with these six republics. Mr Brady said the US was ready to support other republics' membership once diplomatic relations were in place. Vnesheconombank has injected Pounds 70m into Moscow Narodny Bank to allow the UK-based institution to take additional charges against its Soviet loan exposure, AP-DJ reports. Moscow Narodny, which halted unsecured lending to the Soviet Union more than a year ago, has thus raised its total capital to Pounds 190.3m, up 58 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN BITES TOWN: DRIVE BETTER, HE SAID;  </P> <P> ONCE BEST IN THE U.S., CALIFORNIANS NOW ACT AS THOUGH THEY'RE CRUISIN' FOR A  BRUISIN'  </P> <P> WE CAN BEGUILE ourselves with the fantasy that so-called Important Subjects  occupy our minds, but it won't wash. For a while, I can write columns about  subjects like politics or sports or race and pretend that I'm dealing with what  "really" matters, but, you know, I'm not fooling anyone -- least of all myself.  Every so often, a person's got to come clean, drop the facade and deal with the  only thing that actually does matter around here: driving.  </P> <P> Yes, that seems like a cliche assessment, on a par with the old Newsweek  articles about people baking away their brains out in Lotusland (and this was  before anybody actually drove a Lotus). But just look at the most recent  election returns.  </P> <P> We voted against spending money for schools. We voted against spending money to  build prisons. Parkland? Forget about it. A new courthouse? You gotta be  kidding. The environment? Let Chevron spend money to save it. We, the people,  voted to spend money for only one purpose: to solve the traffic mess. If Big  Green had promised to clear rush-hour traffic on the 91, it would have breezed  through.  </P> <P> Admittedly, what one might facetiously describe as "the system" doesn't work.  Hard-core Caltransophiles might argue that's because we didn't persevere with  the Original Plan. Caltrans prescribed quite an impressive system in theory; as  I recall, it proposed a grid of freeways no farther apart from one another than  four miles in any direction. Had the early planners had their way, you could  have waved to somebody driving on the next freeway over. But the dream of a  Southern California map decked out in tight freeway plaid is deader than Sam  the Olympic Eagle.  </P> <P> But given the constraints of our asphalt circulatory system, we still bear  major blame for clotting it up like so many automotive platelets of bad  cholesterol. We -- by which I mean everybody but me -- engage in such maneuvers  as cruising ever so slowly in the fast lane of a boulevard for blocks on end  until that left-turn pocket we've been searching for suddenly appears. We  cheerfully block whole afternoonfuls of traffic by pulling into the right lane  of a street and then insisting on bulldozing our way across the intervening  lanes to the very next left-turn lane, out of panic that a parallel street  affording a similar turn opportunity will never appear.  </P> <P> We wait at long red lights, and then rouse ourselves so slowly from our slumber  that only one or two of the fellow drivers behind us can take advantage of that  same, all-too-brief green. We act, in short, in the solipsistic manner of one  whose drivers' ed class pounded home this crucial lesson: Hey, cool ruler,  you're the only one on the road!  </P> <P> This assumes, of course, that we attended any such class. Actually, I blame the  decline in the quality of local vehicular behavior on the influx of people who  learned to drive primarily by watching "The Blues Brothers." Driving used to be  embarrassingly good. Easterners would scoff at our polite, law-abiding ways as  the ultimate proof of our hick pedigree. Conversely, I remember being amazed,  on first arriving in Boston, that anyone could survive in a car there for more  than 15 minutes.  </P> <P> The most obvious proof of our sad fall from automotive grace is the rupture of  the social contract that used to govern relations with pedestrians. Woody Allen  had too much emotion invested in the cultural superiority of spending  afternoons in the Thalia Theatre to realize it, but allowing cars to turn right  on red was, in fact, part of a coherent way of being.  </P> <P> Certain privileges were ceded to the pedestrian (in recognition of his rare and  endangered status), such as the absolute right to cross in the crosswalk,  before which all drivers must stop. In return, the driver gained equal and  complementary privileges, like the famous right turn on red.  </P> <P> But like a chimpanzee trying to play Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," today's  drivers have clumsily banged away at this stately and elegant balance. Stepping  into a crosswalk now gives a pedestrian nothing more than the right to get  exhaust burns on his jeans from the scofflaws speeding by. My personal  crosswalk technique -- shared here purely for entertainment purposes and not to  encourage similar behavior, so don't sue me if you get hit -- is to stare down  oncoming drivers, relying on eye contact to revive the latent human impulse to  not kill. Sometimes it works.  </P> <P> But if it's everybody for himself, then we have to go all the way. Let  pedestrians jaywalk or run for it any time they can. And drivers have to give  up that precious right turn on red; that brief, safe time at the intersection  becomes too crucial to sheer pedestrian survival. It's a coherent system, too  -- the laws of the jungle, or Manhattan -- and it's coming our way.  </P> <P> Of course, the authorities help to degrade this state of affairs further. If  nobody gets a ticket for plowing through red lights any more, it's Katie, bar  the door. And who empowered city officials to remove the nickel from the list  of legal coinage, as far as parking meters are concerned?  </P> <P> But the core of the problem remains us -- that is, everybody but me. Let's work  on it, shall we? Meantime, outta my way, babe. I'm late.  </P></p>

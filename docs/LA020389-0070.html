			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COASTCAST PLANT CITED FOR RELEASING ODORS  </P> <P> A Van Nuys company has been cited for creating a public nuisance by releasing  foul odors, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, said  that the citation comes after complaints by people who live in a trailer park  next door to the Coastcast plant in the 16700 block of Stagg Street.  </P> <P> The residents contacted the AQMD on Jan. 19, complaining about sickening odors  emanating from the plant.  </P> <P> The company could be fined a maximum of $25,000 for the citation, which will be  added to a Jan. 24 citation against the company for visible smoke, officials  said. That citation also could cost the firm a maximum of $25,000, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Kelly said the AQMD will continue its investigation into what caused the odors.  But he said investigators believe they came from wax burned in a wax-cast  process Coastcast uses to manufacture metal parts for the aerospace industry.  </P> <P> "The company has been cooperative, and they have shut down the oven that was  creating the odors until they can work out with our engineers how to solve the  problem," Kelly said.  </P></p>

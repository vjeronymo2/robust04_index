			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rui Oliveira, spokesman for the National </F> Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, by  unidentified correspondent in Lisbon; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Oliveira] We now have the extremely positive  experience of all that has happened in South Africa concerning  the elections. We saw the winning side--the ANC and its leader  Nelson Mandela--being extremely flexible and inviting  others--although there were already previous agreements among  themselves, including the extreme right like the AWB [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] and all the other political forces--to be  part of the national unity government.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that such solutions would  work  in Angola?    [Oliveira] Well, we believe that the South African  experience  is extremely positive and, at the end of the day, what has  happened in South Africa is what we have been negotiating and  trying to make the Luanda government understand--which is a  greater flexibility on the part of the MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola]. We want, in real terms, an  administrative decentralization. Angola cannot be ruled from  Luanda. Therefore, we have been asking right from the beginning  for governing bodies in those provinces where we won the  elections.    Apart from everything else, it is not possible for the  ruling  body of those provinces to include members of a party that  shelled for a year and a half--and keeps on shelling heavily  with all types of weapons and from the air, particularly with  MiGs and Sukhoys--the people of cities where there is no war.  That is the case in Huambo, Andulo, Vila Nova, and other cities  that are not on the front line and which the Luanda government  has been shelling for a year and a half. As I have said, it  continues shelling those cities. The people living in those  cities will find it hard to be ruled by those same people.    [Correspondent] What is preventing further progress at the  talks in Lusaka and us from seeing concrete results?    [Oliveira] As far as we are concerned, we have been waiting  to adopt the same measure since we declared a cease-fire for the  Luanda government. If the Luanda government were to give the  same response to our cease-fire with a cease-fire command to its  troops, the Lusaka agreement might have been signed by now.    [Correspondent] One last question: Can you see it possible  for an Eduardo dos Santos-Jonas Savimbi meeting to take place  through Portuguese mediation, through the mediation of President  Soares? Do you believe that is possible?    [Oliveira] Well, as you know, there have been other  proposals previously. For example, I can remember initiatives  by King Hassan II, Nelson Mandela, and the deceased President  Boigny, who proposed and offered to mediate in the peace process  in Angola and to promote a meeting between Jose Eduardo dos  Santos and Jonas Savimbi. We responded positively but the MPLA,  through its president, refused the meeting. We are totally  available at present for a meeting at the highest level. Dr.  Savimbi has already said that it has been the MPLA, the Luanda  government, that has refused the meeting.    [Correspondent] Is Savimbi, therefore, available for a  meeting with Jose Eduardo dos Santos?    [Oliveira] Yes, we are willing to do everything for peace to  return to Angola. If that initiative comes from someone who  really wants peace in Angola, be it Dr. Mario Soares, Nelson  Mandela, King Hassan II, or anyone else, we will respond  positively at any time. We have already stated this previously.</p>

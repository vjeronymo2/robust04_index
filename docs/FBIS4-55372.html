			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) believes that the results of the first round  of parliamentary elections held in Hungary on May 8 were greatly  influenced by the operation of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian  Television. ``The majority of the citizens receive their  information from the electronic media, and it was here that the  differences in the parties' manifestos could not be greatly  elaborated.    "The new government must settle the situation of the media  after the elections, and it must dismiss the vice-presidents of  Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television, Laszlo Csucs and Gabor  Nahlik, because they both worked in a manner contradictory to  public service norms. New presidents and vice-presidents must  be appointed to head Radio and Television, in order for them to  consolidate the institutions."    The above was how SZDSZ executive Peter Hack evaluated the  media situation in a meeting with the press in Budapest on  Wednesday [11 May], prior to holding a discussion with Dutch  students studying the media.    According to Hack, there are good reasons for Dutch students  to gather information in Hungary, as the media situation in the  country can be instructive, similar to the often mentioned  "veterinarian horse".    The SZDSZ politician said the new Parliament must enact the  media law by October at the latest. The law should create the  conditions for commercial radio and television so that open  bidding can take place early next year.    The Free Democrats believe the state should keep an  earth-based television channel and a satellite channel, while  two earth-based channels could be privatized for 10 to 15 years,  based on a concession tender. The SZDSZ believes it justified  to have two public service radio channels: Kossuth station and  the cultural station Bartok, with private radios broadcasting on  the other frequencies.</p>

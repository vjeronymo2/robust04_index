			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 May (Notimex) -- It is necessary to  prevent misunderstandings or rifts between Mexico and the United  States as a consequence of unilateral actions that upset any of  the parties, Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias has stated.    Opening the 11th U.S.-Mexican Bilateral Commission, the  Mexican foreign secretary said that relations between the two  countries are at a great moment in time, adding that he hopes  the work being done by both delegations "will contribute to  strengthening our ties."    Speaking to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  other officials from the two countries, Tello Macias explained  that Mexico has launched reforms and significant changes for  promoting growth, controlling inflation, fighting poverty, and  opening the economy to world competition. Tello Macias  emphasized that "we are the first to admit that there is still a  lot to be done and we are encouraged to see that our efforts and  sacrifices are producing the desired results."    He said the current administration's basic goal is to place  Mexico in an international position that enables it to use the  opportunities presented by global reorganization, "as an active  participant in the changes that occur rather than as a passive  and indifferent spectator."    The Mexican diplomat said that, given their proximity,  asymmetric capabilities, individual historical experiences, and  diverse cultures, "ties between the two countries are the most  complex in the world." He said: This happens because ties among  academicians, scientists, businessmen, and organizations on both  sides of the border represent a universe of societal contacts  that frequently surpass the interaction between the two  governments.    Tello Macias explained that, given this reality, it is  important to cultivate bilateral relations with talent, which  implies having effective institutional channels that facilitate  dialogue and cooperation. The foreign minister admitted that  cultural differences "and economic disparities between our  countries" cannot be neglected, but that "interests based on our  common presence in the same geographical zone prevail and these  interests are strengthened with commercial integration."    He emphasized that the meeting's agenda clearly proves the  richness and complexity of relations between Mexico and the  United States and the responsibility of finding reasonable  formulas to resolve any problems between the two countries.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Management: Into the great wide open - Companies are in a better position to exploit new opportunities if they take a broader view of where they are going One of the most powerful maxims of modern management is that companies are best organised by splitting themselves not only into divisions or businesses, but also into smaller 'strategic business units' focused on particular product markets. The approach fosters efficiency, market responsiveness and managerial motivation, as a growing number of western companies has found over the past decade or more - though not all of them have chosen to use the American 'strategic business unit' (SBU) terminology. Yet there is also a groundswell of opinion that today's business units - and even much larger divisions - provide far too narrow a set of boundaries from which to make appropriate decisions about all tomorrow's competitive opportunities and threats, especially those in new industries. Such opportunities and threats may either cross boundaries between divisions or business units, or may fall somewhere in between. As a result they may be fought over, confronted inadequately, or just ignored. A much broader corporate perspective needs to be taken if the company is to act appropriately - but without the sort of bureaucracy sometimes used in the past. One way of trying to do this used to be to rely on senior 'functional' executives at head office, such as chief technology officers. Even in its heyday, this was generally inadequate. In today's streamlined matrix structures, where divisions or businesses generally hold most power, such functional executives lack muscle. Their perspective is also usually too narrow - for instance, most technology officers lack market experience and insight. Another favourite US practice in the early 1980s, at General Electric and elsewhere, was to overlay a laborious 'sector' structure across the businesses and SBUs. GE then abandoned this, and has since relied instead on less formal cross-company co-ordination. But sceptics have questioned whether this has been really effective at putting GE in a position to exploit the industries of the future. GE has not been alone in having too narrow a perspective on future industries. So, according to Dr Gary Hamel of the London Business School, does Digital Equipment, together with most large western companies - in stark contrast with many of their Japanese rivals. On the other hand, Hamel argues that Kodak, Apple, Motorola and Hughes Aircraft are all looking beyond the boundaries of their current businesses in order to harness the 'core competences' which underpin several of them. Such competences include Apple's experience in software and 'user-friendly' interfaces, and Kodak's skills in chemical photography and digital imaging. The latter have been combined successfully to produce several cross-business products, notably Kodak's 'photo compact disc', which allows high-resolution video images to be stored, retrieved and altered. Because of the sensitivity of all the strategic and organisational issues involved, a presentation by Hamel on 'competing for industry futures' excited intense debate among the executives, academics and consultants at last month's annual conference of the international Strategic Management Society, held this year in London. Hamel shares most academics' penchant for jargon, but his prescription is powerful all the same. Among other things, it calls for radical change in the sorts of strategic concepts and techniques which companies employ, and the way they use existing ones. His prescription is summarised below. If companies want to 'compete for industry futures', rather than just for shares of existing markets, they must recognise several new guiding principles, says Hamel. Doing so is much more important than any structural reorganisation which may also be necessary. The principles include the following: New industries are emerging out of all sorts of existing ones, and in the 'white space' between them. Hamel cites nine examples, ranging from digital television to multi-media systems and applications, and from gene-engineered drugs and branch-less banking to intelligent vehicle and highway systems. Many new industries offer opportunities to rivals from a range of backgrounds. For instance, companies are coming at the emerging 'digital industry' from consumer electronics, professional electronics, entertainment and publishing, professional systems, information technology services, software, and telecommunications. Competing for such 'industry futures' is therefore of a different character from current competition for 'market position'. Instead of competition being between products, it is between companies. Instead of being for 'stand-alone' opportunities, it is for systemic ones. (Hence Kodak's reconception of itself as an 'imaging company', using both chemical and digital technology.) Instead of speed of execution being the key, perseverance is. And instead of competition being for cost and quality leadership, it is for intellectual leadership. The conventional assumptions and tools of industrial analysis 'just don't apply' - the boundaries of each industry are unknown and unstable; it is hard to differentiate between customers, suppliers and competitors; and 'strategy' is about positioning the company in new, not existing, 'industry space'. In this context of uncertainty, companies such as Apple, Kodak and Motorola  -just like, for example, Sony and NEC in Japan - act as 'nodes'. That is, they have built core competences which will be valuable under a broad variety of industry outcomes; they feel they have more to gain from changing the rules of their industry than from abiding by them; they actively manage the process of transition into new industries; and they build networks of alliances which have a cumulative logic to them, rather than just a series of one-by-one relationships. Competition for industry futures takes place in three phases. The first, akin to preparing for a marathon, includes understanding potential patterns of evolution in core competences, in technical functionality, and in customer patterns. It also includes aligning corporate resources within a strategic framework (or 'strategic architecture') that shows how various technological and other developments may fit together as the new industry emerges. NEC published such a framework as far back as 1977 for the integration of computers and communications - a process which is occurring only now. The second phase is akin to the long, hard slog of the marathon proper. It involves competing for the acquisition of competences, and for product concepts and standards. It involves building alliances (or 'coalitions') of companies which share the same view of the future; these coalitions then compete with each other for market learning. The third phase, 'like the final 100-metre sprint', involves competing for market share and profits around the world. Most western top management time is spent just on this phase, 'yet nothing happens here unless someone has been busy on phases one and two, winding up the mainspring in the clock,' says Hamel. Like IBM, companies can hold market leadership long after they have lost in phases one and two. But eventually the spring unwinds and leaves them floundering. Kodak, by contrast, has been investing in phase one, creating 'stored energy' for the future. In deciding which core competences to build, companies should ask three questions. First, which competences will allow them to exploit discontinuous changes in industries - their own or those of others? Second, which core competences (such as flat screen displays) will provide 'gateways' to future markets? And third, which core competences would provide influence over other industry players? Sony's near-monopoly of the skills of miniaturisation is an obvious example here. As a result of all the above, companies, when they are competing for the future, need to think very differently from usual about the meaning of that all-important goal, 'market share'. It can have at least six meanings: share of technology creation (where the west's share is high in most industries); share of core competence (where it is much lower in a growing number); share of 'core platform' (such as Canon's stranglehold over laser printer 'engines' for western companies); share of a format or standard (eg the Japanese VHS format for cassette recorders); share of end-product manufacturing; and finally, the usual definition of brand share. If a company controls the manufacturing of 'core platforms', says Hamel, it has ultimate control over the share of end-product. Hence the tendency in a number of industries for Japanese companies to focus on achieving a high share of both, leaving US and European companies clinging to the consolation prize of high brand shares - for the moment, anyway. Strategy has been seen traditionally in the west as a positioning game within existing businesses, rather than as the creation of new ones, Hamel told the Strategic Management Society conference. 'Everybody in Europe worries today about market share in the car business, or in semiconductors. Yet the question for the rest of the decade and beyond is 'what is your share of new business creation?' Chief executives and their teams need to make a far greater intellectual investment in thinking about the future than most of them are.'</p>

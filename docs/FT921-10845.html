			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Warning over works councils WORKS councils planned under European Community legislation constitute a serious challenge to existing forms of union organisation in Britain, according to an official of the International Metalworkers Federation. The European Commission is proposing to set up works councils in larger companies operating in more than one member state. Companies would have to consult local works councils on matters affecting employees. In a paper delivered yesterday at Warwick University, Mr Denis MacShane warned: 'There is a serious dispute currently taking place about who nominates British union representatives to Euro works councils and it is, as yet, unresolved.' Mr MacShane predicted that in spite of Britain's opt-out from the European Social Chapter at the Maastricht summit, more works councils would be set up in Britain. Some British unions dislike the German model for works councils, under which employees elect representatives. Those unions would prefer the appointment of union officials. Mr MacShane predicted that British unions would have to adapt to a Continental system of rights for workers. He also predicted that the dispute over representation would be settled when British unions accepted the German model. 'For the first time in 150 years, British unions are faced with a serious challenge not in the name of strengthening capital but in the name of strengthening the workers,' he said. The Trades Union Congress's organisation committee is examining how to adapt union structures to the works council system.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> ORDINANCE ON POOL FENCING IS STUDIED  </P> <P> The City Council took up the issue of extra fencing around swimming pools at a  study session Monday, but decided to delay action on a proposed ordinance until  a county committee finalizes its policy.  </P> <P> The fencing proposal has arisen because of concerns over pool safety and the  frequency of child drownings in Orange County. Local pool safety advocate Jim  Landis, whose son nearly drowned in a pool accident last year, asked the  council to keep an open mind about the proposal and to consider the issue a  matter of public safety.  </P> <P> "For those of you who indicate that it is a matter of private concern, please  remember that many of the kids who don't die in these pools end up in state  hospitals . . . ," Landis said. "All we're trying to do is protect the  children. There have been two deaths this year in Newport Beach alone."  </P> <P> In September, the International Conference of Building Officials met and drew  up a model ordinance for cities and states interested in adopting safety  measures for residential pools. The policy would require four sides of fencing  around all pools. Where the house is used as the fourth side, then the  ordinance would require doors that close and lock automatically, as well as  door alarms.  </P> <P> Among the questions still to be addressed by any policy are whether the  ordinance should apply to all homes or just newly installed pools, and whether  residents without children would be exempt from the restrictions.  </P> <P> Councilman Clarence J. Turner said the city should adopt such an ordinance. "It  seems to me that this is a problem that cries out for addressing," he said.  "We've had a plethora of deaths from infants falling into pools."  </P> <P> Councilman John Hedges disagreed, saying it was out of the council's  jurisdiction to address private safety issues.  </P> <P> The recently formed county committee includes representatives from the county,  Irvine, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, the National Swimming Pool and Spa  Institute; and Landis, who has formed a local group called the Children's Pool  Safety Assn.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan returned from  Ouagadougou yesterday, where he participated in an economic  summit devoted to the devaluation and the West African Economic  and Monetary Union [UEMOA]. Pascal Amani Kouadio was at the  airport yesterday and reports the following:    [Begin recording] [Kouadio] The prime minister arrived at  Port-Bouet airport at 2100 on board the presidential plane from  Ouagadougou, where he attended the UEMOA summit. He was  welcomed at the airport by government officials. The prime  minister spoke about the Ouagadougou summit:    [Duncan] The Ouagadougou meeting examined three issues:  first, the devaluation; second, UEMOA; and third, the West  African Economic Community [CEAO]. Concerning the devaluation,  two months after this measure it was needful for the heads of  state and the governments of the UEMOA area to review issues  relating to this measure, to find out about the various measures  being taken by each state regarding the devaluation, to find out  how negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF,  and the World Bank are progressing, and how our cooperation with  France on this matter is proceeding.    On this matter, I can say that generally things are  progressing well. With the exception of only one state, all  arrangements with the Bretton Woods institutions will be  finalized by the end of this month. It is important to stress  this. I would also like to state that inflation has been  relatively well controlled and in line with projections.  Nevertheless, the heads of state present at the meeting  expressed the desire for a number of actions to be carried out.  First, communication must be intensified among the populations  to explain the devaluation better and to indicate -- and this is  important -- that it is an opportunity for our countries to  forge ahead. We would like to underline here that this is the  final devaluation. There is no question of a second  devaluation, because no indicators point to this. It is  important to state this and I believe all the heads of state and  participants, including the Bretton Woods institutions and  certainly France, have taken good note of this.    Also, the backup measures announced during the signing of  the  various agreements are proceeding on schedule in all the states.  It was therefore agreed to have regular meetings of this kind  so that UEMOA partners can coordinate their actions. It was  also decided to hold a meeting at the latest in June with  members of the Bank of Central African States, so that all the  members of the franc zone countries can coordinate their  positions. It is also important to stress that trade in goods  and services within the UEMOA must be developed, and this  permits me to go to the second point, which is the issue of the  UEMOA.    As you are aware, the UEMOA agreement was signed at Dakar on  11 January, but due to the devaluation the signing of the UEMOA  agreement was somewhat relegated to the background. At the  Ouagadougou meeting, the heads of state have, so to say, very  much insisted on the need to proceed with integration, and it  was therefore advocated that all the member states, except one  -- for reasons peculiar to this state -- ratify the UEMOA  agreement by 30 April. With regard to the state concerned,  because of internal reasons that ratification is expected to  take place before 30 June, so that we can have a basic legal  instrument which would permit us to forge ahead toward  integration. This is an important chance we can seize, and as  we have made considerable progress on West African issues, we  intend to move quickly to reinforce solidarity within the UEMOA  member states.    The last issue examined concerned the West African Economic  Community. It was difficult for two economic bodies to coexist  in the area. The CEAO heads of state conference has therefore  decided to dissolve the CEAO and has instructed the council of  ministers to see to the liquidation of this body and take  measures to settle issues relating to its personnel.

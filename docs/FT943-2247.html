			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco attracts buyers Supermarkets group Tesco was among the FT-SE 100's best individual performers and the heaviest traded stock in the index as the market became increasingly optimistic about sales and a stabilisation of profit margins ahead of interim figures which are expected this morning. Tesco's numbers mark the opening of the food retailing sector's results season. Analysts' forecasts of Tesco's half-year profits range from around Pounds 240m to Pounds 252m with the interim expected to rise by 10 per cent to 2.7p. Sentiment in Tesco, and the food retailing sector as a whole was helped by a positive research circular published by NatWest Securities who upgraded their profits estimates for Tesco, Argyll, Morrison and Sainsbury. The broker upgraded its stance on the sector to neutral after increasing its 1995 earnings growth forecasts from 4 per cent to 10 per cent, matched by dividend growth, citing gross margin recovery at mainstream superstores and a transfer of margin pressures to discount stores. NatWest restored its 'add' recommendation to Tesco, whose shares touched 256p, their highest level since March 1993 before slipping back to close a net 2 1/2 higher at 251p. Turnover reached 10m shares. Argyll put on 6 to 290p and Sainsbury settled a penny off at 439p. Kwik-Save, the discount retailer, dipped 3 to 604p after Dairy Farm International, which holds a 29.4 per cent stake, said it had no present intention of bidding for the group. A standstill agreement, preventing Dairy Farm from increasing its 29.9 per cent stake, has been allowed to lapse. Asda holds its agm tomorrow, while William Morrison reports interims on Thursday. Sainsbury's interims are scheduled for November 2, Kwik-Save's on november 3 and Argyll's on November 30. Asda reports interims on December 16.</p>

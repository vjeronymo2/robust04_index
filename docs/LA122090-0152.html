			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: PARAMOUNT;  </P> <P> EX-COUNCILMAN HARKEMA APPOINTED TO FILL VACANCY  </P> <P> Former Councilman Henry Harkema, who lost a reelection bid in April, was  appointed Tuesday to fill the unexpired term of Vice Mayor Allen J. Parker, who  died Dec. 7 of a heart attack.  </P> <P> Harkema was selected by the three Paramount City Council members who attended  the meeting.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Esther Caldwell was absent.  </P> <P> In April, Harkema finished fourth among seven candidates running for three  seats. Harkema lost by 94 votes. Parker, who was serving his first term on the  five-member council, received the largest number of votes, 1,103. His term runs  through April, 1994. Parker, Mayor Manuel Guillen and Elvira Amaro won in the  April election.  </P> <P> Harkema, 79, a Paramount resident for 55 years, was on the council from 1986 to  1989. The city rotates the mayoral position annually, and Harkema was mayor  from 1988 to April, 1989.  </P> <P> He has been serving as chairman of the Planning Commission since his defeat. He  resigned that position Tuesday to serve as a councilman.  </P> <P> Guillen said that Harkema should be appointed to fill the vacancy because of  the number of votes he received in the last election. The other council  members, Amaro and Gerald Mulrooney, agreed.  </P> <P> By state law the city had 30 days to appoint a replacement or call an election.  City Manager William Holt told the council an election could not be held until  June, 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron] </F>   [Text] San Jose, Costa Rica -- Honduran President Carlos  Roberto Reina has stated here that the autonomy of the Honduran  Armed Forces and its commander will be reviewed shortly. He  also made reference to military personnel's participation in  private enterprises and said it is a very sensitive topic that  the Honduran Congress will have to debate. Those issues were  brought up at news conference by President Reina with  international media representatives attending the inaugural  ceremony of the new Costa Rican president.    Reina said civilian society had maintained a fearful  attitude  in the past and that this had allowed the military sector to  obtain too much power over society. As an example, he mentioned  that, according to the Constitution, the National Congress has  to establish the amount of troops the armed institution can  have. However, this has never been done. He pointed out that  one of the most negative measures implemented by the Armed  Forces was troop recruitment, since it forced only poor people  to serve in the institution and excluded the rich ones. A  positive change, said Reina, is that this system has been  abolished and that Congress has already approved a new method in  its first debate. The Armed Forces have also accepted the new  system.  <H5>  Military Firms </H5>   The Honduran president pointed out that Congress will have  to  decide whether military personnel can use their retirement funds  to invest in commercial activities. He believes they have a  right to do so. However, the problem is that they could use  their military influence to attain unfair competition vis-a-vis  the rest of the merchants. The National Congress will discuss  the issue and reach a final decision on it, Reina asserted.    President Reina emphasized that he has never wanted the  Honduran Armed Forces to be abolished, because he does not  believe it is in the country's best interest to do so. The  Honduran Armed Forces, he stated, have asserted that the Costa  Rican Army is bigger and has a bigger budget, but this is  something that would have to be studied. [sentence as published]  Reina said he did not want to argue over this assessment and  reiterated that it is what the Honduran Armed Forces officers  maintain.    The important thing now, he added, is to go from an absurd  and inhuman concept, such as the one on national security, to  the concept of guaranteeing individual security, which we will  establish because we require a force to ensure this. If a law  does not have a coercive mechanism, it stops being the law, he  said.    In Reina's opinion, the phase during which an abusive army  took command of the country has been totally transcended. He  said all the human rights violations in the country occurred  when military officers governed the country. He said he was one  of the Central American citizens who had strongly opposed those  governments and had even condemned governments formed by his own  party because he was determined to defend human rights.  <H5>  Armed Forces Commander </H5>   Reina was asked about the Armed Forces commander and his  relations with General Luis Alonso Discua, the current Honduran  Armed Forces commander. The president said he maintained good,  cordial relations with Discua.    The Honduran president said, however, that in his opinion a  mistake had been made in the 1957 Constitution in the section  that establishes the Armed Forces commander's appointment, which  also gives him too much autonomy in his actions. He added that  the then Constituent Assembly president had explained that such  provisions had been included in the Constitution because,  without them, they could not democratize the country.    Reina believes the figure of the Armed Forces commander, as  well as his autonomy should, perhaps, be reviewed. He emphasized  that his relations with Gen. Discua are very good and that he  has no complaints or reasons for distrust. The military  commander has reiterated this since he accepted subordination to  the president of the Republic.    President Reina mentioned that Gen. Discua's term ends next  year and his replacement will be selected from a list sent by  the Armed Forces to the National Congress. He added that, if  several constitutional amendments are made, the military  commander would be the defense minister and would be appointed  by the president of the Republic.    Anyway, he added, Honduras is in a straightforward process  to  achieve its full democratization and the reassessment of its  priorities, which is currently the basic position in America and  the world.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: From baseball hats to antiques - Maxwell's goods are sold: The sale at Sotheby's yesterday raised Pounds 430,000 THE MAX factor which drove the price of Robert Maxwell's shares down during his life finally began to work in reverse yesterday. The notoriety of his name drew a crowd that would not have shamed Oxford United to Sotheby's yesterday for the sale of 'The Complete Contents of the Chairman's Apartment at Maxwell House'. But it also drove up the price of rather mundane objects as those seeking Maxwell ikons and mementos engaged in brisk bidding. Some of the briskest was for lot 285, a collection of hats, comprising three baseball hats, one inscribed MCC and another GUVNOR, together with two trilby hats, a tweed and some coat hangers. 'Someone's being sold a pup there. The best hats are already gone. Those were just a few left over,' said a former Maxwell employee sardonically. Lot 285 sold for Pounds 1,100. There was considerable interest in the Maxwell office desk, chair and filing box. The modern black leather filing box with a brass plaque engraved CHAIRMAN had an estimated value of between Pounds 80 and Pounds 100. It fetched Pounds 1,300. The chairman's desk went for Pounds 1,200 and his perfectly ordinary black leather and chrome chair - though obviously strong - shot through its estimated price of between Pounds 100 and Pounds 200 to bring in another Pounds 2,000 for the administrators, Price Waterhouse. Robert Maxwell's very large double bed didn't seem to attract the same degree of interest. Mr Leslie Weller, the auctioneer, had to stoop to Pounds 500 to get things moving, despite the padded serpentine headboard upholstered in red and and blue sprigged boucle material, with oyster silk valance, box spring and mattress. It raised Pounds 1,400, only Pounds 200 more than 'A Large Sofa'. The sale engendered enormous interest with queues out into Bond Street as would-be bidders queued to register. The event drew eight sets of television cameras and as Mr Weller did his stuff quiet-voiced American reporters did their voice-overs talking of the elegant and the personal. For any business troubles there were also the shredding machines. A pair of conventional shredders went for Pounds 220 and a desktop version was bought for Pounds 400. The grander items, antiques bought in to give the Maxwell apartment a bit of class, sold well, but the unsentimental often didn't reach close to the Sotheby estimates. The top prices were paid for the mahogany three-pillar Maxwell Regency dining table and a pair of George IV silver wine coolers, each of which fetched Pounds 20,000. The most expensive painting was from the Maxwell drawing room - L'Indolence by Jean Baptiste Santerre, which went for Pounds 14,000. Sotheby's then add 10 per cent commission on to all prices. The total raised from Robert Maxwell's official London possessions was Pounds 430,000, excluding commission - still ahead of the Pounds 400,000 estimate.</p>

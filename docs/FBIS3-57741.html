			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 28 January HOMMIKULEHT, RAHVA HAAL, pp 1,2] </F>   [Text] Friday, January 28 -- Russia will agree to the  involvement of the international experts only after the removal  of the fuel rods from the Paldiski reactor, Foreign Ministry  Chancellor Alar Olljum announced after returning from an  international conference in Stockholm dedicated to the  dismantling of the reactors.    The removal of the fuel has been practically agreed upon and  it should be completed between April and July, he said. Russia  has decided to complete it without international aid, referring  to state secrets, he added.    The conference failed to agree on the guarantees of safety  during the removal and transportation of the fuel rods, Olljum  said, explaining that Russia's equipment either fails to meet  the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] requirements or  has been classified. Olljum added that Estonia may ban the  removal operations in case of doubts in its safety, but such  moves could be misunderstood. However, the process should be  monitored by Estonian and foreign experts, the chancellor said.    Most problems should be discussed at the next round of the  Estonian-Russian negotiations, Olljum told the press. But he  added that practically no progress had been made in the  preparations of the intended Estonian-Russian summit meeting.  The meeting would only be possible after the settling of the  deadline for the Russian troops withdrawal, Olljum said.</p>

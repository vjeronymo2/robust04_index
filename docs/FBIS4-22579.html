			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Opposition Must Become </F> Radical: This Will Help the Population To Make a Choice"]    [Text] Since the Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission for  elections of people's deputies still has not produced anything  other than the preliminary results of the first round of  parliamentary elections, practically all political forces in  Ukraine and journalists-sociologists are currently being  counting votes and making forecasts of the potential outcome of  the second round of voting. At a press conference in Kiev on 30  March Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the Ukraine coalition of  democratic forces (a total of 41 public and political  organizations), said that of the 49 new people's deputies  elected in the first round, 24 were nominated by democrats. From  what he said we learned that before the elections Ukraine  coordinated the list of candidates in 360 districts, and that  overall the democrats have been able to field candidates in 430  out of 450 districts. Of those who will run in the second round,  88 are candidates agreed upon by all representatives of the  Ukraine coalition, and 94 are candidates whom the democratic  forces nominated as a safeguard and whom Ukraine now will  support. The main criteria of democratic credentials of the  candidates, according to Levko Lukyanenko, is loyalty to the  idea of Ukrainian statehood, adherence to radical economic  reforms, active struggle against organized crime and ecological  crimes, as well as acknowledging the need for social protection  of low-income strata.    On the same day, a "roundtable" of leading sociologists,  political scientists, and journalists was held in Kiev; its  participants analyzed all available data on the candidates in  the 401 remaining districts and obtained the following picture:  of 801 candidates, 182 were nominated by democrats, 183--by  communists, about 30--by socialists, and 83--by the Peasants  Party. About 40 candidates were fielded by Leonid Kuchma and  Vladimir Grinev's Interregional Reform Bloc (IBR); 140  candidates were nominated by various bodies of authority and  administrative structures--both soviet and presidential (this is  the so-called "power party"). Another approximately 140  candidates were either nominated by commercial structures or  are, as they are called, "dark horses" behind whom there are no  visibly identifiable influence groups and about whom one can  only guess.    At the aforementioned press conference Levko Lukyanenko  said:  "These elections are a lesson of the past. In the future all  democratic forces must radicalize their position with respect to  the authorities and become a real opposition, which could serve  as a normal mechanism of cooperation in society."    This sort of statement coming from one of the most  influential leaders of the Ukrainian opposition and a similar  position on the part of People's Rukh and other  national-democratic organizations are very important for  Ukraine. They inspire hope for the removal of two main  shortcomings which to a large extent have defined the  development of political processes over the past two to three  years and have led to a protracted political crisis that  threatens to grow into a constitutional one. First, close  cooperation between the national-democratic and other opposition  with postcommunist structures have created among the people an  illusion of a "rejuvenated authority," which, in the  circumstances of the absence of any significant political and  economic reforms, resulted in the discrediting of the very idea  of an independent Ukraine. Second, uncertainty in the ranks of  the opposition created the absence of clear alternative  reference points in society and scenarios for future  development. This is especially true with respect to the  question of economic reform. For instance, the slow  "grabization" of state property by the nomenklatura and the  obstacles on the road to private entrepreneurship prevented the  creation of an attractive image of economic reforms, while  business in the public mind today is firmly associated with the  mafia or other manifestations of criminal activities. All these  circumstances have led to the spread in the society of  pessimism, apathy, and lack of confidence both in people's own  abilities and the ability of the state and its  political-economic institutions to change anything, which,  naturally, creates a nourishing environment for the activities  of various sorts of extremists offering the simplest forcible  means of solving problems, and populists promising everything to  everybody. It was during this time that the situation emerged  whereby official Kiev, which keeps society from resolving  conflicts by radical methods, became the center under attack  both from the left--from communists, and the right--the  national-radicals--while national-democrats and liberals of all  colorations altogether stopped playing any perceptible role and  influencing the pace of reforming society. The emergence of a  well-defined opposition, which proposes its way of development  based on faster reforms will help to structure both the  parliament and society along the main principle: either for fast  and productive reforms, or against them.    Meanwhile we have learned that many district  commissions--for  instance, in Kharkov Oblast--set the date for the second round  of voting as early as 3 April, which, on one hand, does not help  a more conscious choice, but on the other, accelerates Ukraine's  choice on many points.</p>

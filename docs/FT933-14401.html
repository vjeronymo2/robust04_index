			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Jobs: Mythical mice . . . and middle managers - Ambitious move to lay down national standards for a type of activity that may not exist READERS who are middle managers, and the rest of us on their behalf, should perhaps be grateful. For during this past half decade much analytic brainpower has been exerted on a question which, having an awful lot of work on their hands, they themselves are mostly too busy to think about. The question is what precisely is it that middle managers do for their pay? And the brainpower has been brought to bear by a body named the Management Charter Initiative which has the backing of 1,614 employing outfits, and the blessing of - albeit no longer automatic funding from - the British government. The employers, mostly large, consist of 850 businesses, 293 public-sector organisations and 471 others such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind. It would be wrong, of course, to suppose that the MCI body is the only one which has lately been pondering the aforesaid question. Many others have done likewise since the recession began, especially in the business sector. Alas their thinking has less often resulted in a definition of what middle managers do than in a decision that, whatever it may be, a lot of it is unnecessary. Hence wholesale firings trendily euphemised as 'de-layering'. The charter body, however, has remained above such logic-chopping. Not only has it pursued its inquiries into the various activities and other elements making up middle-management work, but it has published its conclusions in a tastefully designed and systematically organised book* of 134 pages. Given the wealth of research showing that reading is not something managers do unless obliged to, even the book's modest length seems unlikely to make it a best seller among people doing the work the authors analyse. So it's probably as well that, to judge by the tenor of the book, it is mainly intended not so much for middle managers as for their 'assessors', who are not necessarily the same kind of animal. For one thing, whereas mid-rank executives are bidding fair to become an endangered species, assessment is a growth industry. Indeed the MCI itself is allied to Britain's National Vocational Qualifications scheme set up to award certificates to people deemed to merit same, in parallel to the certificates awarded by the academic educational network. For another thing, although the job of assessors is to judge suitability for work in middle management, they apparently do not need to have worked as middle managers themselves. Hence their judgment can be entirely uncontaminated by narrow experience of what they are judging. Moreover, thanks to the charter body, they no longer have to rely on rules of thumb such as whether the person under assessment is related to the company chairman. They can be guided by the book's analysis. The idea underpinning it was evidently originated by American psychologist David McClelland in the 1970s. Its nub is that although any given job may be done in different ways by different people, those who are good at it display certain patterns of skilled behaviour that are essentially the same in all cases. Such patterns are known as 'competences'. They are exemplified by the three which Professor McClelland identified in a searching study of how successful diplomats in United States embassies overseas differed from people doing the same job badly. One thing the successful had in greater degree was political nous: 'the ability to figure out quickly who influences whom and what each person's political intrests are. Another was 'the ability to hear what people from a foreign culture are really meaning, and to predict how they will react.' The third he picked out was 'a strong belief in the underlying dignity and worth of others different from oneself, and the ability to maintain this positive outlook under stress.' As a measure of ability to do the diplomatic job well, tests of those three competences proved better than either standard aptitude and intelligence tests or paper qualifications. Even so, the tests were by no means a perfect measure. The professor made no pretence that just looking at the competences was sufficient to judge people's overall suitability for the work. That necessitated considering their performance in the job as a whole. The British charter body professes to agree. The evidence used in assessment, the book declares, must '. . . describe the activities required by the occupational role as a whole rather than a fragmented and over-detailed list of tasks.' It then serenely proceeds to list 36 'elements of competence', 258 'performance criteria', and 351 'range indicators' - some of which admittedly overlap from element to element - together with what the MCI evidently regards as a less than complete inventory of 439 sorts of evidence to be evaluated. While that tally might seem fulsome compared with David McClelland's three competences, there's a point to be remembered. He focused on a specific type of job done in a specific setting. The MCI is spreading its web across middle management in general, regardless of economic sector let alone kind of organisation. Whether such a universal activity really exists, however, is another question. True, a well defined entity called 'middle' management can be found on notional organisation charts: it's the chunk of the pyramid just below 'senior' management. But does any such entity exist in the actual workplace as distinct from purely on paper? While the MCI evidently thinks so, numerous authorities on management would disagree. One who'd be apt to do so, for example, is Harvard Business School's Professor John Kotter. A second is Bath University's Professor of Management Iain Mangham, who waxes eloquent on the daftness of the myth that the abilities of real-life managers are somehow assembled from a kit of standard competences, as one might construct Mickey Mouses out of Lego blocks. Besides, the charter body's performance criteria are not entirely self-consistent. Take for example those on leading meetings. One is that the people invited to attend should be 'appropriate to the context and the purpose of the meeting' Another - to which the assessor is presumably required to give equal weight - is that 'unhelpful arguments and digressions' should be effectively discouraged. Since people who indulge in such digressions can hardly be appropriate to the meeting, surely any leader needing to take the discouraging action must be marked down for having invited them in the first place. On the other hand, if they aren't invited, the leader must lose the ordained mark for deterring digressions because none will arise. Such details aside, however, the MCI is certainly right in claiming that it has taken a positive step towards establishing standards of management work. The only trouble is that even positive steps can be dangerous when taken on shaky ground. So before proceeding any farther in its grand bureaucratic endeavour, the charter body should perhaps remember James Thurber's maxim: 'One can just as well fall flat on one's face as lean over too far backwards.' *Middle Management Standards, MCI, London WC1B 5BZ.

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Growing confidence raises hopes of end to recession BRITAIN'S companies and consumers are increasingly confident, raising hopes that the recession could be coming to an end. Independent surveys published yesterday indicated that more than half UK companies expect higher orders and sales in the current quarter and that consumers increased their spending slightly in the first three months of this year. The government also published figures for February that provided the first signs of increased demand for consumer credit since last August. The latest quarterly business expectations survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, found that optimism among companies has returned to levels last seen in the final quarter of 1989. Although the employment outlook remains weak, it found a sharp increase in optimism about export prospects and a marked improvement in business confidence in London and the south-east in spite of uncertainties triggered by the election campaign. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet report showed all business sectors, except construction, expect improvements in sales, orders and exports. According to Mr Philip Mellor, the company's marketing manager, its results represented 'a strong leading indicator of an economic turnaround'. Yesterday's quarterly survey of regional consumer sentiment from Gallup and Business Strategies Ltd, an economic consultancy, pointed to a slow recovery in consumer confidence and an 0.3 per cent rise in total consumer spending in the first three months of this year compared with last year's final quarter. This finding gained some support from Central Statistical Office figures, which showed net credit advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and through banks' credit cards increased by Pounds 13m in February. City analysts, however, were reluctant to read too much into yesterday's crop of upbeat economic indicators. The surveys from Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Gallup and Business Strategies have yet to establish clear track records while yesterday's news that car sales fell sharply in March also encouraged caution. But the indicators 'could be straws in the wind', commented Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist of Shearson Lehman, the securities company. He noted that yesterday's news followed other positive pointers for the economy, such as last week's report from the Institute of Purchasing and Supply showing a sharp rise in its purchasing managers' index last month. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey, conducted between March 11 and 27, contained no hint that the election campaign and Labour's consistent narrow lead in the polls had a negative impact on business sentiment.

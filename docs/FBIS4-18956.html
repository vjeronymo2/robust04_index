			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Constitution </F> Enshrines Unity Through Violence"]    [Excerpt] San Sebastian -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV)  Chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated in a speech delivered during the  Aberri Eguna [Basque Fatherland Day] celebrations that his party  will not confine its political demands to the autonomy statute,  that the PNV claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories,  and that the Basque Country will "gradually" achieve a  "cultural, economic, and ultimately political unity in Europe,"  as well as asserting that the Constitution entrusts the defense  of Spain's unity to the Army and violence.    The PNV, as it has done for the past few years, organized  two  different political meetings on the occasion of Aberri Eguna --  one in Guipuzcoa in the morning and the second in Bilbao in the  afternoon. Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza,  PNV spokesman Joseba Egibar, and candidate in the European  elections Josu Jon Imaz spoke at the first meeting, in Azpeitia.  Aberri Eguna was held this year under the watchword "Let's  improve the Basque Country."  <H5>  Ability To Decide </H5>   In statements made both before the political meeting and  during his speech before PNV members, the PNV leader was highly  critical of the Socialists. "Since the agreements in Madrid  began, they have forgotten everything; they have forgotten the  right of self-determination. They have never been Basque  nationalists. The ministers, such as Mr. Eguiagaray, speak of  the nation's government. Clearly, they believe in another  nation, in another fatherland."    Arzalluz stated that the PNV "wants the Basque people to  have  the ability to determine their destiny: If they want it to be  with Spain, then with Spain; if they want it to be with Europe,  then with Europe; and if they want it to be on their own, then  on their own," because "a nation that wishes to hold people down  through coercion will be not a nation but a prison." "Let them  not come and tell us," he added "that anything can be upheld  without violence, because then it turns out that when we uphold  something that comes from our own freedom, everybody attacks  us." The PNV leader added that the PNV does not have recourse  to violence: "We simply demand our right to think, to feel, and  to secure democratically everything that we see fit."    Xabier Arzalluz stated that the political activity of the  PNV, which claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, is  not confined to the statute. "While the statute is important,  we will not stop there," he stated. "They talk a great deal  about ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty], they have Article 8 of  the Constitution, specifically designed for reds and  separatists, in which they entrust the unity of the fatherland,  of their idea of a territorial fatherland, to the Army, weapons,  and violence." According to Arzalluz, when the PNV upholds "what  comes from what we want and our own freedom, everybody attacks  us, because they have another fatherland." [passage omitted]</p>

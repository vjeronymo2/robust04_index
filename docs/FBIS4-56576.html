			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our reporter Edner Jean reports on the session  held on 4 May in the Chamber of Deputies:    [Begin Jean recording] This session was held at a time when  it was basically unexpected. It was only at 1900 GMT that the  office of the Chamber was able to muster the necessary working  quorum. Forty-two deputies from the Alliance, plus the  socialists, participated together to open the session, BP-FNCD  [Parliamentary Bloc of the National Front for Change and  Democracy] having decided to return to its old empty-seat policy.    Deputy Vital Pierre Francois then proposed reducing the  quorum to 39 deputies, which would have relaunched the  controversy on the status of those elected on 18 January. After  some thorny discussions, the assembly agreed that those 20  contested deputies voluntarily refrained from participating  since the signing of the New York pact. The concession, however,  was made to list their names on the roll. Clearly, the office of  the Chamber of Deputies keeps those contested deputies as a  spare solution, which could be useful if and when necessary.    Then the key point of this session was addressed, the reason  for which the assembly was convened: the development of the  political situation and the means of filling the governmental  vacuum. The socialists presented their analysis of the  situation. According to them, Article 148 is presently  inapplicable without the approval of President Aristide. Article  149 is out of date and Article 111 is maladapted. Duly Brutus,  spokesman for the socialist bloc, again recommended political  compromise and sacrifice as a solution to the crisis. He asked  President Monde to immediately consult with General Cedras for  the purpose of convincing the Army's commander in chief that he  should make the gesture that the international community is  expecting of him, meaning to resign. This proposal raised a stir  in the room. [passage omitted]    Deputy Joseph Lambert, one of the leading lights of the  Alliance, proposed a resolution bill inspired by Article 111 of  the Constitution, which will give the National Assembly the  right to nominate an ad hoc prime minister until President  Aristide decides to appoint another head of government. [passage  omitted]    In reaction to the U.S. threat of military intervention as a  solution to the crisis, Deputy Lambert proposed a second  resolution bill, declaring the Legislative Palace the place of  high resistance against foreign military intervention. This bill  added that President Aristide is mandated to consult with the  Haitian Armed Forces for necessary measures to safeguard the  territory's integrity. If not, he will be accountable for this  violation of our national sovereignty. These two bills were not  voted on, however, because the quorum was invalidated. President  Frantz Robert Monde planned another meeting for this Thursday.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Staff cover proves a liability: Rising insurance costs for UK business British businesses increasingly face an uphill task in finding insurance cover for employees who suffer accidents or become ill through their work. Employers' liability insurance, which is compulsory for UK companies, has already become much more expensive in the past three years. Next year the situation could get worse if, as expected, insurers reduce the scope of cover offered in typical policies, because of moves by their own reinsurance companies to restrict protection. According to the UK risk managers association, Airmic, the issue ranks alongside the environment and terrorism as among the most pressing facing insurance buyers. 'It is a problem area,' says Alan Fleming, executive director of Airmic. He estimates that employers' liability insurance can amount to 40 per cent of overall insurance costs for some companies. Premium rates for manual workers have risen by an average of at least 20 to 30 per cent annually in recent years, with rates rising in some cases from perhaps 0.2 per cent to between 5 per cent and 8 per cent of payroll. The more serious threat is that employers face even steeper increases for their white collar workers; rates are rising from 0.01 per cent to as much as 0.3 per cent of payroll. The background to all this is a rise in claims costs, which reflects a number of political and social trends. New official health and safety requirements and the greater willingness of workers, especially when organised in trade unions, to claim damages in the courts have led to a surge in disease claims. These now account for between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the Pounds 500m paid each year in employers' liability claims by UK insurance companies, compared to less than 20 per cent 10 years ago. The picture is expected to deteriorate further as claims from victims of new conditions - such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) and stress - come to the courts. A recent award of Pounds 79,000 in an RSI case involving a former Inland Revenue typist is likely to encourage trade unions which are backing action by other injured workers and has highlighted what James Hopper, employers' liability specialist with Sedgwick, the insurance broker, recently qualified as a 'potential epidemic'. The biggest headache of all could be finding an insurer in the first place. A number of companies have withdrawn from the market and no longer offer 'standalone' policies - and more are likely to follow suit. Reinsurers have become concerned about the scale of potential losses following claims stemming from the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in 1988. They have consequently begun to curb the traditionally unlimited cover they offer insurance companies. Insurers now expect reinsurers to limit cover to between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m per occurrence, when they renew their annual policies for 1995. This means insurers may have to introduce changes into their own contracts as they come up for renewal later this year. What can companies do? Derek Howie, assistant liability manager for Eagle Star, the BAT Industries subsidiary, predicts the emergence of a new 'excess of loss' market where corporate buyers will be able to obtain cover above the limits made available from their traditional insurers. But risk managers, brokers and insurers expect the new combination of circumstances to lead to greater interest in self-insurance, with many buyers increasing the amount of risk they leave uninsured or self-insured. Already many larger UK companies cover all claims under a certain level  - with a limit of Pounds 100,000 typical for some large companies. 'Basically, it can allow cost savings. Companies are managing predictable claims of a modest size themselves rather than handing over responsibility to insurance companies,' says John Stoker, a consultant who works with Tillinghast, the actuaries and management consultants. Self-insurance can help cut legal bills, which add thousands of pounds to costs. The self-insurance option is frequently accompanied by a more pro-active approach to claims management. Companies can also reduce their employers' liability costs by 'recognising when people have a real claim and doing everything they can to settle it quickly,' explains Stoker. Trying to resist all claims is like 'pushing water uphill', he comments. Another option is to create a captive company, a specially created subsidiary dedicated to insuring the risks of the parent and its subsidiaries. Forming a captive insurance company can be expensive, partly because captive managers must arrange for policies to be 'fronted' by an insurance company licensed by the Department of Trade and Industry. According to Hopper, this guarantee can cost between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the premium paid. Claims handling charges also add to the expense. Howie at Eagle Star points out that insurers can provide valuable experience in advising employers on the complex legal issues surrounding some claims. Even so, self-insurance can still be an attractive option for many buyers, especially larger companies. 'In the short term there is not a lot of money going out,' explains Hopper. Above all, the shrinkage in insurance cover will encourage companies to find ways of controlling risk through improvements in management and safety procedures. Liz Taylor, risk manager of Harrisons and Crosfield, the conglomerate, and a former Airmic president, recommends adoption of 'the best possible standards of health and safety'. The point is that if employers are unable to buy financial protection for loss at an acceptable price, they may be forced to step up actions to prevent losses in the first place.</p>

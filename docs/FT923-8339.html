			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bass sells another 170 pubs BASS has sold 170 pubs to Marr Taverns, a London-based independent pub company headed by Mr Ron Kirk, former managing director of Mansfield Brewery. The deal, which includes pubs in London, south-east England and South Wales, almost completes Bass's programme of 2,740 pub disposals to comply with the government's beer orders by November 1. Since July 1989, it has sold 2,600 pubs and has agreed terms on more than another 100. 'Interest in the remaining pubs to be sold is high and we are confident of reaching the target before the deadline,' said Mr John Denning, Bass Taverns property director.</p>

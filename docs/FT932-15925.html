			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Leading Article: Anglo-German capitalism The dominance of the banks in the capital markets of continental Europe has always militated against the adoption of Anglo-Saxon financial habits such as hostile takeovers and high pay-out ratios. Yet the resistance is finally eroding in Europe's pre-eminent bank-based system, Germany. The decision by Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, to adopt US accounting and disclosure requirements to obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange is symptomatic. As the capital markets become global, the Anglo-Saxon model is tending, for better or worse, to prevail. Well-known German companies such as Hoesch in steel and Feldmuhle in packaging have recently fallen victim to predators. Shareholder activism, meantime, has been breaking out at the annual general meetings of corporate giants like Siemens and Daimler. Interestingly, Daimler recently decided to unwind a defensive arrangement whereby 25 per cent of its capital was held in a special holding company. Nor is it just domestic shareholders who have been complaining about restrictive voting arrangements. A representative of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) shook the management of the conglomerate RWE last year by denouncing the company's restricted voting rights at the annual general meeting. Shareholder activism The influence of big pension funds like Calpers is not to be under-estimated. Around 40 per cent of the tradeable shares of German companies is now in foreign hands. German management could afford to ignore foreign owners in the 1980s when companies were cash-rich. But with the domestic economy contracting and profits under severe pressure, access to international capital suddenly becomes important, especially in a system with few funded pension schemes, where private investors prefer bonds. Daimler-Benz is a case in point. After its acquisition spree in the 1980s it had a heavyweight rights issue in 1989. Over the past year it has wanted to raise a further D-Mark 2bn (Pounds 820m) against a difficult market background. Yet its diversification has prompted criticism and profits are forecast to fall for the second year running. Disclosure could help keep the door open to that equity issue. Improving disclosure Even without any need to satisfy the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the US Securities Exchange Commission, many German companies have been improving disclosure and adopting more generous dividend policies. The trend will continue. Fiscal pressures resulting from unification will cause Germany's privatisation programme to accelerate; foreign investors will be needed to help maximise the government's returns. The ageing of the population could also result in more of the pensions burden being transferred from the state to funded private pension schemes. That, too, would create increased demand for equities. If the general trend towards a more open capital market ultimately tightens accountability, it may be no bad thing. For all its merits, the German system of corporate governance has been less effective than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent in unravelling the damage caused by promiscuous conglomeration. Supervisory boards have often been slow to push management into focusing on problems in the core business. That said, there are clear risks in going down the Anglo-Saxon route. Much of the success of German industry has been based precisely on harmonious relations between management and workers within the company, and close relationships outside, with banks, suppliers, government and community. It would be ironic if the Germans were to adopt an Anglo-Saxon-style market in corporate control just as US investors are discovering the joys of 'relationship investing', whereby institutional shareholders make a long-term commitment to a given company and engage in a continuing dialogue with the board. That, however, is unlikely. The innate conservatism of the German financial system militates against rapid change, as does the powerful vested interest of the banks - which is why it is conceivable that Germany will end up with the best of both worlds.</p>

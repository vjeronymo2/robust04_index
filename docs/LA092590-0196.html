			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> SURVIVING IN THE '90S;  </P> <P> NEW JOBS EVOLVING TO HELP CLEAN UP THE PLANET;  </P> <P> UP TO $500 BILLION MAY BE SPENT TO CORRECT ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN COMING  DECADES. THE EFFORT WILL CREATE BOTH TECHNICAL AND BLUE-COLLAR POSITIONS.  </P> <P> When Sharyn D. Nappi gets the call to hunt up a certified industrial hygienist,  she knows it's a tough assignment.  </P> <P> There are perhaps 4,500 such environmental specialists in the world -- and all  likely to be happily employed.  </P> <P> "And when someone says, 'I need a CIH for Timbuktu,' good luck," Nappi laughs.  Then she bluntly advises her client, "You're going to have to pay them whatever  you have to."  </P> <P> Nappi is an environmental headhunter, vice president of Jeffrey B. Brant Co.,  an executive search firm with offices in El Toro and Woodland Hills. She stalks  the restless environmental engineer, the newly certified solid-waste manager,  the ambitious recycling specialist and other valuable personnel in the crusade  to clean up the nation. And she can't find candidates fast enough.  </P> <P> Particularly in the past few years, opportunities in environmental work have  been tremendous, notes Nappi. And they only seem to grow, as the industry  begins to look not only at cleaning up but at preventing future messes.  </P> <P> "The thrust for the future," Nappi said, "will be going in and assessing a  potential situation and taking precautions to prevent it from happening."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, most of the current jobs are in businesses created literally by  force of law.  </P> <P> Since passage of the 1970 federal Clean Air Act, 1972 Clean Water Act and the  later Superfund laws, jobs have bloomed not so much in traditional conservation  work -- such as wildlife management -- but in entirely new fields.  </P> <P> "I have never had a request for a park ranger," said Rocco Catena, vice  president and industry specialist with Purcell Group, a Los Angeles-based  executive recruiter. "The greatest demand in the environmental field right now  is for technically trained people."  </P> <P> These are often the technical staff on cleanup teams, in regulation-driven  industries that are likely to just keep growing over the next couple of  decades.  </P> <P> For instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under Superfund laws  designed to remove or stabilize hazardous waste around the country, has already  identified more than 1,200 sites and expects to add 900 to the list. Each  cleanup is likely to average $25 million and take an average of eight to nine  years. At the moment, 3,000 EPA employees alone are working on Superfund  projects.  </P> <P> And this is just part of a vast environmental public works project that could  cost as much as $500 billion over the next several decades, according to a 1989  report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.  </P> <P> More environmental work will come in such new fields as recycling. In  California, for instance, 25% less trash will be allowed in landfills by 1995,  50% by the year 2000. And nationally, the EPA target is 25% less in the next  two years. This is spawning a huge new field in waste handling and recycling,  which offers not only work for the technically sophisticated, but also for the  manual laborer.  </P> <P> "I see a whole range of needs," said Robert H. Collins, president of Mine  Reclamation Corp., which is at the stage of gathering permits for a recycling  and landfill project at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County.  </P> <P> "People who operate heavy equipment or are in materials handling" will be  needed, Collins said. "The recycling industry is going to be heavy on  blue-collar workers initially because the way you separate (recyclable  materials) is by hand. But there will be jobs in human relations, accounting --  there's a whole new industry being built up."  </P> <P> Collins sees opportunity in recycling and waste management for refugees from  the aerospace industry, in particular.  </P> <P> "We're looking for bright young people who have experience in related fields,"  Collins said, "because there is (a shortage of workers with) direct experience.  . . . Normally, the aerospace industry has enough technical background, and  that's what you need -- plus ingenuity."  </P> <P> Indeed, people in other lines of work have already begun to specialize in  environmental concerns. These include accountants, personnel managers,  assessors, heavy equipment operators and, of course, attorneys.  </P> <P> "There simply aren't enough environmental attorneys to go around," noted the  San Diego-based Environmental Business Journal.  </P> <P> "The hottest commodity in the legal job market is the environmental lawyer,"  agreed Joel Moskowitz, a partner specializing in environmental law with Gibson,  Dunn &amp; Crutcher in Los Angeles. "The environmental lawyer has a lot to do,  both in negotiating with government agencies and in bringing suits" to settle  liabilities among various parties in contested cleanups.  </P> <P> Moskowitz recalls that demand for environmental specialists was already high  even in the mid-1980s, when he was head of California's Toxic Substances  Control Program, an umbrella organization directing the state's hazardous waste  and toxic cleanup efforts. At the same time that Gov. George Deukmejian was  cutting the state work force and had frozen hiring, he was increasing state  jobs in toxic-waste cleanup by 50% a year, Moskowitz said.  </P> <P> Today, technical specialties once considered exotic are bread-and-butter  careers in the environmental field.  </P> <P> For instance, the certified industrial hygienist that Nappi has trouble finding  is typically responsible for the control of occupational health hazards ranging  from exposure to chemical agents to physical nuisances such as noise, vibration  and radiation.  </P> <P> Geologists, hydrologists, civil engineers and traditional soil scientists are  now working alongside environmental biologists, nuclear engineers, health  physicists, risk-management specialists, and sales and marketing people with  environmental experience -- with salaries in the area of $35,000 to $75,000 a  year.  </P> <P> Experience is one of the best bargaining chips an environmental specialist can  bring to the job search.  </P> <P> Boston-based CEIP Fund Inc. (formerly the Center for Environmental Intern  Programs) offers one way to break in. CEIP considers itself the nation's  biggest on-the-job trainer for environmental work. In the past 18 years, it has  placed more than 4,000 students and recent college graduates in short-term  professional positions in environmental work.  </P> <P> Currently, this means positions with industry, consultants, environmental  organizations or government agencies. The average job lasts five months, and  median salaries are more than $375 a week.  </P> <P> CEIP Fund also has produced, through nonprofit Island Press (and on acid-free,  recycled paper, naturally), a detailed, anecdotal "Complete Guide to  Environmental Careers," a book aimed at "the next generation of environmental  professionals."  </P> <P> That next generation will have not only the option of a career in a growing  industry, but job satisfaction, said Kevin Doyle, national director of programs  for CEIP.  </P> <P> "You can feel good about what you're doing," he said. "It's challenging, and  you run into other people who are really fascinating -- by virtue of the fact  that they have also chosen to devote their lives to environmental protection.  And whether they choose to work for a major corporation or the Sierra Club, the  same spirit moves them."  </P></p>

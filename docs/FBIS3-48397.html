			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chong In-hwa] </F>   [Text] In the event that separated family members and  businessmen of the ROK want to contact North Korean residents or  to visit North Korea, the government plans to allow only those  who completed a course of education on reunification in the  educational institute under the National Unification Board  [NUB]. Having formulated this policy on 22 January, the NUB is  going to discuss concrete curricula in the course of education  and to implement them from April at the earliest. For those who  visited North Korea in the past in connection with North-South  dialogue including high-level talks and sports talks, the Agency  for National Security Planning conducted prior education.  However, no education was conducted in advance for separated  family members and businessmen who wanted to contact North  Korean residents in a third country.    According to the new policy, the separated family members  and  businessmen who want to visit North Korea or to meet their  relatives and friends living in North Korea will be required to  attach to the request for visit to North Korea a statement on  personal background, the exit report and permit, North Korean  side's memorandum on insurance of personal safety, and a  certificate of completion of education by the NUB.</p>

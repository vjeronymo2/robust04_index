			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cheng Te-lin (6774 1795 2651): "CPC is Going to Improve </F> Equipment of Its Navy and Air Force"]    [Text] According to well-informed sources, on 5 January,  accompanied by Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong; Defense Minister  Chi Haotian; Wu Bangguo, secretary of the party committee of the  Nanjing Military Region; the veteran general Li Desheng; and Li  Jiejun, director of the General Office of the Central Military  Commission, a certain CPC elder paid a call at the Command Base  of the Donghai Fleet at the mouth of the Wusong River, Shanghai  to inspect a nuclear-powered missile submarine which was  officially put into service that day. According to informed  sources, it is China's 11th nuclear-powered missile submarine  with 8,000 tonnes displacement and is an improved model  Xia-class nuclear-powered missile-launching submarine. The  submarine was originally scheduled to be launched on 1 January,  but in order for the CPC elder to inspect it, it was not  officially put into service for the Donghai Fleet until 5  January.  <H5>  China is Capable of Returning a Nuclear Attack </H5>   The informed sources added: After meeting with  representatives of the navy's nuclear submarine, missile  destroyers, and airborne troops, the elder gave a speech: "I am  very glad today. As a citizen, an old party member, and a  veteran, I express gratitude to our people's Army and to our  defense and scientific and technological experts! During the  hard times in the 1960's, we exploded the atomic bomb, breaking  through the nuclear monopoly and nuclear threat of the major  powers. In the turbulent years of the 1970's, we upgraded  nuclear weapons. This demonstrated that China was capable of  developing and improving nuclear weapons and defending itself.  In the years of reform and opening up which centered on  economic development during the 1980's, we developed  intercontinental missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, and  others things, by which we declared to the world that China is  capable of returning a fatal blow to any aggressor that launches  a nuclear attack. In the years between 1990's and the year  2000, depending mainly on our own capability, we must change the  equipment of the navy and the air force quite considerably.  This is the policy of the central authorities.  <H5>  Hegemony Fears China's Development </H5>   This elder continued: Hegemony and power politics and their  followers themselves do not want to reduce their armaments or  totally ban and destroy their nuclear weapons, and yet they are  against and fear China's developing a modernized military  capability. Isn't this overbearing! Now that they see that  China is developing a little quicker and that its national  strength is a little bigger, they criticize, fan feelings, and  create the theory that China is going to threaten its neighbors.  This has always been a means used by power politics and  anti-Chinese and anti-communist political forces. The Chinese  Government solemnly declares that it will not be militarily  aligned and will not interfere and intervene in the internal  affairs of another country and that it insists on resolving  differences, disputes, and problems left over from history  between nations by peaceful and fair ways of negotiation which  is to seek common ground while reserving differences. China  will never pursue hegemony in the international arena nor will  it pursue special privileges in a region as a "small  hegemonist." China maintains that all countries are equal  despite their size and strength. Therefore, China did not, does  not, and will never accept interference in China's sovereignty  and internal affairs of hegemony and power politics or their  ordering about; nor will it be daunted by their political  challenges such as economic sanctions, unilaterally dishonoring  communiques or joint declarations between nations, or rejecting  agreements between the governments of nations. Rather, what they  are doing will help the entire Army and people across the  country to be united more closely, to take their own way more  determinedly, and to have a more better understanding that only  when the country is unified and strong and has the initiative in  its hands can it really enjoy equality, freedom, and democracy.    The elder's speech, which lasted nearly 20 minutes, won  eight  rounds of warm and long applause.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jasjit Singh: "South Asian Nuclear Scene; Time </F> for Local Initiative"]    [Text] The issue of multilateral dialogue on security (or  non-proliferation, as the United States may prefer)  unfortunately seems to have been compounded by the U.S. attempts  to hustling India, especially by the London talks. It is all the  more unfortunate because this has happened just before the Prime  Minister's visit to the United States. But there is a need to  take a dispassionate view of the questions involved.    The United States has been seeking a multilateral dialogue  since 1991 to discuss non-proliferation in South Asia. Our  problem has been that the South Asian framework simply does not  address the problems of nuclear security in our case. But the  five-nation dialogue was doomed from the day Pakistan  arbitrarily derailed the process by defining the agenda in terms  of seeking to establish South Asia as a nuclear weapon-free  zone. U.S. insistence since then to hold a five-nation dialogue  has only tended to harden attitudes in India against any  multilateral dialogue on non-proliferation issues.    The United States has been clearly articulating its  non-proliferation objectives: it seeks to cap, reduce and  eliminate nuclear capabilities in South Asia--in other words,  create a nuclear weapon-free zone. This is the reason why even  later variations of the five-nation dialogue continue to be  deeply suspect in Indian eyes. The United States has been saying  that it has no fixed agenda, but the picture at the end of the  road has been clearly defined. It claims that the composition  could be decided through preparatory discussions, but it seems  to have strong reservations about a composition that does not  stack up in favour of its goals. And the greater the U.S.  pressure, the greater the Indian resistance not to give in,  especially when the fundamental and vital national strategic  interests of India are at stake.  <H5>  Basic Goals </H5>   It is ironic that the basic goals of the two countries lie  along parallel lines, displaced in time and scope. Our vital  interests can be addressed only by a non-proliferation policy  that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons from the world,  while the United States wants to apply disarmament only to South  Asia. We have believed that the process could be preceded by  nuclear freeze and reduction in a global framework; and that  this cannot be achieved in a local framework. The problem is  that the U.S. aims regarding nonproliferation in South Asia, and  our vital strategic interests have become increasingly  irreconcilable.    The bilateral dialogues were meant to improve mutual  understanding of strategic concerns. Some common ground has been  found in terms of starting negotiations for a global ban on  production of fissile material for weapon purposes, and more can  be found in working for the comprehensive test-ban treaty. These  are important building blocks for the long-term goals. But these  should not be jeopardised by narrow partisan aims. The question  remains whether there is any scope for a multilateral dialogue.  To answer this we must look at the realities dispassionately.    The very term `cap' assumes that the United States considers  the situation in South Asia as that representing a  post-proliferation stage. Its willingness to waive its own laws  against clandestine weapon programmes only confirms that it  accepts Pakistan's nuclear weapon status. It is, therefore, in  the interest of Indians and Pakistanis, more than anyone else,  to reduce the risks associated with ambiguous nuclear  capabilities. This indeed is the rationale for the Indian  proposals to Pakistan for no-first-use of nuclear capabilities,  non-attack on population centres.  <H5>  More Steps </H5>   Many more steps down that road are possible if Pakistan is  willing to seek greater stability and reduced risks. The United  States prepared its own policies on seeking strategic stability,  and could contribute constructively by agreeing to multilateral  agreements that aim for strategic stability in Southern Asia.  People like Mr Paul Nitze are arguing about the lack of utility  and futility of U.S. nuclear responses in future scenarios.  Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) have their  greatest potential in a bilateral framework, but they also lend  themselves to multilateral discussions and agreements, and would  go a long way in achieving perhaps more than arms control  measures because they circumscribe the nuclear factors. There  are greater payoffs in a multilateral dialogue on peace,  co-operation and security, rather than starting with  non-proliferation measures on the agenda in a post-proliferation  world. At the same time, the framework will have to be Asian  rather than that of South Asia.    We need to be sensitive to the intrinsic risks associated  with ambiguous nuclear weapon programmes; and hence the need for  seeking stability. The scope for bilateral dialogue with  Pakistan on nuclear issues is limited to CSBMs only, and going  beyond that would be counter-productive, besides according  legitimacy to a clandestine programme. The Pakistani leadership  has already been emphasising that its nuclear programme is  capped/frozen at 1989-90 level. This is credible since no real  advantage would accrue to Pakistan in going beyond the dozen or  so weapon capability it has acquired; and the additional costs  would be infructuous.    For India, keeping the nuclear option open in a recessed  deterrence posture is adequate. Even in the worse case scenario,  the maximum capability that India would ever need is that of  minimum deterrence. There is, thus, virtually no risk of an  open-ended nuclear arms race in the sub-continent. As regards  the uncertainty about who has the finger on the nuclear button  in Pakistan, General Aslam Beg has recently confirmed that a  national command authority for nuclear deterrence exists.  <H5>  Capping Strategy </H5>   The other risk is that of nuclear weapon technology being  passed on to another state by Pakistan. This problem cannot be  resolved by the capping strategy. On the other hand,  notwithstanding irresponsible and fictional accounts (like  Critical Mass), it would be difficult to argue that  the present situation is unstable as long as Pakistanis believe  that their nuclear weapons provide them a much-needed sense of  security.    At the same time, there is a need for strengthening regional  peace and security. This can be enhanced by a multilateral  dialogue in an Asian forum for peace. Kazakhstan has already  proposed a conference on confidence-building and peace in Asia,  and China has supported the idea. Iran has been emphasising the  need for regional solutions through regional co-operation. The  time is, therefore, ripe for providing the necessary impetus to  a multilateral dialogue among the states of Asia on peace and  co-operation to translate the concept of Panchsheel  into a new co-operative security framework under the principle  of "mutual and equal security."    Such a multilateral dialogue need not be a substitute for,  or  in contradiction of, any multilateral dialogue sought by the  United States. But it would complement the fundamental goal of  seeking an improved environment through better political  relations and marginalise a nuclear weapon-based approach to  inter-state relations and national security. The United States  would need to re-think its policy approaches, especially with  regard to what it seeks in a multilateral dialogue.  Non-proliferation, like disarmament, is the means to the larger  end of ensuring peace and security; and it should not be  interpreted as an end in itself and sought for its own sake.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that if Israel  does not make peace with Syria, a war could break out in three  to seven years. Rabin reaffirmed that a referendum would be  held to decide any serious territorial concessions on the Golan,  but, Rabin added, peace without concessions is impossible. The  prime minister was addressing the annual conference of the Qeren  Hayesod, the United Israel Appeal, in Jerusalem.    [Begin Rabin recording] Those who tell you that we can  achieve peace just for peace, peace without all Golan Heights,  lie to you. If they could, why they didn't succeed to achieve 1  per mill of the area of the Sinai? How can they mitigate that  for peace with Egypt you have to return till the last square  inch and to say that vis-a-vis Syria, we can achieve peace just  for peace? Total nonsense, total nonsense! Whoever would like  to say that he is for all the Golan Heights, he has to prepare  for war three, five years, or seven years from now or ten years  from now.    We tried to achieve compromise. We have not yet succeeded.  I hope that the visit of King Husayn in the United States will  bring about the resumption of the talks -- not in Washington,  here, in the area. I don't need any more the Madrid peace  conference but as a background. I need now bilateral talks with  every Arab partner. [end recording]    [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 23 June on page  1  carries a similar report on Rabin's address by Batsheva Tsur and  news agencies. The report quotes Rabin as saying that "Iraq  tried to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is trying to do this.  Against whom, if not against Israel?"    ["Rabin said, `There is consensus in Israel about keeping  Gush 'Etzyon, Ma'ale Adumim and the Jordan Valley under Israeli  control for security and not political reasons,' and added that  Jerusalem must remain united forever as Israel's capital."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 23 June  carries a report by Esti Perez about an impromptu news  conference held by Rabin at the end of his address. In a  recorded passage, Rabin says: "I hope very much that what was  agreed in the trilateral U.S.- Israel-Jordan meeting in  Washington on economic issues and in the bilateral contacts will  be pursued in July in our region, which would be much simpler  than traveling to Washington."    [Referring to a meeting with King Husayn, Rabin says: "The  reported possibility of a public meeting exists. I think that  in addition to such a meeting, it is very important to make  progress in the negotiations on the components that will  ultimately enable the signing of a peace treaty between Israel  and Jordan."    [Perez adds that the prime minister disclosed that he is  scheduled to meet with Palestinian elements next Monday to  discuss what he described as outstanding issues. In a recorded  passage, Rabin says: "Many issues were left pending. For  example, the international passages are not yet operating in  accordance with the agreement and the question of the safe  passages and civilian issues remain unresolved."]</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Keen bidding for rare Meissen: Saleroom A COLLECTION of early and mid-18th-century Meissen porcelain found exceptional prices at Christie's in London yesterday. The collection, by Dr and Mrs Korthaus between the late 1940s and 1968, was of consistently high quality and contained several rarities. Keen bidding forced a top price of Pounds 77,000 (estimate Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000) for a chinoiserie table-bell and stand decorated with harbour scenes, set in elaborate purl and gilt cartouches, and one of very few examples to have survived intact. Other pieces from this apparently unique tea and coffee service doubled their estimates. A white ware beaker vase dating to the last days of the great Johann Bottger also soared way over estimate, fetching Pounds 49,000. An oval armorial sugar box and cover from the famous Swan Service, made by JJ Kandler and Eberlein for the factory's director Count Bruhl, found a new owner at Pounds 48,400 (estimate Pounds 25,000-Pounds 35,000). The Korthaus collection realised Pounds 613,910, with 19 of 68 lots unsold. A further 70 pieces will be offered in the spring. Outstanding istoriato or 'story-telling' majolica earthenware from the collection of the late Sir Thomas Barlow fared less well. A dish of 1523-25 decorated by the Raphael of majolica painting, Nicola da Urbino, and a great market rarity, was bought in at Pounds 60,000 (estimate Pounds 80,000-Pounds 120,000). Another Urbino istoriato dish, by Francesco Xanto Avelli  - perhaps the most extraordinary personality in the history of majolica  - was unsold at Pounds 26,000. Italian dealers and collectors, the prime supporters of the majolica market, seemed to have stayed at home. The sale of Continental ceramics totalled Pounds 775,148, with 70 per cent sold by value.</p>

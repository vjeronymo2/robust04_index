			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTION OF KEY FIGURE IN OHIO S&amp;L CASE  </P> <P> A state appeals court Wednesday overturned the bank fraud conviction of Marvin  Warner, a key figure in the 1985 crisis that struck savings and loan  associations in Ohio.  </P> <P> The court overturned Warner's conviction on charges unauthorized transfer of  funds and other acts, as well as an order that he pay $22 million in  restitution.  </P> <P> Ohio Atty. Gen. Anthony Celebrezze said he would appeal the ruling to the  state's supreme court because it was based on technicalities. He said Ohio had  already spent $5.5 million prosecuting the case and would continue to pursue  it.  </P> <P> Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was sentenced to 42 months in  jail but has been free on bond and living in Florida while the appeal was  processed.  </P> <P> Warner was convicted in 1987 of illegally diverting millions of dollars from a  Cincinnati savings association to a securities trading company.  </P> <P> The collapse of Warner's Home State Savings Bank, then the state's largest  privately insured savings and loan, caused a run on other savings and loans in  Ohio, forcing state officials to close 71 institutions until stability  returned.  </P></p>

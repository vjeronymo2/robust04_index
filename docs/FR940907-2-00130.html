Legislators, policymakers, service providers, and advocates_as well as manufacturers and retailers_require information on the incidence and prevalence of disability conditions, the distribution of disability conditions among the population, and the characteristics of individuals with disabilities. This information is needed in order to develop policy, and plan, administer, and evaluate programs, including health care programs; assess market demand for goods and services; estimate demand for and the costs of public services; and evaluate the effectiveness of society's efforts to promote disability prevention, rehabilitation, community integration and inclusion, and protect the civil rights of individuals with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on disability are collected and produced by many groups. The variety of statutory authorities for the collection of public data sets, the absence of any mandate or resources for comprehensive demographic studies of disability, and a consistently applied definition of disability have resulted in fragmented, incomplete, and inconsistent data sets about individuals with disability. One byproduct of this situation has been the focus on explorations and reconciliations to make these data more useful for further research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yet legislators and program administrators, advocates and journalists continue to use ``data''_numbers, estimates, projections, and ``best guesses''_as the basis for policy decisions and assessments. It is important that the estimates used be accurate and that their users understand the implications of the data. Underestimates of certain conditions or populations may result in failure to plan and provide resources for adequate services; overestimation makes it impossible to assess the real effectiveness of laws or programs and may discourage efforts to address certain problems for fear of overwhelming costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a need for presentation of data in meaningful, understandable, and accessible formats usable by persons with a range of educational levels and technical skills, sensory disabilities, languages, and cognitive abilities. There is also a need to make disability data available to the broad range of target audiences referred to above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIDRR has attempted to address many of the problems of unsatisfactory databases and the need to increase understanding of the demography of disability by supporting research projects and centers that primarily compile and analyze data and train researchers and statisticians. This scholarly effort has not addressed sufficiently the widescale dissemination of data that is presented in useful, meaningful, and accessible formats for a variety of audiences not experienced in the nuances of data interpretation. Further, NIDRR's data research program has, almost of necessity, been focused on data that relate to health conditions and health care needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIDRR also has identified a need to improve the ability of individuals with disabilities and the parents, persons from minority backgrounds with disabilities, family members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives of the individuals to access information. In addition, many persons with disabilities need comprehension aids that will allow them to understand and utilize the information they access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed project on access to disability data will focus on the synthesis, interpretation, presentation, and dissemination of statistical information on disability to a wide target audience. It will provide training in the interpretation and use of disability data to individuals with disabilities and their organizations, and will involve individuals with disabilities in the identification of information needs and channels of access, evaluation of the materials prepared in the project, and dissemination of products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

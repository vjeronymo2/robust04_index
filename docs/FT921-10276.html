			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Punjab election campaign begins A FORTNIGHT'S election campaigning in Punjab began quietly yesterday in the shadow of guns wielded by both militants and the troops that have been deployed in the state to keep them at bay. Candidates were under heavy military escort and there was little of the enthusiasm associated with the start of an election process. Polling will be held on February 19 to elect 13 members of parliament and 117 members of the Punjab legislature. For the last nine years, the state has been torn by violence by Sikh militants seeking independence. Initial election rallies were held not to propagate the contestants' policies but to urge the voters either to boycott the election or to get them to vote at all. The election is being boycotted by the main factions of the Akali Dal, the Sikhs' main political party, under instructions from the militants. The Akalis held rallies throughout the state asking the people not to vote. Anti-boycott rallies were held by the authorities. The Indian government claims it has made sufficient arrangements for a fair and free election and is urging voters to turn out in large numbers. One small faction of the Akali Dal is, however, contesting the election, a faction of led by Mr Amrinder Singh, a former prince of the Patiala royal family. Mr Singh was declared elected to the Punjab legislature on Wednesday when all his opponents withdrew from the contest. This is seen as part of moves being made by the contesting political parties to ensure an Akali presence in the new legislature to give it respectability. The other main parties contesting the election are Congress, which also forms the federal government, the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is the official opposition in parliament, and the Marxists. The period of campaigning has been cut to a fortnight because of security problems in Punjab. The state has been under president's rule (direct administration from New Delhi) for 56 months after the last Akali government was dismissed for failing to check violence by the militants. The situation has got worse under president's rule. The Indian government has called elections in Punjab to see whether restoration of democracy and an elected government can do better.</p>

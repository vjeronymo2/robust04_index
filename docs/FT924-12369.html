			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: UDM leader to stand down MR ROY LYNK, leader of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, said yesterday he felt so betrayed by the government's pit closure decision that he would not stand for re-election. Speaking from the bottom of the Silverhill mine in Nottinghamshire, where he has spent the past five days and nights protesting at the closure decision, Mr Lynk said he faced a credibility gap with his members and had decided 'to jump before I am pushed'. Members of the UDM, which represents about a third of British Coal's miners, mainly in Nottinghamshire, worked through the 1984-85 pit strike and subsequently enjoyed a close relationship with Conservative ministers. The union remains opposed to privatisation but Mr Lynk has been a keen advocate of taking an employee stake in the privatised pits. Mr Lynk, who is 60 next month, said: 'I want to illustrate to the world the obvious contempt the government and British Coal have got for moderate trade union leaders.' Mr Lynk was narrowly re-elected as president two years ago and in next month's election would probably have lost to Mr Neil Greatrex, leader of the union's Nottingham section. Mr Greatrex has always been more sceptical of privatisation and more hostile to the government. Mr Greatrex still faces Mr Arthur Morehouse, branch secretary at the Thoresby pit, in the election for president. Even if Mr Greatrex wins, the chances of swift rapprochement with the National Union of Mineworkers remain slim. Mr Greatrex said he hoped there would be a 'better rapport' with the NUM if he was elected. He emphasised, though, that they would remain separate organisations. Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, will accept rapprochement only on his terms: individual UDM members rejoining the NUM. The TUC has enjoyed a strong revival in its credibility, not least among its own member unions, during the pits crisis, according to senior officials. An immediate consequence is likely to be a clear recommendation for a 'yes' vote from the executive of the electricians' section of the AEEU craft union in next year's ballot on whether the merged union should be in the TUC. The electricians' union remains outside the TUC after disputes about poaching of members, but after its merger with the AEU engineering union, a TUC member, members of both unions are being balloted.</p>

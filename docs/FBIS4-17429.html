			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of Armenia favors the establishment  of a universal currency for the CIS. Vardan Movsisyan, the  republic's deputy minister of economy, said this today at a news  conference. He disclosed that [words indistinct] was proposed to  the members of the CIS economic union within the framework of  the convention on the establishment of a single CIS payments  union signed on 15 April this year in Moscow.    Movsisyan said the idea of establishing a universal currency  for the CIS similar to the European ECU [European Currency  Unit], envisages the creation of a financial reserve at the CIS  Interstate Bank. Each republic would make a pro rata payment  into this reserve, based on its GNP.    The deputy minister believes that this would enable the CIS  states to survive the payments crisis, and would also be an  effective way to establish exchange rates between the soft  currencies of the CIS and to make them convertible among each  other.</p>

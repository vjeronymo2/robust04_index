			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Good news fails to lift dollar GOOD NEWS on the US econ-omy failed to push the dollar through a DM1.6510 ceiling in London yesterday, writes Emma Tucker. Consumer confidence in the US in March rose to a rating of 54.0 from a revised 47.3 in February, the highest reading since October. Meanwhile, the Chicago Purchasing Management index climbed to a seasonally adjusted 51.1 per cent in March from 48 per cent in February. However, both sets of data, along with a 0.8 per cent rise in February's leading indicator, were broadly in line with expectations and failed to excite the currency markets. After spending most of the day at DM1.64, speculative buying along with the three pieces of good economic news pushed the dollar to a peak. But a big sale order coming out of New York knocked it back to close at DM1.6450, little changed from its DM1.6440 start. In late Asian trading the dollar had eased slightly against the yen and the D-Mark. A dealer at a Japanese bank in Hong Kong said the market had lacked a trend all day, with the closing movements amounting to minor adjustments ahead of Japan's new fiscal year that begins today. The US currency closed in Tokyo at Y133.05 and DM1.6485. In New York yesterday the dollar traded in a narrow range, opening at DM1.6430/35 and Y133.10/20 and ending at DM1.6425/35 and Y132.70/80, compared with Monday's close of DM1.6455/65 and Y132.90/95. The Italian lira encountered light selling amid political uncertainty. Similar to Britain, Italy is poised for a general election, the latter's to be held at the weekend. Investors will be looking for a commitment from the new government to reduce the country's big public sector deficit. An economist said: 'If the prospect of a strong coalition seems in doubt, the pressure could pile on the lira in the coming weeks.' Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays, said he believed there was pent-up demand for sterling and the lira and that talk of a sterling crisis after the election was overdone, particularly given the constraints of the ERM. 'Once the elections are out of the way, we expect to see both currencies bounce up.' The lira weakened against the D-Mark to L754.80/90 from Monday night's L754.60/70. Sterling drifted through another lacklustre session. With only nine days left until polling day the market had no firm indication of who is going to win the election. Said one UK bank trader: 'People have postponed their investment decisions until the future shape of the government becomes clear, and sterling's uneasy stability reflects this.' The pound closed  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.8550. In spite of political jitters in France, the French franc held a steady tone.</p>

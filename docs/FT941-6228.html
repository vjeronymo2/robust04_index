			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Economic hopes help Nikkei close above 20,000 level The stable yen and hopes of a bottoming out of the economy supported investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average closed above the 20,000 level for the first time since February 8, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 219.42, or 1.1 per cent, at 20,216.62 on active buying by foreign investors. It opened at the day's low of 20,052.61 and peaked at 20,240.92 during the morning. Investors were encouraged by better than expected industrial output figures and labour statistics announced on Monday. However, the tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, announced yesterday had little impact on stock prices since it showed that sentiment among manufacturers was little changed from the previous report. Large-lot profit-taking around the 20,000 level by institutional investors in the afternoon prevented the Nikkei 225 from rising further, in spite of active overseas buying. The recent decline in the bond market also prompted a shift into the stock market by foreign fund managers. Volume was 500m shares, against 467m. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 13.77 to 1,645.48, while the Nikkei 300 added 2.02 at 304.25. Rises led falls by 780 to 269, with 140 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.93 to 1,365.73. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y3,000 to Y979,000 in spite of reports that it will not request a previously expected rise in local call rates for the next fiscal year, but instead plans to raise its core service rate, which would have a smaller effect on profits. A strong rise in housing starts figures for January released on Monday supported housing shares. Misawa Homes climbed Y40 to Y1,150 and Daiwa House Y40 to Y1,700. Foreign investors bought steel issues. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, gained Y2 at Y354. Stocks previously higher on the multimedia theme, encountered profit-taking. NEC receded Y10 to Y1,040. Some banking issues were easier on corporate selling. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 185.08 to 22,323.96 in volume of 160m shares, the eighth consecutive advance. Roundup The region was mixed yesterday. Seoul was closed for a national holiday. HONG KONG fell 2.5 per cent, undermined by a slide in banking stocks and worries that prices fetched at a government land auction were too high. The Hang Seng index shed 261.87 to 10,148.36. Heavy profit-taking from the opening in Hang Seng Bank and its parent HSBC Holdings pulled the index down, following the two groups' results on Monday. HSBC dropped HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 107 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 8 to HKDollars 61.50. The market fall gathered momentum in late trade on news that a residential development site in the tourist district of Kowloon had sold for HKDollars 2.26bn, far exceeding forecasts of HKDollars 1.5bn to HKDollars 1.7bn. This prompted concern that Hong Kong's high property prices, which are propping up the stock market, might lead developers to raise funds through the equity market with rights offers, which could eventually depress share prices. Blue chip properties fell. SHK Properties slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57.50 and Cheung Kong 75 cents to HKDollars 43.75. SINGAPORE was dragged down by the worries in Hong Kong and concern over the outlook for higher US interest rates. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 29.04, or 1.2 per cent, to 2,313.68. MANILA dropped 3.7 per cent to its lowest point this year, closing below the 2,850 support level as investors sold heavily in anticipation of a further decline. The composite index lost 105.96 at 2,755.65. The decline was also attributed to a shift to fixed-income instruments by most foreign investors, following an increase in US interest rates. KUALA LUMPUR saw some bargain hunting which lifted shares off the day's lows after news that the central bank would not introduce fresh measures to choke off local currency speculation. Recent speculation about new liquidity-mopping measures, including a rise in the statutory reserve requirement of financial institutions, had been affecting market sentiment. The composite index ended 12.22 down at 1,113.41. TAIWAN gained on a technical rebound after four days of declines, but sentiment remained cautious. The weighted index improved 37.80 to 5,452.44. AUSTRALIA clawed back futures-led losses but brokers said sentiment remained nervous. The All Ordinaries index finished 1.6 up at 2,181.7. On the Sydney futures market the March Index finished down 12 at 2,174.0. NEW ZEALAND put in another impressive performance as the NZSE-40 capital index rose 25.80 to 2,270.20. KARACHI broke the 2,500 barrier for the first time, the KSE-100 index moving ahead 43.52 to 2,505.24. After the close the central bank cut the discount rate to 15 per cent from 17 per cent and the maximum lending rate to 19 per cent from 22 per cent. BOMBAY eased in low volume as investors digested the implications of Monday's budget. The BSE index lost 136.05, or 3.1 per cent, at 4,150.15.</p>

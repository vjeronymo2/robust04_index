			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Vauxhall pay offer rejected NATIONAL union officials have been called in to try to prevent industrial conflict at Vauxhall motor company after shop stewards representing 9,000 workers rejected a two-year pay offer. The company said yesterday that it was 'disappointed' at the outcome and warned employees at its plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, that it was facing extremely difficult market conditions. On Thursday it offered a rise of 2.1 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year.</p>

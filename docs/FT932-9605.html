			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Regions give clearest sign yet of recovery WALES, THE west Midlands and south-east England are leading manufacturing industry's recovery, says the latest regional trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and the economic consultancy Business Strategies. The survey found that manufacturing output rose in seven of the UK's 11 regions in the four months to April while orders were higher in six of the regions. Orders rose sharply in Wales and the west Midlands with smaller rises reported in the south-east, Northern Ireland and north-west England. Mr Richard Holt, an associate director of Business Strategies, said the survey was 'the clearest signal yet that the recovery is here'. Manufacturers in all regions expect increased output and orders in the next four months. Companies in the west Midlands are the most optimistic about production prospects, followed by those in Northern Ireland, East Anglia, the north and north-west England. Manufacturing output in Yorkshire and Humberside is expected to rise more slowly than in other areas, while production in the south-east may be constrained by high stocks of finished goods. Scottish manufacturers are less optimistic than others about orders in the coming months. Mr Holt said the revival in industry's fortunes partly reflected improved export prospects following the devaluation of sterling since September. But he said that the recovery was not confined to exporters. While the upturn in the west Midlands and Wales was largely export led, industry had also recovered in the south-east and East Anglia, which were less export dependent. Business Strategies estimates that manufacturing employment will fall by 30,000 to 4.28m in the current quarter compared with the first three months of this year and will be 194,000 lower than in the second quarter of last year. While the current quarter is expected to see a halt to job losses in the west Midlands, northern England and Northern Ireland, employment levels in these regions will still be substantially below last year's levels. Scotland's recovery was likely to be slower than the rest of the UK because it was later into the recession and investment had slowed in the offshore oil sector. Mr Holt said the government's pit closure plans could be contributing to the relatively muted production prospects in Yorkshire and Humberside. Companies in Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in East Anglia, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands still plan to increase investment. But many manufacturers in Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in Northern Ireland, the south-east and north-west England, complained that a shortage of company-generated finance could limit expansion. The survey of nearly 1,300 companies between March 26 and April 14 found increased concern among manufacturers in East Anglia, the west Midlands and the north-west that political and economic conditions abroad might limit their ability to win export orders.

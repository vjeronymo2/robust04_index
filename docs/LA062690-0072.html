			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: BLACK ENTREPRENEURS: LOST IN THE CROWD?  </P> <P> Drive down the streets of any black neighborhood in California's big cities and  look at who has been buying the liquor stores and beauty parlors and  convenience markets and gas stations and fast-food places. Immigrants, mostly.  From South Korea, India, Vietnam and elsewhere.  </P> <P> There is no shortage of long-established black-owned businesses, but not much  evidence of new black entrepreneurs in black neighborhoods.  </P> <P> What's happening here? Didn't the 1980s show the most explosive increase in the  start-up of small businesses in California history? Were blacks left out again?  </P> <P> Answers -- but certainly not opinions -- are hard to come by. Some say blacks'  traditional lack of access to capital became even more noticeable and painful  during the booming 1980s, especially as government programs to assist minority  entrepreneurs shrank. They add that the legacy of redlining, discrimination and  poverty may have sapped the energy of those who otherwise might have  participated.  </P> <P> Others, shrugging their shoulders, believe that immigrants have always been the  ones to start the most businesses in California, and that the 1980s were simply  bigger but not different.  </P> <P> Still others maintain that more blacks finally entered the corporate mainstream  in the 1980s and that, therefore, the people most likely to open businesses in  their old neighborhoods were less interested in taking that difficult path.  </P> <P> There is no consensus among all those opinions. But what seems clear is that  the changing demographics of California are significantly altering the economic  landscape and making old ethnic assumptions about business obsolete. And if you  view the 1990s wearing 1960s glasses you will likely miss many of these  changes.  </P> <P> Statistics tell part of the story. The huge increase in business formations is  a nationwide trend, but it's a bit more pronounced in California. The Census  Bureau estimates that the total number of businesses in the state jumped by  more than a third between 1982 and 1987, compared to a 28% rise nationally.  </P> <P> Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit reporting company, figures that in 1987 more  than 13% of the nation's new businesses were launched in California. And the  state's Employment Development Department reports that the largest percentage  growth of any business sector during the 1980s was the 51% rise shown by tiny,  often brand-new outfits with three or fewer employees.  </P> <P> What all this means is that more people in California are going into business  for themselves than ever before, and they are doing so at a faster clip than  any other Americans. They also succeed more often, with the California business  failure rate well below the national average.  </P> <P> The state's reputation as a hothouse that nurtures young business seems  well-deserved.  </P> <P> But at the same time, immigration has changed the culture and economics here.  The state's population grew by 21% in the past decade, in large part through  immigration. Ethnic patterns are changing virtually everywhere; by 1992, it's  projected that Anglos will be no more than about 40% of the population in Los  Angeles County, with blacks, Latinos, Asians and others making up the remaining  60%.  </P> <P> During the past 10 years, however, there has been little new immigration by  blacks to California. In fact, some demographers have detected at least a small  out-migration to other states.  </P> <P> "The motivation of immigrants to California has always been to get rich, to  latch onto the ring," says Gene Grigsby, a planning consultant and chair of the  economic development subcommittee of Los Angeles 2000, a quasi-public group  that studies local trends. "So if a population group isn't growing through  immigration, you might expect to see less entrepreneurial zeal."  </P> <P> Nearly a half century ago, as California's black population swelled through  immigration during and after World War II, entrepreneurship flourished.  Black-owned shops and businesses lined the streets of neighborhoods in Los  Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere. Most were in the service industries --  the same economic sector that showed such a huge rise in the 1980s.  </P> <P> That generation of black entrepreneurs is aging, and many have sold their  businesses and moved away. A number of black-owned California companies born in  the heady days of the 1960s civil rights movement did grow and prosper during  the past decade. But the federal assistance programs that helped give birth to  many of them have shriveled.  </P> <P> Also, the traditional black neighborhoods of California that were based on  segregated housing are fading now, with many younger blacks moving to other  areas.  </P> <P> What often remains, tragically, is an underclass of unemployed people, many of  whom have never known a black entrepreneur. Lacking incentive and a good  education, they watch in frustration as immigrants buy businesses and move in.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the new Californians, coming from a dozen different cultures,  have arrived with hopes every bit as high as any of their predecessors. Pooling  money among themselves and hiring their relatives for little or no salary, they  are buying up or starting small businesses across the state and somehow are  making a go of it. Sometimes unaware of the cultural sensitivity involved, many  buy shops in black communities or other economically disadvantaged areas  because the prices tend to be lower.  </P> <P> The story doesn't stop here; there may even be a happy ending. Mainstreaming  programs begun in the 1960s have achieved some success. Although the number of  blacks attending college is little changed, there has been an increase in those  attending business schools. There is also a measurable increase in the number  of blacks rising through the corporate ranks.  </P> <P> Some of these people have been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, but don't  look for a lot of them in South-Central Los Angeles, in San Francisco's  Fillmore District or in other traditional black neighborhoods.  </P> <P> There has been a growth of black-owned businesses in the real estate industry,  in communications and in information processing. But these firms are scattered  across the state, in places that might be called unlikely if you fail to grasp  the demographic changes that are occurring.  </P> <P> It's such a new development that most observers aren't sure yet just how  significant it is. Does it mean that entrepreneurship in California is finally  becoming colorblind? Will there be no more "traditional" black businesses?  Maybe, but don't count on it.  </P> <P> More likely, it means that you'll have to look harder to find them in the  crowd.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A CHANGING POPULATION  </P> <P> Estimate, July 1989:  </P> <P> California population: 29,063,000  </P> <P> White: 58.8%  </P> <P> Latino: 24.4%  </P> <P> Asian/Other: 9.5%  </P> <P> Black: 7.5%  </P> <P> 1979 comparison:  </P> <P> California population: 23,255,000  </P> <P> White: 67.5%  </P> <P> Latino: 18.7%  </P> <P> Black: 7.5%  </P> <P> Asian/Other: 6.3%  </P> <P> Source: Demographic Research Unit, California Department of Finance  </P></p>

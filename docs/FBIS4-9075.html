			<p>BFN     [Text] Precisely two years ago, the democratic government  presided over by Aleksander Meksi that emerged from the 22 March  elections took its oath before the president of the Republic.  We availed ourselves of this opportunity to interview Prime  Minister Meksi:    [Begin recording] [Meksi] Regarding the government's  activity  during these two years, I would highlight the great work done in  the direction of the all-round reformation of Albania in the  aspect of structures and the judicial, economic, and general  aspect so as to pass from a state with a centralized economy and  a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat into a state of  democracy and free market economy. Of course, just a glimpse of  that great work of the government and parliament, after two  years, cannot be understood in one moment. However, if we take  into account the large number of laws, we would understand that  many things have changed in Albania and, in my opinion, they  have changed for ever.    Nevertheless, the Albanian Government and parliament will  have a greater obligation in the next two years, precisely in  the direction of changing the economic, state, and judicial  structures in Albania, because there are still many things to be  done.    [Unidentified correspondent] What didn't you manage to  accomplish in these two years as you would have liked to?    [Meksi] We would have liked public investments to have been  more numerous and larger, but the difficulties of these two  years and the need for a social character in the whole economic  reform, as well as the need to support unemployment and the less  economically rich strata, left fewer funds for foreign  investments. We hope that in the coming years, together with  the support program by the G-24 countries, these investments  will be greater.    [Unidentified correspondent] What message would you like to  address to the Albanian people today?    [Meksi] First of all, the overwhelming majority of the  Albanian people have courageously supported the reform in  Albania. The message I would send to them on this occasion would  be to thank them for the support that they have given to the  government and the economic and state reforms in Albania. This  message is valid for all Albanians, first to the emigrants who  have helped to overcome these two difficult years; the trade  unions who have developed a dialogue, objected, and proposed  better solutions to the government; and the political forces who  have been objective and who have wanted to improve the reform in  Albania to the benefit of Albania.    My thanks go to all those foreign experts who have come to  Albania and have contributed to the reform; to all the  associations who have helped Albania with humanitarian aid; to  all states, first those of the European Community, the United  States, Turkey, and other countries that, with the humanitarian  aid, credits for raw materials, and assistance for the balance  of payments have made it possible for Albania to overcome these  difficult years of transition.

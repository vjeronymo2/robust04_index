			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Observer: Weighty question Last week's Washington trip by Helmut Kohl has complicated matters for his staff in Germany. Some of them have wagered that their chancellor will be 14 kilos lighter on returning from his annual visit to an Austrian spa, due to begin on Wednesday. But now he has been to the US, the decisive question is not how much he will weigh after the spa holiday, but the weight at which he'll start it. Suspicions that he increased his bulk while in Washington are strengthened by onlookers' impressions that he was there not so much to meet the new US president as to renew his own acquaintance with a favourite restaurant: Filomena's in Georgetown. Certainly, hobnobbing before a White House meeting on Friday, he could talk of little else. As a result Bill Clinton, who has proved himself more than a McDonalds man with recent appearances in several of Washington's trendier restaurants, added Filomena's to his list. He might have done better to note the address of the spa.</p>

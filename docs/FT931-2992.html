			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Promises betrayed, says Labour 'We have no plans and no need to raise extra resources from value added tax' John Major, March 1992 'We do not see any need to increase the tax burden' John Major, March 1992 'We will maintain martgage tax relief' Conservative party general election manifesto MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of having 'cynically and ruthlessly betrayed' its election pledges not to raise tax or VAT. In a vigorous first reaction to the chancellor's speech, he personally targetted Mr John Major by repeating a number of statements made by the prime minister in the run-up to last year's election. To angry shouts of 'cheats' from the Labour benches and silence from the Tories, Mr Smith quoted Mr Major's insistence that the Conservatives would not raise or extend the range of value added tax. 'I don't know how the prime minister can sit there as leader of a government capable of deceit on such a scale,' he said to roars of approval. 'These people make pledges as if they matter not a whit.' Mr Smith went on to single out the increase in national insurance contributions as particularly iniquitous, claiming it was worse than a rise in income tax 'as it affects the people further down the scale'. And he went on to point out that the imposition of VAT on domestic energy bills would hit millions of badly-off people who would not qualify for the exemptions offered to those on income support. The extension of the 20p tax band by a further Pounds 500 would have little impact, Mr Smith claimed, while part of it was already lost by the decision not to raise tax allowances in line with inflation. The measures to tackle unemployment were grossly inadequate and would help just a third of the 300,000 who had lost their jobs since the election, he said. Later, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, described the Budget as amounting to a Pounds 17.5bn tax increase over the next three years and 'the biggest tax rise in history'. Mr Brown said that the average family's tax bill would go up by Pounds 8 a week when fuel costs, national insurance contributions, married couples' allowances and excise duties were taken into account. He went on to promise that Labour would campaign against the Budget across the country on the theme of 'The Betrayal of Britain'. Mr Smith's attack was echoed by other opposition parties. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, described the Budget was one of of 'despair - even a Budget of desperation'. He criticised the 'totally appalling' phasing-in of the full rate of VAT on domestic fuel, and said it was also a 'desperately disappointing' Budget for the unemployed. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, said it was a 'bankrupt Budget from a bankrupt chancellor . . . the myth of the low-tax Tories has finally been destroyed.' Even on the Tory benches, there was an early display of unease. Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire north, a former Treasury minister, questioned whether the whether proposed tax increases were adequate to deal with a public sector borrowing requirement expected to reach Pounds 50bn in 1993-94.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               SUMMARY OF TAX CHANGES OVER NEXT TWO YEARS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 1993-94         1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INCOME TAX Personal allowances                              frozen               - Married couples allowance                                                  frozen      restricted                                                                  to 20% Couples over 65                                  frozen       allowance                                                             increase of                                                              Pounds 200 20 per cent tax band            widened to Pounds 2,500    Pounds 3,000 Mortgage income tax relief                       frozen  limited to 20%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STAMP DUTY                     doubled to Pounds 60,000               -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUSINESS TAXES Advanced corporation tax               reduced to 22.5%             20% Capital gains tax                                frozen               - VAT Extended to domestic fuel and power                   -       8% (17.5%                                                                1995-96)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXCISE DUTIES Alcohol                                           up 5%               - Spirits                                          frozen               - Tobacco                                         up 6.5%               - Vehicle exise duty                         up Pounds 15               -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NATIONAL INSURANCE Employees' contributions                         frozen           up 1% Employers' contributions                         frozen               -  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

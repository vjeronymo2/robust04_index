			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Building a High Speed, Highly Effective </F> Transportation Network"]    [Text] Anhui has made giant  strides in transport construction. According to preliminary  statistics, in the first 10 months of 1993 a total investment of  1.0018 billion yuan was spent on 11 key transport construction  projects, up 115.54 percent over the same period in 1992.    In keeping with the aim of quickly and effectively building  an integrated transport network, Anhui stresses construction of  national railroad trunk lines and road hub network projects. At  the same time it is strengthening north-south road connection  capabilities and expanding roads towards the coast. The scale of  projects is increasingly large and grades are ever more  improved, an initial indication that a modernized transport  network with a backbone of high quality roads is taking shape.    -- Regarding railroad construction: By the end of October,  54.4 percent of the entire multiple track line roadbed in cubic  meters of earth and stone within Anhui Province of the  Beijing-Jiujiang railroad was completed; more than 80 percent of  the bored pile design for five particularly large bridges on the  Fuyang-Jiujiang line was finished; and 41 percent of the Fuyang  hub in earth and stone cubic meters was done. Construction began  on two particularly large bridges and 26 medium-sized bridges.  Forty-four kilometers of principal track on the Fuyang-Huainan  multiple track line were laid; the entire line can be running,  within one year, attaining the goal of linking three areas. One  hundred kilometers of the Hefei to Anqing section of the  Hefei-Jiujiang were laid, reaching the town of Gaohebu. On the  Hefei railroad hub, 560,000 earth and stone cubic meters have  been worked. Work has begun on building 21 bridges and culverts  and 28 medium-sized bridges.    -- Regarding highway construction: The first stage of the  Hefei-Wuhu highway, a 52-km roadbed from Xiage to Shenjiaxiang,  has been lain. The entire roadbed for the Hefei-Tongling  first-grade highway restricted to vehicle use, linking Hefei,  the coastal economic zone, and the Huang Shan and Jiuhua Shan  tourist areas is done. All-out efforts are being invested in  road surfacing. Recently the groundbreaking was held for the  Dalong section of national highway 312. Seven of the eight main  river piers for the Tongling-Chang Jiang highway bridge have  emerged from the water and work is beginning on the  superstructure.    -- Regarding airport construction: Anqing airport expansion  has been examined and approved by the state. The Wuhu-Beijing  airline officially began flying. The construction curtain was  raised on the Fuyang airport.    -- Regarding harbor channel construction: With the Wuhu port  as the "faucet" of Anhui's river coastal area, construction is  intensifying on modernized harbors with Maanshan, Tongling,  Shazhou and Anqing as the two wings. The Xin'anjiang region  unified airline was arranged to build a new group of passenger  and cargo wharves using French Government loans for the  Xin'anjiang airline overall utilization development project.  After it is built it will provide the conditions for developing  Huang Shan tourism and coastal economic development.</p>

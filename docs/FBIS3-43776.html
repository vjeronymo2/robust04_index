The guest of  this second part is President Alpha Oumar Konare, who thinks  that this devaluation was unavoidable and that the African  countries belonging to the franc zone should display more  solidarity with each other from now on. Ghislaine Dupont first  asked the Malian president if he agreed with the World Bank,  which declared that the devaluation of the CFA franc could be  beneficial to Mali:    [Begin recording] [Konare] It is certain that a devaluation  includes positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects  are that we need to take measures to keep inflation under  control and also take necessary social measures. Having said  this, there are positive aspects of which we can take advantage.  This includes everything that concerns the improvement of  national production in the rural areas and in small- and  medium-sized companies. Our exports could also benefit. I  think this devaluation is an opportunity for us to create  conditions for a genuine control of our economy.    [Dupont] Your prime minister has called on the population to  adopt patriotic behavior. For instance, he asked traders not to  increase prices. This appeal has apparently not been heard.  Certain prices have already been doubled in the Bamako markets.    [Konare] As you know, this is a reaction I would describe as  almost normal after the announcement of the devaluation. We  hope that things will get back to normal after the explanation  we are going to give and the measures we are going to take.    [Dupont] Are you satisfied with the promised package of  measures linked to the deal?    [Konare] I think the measures are certainly important, but  they cannot be a substitute for the work and discipline that we  should impose on ourselves. It is important that these measures  should be implemented very quickly. We should create a package  of important and lasting measures very quickly. This is the  condition for avoiding social and political crises. I would  even say that this is the only condition for preserving our  relationship of cooperation with our partners.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Index linking adds shine to gilts - Serious Money INFLATION has fallen to 2.6 per cent, so it may seem an odd time to be extolling the virtues of index-linked gilts. But their appeal to the private investor is three-fold. The first attraction is that inflation might rise, whatever the views of the pundits. Traditionally, devaluations of the pound and high budget deficits have led to higher prices eventually. The second is that, even if inflation does stay low, the 'real' returns (the nominal returns minus inflation) offered by index-linked gilts may look attractive. Currently long-dated indexed issues offer real returns of between 3.5 and four per cent. The attractions are increased by their tax efficiency. Much of the return from an index-linked gilt comes in the form of tax-free capital gain. There is a small income - two or 2.5 per cent - on most issues. But this means that even top-rate taxpayers will pay a maximum of one per cent in tax per annum. So, assuming inflation averages four per cent, an index-linked issue with a real yield of 3.7 per cent offers the prospect of a net return of 6.7 per cent a year to the top-rate taxpayer. A building society would have to pay 11.2 per cent gross to offer an equivalent return. What about conventional gilts as an alternative? It is possible to work out a break-even level inflation rate, above which index-linked issues will be more attractive than conventional gilts. Graham Cox, economist at Sun Life, says these calculations make index-linked issues look very attractive. For top-rate taxpayers, Greenwell Montagu shows the break-even inflation rates as 1.62 per cent for the 2001 issue; 1.6 per cent for 1998; 1.24 per cent for 1996; and minus 0.4 per cent for the 1994 issue. Most economists would expect inflation to be higher than those rates. So why are these highly attractive investments not a more common part of investors' portfolios? One problem is that, though simple in concept, index-linked gilts are fiendishly complicated in practice. The value of your investment does not go up in line with inflation every year. All that is certain for the investor is that the repayment value of the gilt on maturity will reflect the increase in the retail prices index since issue. Similarly, the dividend will go up in line with the RPI each half-year. But the price of the gilt is set by supply and demand; so if investors think that inflation is going to be low, and sell index-linked gilts, the price will fall. Index-linked issues will then trade, as they do now, below their theoretical value. This makes them more attractive to new investors buying at current prices. Instead of the two per cent or 2.5 per cent above inflation that such gilts offered on issue, they now offer real returns of 3.5 per cent plus. What makes pricing specially difficult is the eight month 'gap' in indexation. Rather than use the RPI figures for the month of issue and maturity, the Bank of England calculates indexation on the basis of the RPI eight months before issue and maturity. This is administratively easier for the Bank but is a lot more difficult for everyone else. The consequence of the gap is that investors are left without inflation protection for the last eight months of the issue. So the higher the expected inflation rate, the lower the real return on index-linked. This has a particular effect on short-dated issues since the eight-month gap is a large proportion of the time till maturity. The FT, for example, shows real yields on the basis of five per cent, and 10 per cent, expected inflation. On Friday morning, the 1996 issue had a real yield of 2.85 per cent on the former basis, but only 2.18 per cent on the latter. For the 2020 issue, the yields were 3.94 per cent and 3.82 per cent respectively. An example of how indexation works in practice might help. The base RPI for the 1996 issue is 67.9 (the figure for July 1980) and if the issue were redeemed today, the relevant index would be April's 138.8 (both figures are given on the FT prices pages, under British funds). Dividing the latter by the former gives 2.044, so an investor who bought Pounds 1,000 of stock on issue would be repaid Pounds 2,044. The actual price on Friday morning, however, was 194 3/4 . So the market value of the investor's holding would be Pounds 1,947.50. The original coupon of two per cent, or Pounds 20, would now have more than doubled to around Pounds 41 a year. If inflation averages five per cent between now and the repayment date of September 1996, then the final repayment value should be around Pounds 2,380 (indexation only occurs until January 1996). So someone buying Pounds 1,000 of the stock now, would have around Pounds 1,223 on maturity; plus an income of just over two per cent a year. For the 2.5 per cent 2001 issue, the repayment date is September of that year. If inflation averages five per cent between now and then, someone buying Pounds 1,000 of stock would get around Pounds 1,645 on maturity, and a taxable income of a little over 2.5 per cent a year in the interim. These are not spectacular gains (and indeed inflation could be lower than five per cent); in the short term, there is always the risk that index-linked prices might fall (especially if the government floods the market with new issues). But the prospect of tax-free profits from the government ought to make many investors consider index-linked as a core holding in their portfolios.</p>

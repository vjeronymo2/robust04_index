			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (14): Blunt message from survey - Quality of service PRICE is not everything. Companies want a reliable telecoms service and if new entrants to the market will not provide it, business will not go their way. That is the blunt message of a detailed survey of user perceptions of the the UK's public network operators carried out at the end of last year by the Telecommunications Users Association which represents 1,100 companies nationwide spending at least Pounds 600m a year on telecoms between them. The survey, of 1,000 companies, analysed the service provided by BT, Mercury and a few smaller providers. Overall, satisfaction levels were high. BT generally scored better than Mercury, but there was little in it and on most measures of service quality more than two-thirds of users professed themselves 'very' or 'fairly' satisfied. However, there were still some serious gripes. BT users were particularly concerned about: Billing. Concern was not so much about accuracy as frequency, layout and content. BT has recently made improvements to the last two, but complaints about frequency from smaller users, and the timing of reminders and threatened disconnections for all, are likely to persist. BT says it has no 'set rule' on the availability of monthly billing. Larger companies qualify; whether small and medium-sized ones do depends, according to a spokesman, 'on their size relative to others in their area'. In London that means they 'probably have to have a bill of several hundreds of thousands a year' - although a trial of monthly billing for all companies is underway in one area. As for reminders, the standard intervals are three weeks to a reminder; followed by second reminder and final notice. 'However, precise intervals depend upon payment history', says the company. 'Good payers generally get greater leeway.' The frequency with which account managers were changed, and poor handover. Some customers complained of having two or three account managers within 18 months. BT's heavy redundancy programme over the past three years which, says the TUA, 'has resulted in many customers feeling uncertain about BT's future ability to deliver'. Some 'major customer problems' were reported. Despite this, the report continues: 'a majority still felt that BT was grossly over-staffed' - so evidently the company cannot win. Information about tariff options. A recurring theme was the difficulty of calculating prices and comparing tariffs between operators, with ever-more-complex discount schemes. As competition intensifies, no improvement is to be expected on this score. Least cost-routing software and smart boxes can do the thinking for you when it comes to selecting operators for particular calls, but the latter have created problems of their own and some new users require large initial payments that also need to be taken into account. With Mercury, the main complaints were: Network congestion, particularly in the Manchester, Birmingham and East Anglia regions 'and a general lack of responsiveness'. Half of all respondents reported one or more recurring faults with Mercury, often as a result of network congestion or failure. Mercury says that since last autumn it has completed new switches, upgraded existing ones, and improved inter-connect arrangements with BT to relieve congestion in all three areas, 'so there are no longer such traffic jams'. Billing, with 'bills for large amounts being sent sporadically' and inadequate machinery for dealing with complaints. Mercury says it is 'examining' a new billing system, but has yet to make an announcement. 'An overall feeling that outside London Mercury was thin on the ground and simply lacked the necessary resources.' The company, which began life targeting City business traffic, still has work to do assuring out-of-London customers that they receive equal treatment. It is too soon to pass judgment on the service provided by the 58 cable TV companies laying networks in the local loop. Indeed, most of the complaints against them have not been about the service provided, but rather the absence of any cables providing service in the first place. BT's Westminster contract area is a prime source of complaints, although BT recently promised to take the contract seriously and make the outlay required to fulfil its licence. However, one new entrant wins plaudits from the TUA: Worldcom, a fast-growing London operator linking private networks into leased national and international leased lines, which has applied for a public telecommunications operator licence to enable it to offer services via the switched network. Worldcom branched out from the leased line business barely 18 months ago, yet now has 80 customers and has only lost one since - and that was not to do with quality. Claiming to charge up to 15 per cent less than Mercury, it is no wonder that the City is discovering it fast. Mr David Hardwick, Worldcom's managing director, says its ability to maintain quality is no surprise. 'After all, our equipment is the same as that used by BT and Mercury - and virtually all our staff come from one or the other.' Including Mr Hardwick himself, who left BT four years ago. Unsurprisingly, the TUA members are keen to see greater competition. Only 31 per cent thought there was 'adequate' competition. The rest wanted to see more, in three areas in particular: the provision of analogue private circuits; in local calls (where BT still has a virtual monopoly - and will continue to over much of the country even when and if the local cable companies start attracting customers en masse); and in geographical areas where Mercury is weak. 'An overriding majority of the users outside the Greater London area felt there was no real alternative to BT', conclude the TUA. As one user put it: 'The problem is, who will want to service the rural or unglamorous areas?' Who indeed.</p>

Aichi, director general of the agency, made the remark to  reporters after a cabinet meeting on the issue.    "I will consult with Prime Minister Hosokawa on arranging  the  reviews. We must go ahead with the work within the  understanding of one another on the issue," he said. He  admitted that relations between the prime minister and the  agency on the issue were insufficient.    The prime minister has voiced his intention to set up his  advisory panel to review the defense program outline and to  reach a conclusion by around summer.    But some Defense Agency officials have opposed Hosokawa's  proposal.    Aichi hinted at a meeting with Hosokawa in February after  political reform bills are enacted. The bills are expected to  pass through the Diet by the end of the current Diet session on  January 29.    The cabinet of Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki drafted the  defense plan in 1976, which outlines the need to arrange armed  forces through numerical targets.    Since then the agency has drafted midterm, five-year defense  buildup programs based on the outline.    Japan has considered reviewing the defense outline since the  Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>

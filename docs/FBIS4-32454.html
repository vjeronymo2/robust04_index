			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- By 1000 today the Serb  military had considerably reduced its presence in the area of  the village of Kakma near Benkovac, UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] representatives in Sector South stressed at a news  conference today in Knin. They made it clear that there  remained five armed soldiers and three to four unarmed soldiers.    The situation in this village, 12 kilometers south-west of  Benkovac, which is situated within the so-called buffer zone and  which is regarded by both sides as "a sensitive area," was  described by the sector commander Czech General Rostislav Kotil  and head of civilian affairs Enrico Aguillar, and press  spokesman Alun Roberts.    In their words, this was a very serious violation of the  cease-fire agreement since about 100 Serb soldiers entered the  buffer zone without giving any notice. Roberts said that  UNPROFOR's Canadian troops had denied neither access to the  waterworks system nor passage through the village of Kakma,  while military observers have not noticed any concentration of  Croatian forces, nor have they seen any relocation of heavy  weaponry near Biograd. He told the press that yesterday a  member of the negotiating team, Colonel Duburg, had visited Knin  and met General Mile Novakovic, the head of Krajina's central  commission for the implementation of the Zagreb agreement.    They agreed to hold a meeting this afternoon between Gen.  Novakovic and Bertrand de Lapresle, the UNPROFOR commander for  the former Yugoslavia, probably in Topusko. A meeting of the  central commission was also suggested in order to normalize the  situation as soon as possible.    Sector Commander Gen. Kotil was speaking about a meeting he  held in Kakma yesterday with Colonel Alavanja, the commander of  the North Dalmatian Corps of the Krajina army and the commander  of the unit that had entered Kakma. According to him, he  suggested that mixed patrols, including UNPROFOR and the militia  of the republic of Serb Krajina, be set up so they could patrol  this area. He agreed that all repairs to the waterworks should  stop. Kotil expressed satisfaction with the latest improved  situation and stressed that he understood how sensitive the  Kakma area was, given the fact that it supplied water to a  number of towns.    Asked by a reporter whether UNPROFOR would withdraw its  armored carriers from this area -- at the moment there are as  many as 25 of them [carriers] -- he said that it was too early  to talk about UNPROFOR's further activities but he could not  accept any claim that UNPROFOR forces occupied Serbian villages.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pacific Enterprises OKs Holder Plan: The board of Pacific Enterprises, the Los  Angeles-based parent of Southern California Gas Co. and Thrifty Corp., has  adopted a shareholders' rights plan. The plan is intended to protect  shareholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire Pacific  Enterprises. "The plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire  control of Pacific Enterprises and the board of directors is unaware of any  such effort," Chairman Paul A. Miller said. "The plan is not intended to  prevent a takeover of Pacific Enterprises and will not do so. However, it  should discourage any attempt to acquire Pacific Enterprises in a manner or on  terms not approved by the board of directors as being in the best interest of  shareholders."  </P></p>

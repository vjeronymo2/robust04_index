			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Rise of 1.6% in house prices is highest for four years HOUSE PRICES in the UK rose by 1.6 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase for more than four years, Halifax Building Society said yesterday. The country's biggest mortgage lender said the seasonally adjusted figures 'could be a sign that house prices may well start to increase earlier than most analysts have anticipated'. Further evidence of a revival in house sales also emerged yesterday from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which said there had been an upswing in home loans since the beginning of the year. More than 216,000 loans worth a total of Pounds 11.8bn were approved by building societies and banks during January, February and March, the council said. This represented an increase in both the number and value of loans of more than 25 per cent over the final three months of last year, and was only marginally lower than during the first three months of last year. It said that lending figures traditionally lagged increases in sales which have recently been reported by builders and estate agents. Mr Mark Boleat, the council's director-general said: 'The sharp pick-up in the number and value of approvals is particularly encouraging, corroborating signs elsewhere of a return of household confidence. With evidence of a recovery in the wider economy becoming increasingly apparent, the likelihood is for a further solid improvement in housing market activity over the coming months.' The seasonally adjusted increase in house prices in April was the biggest recorded by Halifax since November 1988 and followed a 1.4 per cent rise reported by the society in March. Actual increases in house prices during April were even higher with the average cost of a home rising by 2.6 per cent from Pounds 61,510 to Pounds 63,144. The price of an average home was still 2.3 per cent lower than during April last year. The society said: 'We continue to believe the recovery will not be strong - certainly no boom is in prospect - and will only be maintained if house sellers continue to set realistic prices for their properties. It is probable now that house prices will show a small increase in 1993 as a whole and could rise in line with average earnings in the economy next year.'

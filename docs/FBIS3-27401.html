Jiang made the remarks when meeting with Lawrence  Eagleburger, former U.S. secretary of state, here this morning  in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Central Committee of the  Chinese Communist Party and the State Council.    Eagleburger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign  Ministry, leading a U.S. "China investment and trade" delegation.    During the meeting, Jiang said that the current  international  situation is still changing in a complicated and profound way.  The world is developing in the direction of multi-polarization,  and the regionalization and conglomeration of the world economy  are tending to accelerate.    However, the president said that various contradictions and  conflicts concealed by the Cold War are gradually being  uncovered, leading to disturbances, clashes and even the  spilling of blood in some areas.    Jiang said that China has always attached much importance to  developing relations with the United States.    More mutual trust and cooperation between China and the  United States will make the two countries play a more active  role in handling international affairs.    Sino-U.S. relations have seen positive development since the  Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries last  November, Jiang said, and since then, exchanges of visits at  high-ranking level had been frequent and bilateral trade and  economic cooperation strengthened.    "All these are helpful to promoting mutual understanding and  solving disputes," he added.    As long as both sides have their eyes on the over-all  situation and the next century, observe the principles of the  three joint communiques between the two governments, respect the  facts, increase consultations, and seek common ground while  reserving differences, Sino-U.S. relations will be able to  maintain a constant development on a normal track.    Eagleburger agreed with Jiang, saying that the changes that  have taken place in China are very impressive, and all those who  are concerned about stability in the next century should agree  on the importance of proper u.s.-China relations, because a  sound Sino-U.S. relationship is beneficial not only to the two  countries, but to world stability and peace as well.    Eagleburger and his party arrived in Beijing on Monday [21  February] evening. In addition to Beijing, they are scheduled  to visit Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Herbert Heller: "Mr. Zvyahilskyy Maintains One </F> Thing, and in Real Life, It Is Quite Another. This Does Not Make  It Any Better for Ukraine"]    [Text] Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy believes "There is  no economic crisis in Ukraine." The No. 2 leader in the state  either does not read the bulletins of the Ministry of  Statistics, or is not knowledgeable about economics, or wants to  put a good face on in a bad situation.    Judge for yourselves. Compared to the first quarter of 1993,  the volume of industrial production fell by 38.4 percent in the  first quarter of this year, the output of foodstuffs fell by  39.2 percent, and retail sales were off 47.6 percent. The  accounts payable by Ukraine to the CIS countries exceed accounts  receivable by 14 trillion [currency not specified], including  those payable to Russia--by 10 trillion [currency not  specified]. Simple calculations indicate that in February alone,  Ukraine's exports to the CIS countries fell by 7.4 trillion  karbovantsy. On the domestic market, the Ukrainian national  economy is running on debt: Accounts receivable increased by 30  trillion karbovantsy in February, and accounts payable by 36.6  trillion karbovantsy. As of 1 March 1994, the total debt came to  172 trillion karbovantsy, which comes to no less than 80 percent  of the national product. This was a factor in expenditures from  the state budget exceeding revenues by more than 5 trillion in  just two months because there was nothing to pay taxes with. If  this condition in Ukraine is not an economic crisis, then what  is a crisis? This happened while taxes and withholdings for  centralized funds in the first quarter came to 89 percent of the  amount of proceeds. Out of each karbovanets in proceeds, as  little as 10 kopeks was left at the disposal of enterprises.  Where are the enterprises to get internal funds for technical  development, retrofitting, and conversion in order to begin  structural changes at their level?    Recently, there has been very much talk about the growth of  prices for products and goods. In January through February  alone, the value-added tax and the excise tax came to almost 9  trillion karbovantsy, or 25.7 percent of the revenues of the  state budget. Add to this the higher outlays on materials,  energy resources, credit rates, and the preservation of the  breakdown of producer cost with the volume of production falling  simultaneously, and you will easily imagine the rate of growth  of wholesale and retail prices.    Mr. Zvyahilskyy boasts that the current government has  curtailed inflation. However, the price paid for this has been  so high that one would not know what is more terrifying--the  temporary curtailment of inflation or the general slump in  production, budget deficit, and deterioration of the financial  standing of the people. The same Ministry of Statistics bulletin  contains data on the size of the average monthly income per  employee in 1993. Frankly, the numbers are revealing. Employees  with the highest incomes were in the merchant marine--256,449  karbovantsy, construction--231,693 karbovantsy, railway  transportation--218,043 karbovantsy, the staff of state and  sectoral management--205,678 karbovantsy, and banks and  insurance companies--518,313 karbovantsy. Employees had the  lowest incomes in culture--99,765 karbovantsy, arts--98,485  karbovantsy, consumer services--77,727 karbovantsy, public  catering--101,451 karbovantsy, health care--114,677 karbovantsy,  agricultural production--118,455 karbovantsy, higher  schools--137,643 karbovantsy, secondary schools--116,204  karbovantsy, science-- 147,866 karbovantsy, and motor vehicle  transportation--145,264 karbovantsy. As can be seen, individuals  working in the social sphere that is financed from the state  budget were the first ones to suffer. For reference, the average  monthly income in Ukraine was 173,876 karbovantsy, including  that of employees of machine building--148,952 karbovantsy--and  of light industry--173,705 karbovantsy.    If one reads the bulletin of the Ministry of Statistics  carefully, he may determine unequivocally that government policy  in managing the economy in the environment of Ukrainian  independence has been a fiasco. The V. Fokin, L. Kuchma, L.  Kravchuk, and Yu. Zvyahilskyy governments have displayed  elementary short-sightedness in governing the state with  deference to the habitual stereotypes and following the lead of  managers of state enterprises, large and small, who religiously  cling to the stereotypes of "developed socialism": to provide  first for themselves and then for the collective, and to give  what remains to our society. This is precisely what has resulted  in the priorities of state policy, what was prompted by the  director "lobby." The social aspects of this policy were merely  declaratory.... This is precisely why the volume of agricultural  production and the output of foodstuffs dropped by a factor of  two compared to 1991. Despite the attempts to pass off the  desirable as being real, the agro-industrial complex has now  long been in a state of economic collapse. This is precisely why  prices for foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 15,500 on  the average, whereas wages-- by a factor of 3,500 at the very  most.    The process of overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and the  restructuring of its economy will take at least six or seven  years because we will have to overcome intellectual backwardness  (may the jingoist patriots forgive me), as well as technological  and organizational backwardness. There are many proposals for  overcoming the crisis. They include replacing fiscal taxation  with a progressive taxation that gives the producers of goods an  incentive to manage more effectively, the need to reduce  expenditures for defense, government, and funding of the  national economy (as people in the know think, this is nothing  but support for state enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy);  fundamentally new foreign-economic legislation that would  encourage the Ukrainian producers of goods to export competitive  products. This also includes a privatization program for 1995  that will most likely remain on paper. However, all of this does  not make sense until the leadership of the state changes, until  the state sees fit to change its stance on the development of  science and education in Ukraine, and finally, until the supreme  officials stop maintaining that there is no economic crisis in  Ukraine....</p>

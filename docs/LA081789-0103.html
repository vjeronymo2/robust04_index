			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Frustrated in attempts to find the cause of the Sioux City, Iowa, crash on July  19 that killed 111 people aboard United Airlines Flight 232, the National  Transportation Safety Board is "fairly certain" to recommend more frequent and  more thorough inspections of all DC-10 engines, ABC News reported. Nothing in  the records for the engine and the plane showed any problems or violations of  maintenance regulations, according to the network. Engines on two other DC-10  passenger jets have suffered explosive failure in the past month.  </P></p>

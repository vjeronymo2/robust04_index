			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "From Tunis to Jericho"] </F>   [Text] Disclosure of the foreign minister's letter to the  PLO leader through the Norwegian foreign minister contradicts  the assertions of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres that  everything pertaining to the Oslo agreement has been put on the  table and that there are no secret documents. No criticism  should be spared from the prime minister and the foreign  minister for not having spoken the truth. Small wonder that now  we ask ourselves whether all the details of the foreign  minister's letter to 'Arafat were fully disclosed. In spite of  our doubts, let us assume for one moment that the letter does  not contain anything other than a long quote from the foreign  minister's address to the Knesset on 9 September 1993. If so,  why did he keep it secret until Yasir 'Arafat disclosed its  existence and contents?    The PLO leader demanded a pledge from Israel that it would  maintain what he termed the "status quo" in Jerusalem and the  status of the Palestinian institutions in the city prior to the  discussions about Jerusalem's permanent status. Peres chose not  to speak about "Palestinian" institutions, and instead  elaborated on the freedom of religious worship and Israel's  willingness to recognize the importance and significance of  Jerusalem to followers of the monotheistic faiths.  Nevertheless, it could be inferred from his speech/letter that  the term "status quo" applies to institutions that have no  religious or cultural mission; Peres also mentioned "other  institutions" and the orderly functioning of "the relevant  institutions and systems."    'Arafat's allegation that he signed the Cairo agreement on  early empowerment of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and  in the Jericho area only thanks to the Israeli foreign  minister's letter concerning Jerusalem leads us to believe that  he was seeking to guarantee the continued presence of a  Palestinian political center in Jerusalem; namely, the building  in the eastern side of the city known as Orient House. Had  Peres publicized his letter immediately after he sent it there  might have been no controversy. However, because he kept it  secret and even denied its existence, the letter is now seen as  a political concession on the part of Israel.    Regardless Israel conceded to the Palestinians when it  agreed  in Oslo that the question of Jerusalem would be dealt with in  the negotiations about the permanent arrangement. Although the  Israeli delegation extracted the mention of the settlements in  the same clause of the agreement in exchange -- that is, the  continued existence of the settlements until the end of the  negotiations about the permanent arrangement -- the government  must now defend itself against allegations that it placed the  unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as an open question on  the negotiating table.    Against this background there is room to question whether  the  operation of Orient House, as we have known it in recent years,  is still tolerable. Its contribution as a liaison between the  Palestinians here and the PLO leadership in Tunis was quite  limited. The PLO leadership is expected to move to Gaza or  Jericho, and the Israeli Government does no longer need any  Palestinian institution as an intermediary. When the PLO  leadership relocates to Gaza or Jericho, the bunch of  wheelers-dealers that had to date worked out of Jerusalem will  lose its stature.    The continued and heightened operation of Orient House might  give the impression that Israel has come to terms with a  situation in which its tenants are allowed to behave as if they  were a Palestinian self-rule outside Gaza and Jericho. Israel  should not agree to the creation of such an image and should  take action to prevent it. The PLO leadership, with which we  will have to negotiate an interim and a permanent arrangement,  should not sit in any part of Jerusalem. As long as it has not  been agreed otherwise, it can relocate from Tunis to either Gaza  or Jericho.    If 'Arafat sees Peres' letter as corroborating his argument  that Orient House, at whatever level of political activity, can  come under the banner "other institutions," the foreign minister  must alert him to his error.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Swiss mouse maker recovers Logitech, the world market leader in tracking devices (mice) for computers, continued its strong recovery in the year ended March, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich. Net income more than trebled to SFr27.8m (Dollars 19.8m), but was inflated by a SFr15.9m gain on the sale of shares and options in a Canadian affiliate and moderated by an exceptional SFr6m depreciation charge and SFr2.6m in restructuring charges. Revenues jumped 17.1 per cent to SFr484.2m.</p>

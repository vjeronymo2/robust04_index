They believe that it is the wrong  moment in time to pay attention to this unstable Transcaucasian  state. Experts believe that signing a treaty between Russia and  Georgia in the situation when problems of the North Caucasus  have not been resolved may provoke a conflict between the  executive and the lawmakers in Russia. Most deputies of the  lower chamber will vote down the ratification of such a treaty.</p>

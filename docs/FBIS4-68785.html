			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Chapter from book "Derzhava" by Gennadiy Zyuganov, </F> Informpechat, Moscow, 1994, edited by Professor N.A. Vasetskiy,  doctor of historical sciences: "Russia Above the Abyss"]    [Excerpt] The book by G.A. Zyuganov, deputy of the State  Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and  chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation  Central Executive Committee, analyzes topical problems of the  constitutional and sovereign-state building of the new Russia  and its domestic and foreign policy and spirituality and  patriotism.    The author has proposed a constructive program for the  extrication of the country from the most profound crisis, a  strengthening of the shaken authority of the managerial  structures, and a surmounting of the growing lack of trust in  the institution of power as a whole.    The book is intended for a wide range of readers, primarily  those to whom the fate of their fatherland and its present and  future is not a matter of indifference. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Russia Above the Abyss </H5>   IF WE THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS CLEAR THAT NOTHING WAS CONCLUDED  BY THE EVENTS IN MOSCOW THAT FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S EDICT ON  THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT. ON THE CONTRARY, EVERYTHING IS  ONLY JUST BEGINNING....    IT IS NOT FORTUITOUS THAT THIS REGIME:    CAME TO REAL POWER IN AUGUST 1991 UNDER THE COVER OF  DEAFENING POPULIST DEMAGOGY ON THE WAVE OF A POWERFUL POLITICAL  CATACLYSM:    REMAINED AFLOAT FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THIS BY INFLAMING AN  ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION AND POLITICAL HYSTERIA AND  REPEATEDLY PROVOKING THE OPPOSITION INTO COLLISIONS;    MANAGED IN THE FALL OF 1993 TO AVOID A CRUSHING POLITICAL  DEFEAT MERELY AT THE PRICE OF THE ORGANIZATION IN MOSCOW OF  BLOODY CLASHES, IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DIED.    "The revolution devours its children...." This dire aphorism  has today once again been confirmed before our eyes. The slick  and smooth-tongued democratic revolution, which two years ago  managed by treachery and lies to destroy a country that had  grown weary and had lost its faith in the perestroyka  experiments, has logically brought society to the brink of civil  war. But its first volleys were aimed against the most furious  "democrats" of the recent past. Another circle of Russian  history inevitably closed, having for the umpteenth time  exploded at its end point in abundant splashes of innocent blood.    This is why it is essential that all of us--patriots and  democrats, monarchists and nationalists--regardless of political  "rightness" or "leftness," urgently think through the results of  the Moscow tragedy in its organic connection with the events of  recent years and draw for ourselves serious, high-minded, and  profound conclusions. The situation is, alas, developing  according to the worst possible scenario, in which there can be  no winners, for those benefiting will be only the destructive,  extremist forces that are aiming at the conclusive extermination  of the remnants of sovereign Russian statehood and the  suffocation of the very rich Russian spirituality and culture.    The inexorable logic of political history has already begun  to uncoil the latest spiral of opposition, at the end of which,  unless we come to our senses, an explosion of violence far more  terrible and ferocious than that which shook Moscow 3-5 October  of 1993 awaits the country.... "God preserve me from seeing a  Russian rebellion--senseless and pitiless"--we would all do well  to keep this firmly in mind. Pushkin knew what he was writing  about--the bloody experience of the 20th century confirms all  too clearly and convincingly how right he was.  <H5>  Fateful Questions </H5>   What has been happening to the country in the last eight  years (since the start of perestroyka)? What are the real,  genuine reasons for the latest Russian troubles and their  principal driving forces, ends and means, and executants and  leaders? What are our real prospects? What needs to be done for  the situation, finally, to be brought under control? Where is  the way out of the political, economic, and ideological impasse  in which we have found ourselves as a result of the universal  "triumph of democracy"? This is just a small part of the  questions that arise at a first attempt to comprehend in calm  and considered fashion the recent Moscow carnage. It  concentrates and fully reflects, as in a drop of water, all the  present troubles, pains, and adversities of our life. It is for  this reason that it is so important to understand how what  happened with us since the fateful Presidential Edict No. 1400  of 21 September could have happened!...    The explanation so importunately and high-handedly imposed  on  public opinion today by the reptilian news media--"a red-brown  putsch"--is patently false and baseless. All these hysterical  cries about the "communo-fascists" altogether come, rather, from  the complete ideological impotence of the authorities, which are  simply incapable of offering society if only some in the least  bit intelligible explanation of what happened. Nonetheless,  there is one--merely a little clear thinking is required.    From the very start of the present troubles--from the moment  when a political grouping of extreme, radical "Westerners"  managed with the support of the world oligarchy at the price of  the collapse of the USSR to seize political power in Russia--it  was perfectly obvious that a substantial number of Russians  would not for the world accept the path of "development" onto  which the zealous devotees of "values common to all mankind"  were endeavoring to drive them at any price. It was just as  obvious that the number of malcontents would grow in line with  the impoverishment of the masses and the intensification of the  general chaos--the inevitable consequences of the political and  economic course of the new Russian leadership. At some moment  the discontent would reach a critical point, and then the fruit  of the long painstaking activity of powerful international  forces endeavoring, on their way to world domination, to remove  Russia from the geopolitical arena by any means would be  imperiled.    Keeping a vast country under control under such conditions  without the use of force is practically impossible. For this  reason the backstage scriptwriters of our modern drama were from  the outset given the assignment of devising and realizing in  practice in Russia a set of methods of the country's controlled  transfer to a new political regime with elements of  dictatorship. The program-maximum here provides for the  achievement of secret, but complete and strict, international  control over the domestic political situation. The  program-minimum, nonadmission to the levers of state power of  national-patriotic forces.    Many puzzles of our contemporary history are easily  explained  upon an analysis of the political collisions in Russia within  the framework of this set of methods. The tragi-comic Emergency  Committee "putsch" appears in a new light. The striking  coincidence of the offices of the "putschists" in August 1991  and of the "rebels" in October 1993 is clear also. In addition,  even quite a confident forecast of the political situation in  the immediate future is possible from this viewpoint. But  everything in its turn.  <H5>  August of '91... </H5>   Before embarking on an examination of the August events,  which dramatically determined Russian and, to a considerable  extent, world history of recent years and served as the point of  departure for processes that culminated in the recent tragedy in  Moscow, it is essential to provide certain explanations.    First, our thoughts may be of at least some analytical value  only in the event of us abandoning emotional value judgments and  trying to impartially trace the techniques and backstage  political mechanics of the phenomena. Whether the state and  political system of the USSR was good or bad--we will leave this  question outside of the framework of the article lest we  complicate matters by personal predilections.    Second, while possessing the undoubted benefit of simplicity  and graphic depiction, the sketchiness inevitable with such an  analysis has simultaneously a number of shortcomings also. One  such is a certain consolidation of events preventing us  conveying all of the practical diversity and actual complexity.  It is essential that this be borne in mind to avoid being, as a  result, an uncritical captive of particular theories to the  detriment of the actual political practice.    Third, a retrospective (backdated) reconstruction of the  operating methods of this political force or the other cannot,  by virtue of a natural lack of information, lay claim to  exhaustive fullness. While reconstituting its main, principal  features with a high degree of probability, it is in no way  possible to guarantee 100 percent accuracy and the full  correspondence of detail. Nor is this necessary, for such  shortcomings do not prevent the achievement of the main goal--a  qualified evaluation of the leading trends of our political life.    Bearing in mind all these amendments, the situation  preceding  the Emergency Committee "putsch" may be described as follows.    Quite a curious and distinctive picture of political forces  had taken shape in the country by mid-1991. Formally, the old  party nomenklatura continued to keep a firm hold of the most  important levers of state administration. Under its strict  control were the power structures: the national armed  forces--combat-ready and easily controllable and barely touched  in practice by the trends of "perestroyka"; the ramified and  universal machinery of the Committee for State  Security--efficient, suitable for the accomplishment of the most  complex and delicate assignments, and possessing immense  information and analytical potential; the Ministry of Internal  Affairs with its most extensive opportunities for controlling  the situation in the country.    For these structures the "flash points" and centers of  conflict that existed at that time on the territory of the USSR  represented no in any way serious threat and could, from the  purely technical viewpoint, have been "extinguished" at any  moment.    The party and state vertical line, thoroughly battered and  shaken in the six perestroyka years, nonetheless continued still  to be a relatively dependable executive framework which was  experienced and professional in matters of administrative and  economic management. Relying on it, any measures of state  stabilization could have been implemented perfectly  well--especially as an understanding that the reform race, which  had began so clamorously, was becoming by degrees a campaign for  the dismantling of all the most important state institutions had  matured among party functionaries.    The legislative authority--the USSR Supreme Soviet--could  easily, if necessary, have mustered the majority needed to pass  stabilization decisions. The CPSU Central Committee bureaucracy,  with its numerous and highly qualified specialists, was, as  before, a sufficiently efficient center of control. Central  Television and the majority of oblast studios and a substantial  part of the central and local press remained in the party's  hands. The financial possibilities of the CPSU were enormous  also. It had almost undivided operational leadership of the  economy.    More simply put--the party had everything. Except for one  thing, the most important. ITS CENTRAL ORGANISM WAS UTTERLY  DEVOID OF A VIGOROUS AND SINGLE-MINDED POLITICAL WILL. Being led  to the slaughter by its own leaders, the fatigued and decrepit  CPSU could not find within itself the powers--obeying its own  political self-preservation instinct--even to adopt elementary  measures of precaution and self-defense.    Nonetheless, continuing "by force of inertia" to control all  the commanding political heights, the party was, seemingly, an  insuperable obstacle in the way of the new, energetic, and  grasping political predators aspiring to take its place on the  Olympus of state power. In addition, there continued to be the  "danger" (slight, but real, nonetheless!) that healthy  intra-party reform could breathe into its enormous body the  beneficial spark of new life....    The "democratic" elite was, therefore, confronted with all  seriousness and urgency with the question of the need to ensure  the drastic, instantaneous "dumping" of its party opponents and  the destruction of the mechanisms of the political domination of  the CPSU.    This quasi-democratic elite, which had taken shape rapidly  in  the years of perestroyka from party renegades, opportunist  government officials sensitive to the least change in the  political climate, "agents of influence," "civil  libertarian"-dissidents, part of the denationalized "artistic"  intelligentsia, and other fragments, outwardly represented a  shapeless and patchwork phenomenon. It would have had no chance  of victory had it not been for three factors which played a  decisive part in this confrontation.    First, the vigorous, outright maniacal will to power which  united the friable, diverse multitude of "democrats" into a  single herd (I am referring, of course, merely to those who  acted consciously, and I by no means wish to offend the vast  majority of well-intentioned people who succumbed to the  fascination of eye-catching slogans and populist appeals).    Second, the "liberal democratic" ideology, which was  attractive following decades of exalted praise for the status  quo and ideological stagnation and behind whose generously  daubed facade it was impossible for the unsophisticated gaze of  the naive Russian public almost to discern the hypocrisy and  cynicism of its vociferous proponents. It was this ideology that  secured for the "democrats" the unconditional support of the  West with all the ensuing material and organizational  consequences. It was its interior that contained the grain of  destruction for whose sake, in fact, it was foisted so  vigorously and clamorously on public opinion and whose shoots  coincided with the collapse of the USSR, and whose first fruits  coincided with the October tragedy in Moscow.    Third--and this is the main factor, perhaps--the "democrats"  had influential allies in the other camp. The "monolithic unity"  of the CPSU was a bluff, and a substantial part of the  unscrupulous nomenklatura, attracted by promises that they would  "live as in Europe," constituted an impressive fifth column in  the party's rear ready at any moment to surrender it to whoever  would pay more. IT IS PARADOXICAL, BUT A FACT: THE HEAD OF THIS  ARMY OF TRAITORS AND DESERTERS WAS THE GENERAL SECRETARY HIMSELF  WITH HIS IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE....    There was on the political stage at that time one further  force--regional. It was represented by the political elites of  the Union republics. As ill luck would have it, with the  majority of them the rudiments of state wisdom were  confined--alas!--to an aspiration to rake in for themselves as  much in the way of power and various benefits as possible and to  snatch as many rights and privileges as they could. In the race  for these cherished aims they were always prepared to support  whoever would promise them more.    It is clear that with this alignment of forces the party  elite was doomed. It was merely a question of the path by which  the change of power would occur--evolution or revolution. The  first left open the possibility of the existence of a unified  state and the continued healthy reform of society, the second  presupposed the collapse of the country and a sharp weakening of  Russia and, consequently, a powerful geopolitical shift in favor  of the West.  <H5>  The Algebra of Politics </H5>   The art of the imperceptible manipulation of large-scale  political processes by no means consists, as some people  believe, of a backstage conductor (conductors) controlling their  progress from start to finish, predetermining the set goal. This  understanding of "conspiracies"--from the simplest petty  intrigue through the "world Yid-Masonic" conspiracy--is  incomplete and primitive. In reality, the political environment  is too complex, diverse, and unpredictable for it to be so  strictly controlled.    No, the real "art of power" consists of the ability to make  virtuoso use of the results of the natural flow of events, only  occasionally, at most important moments, imparting to them the  essential direction by almost intangible, but precise and  calibrated influences.    It is thus, I believe, that the political history of Russia  of recent years has been programmed.    The set of methods of this programming may conditionally be  called the methods of "controlled explosions" or "managed  catastrophe." Their main purpose is the consistent removal from  the Russian political arena of all forces capable of impeding  the country's integration in the single supra-state system of  the "new world order." The principle of their action is based on  the use of the political and social antagonisms that naturally  exist in any state, especially a state in the grip, like Russia,  of a profound systemic crisis. The starting point of the process  is the political reality that has taken shape as of a certain  moment of time, and its end result, the transfer of the entire  social and political system to a fundamentally new condition  with certain predetermined characteristics.    For simplicity and convenience of schematic description let  us establish that there participate in the process "players"  pursuing independent political goals, and a "conductor," whose  mission it is with the aid of the set of methods described to  ensure certain rules of the game guaranteeing the predetermined  result. Essentially, the "conductor" is a player just like the  others, only of a higher order and the highest qualifications.  He also pursues an independent goal, the difference being merely  that he is hidden from the majority of "players," and this is an  essential condition of its realization.    For convenience of analysis the entire process may be  divided  into five consecutive phases.    The FIRST phase is the focusing or initial phase. It  provides  for the "conductor's" determination of his attitude toward the  "players." The "players" are divided into one's own and others',  friends and foes, allies and opponents. The main criterion  making it possible to conduct such an operation with sufficient  precision is the attitude of the "players" toward some  fundamental, model concepts and requirements reflecting the true  purposes of the "conductor" in this game. The ascertainment of  such "models" in all walks of life is extraordinarily important  for the observer-analyst, for it is they that make it possible  to compile the most realistic idea of the real, not sham, goals  and driving forces of the game.    Assuming that some outside force interested in the  elimination of a strong rival attempts to assume the role of  "conductor" in the current Russian troubles, as has repeatedly  been the case throughout our tumultuous 1,000-year history, we  obtain (with reference to the pre-putsch situation of 1991):    1. Serving for the "conductor" as the "model" for choice of  friends should be the "players'" readiness for the sake of the  achievement of their individual political and material goals  (power, wealth, and so forth) to sacrifice the interests of the  USSR (Russia) as a geopolitical subject: the country's  territorial integrity, its military and economic power,  political sovereignty, spiritual and cultural distinctiveness,  and so forth....    2. In the confrontation of "democrats" and "communists" the  "conductor's" natural allies are the denationalized "democrats"  with their aspiration to "integration in the world economic  system," "entry into the market," "primacy of values common to  all mankind," and such-like ideological fetishes concealing an  absence of any national purpose whatever and the rudiments of a  state instinct.    The "communists" (who were earlier, at the dawn of their  existence, the loyal allies of the "conductor") automatically  find themselves in the role of "enemies," for the elementary  self-preservation instinct dictates to them concern for the  utmost strengthening of the social and political and  state-administrative system which ensures their dominating  position.    The propaganda formalization of this  opposition--"freedom-loving democrats against the totalitarian  monster of barracks socialism"--bears no relation here to the  heart of the matter and is intended merely to ensure that public  opinion accept the coming changes as unquestioningly as  possible....    The SECOND PHASE is the cumulative or polarization phase.  The  friends and enemies have been determined, so now it is necessary  to polarize these two forces as much as possible and to exclude  any possibility of compromise between them. Concentrated around  one pole are all those who are intended by the "conductor" to  walk out onto the stage and seize power at the end of the game,  around the other, those who have to be removed from the  political arena.    The personal question is of particular importance here.  Russia, as we all know, does not tolerate impersonal truths, and  every idea in it laying claim to realization must necessarily be  personified. It is hard to exaggerate the role of individuality,  the personality, and a striking and vigorous leader under our  conditions. This is why at this stage the experienced  "conductor" endeavors in every way possible to ensure that all  the "players" of the other side and all political leaders of the  opposition have a chance to show clearly enough what they can do  and end up here in one general political bunch. The opposite  pole, which is to be removed, should have time to attract to  itself all the forces destined to be "cut" and all leaders whose  removal guarantees the "players" who are the "conductor's"  allies maximum freedom of action.    Projecting this format onto the era of perestroyka, we find  that the period 1985 through 1989 corresponds, roughly, to the  first phase of the game, the years 1989-1990, to the second. It  was at this time that the attack on communism in the news media  came to be tied in distinctly with the assaults on statehood as  such. Full voice was given to the provocative slogans "The USSR  is the evil empire," "Patriotism is the attribute of  scoundrels," "Russian history is the history of slavery," and  such like. The propaganda of outright Russophobia and the  furious hounding of Russian writers assumed unprecedented  proportions, and the "chained curs of perestroyka" were at the  same time choking from fury apropos "Russian anti-Semitism" and  vituperated demagogically in an expectation of mythical Jewish  pogroms.    This entire barrage of hatred and cynicism pursued as a  principal purpose the ascertainment of the patriotic forces and  an evaluation of the possibilities of their influence on the  mass consciousness, a "battle reconnaissance," so to speak. In  addition, it was anticipated, not without reason, that the dirty  and insulting tone of the polemic would force the patriots, in  turn, to lapse into shrill vituperation and extremism, in this  way discrediting the very idea of patriotism and nationally  conceptualized statehood. The alliance of populists and patriots  and communists and statists, which was highly likely under these  conditions, also blended splendidly into the script of the game.    The THIRD PHASE is the crisis phase. It is, perhaps, the key  phase, the most important of all. Its realization requires of  the "conductor" particularly careful, comprehensive preparation  and the meticulous, refined craftsmanship of political intrigue.  The main content of this phase of the game is the clever  incitement of opponents against one another and the spurring of  subjective contradictions excluding the possibility of accords  geared to an escape from the crisis. The situation is converted  here into a stalemated, deadlocked condition, when turning for  help to normal, legal, and evolutionary political means becomes  impossible.    A clash of the "players" under conditions that are patently  disadvantageous to the opponents of the "conductor" and  favorable for its allies is simultaneously provoked in every  possible way here.    It was thus that events developed at the end of 1990 through  the first half of 1991. The collapse of the world socialist  system, the progressive disintegration of the USSR, the  aggressive nationalism of the outlying areas, the January events  in Lithuania, the inexplicable inaction of a general  secretary-president invested with boundless authority, the  unrest in the party masses, the hysteria of the "democratic"  news media, the defamation of the army and the loss of all  strategic allies, the disregard for the results of the March  referendum, which confirmed the country's unity--the result of  all this was that the party, more precisely, its  conservative-state wing, was left with practically no choice. It  was necessary either to unconditionally surrender in the face of  the new realities or take decisive action to stabilize the  internal and external position of the USSR.    Thus was the August "putsch" incited.    The FOURTH PHASE of the process is the power or  revolutionary  phase. It is in terms of time the shortest, but in terms of  significance, the most decisive. Its course is almost wholly  dependent on how carefully the preparation at the preceding  stage of the game has been. Of course, there is always the  element of risk, but with the competent actions of the  "conductor" it is quite small.    This phase presupposes the "players'" move beyond the  framework of the legal field and the settled political  stereotypes. This explosion creates the ideal preliminary  conditions for a decisive change in the political landscape.  Public opinion, which is in a state of shock, subsequently  allows the victorious "player" to carry out any revolutionary  manipulations in no fear of responsibility or organized  counteraction.    In the case of the Emergency Committee the deplorable result  for its sponsors and participants had been predetermined from  the outset, and the possibility of the uncontrollable  development of the "putsch" had been reduced to a minimum. The  following factors contributed to this:    1. The predictability of the event itself. The putsch had  been "in the air," so to speak, long prior to the attempt at its  practical realization. That something of the sort had to be  about to occur was obvious to the main "players" in advance so  the "initiated" had every opportunity to prepare for the  denouement.    2. The nature of the "putsch," which was phony, timid, and  indecisive from the outset. It had never been planned in earnest  even by the organizers themselves. The tacit assumption was that  a show of decisiveness and strength would in itself sort  everything out, having then become a decoration and effective  background against which stabilization measures would be  implemented easily and without hindrance.    3. The strange (to put it mildly) behavior of the head of  the  party and the state. The double game of the president-general  secretary at this stage is obvious. Having by his inaction given  the Emergency Committee the "green light," he instantly "turned  in" all his party associates as soon as the situation became  irreversible. And his personal political aims were  straightforward and comprehensible, what is more: ridding  himself of the inconvenient tutelage of the "conservatives,"  untying his hands for further political and personnel maneuvers,  and so on and so forth.    The aims of the "conductor," however, were different. And it  was they that predetermined the content of the final, fifth,  stage of this game.    The FIFTH PHASE may be defined as that of collapse. As a  result of the incited political explosion the hostile power pole  finds itself "outlawed" and is ruthlessly liquidated. The  rupture of the legal space and the paralysis of the enemy,  shaken by the unexpected turn of affairs, enable the victorious  "players" to promptly smash their opponents, rapidly occupy all  the commanding heights, and emphatically transfer the situation  to a new quality beneficial to themselves--which was anticipated  by the set of methods within whose framework the "conductor"  operated.    In the case of the August "putsch" this collapse phase  lasted  right up until December 1991, when, as a result of the Belovezha  conspiracy, which logically crowned the "perestroyka process,"  the USSR--the historical and geopolitical successor of the  Russian Empire--was legally liquidated. The sought-for "new  quality" of both the intra-Russian and global, world balance of  forces was achieved....    We have tried in the example of the Emergency Committee to  describe in the most general outlines the set of methods of  "managed catastrophe" applied for the manipulation of political  processes in Russia. Let us sum up.    IN BRIEF, THIS SET OF METHODS COULD BE FORMULATED AS  FOLLOWS:  "DIVISION--CONFLICT--DEADLOCK--EXPLOSION--COLLAPSE." The seed of  division is introduced into the ruling political grouping (or  one that already exists is stimulated). The rival factions are  artificially polarized in respect to a predetermined ideological  pair (communism--democracy; cosmopolitanism--nationalism;  capitalism--socialism; market--plan; and so forth).  Contradictions are single-mindedly inflamed, the opposition  being turned into an open conflict. This is followed by  political deadlock and then a severe crisis, in the course of  the power solution of which the "enemy" political grouping is  liquidated.    If necessary, everything is repeated all over again as the  team of victors loses its monolithic character and "undesirable"  trends begin to grow within it once again. The successive series  of such explosions time after time "filters" the political  spectrum of the ruling elite, gradually dislodging the  objectionable forces from all the structures of power and state  administration, fragmenting and destroying their social base,  and disorganizing and impeding ideological and practical  consolidation.  <H5>  And Once More October... </H5>   By the fall of 1993 the alignment of political forces in the  country was in some of its features painfully reminiscent of the  pre-putsch situation of August '91. There were also, however,  fundamentally new features that lent the situation an undoubted  distinctiveness.    The game that had been successfully staged by the  "conductor," having culminated in the collapse of the USSR and  the breakup of the party and state nomenklatura, represented  strategically merely act one of a wide-ranging scenario entitled  "The Taming of the Russian Bear." The essence of the scenario  consists, as we have already said, of the destruction of the  historically evolved geopolitical Russian "power center" and the  subsequent integration of its fragments in transnational  structures of the "single world community."    The old party elite was far from the sole obstacle on this  path. There were in the vast country many forces, different in  terms of their primary political persuasion, but equally opposed  to the "democratic" prospect of Russia's conversion into a raw  material appendage and a beachhead of the "new world order." The  "conductor" had to lure these forces--deprived to a considerable  extent of clear ideological and political self-awareness,  eroded, and unorganized--to the surface of political life and  smash them one by one, preventing their unification and  formation.    This need predetermined a repetition--at a new level--of  that  same "game cycle" we considered in the previous chapter.    The power picture of the Russian political field that had  taken shape following the liquidation of the USSR and the start  of the shock market reforms afforded every opportunity for this.  Real authority--the power structures, the news media,  operational control of the country's economic mechanism, foreign  policy, and other key spheres--was almost entirely under the  control of the president's team. On the other hand, considerable  opportunities for influencing the situation were retained by the  Supreme Soviet, which had, according to the logic of events, to  have occupied a critical position in relation to the president  and the government. Emerging from the same "democratic egg,"  these rival twins inevitably moved further apart from one  another. Things were too cramped for them together on the upper  platform of the political Olympus, and the opportunist need to  constantly declare an "independent political position"  predetermined the parallel search for their own ideology and  social base.    The first, focusing, phase of the "game" in this situation  presented the "conductor" with no great difficulty. The majority  of the old, tried-and-tested personnel was concentrated in the  radical-democratic camp of the president, which, however, did  not rule out the possibility of their reinforcement with gifted  recruits from outside and the use of supplementary strong  points. These "players" had to be enshrined in the public  consciousness as "reformers."    In accordance with the set of methods already known to us, a  negative pole, intended for liquidation, must necessarily be  counterposed to this "positive" pole. Appointed for this role  was the Supreme Soviet, which had originally not even conceived  of any conflicts but had contemplated "honorably" and "legally"  sharing power with the executive structures on the basis of the  customary backstage agreements and compromises. But its  "players" had already been assigned the role of "conservatives"  and "revanchists" in advance. Need it be said that the  hysterics, on account of the "conservative attacks" on the  "reform forces" or the "red-brown danger" allegedly threatening  the young Russian democracy, which were incited in society by  degrees, had nothing in common with reality and reflected merely  the propaganda myth within whose framework it was contemplated  preparing society for the coming events.    The situation was complicated somewhat by the presence of  increasingly independent regions, whose position it was  difficult to anticipate in advance, but it was perfectly  suitable for the game as a whole. The intensifying economic  crisis even created a particularly favorable background for it,  polarizing public opinion in natural fashion in respect to all  that was happening. In short, the first phase of the process did  not take much time, and by the start of 1992 the game had even  entered the second--cumulative--phase.    No difficulties were encountered here either. The  uncompromising and strict policy of the "reformers" and the  categorical refusal to admit to the levers of real power the  leadership of the "conservative" Supreme Soviet rapidly did its  job. The mutual insults and personal character traits of the  leaders of the opposed forces contributed to this to a  considerable extent, which showed once again that an ability to  play on human frailties and passions is an indispensable  condition of political success in a "democratic" society.    The situation developed in line of ascent throughout 1992  until it finally, in December, entered the next, conflict,  phase. Open conflict was initiated at the congress of people's  deputies by the sharply worded, provocative speech of the  president, who declared to the whole country that "it is  impossible to work with this congress."    All attempts at a compromise between the executive and the  legislature were then deliberately, it has to be assumed,  stymied. The statements of their leaders became increasingly  harsh, ultimately becoming avowedly confrontational. The  president's March attempt to impose the "special order of rule  of the country" "won" by the April Referendum, the Supreme  Soviet's transition en bloc almost to "opposition"--these are  just some of the landmarks on this path.    As the legislators became increasingly "conservative," ALL  FORCES THAT REJECTED THE PATH OF THE "DEMOCRATIC" DISMANTLING OF  RUSSIAN STATEHOOD CONCENTRATED BY DEGREES AT THIS POLE.  Ultimately it became an odd conglomerate which incorporated the  most diverse factions--from communists to monarchists. Lacking a  well-considered common program, ALL WHO WERE "AGAINST"  DEMOCRATIC EXTREMISM, GATHERED HERE, WHICH, IN FACT, IDEALLY  CORRESPONDED TO THE PREDETERMINED SCRIPT OF THE GAME.    Reality is always broader than the stereotyped pattern, so  events in this period developed at times in highly dramatic  fashion, but ultimately the required result was, nonetheless,  achieved in full.    By the fall of 1993 the political situation had obviously  become deadlocked. When, therefore, the conflict switched to the  revolutionary, power phase--as of the time the president signed  the edict on the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and the  congress--no one was particularly surprised. Its temporal  framework may be defined perfectly precisely: from 21 September  through 5 October. Carefully planned, by all accounts, it was  crowned with a "success" as complete and decisive as, it would  seem, the victors themselves even had not expected. The Supreme  Soviet was destroyed in both the literal and metaphorical  meaning of this word, and the clashes of the army and the  militia with its defenders were presented to society as a  "communo-fascist rebellion." The imposition of a state of  emergency in Moscow and the disintegration of the entire  vertical line of the soviets, down to the local soviets also,  conclusively concentrated state power in the hands of the  "reformers," who had smashed simultaneously the vast majority of  opposition political organizations and the "conservative" news  media.    The country had once again accomplished a revolutionary leap  into a new quality of its political being: FROM BENEATH THE  DISLODGED DEMOCRATIC MASK FLASHED THE BARED WOLF'S TEETH OF A  CYNICAL RUTHLESS DICTATORSHIP.    The collapse phase of this process continues, and God only  knows how far its end result will coincide with the  "conductor's" original desires. But it is possible even now to  draw some conclusions and even venture certain forecasts.  <H5>  Not Peace But the Sword... </H5>   So how are we to view the fact that the "Supreme Soviet  party" lost to the "president's party"? This question is for the  patriotic consciousness far from being as simple as might appear  at first sight.    First, "cut off" as a result of the "communo-fascist  rebellion" is to a large extent part of that same "democratic"  elite which had come to power after the "putsch" in 1991.  "Conservative" and "patriotic" slogans were for many of them  merely a tool for establishing their own political individuality  in the struggle for power, not by any means an expression of  conceptualized beliefs arrived at after considerable torment.  Compared with the democratic radicals, they would undoubtedly be  the lesser evil, but in principle.... "Same broth, only a bit  thinner," as the Russian folk saying aptly characterizes such  situations.    In addition, together with the "Supreme Soviet party"  certain  extremist organizations which had affiliated to it in the course  of the power confrontation and which had performed a patently  provocative role in the unleashing of the "rebellion" have found  themselves swept from the political stage also. This fact may be  ranked with the few positive results of the events, especially  if it is considered how much blood the patriotic movement has  been caused by the "extreme left" and the "extreme right,"  preventing the unification of the healthy forces, discrediting  the movement as a whole, inciting hysteria, and affording the  "democrats" a pretext for the dirtiest and most unbridled  accusations against the patriots.    And, finally, the main point (if we think about it, it is  clear that nothing was concluded by the events in Moscow that  followed the president's edict on the dissolution of parliament.  On the contrary, everything is only just beginning). Having won  round one of the "battle for Russia" from the party nomenklatura  in 1991, the makers of the "new world order" staged round two  also--against some of their recent allies, "incorrect" democrats  who had "degenerated" in a spirit of "imperial thinking" and  "great-power chauvinism."    But the innocent blood, clamor, and din of this struggle  attracted general attention, which had been exacerbated by the  crisis processes in many spheres of social, economic, and state  life. People involuntarily had to reflect on where the true  causes of what is happening are rooted. The result is evident:  It may confidently be said today that there has come to be  considerably more people than there were a year ago even who are  aware of the real nature of the present authorities, who  understand in what a most difficult situation Russia has found  itself today, and who are convinced that it can only be saved by  a process of the unification of all healthy forces based on our  centuries-old national-state, spiritual, and moral and religious  values.    Nor should the difficulties awaiting us on this path be  understated. Nonetheless, there is hope. No repressive edicts or  police measures of a fledgling dictatorship can halt the shift  in the public consciousness, make up for the rapid reduction in  the social base of the regime, or prevent the coming changes. It  is important, however, that the patriotic forces learn a serious  lesson from what has happened and not repeat their past mistakes  in the future. This is the guarantee of success!    There is no future for the present antipopular regime,  however. IF IT IS COMPELLED TO EXIST FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME  UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT DEVELOPMENT AND  LEGAL STABILITY, IT WILL INEVITABLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE  OPPOSITION. The present "elite" can hold on to power only by  intensifying the dictatorship. Increasingly new conflicts and  social unrest are needed as a pretext for this. It would be no  bad thing for today's exultant "democrats" to give some thought,  incidentally, as to which of them will the next time be the  victim of another political intrigue at a new turn of the brutal  game. And it is, it would seem, inevitable, for only the tops  have been cut off, the rootlets, on the other hand--the crisis  phenomena in all spheres of contemporary Russian life--have  remained entirely untouched.    The main danger is that at each new such turn the power  phase  of the conflict will become increasingly prolonged and furious,  pulling into its maelstrom increasingly large masses of people.  How this might end requires, I believe, no explanation. This  would be, for that matter, that very result, perhaps, to which  the true conductors of our troubles, ensuring the unsinkability  of the bankrupt regime, aspire.    It is not fortuitous that this regime:    Came to real power in August 1991 under the cover of  deafening populist demagogy on the wave of a powerful political  cataclysm;    remained afloat for two years after this by inflaming an  atmosphere of confrontation and political hysteria and  repeatedly provoking the opposition into collisions;    managed in the fall of 1993 to avoid a crushing political  defeat merely at the price of the organization in Moscow of  bloody clashes in which hundreds of people died.    Such a regime is a regime of civil war. And all who desire  to  avoid national catastrophe need, regardless of their political  positions, to join efforts to ensure for our people a peaceful  future and the possibility of themselves, freely and  consciously, deciding their historical destiny.

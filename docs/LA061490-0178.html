			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'IN THE WORKS' FINALE AT GASCON INSTITUTE  </P> <P> A capacity crowd braved humid conditions Sunday at the Gascon Institute to view  the last afternoon of "In the Works" this season. The program of choreography  and commentary featured dances by Susan Rose and Ferne Ackerman.  </P> <P> Rose, an early graduate of CalArts, returned to California last year after  running a Boston-based modern dance ensemble. Her "Five Little Dances" is based  on a grid of oranges. To recordings of Swedish folk music, she and Kelli King  investigated, with great concentration and humor, the range of possible  interactions between women and round fruit.  </P> <P> "First Steps in the Shape of a Song" consisted of two brief solos to music from  the sound track of "Diva." One of these was inspired, Rose told the audience,  by the shape and texture of a dried palm frond; as danced by King it had an  elegant, curving verticality.  </P> <P> Rose also showed "The Eleventh Hour," a suite for five. To a percussion score  by Mikel Rouse, it explored momentum and risk; the dancers fell backward into  waiting arms and concluded the piece balanced in a human pyramid.  </P> <P> Ferne Ackerman discussed the genesis of several of her familiar pieces and  deconstructed a new dance, "Unseen Enemies," so that the audience could observe  its inner workings. To a recording of cello music by Kodaly, four members of  her company, Big Flood, performed the dance's gestural, grasping motions,  punctuated by sharp exhalations of breath.

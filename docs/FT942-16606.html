			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Peace envoys step up Bosnia drive American and Russian negotiators yesterday stepped up pressure on Serbs and Moslems to end two years of war in Bosnia as heavy fighting raged over a strategic point south of the Gorazde enclave. Mr Charles Redman, US envoy and one of the architects of last month's landmark federation agreement between Croats and Moslems, arrived in Sarajevo to throw his weight behind the peace-making efforts of Gen Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander. He stressed that he had come to discuss an overall political settlement, not just a ceasefire deal. The Moslems have been reluctant to endorse a ceasefire for fear of consolidating Serb gains. Mr Redman said after meeting Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic: 'We have some ideas. We're are talking about them but it will, no doubt, take a few days to sort these out.' Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian negotiator, is due in Belgrade tomorrow, where he is expected to put pressure on the Serbs to agree a deal even at the cost of some territorial concessions. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has given more detailed reports of the bloodshed than the UN military command, said its representatives in Gorazde could hear 'very loud impacts' from artillery to the south. This would suggest a fight for control of the village of Vitkovici, where a munitions factory is thought to be located. If the Serbs capture it they will have moved closer to clearing a route between Serbia and eastern Bosnia, a long-standing ambition. A Serb commander claimed that his side was close to seizing the whole enclave, one of three so-called safe areas for Moslems designated by the UN. 'Soon we shall occupy the entire region of Gorazde and thus gain control over both banks of the Drina (river),' said Gen Vlado Spremo, Bosnian commander. Mr Kris Janowski, a UNHCR spokesman, said that as of yesterday morning, 83 people had been killed and 376 wounded in fighting around Gorazde, including 16 deaths in the past 24 hours. A ceasefire proclaimed by the Moslems on Thursday night appears to have brought no more than a temporary lull in fighting. Opposition politicians demanded a no-confidence vote on Croatia's defence minister following an arms warehouse explosion that sent shrapnel flying up to three miles away and left five soldiers missing, AP reports. But members of President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party charged that the move was unconnected to Thursday's blast and merely another ploy to oust right-wing Defence Minister Gojko Susak.</p>

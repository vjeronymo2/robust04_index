			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENERAL DYNAMICS UNIT PLANS TO LAY OFF 450  </P> <P> Citing the poor outlook for defense contracts, General Dynamics said Friday  that it will lay off 450 employees at its Electronics division, a 15% cut in  jobs at the San Diego-based unit and one of the biggest single layoffs in San  Diego this year.  </P> <P> The division's principal line of business is making test equipment for military  aircraft such as the F-16 fighter, the C-17 military cargo aircraft and the B-1  bomber. As aircraft orders have fallen off, so has demand for General Dynamics'  test equipment, hence the decision to cut jobs, spokeswoman Julie Andrews said.  The division employs 3,000 workers in San Diego.  </P> <P> The layoffs will be across the board, from salaried executives to hourly  workers on assembly lines. The cuts will take effect starting at the end of  January. The individuals losing their jobs will be notified after the  Thanksgiving holiday.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the Electronics division was hit with severe cost overruns  related to its SINCGARS hand-held radio used by U.S. Army ground troops to  communicate with airborne units. The overruns caused General Dynamics to take a  $50-million writeoff, a charge that contributed to the defense firm's  $240-million second-quarter loss, the largest in its history.  </P> <P> General Dynamics' Andrews said the troubled radio contract had no direct  bearing on the company's decision to reduce its payroll, however. "We are  seeing the reality of the defense downturn at General Dynamics. . . . Layoffs  in our industry have not been that infrequent lately. We are downsizing to meet  what we expect will be declining revenues."  </P> <P> The layoffs are the latest of a succession in the state's aerospace industry  this year, as contractors have been buffeted by defense spending cutbacks. As  of last month, total aerospace employment in California was 335,000 -- down  18,000 from the start of 1990, according to the UCLA Business Forecast Project.  Another 17,000 aerospace jobs will be lost in the state next year, UCLA  projects.  </P> <P> General Dynamics also said Friday that it was laying off 60 of its 8,910  Convair Division employees over the next two months. San Diego-based Convair,  which makes the Tomahawk Cruise missile, laid off 40 employees earlier this  year.  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / MPs will investigate opening of gas market The trade and industry select committee yesterday announced that it will hold an inquiry into the planned deregulation of the domestic gas market. The announcement came amid growing doubts in the gas industry that the government is still committed to the plan it announced last December to phase in domestic competition, beginning in 1996. The inquiry, which will start immediately after parliament returns from its summer recess, will examine 'the timing and the manner of opening up the domestic gas market to competition'. It will also look at the possible impact of competition on gas prices for various types of consumer. Safety, security of supply and standards of service will also be examined. Ofgas, the industry's regulator, said it did not expect the parliamentary inquiry to affect its effort to develop detailed plans to open up the residential market to competition. The Gas Consumers Council welcomed the announcement. Mr Ian Powe, the council's director, said it should make the present consultation process between the government, the regulator and industry more open.</p>

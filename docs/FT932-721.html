			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The Property Market: The lasting appeal of a country cottage  -Gerald Cadogan explains why they remain at a premium HOW DO you view cottages? As places of rural romance for weekenders to shake off the city's smoke and roar? Or as dark, damp and draughty country slums with outside lavatories, pumps for water, and smoky, decrepit cooking ranges? Both views can be true; yet, even at worst, the dream factor in cottages remains. To many people, there is enormous appeal in going to the local market to buy home-made jam and cakes from the Women's Institute stall, or to the pub for bitter beer and rustic wisdom distilled over centuries. Mix in village cricket matches and hollyhocks in the garden and you see why people pay a premium for such homes. Take Lilac Cottage in Henham Road, Elsenham, Hertfordshire, described as 'a 16th century cottage overlooking the village cricket field.' Listed grade II, and with two (or three) bedrooms, it is offered by Mullucks Wells for Pounds 155,000. A recent survey prepared by the PR Department, which represents estate agents in the home counties, reveals that the cottage market is picking up, especially in Surrey and Sussex; indeed, there are more inquiries from possible buyers than cottages for sale. 'Many potential vendors are waiting to see whether prices will rise,' says David Bedford, of estate agent Bedford. The survey found that while buyers tend towards cottages in good condition or needing a minimum of work, the unregenerate cottage has not vanished altogether. For centuries, these were the homes of the rural poor; and while many have been refurbished, plenty survive as the vernacular architecture of the countryside, using the different local materials. Two important criteria for buying a cottage are its location (the further from London, generally the cheaper) and what it is made of. Are you willing to renew the thatch regularly, or will you choose one with a tile or slate roof? If you are looking for thatch and pink paint, Mullucks Wells offers Chaureth Cottage at Cherry Green, near Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, for Pounds 138,500 while Bedford has Fir Cottage at Hengrave, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, for Pounds 159,500. Also pink and thatched is Roudham Lodge, a gem of a Victorian Gothic cottage with lancet windows, flint chimney stacks and rusticated woodwork supporting the projecting eaves. Listed grade II, with three bedrooms, it belonged to a big house near Norwich and costs around Pounds 79,000 from Savills. In brick, Bedford is selling the straightforward two-up, two-down Oak Cottage at Rougham, near Bury St Edmunds, for Pounds 89,000 and a 1967-built thatched cottage called Bridge House at Dalham, near Newmarket, for Pounds 120,000. Overlooking the green at Blackmore End, near Braintree in Essex, is Mission Cottage, the old mission hall; Pounds 145,000 from Mullucks Wells. To buy in southern counties costs more. In Hampshire, Lane Fox in Winchester is selling Rose Cottage at Cheriton, near Alresford, for Pounds 245,000 while its Basingstoke office has Blaegrove Cottage at nearby Up Nately for Pounds 300,000. Both are timbered, thatched and listed. In Surrey, Browns in Cranleigh offers the brick, stone and hung-tile three-bedroom Malthouse Cottage at Hambledon, near Godalming, for Pounds 250,000, and its Guildford office has the timbered, 16th century, two-bedroom Millmeadow Cottage at Bramley, near Guildford, for Pounds 225,000. For that price in Dorset, you can buy the four-bedroomed stone-and-thatch Chapel Cottage (which incorporates the old village chapel as a second reception room), in Melbury Osmond, near Sherborne. Humberts offers it on a leasehold as part of an estate. Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury is selling the white-painted Rookery Cottage in nearby Orcheston for Pounds 98,000. In the Lambourn valley, near Newbury in Berkshire, Mallard Cottage at Easton has three bedrooms, a stable (or office) and tack room for Pounds 155,000 (from Strutt &amp; Parker). It is well placed for the M4, which also is one way to reach the Cotswolds from London; the M40 is the other. In those cottage-strewn hills, Hill Cottage at Great Rissington, in the Windrush valley, is on offer at Pounds 135,000 from Carter Jonas - a good weekend nest but perhaps too tight for permanent occupation. A larger cottage is the School House on the village green at Whichford, near Shipston-on-Stour; for Pounds 170,000 from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe. For a single-bedroom weekend getaway, the same firm has Pixie Cottage at Naunton, near Stow-on-the-Wold, for Pounds 67,500; and, with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, HLT offers Paynes Cottage at Broadwell, between Stow and Moreton-in-Marsh, for Pounds 65,000. Meanwhile, in Tingewick, near Buckingham, KFR is selling the three-bedroomed Wood Lane Cottage for around Pounds 150,000. The south-west offers good value. Stags in South Molton, Devon, offers Hollow Tree near Chulmleigh, a white-painted thatched cottage that used to be a farmhouse. The asking price of Pounds 115,000 also includes a listed barn, a stable with three loose boxes, and a paddock. For Pounds 109,000 (reduced from Pounds 150,000), Millerson has the Old Cottage at Lewdown, near Okehampton, which has been converted from a row of quarry workers' cottages. The price includes fishing on the river Lew. As a finale, two intriguing properties. One is the 1848 Enoch's Tower, a folly at Stow-on-the-Wold with an extension giving three bedrooms; from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe for Pounds 149,950. The other is Magazine Cottage at Sedgeford, north Norfolk, from agents Bedford. The cottage was a royalist powder magazine in the civil war and was converted into a home in 1860, when it might also have been a prison. What a history for Pounds 119,500.

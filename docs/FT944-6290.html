			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Changes may raise cost of issuing new shares - Tax loopholes One of the tax loopholes to be closed by the Budget may raise the cost of issuing new shares in London. Perhaps the most significant change will close a means by which companies have avoided paying VAT on advisory fees incurred when raising new equity capital. Unlike other advisory fees which also attract VAT, companies may not offset VAT charges incurred in capital-raising exercises for shares distributed within the European Union against the VAT they charge their own customers. In effect, this 17.5 per cent charge is non-recoverable, notes Mr George Michie, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. But companies have been able to circumvent the VAT charge by creating a special tranche of shares to be sold outside the EU and allocating all the expenses to that tranche. Now, that loophole will be closed, effectively raising the cost of issuing new shares. 'Anything which puts up the cost of using the City is not good for quoted companies,' said Mr Mark Cramsie, head of corporate finance at merchant bank Singer and Fried-lander. Moreover, some merchant bankers said privately, the new rule is likely to increase pressure on advisers to lower their fees. Another change will affect the tax banks are forced to pay on the securities in which they invest their long-term regulatory capital. In effect, they will now be forced to pay tax on the unrealised investment gains of deeply discounted securities which do not pay interest annually and whose benefits will not be felt until maturity. Mr Derek Jenkins, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, notes that the Inland Revenue has suspected that banks are placing certain types of deeply discounted or index-linked holdings into special investment company subsidiaries instead of carrying them on their own trading accounts. These investment companies are not required to pay tax until maturity. Mr Jenkins noted that it is still not clear whether banks will incur capital gains tax or income tax on the unrealised gains. The chancellor moved to curtail the transfer from company to company of unused tax relief, yielding an estimated Pounds 30m a year from 1996-97. Earlier Budgets have steadily curtailed the purchase of trading companies for tax reasons, and yesterday's proposed applying the principle to investment companies such as insurers. An acquirer can no longer reduce its taxable profits by taking over an investment company and its losses, otherwise known as excess management expenses. Tax relief will be withdrawn if the investment company undergoes 'a major change in the nature or conduct of its business'. Mr Richard Piller, senior consultant at accountants Price Waterhouse, said: 'There has been a thriving market in excess management expenses throughout this year.'</p>

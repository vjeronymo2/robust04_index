			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F.J. Khergamvala: "A Black Mark Against Indian </F> Foreign Policy"]    [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 10.    Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife of the U.S. President, has  described the events in South Africa today as the greatest day  of the 20th century. Few would disagree with that, but among  those few are the Indian political leadership, including the  Opposition. Otherwise, considering every foreign policy  denominator, India should have been represented in Pretoria at  the highest political level from each party.    The Vice President, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, is no doubt high  ranking in the Indian order, but on the world scale the post of  an Indian Vice President does not count. Not for this event in  any case. By any yardstick, the presence of over a million  Indians in South Africa, India's historical leadership in the  fight against apartheid, future economic and political interests  in the Indian Ocean region with a major power and purely from  the point of national sentiment should have compelled the top  Indian leadership to be present in Pretoria, irrespective of  whether it is close to a working visit to the U.S. This is a  sentiment very widely shared among senior Indian diplomats.  Without exception, it is their view that Rajiv Gandhi would have  certainly not missed the moment. Those who pretend to swear by  his ideals certainly have missed the opportunity of shaking the  hand of one of the greatest men of this century during his  finest hour.    Pakistan, Portugal, Ireland, to name a few, have hardly any  ties or a historical record to speak of with South Africa,  compared with that of India. But they are all there either  represented by the President or the Prime Minister. One  commentator perhaps diagnosed the malaise accurately. He felt  that beyond the U.S. and Pakistan nothing ever makes this  leadership sit up and grab an opportunity. The fundamental  moorings of Indian foreign policy are being taken apart, root by  root. Despite all the noise against Islamabad, any objective  Indian observer must hand it to Pakistan that it seldom loses an  opportunity to make its point. The Commonwealth summit in  Limassol was a case in point, where Ms. Benazir Bhutto rushed  there immediately after her inauguration with New Delhi left  making excuses.    Dr. Fidel Castro, Mr. Yasser Arafat, Dr. Robert Mugabe, all  cause celebre of the Non-aligned Movement rubbed  shoulders with the likes of an American Vice President and the  country's First Lady. Even Israel's President was there, a true  indication of how countries can dexterously indicate recognition  of new interests. It is something to be noted that of all  countries that are touchy or sensitive about foreign leaders  being absent from an event being hosted, India ranks at the top.  The poor attendance at the second attempt at a G-15 summit a  month and half back was perhaps a good indication of how others  respond to a country whose leadership is appearing increasingly  insular. Spokesmen will, of course, provide all the reasons,  that a warm message was carried by the Vice President, that  India was suitably represented, but the fact remains that in  Pretoria's record books India did not take the occasion  seriously enough. New Delhi knows this very well because the  Ministry of External Affairs [MEA] itself keeps a close account  of which country did or did not send leaders for funerals in New  Delhi.    There had been some speculation among Indian officials that  India's Prime Minister wished to avoid encounters with his  Pakistani counterpart. It would probably more accurate to say  that the age and infirmity of Indian leaders lies behind their  reluctance to undertake such a historical mission. The leaders  of each of India's political parties are doubtless either very  old or not fit enough.    Ordinarily, a strong External Affairs Minister would press  the country's Prime Minister to attend such a world event. But  then the quality of the political leadership in the MEA is all  too well known. Correspondingly, the visit of key Opposition  leaders is either initiated and organised by the External  Affairs Minister or requests come in from these opposition  figures that they would like to be present in an official Indian  delegation at such events. A bit sarcastically, perhaps there is  indeed a consensus in India among the opposition and with the  ruling party. All they think of and speak about are Pakistan and  the U.S. The message sent out to the Indians in South Africa and  those who now govern them is not a healthy one.</p>

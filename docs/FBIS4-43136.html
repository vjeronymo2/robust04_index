			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Schwarz: "Clinton's Sad European </F> Balance Sheet"]    [Text] The D-Day celebrations and Bill Clinton's trip to  Europe have given rise to many historical observations. One  could be: Europe has rarely seen a similarly colorless U.S.  President who is more prone to attack and has as little  substance.    Prone to attack: The fact that, when the leader of the last  superpower sits beside the beautiful wife of the Italian prime  minister, the international press only mocks the "womanizer"  Clinton, giving the clear image of a president who has  practically admitted to having had an affair before his  presidency and is looking for presidential immunity in case of  possible further accusations. There are far heavier burdens:  "Whitewater" is still waiting for him at home and his staff is  constantly being decimated through suicide, resignation, or  investigations.    Colorless: Anyone who watched the President in Normandy --  how he pretended to be shocked -- who heard how he justified his  refusal to serve in Vietnam, but regretted the lack of military  experience (by referring to the war movies of his childhood),  who saw what figure Bill Clinton cut in the interview with  Francois Mitterrand, can only agree with the annoyed veterans:  Youth is not a disgrace, but no one wants to take this paleness  seriously.    Lack of substance: The fact that Bill Clinton was the first  U.S. President since Woodrow Wilson to speak at the French  National Assembly is the only remarkable thing about this event.  The call for a strong Europe (as a counterpart to the  withdrawing United States) would not have needed this historical  frame; one would have known anyway how determined Clinton is  about his foreign policy -- see Bosnia, China, and North Korea.    Lastly, the President went to Oxford to receive an honorary  doctorate. And the renowned ECONOMIST, which once recommended  that people vote for Clinton, received him in an editorial with  terms such as "inconsistent," "no backbone," "embarrassing,"  and, therefore, "in the corner" out of his own fault. What can  one add to that?</p>

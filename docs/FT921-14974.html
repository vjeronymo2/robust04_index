			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Israel agrees diplomatic links with China MR DAVID LEVY, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday Israel and China had agreed to establish diplomatic relations for the first time, a step likely to be formally concluded later this month when he visits Beijing. Final consummation of the relationship, long sought by Israel, would complete the Jewish state's formal ties to all five members of the United Nations Security Council following the re-establishment of full relations with the then Soviet Union last year. It would clear away any Israeli objections to Chinese participation in the multilateral phase of the Middle East peace talks due to open in Moscow on January 28, just as the resumption of ties with the Kremlin opened the way for the Soviet Union - its place now assumed by Russia - to co-sponsor the peace negotiations with the US. The third round of so-far fruitless bilateral talks between Israel and the Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians and Palestinians are set to get under way in Washington today. There are hopes that a proceand the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation will be overcome, but Israel says its negotiators will not stay in the US beyond Thursday, narrowing the room for substantive progress until a fourth round at a location yet to be determined. Israel has been pressing China to make the move to a formal diplomatic relationship for years, to draw Beijing away from its close public support for Arab nations. Ironically, however, the two sides have well-established informal trading links with an emphasis on military products, which has upset Washington since US military sales to China were banned after the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. Israel opened a scientific liaison office in Beijing in 1990, but had become an important source of technological support in areas from arms to agriculture well before then. Reports have emerged of extensive defence industry co-operation, including Israeli contracts for equipping Chinese tanks, jet fighters and possibly advanced missiles.</p>

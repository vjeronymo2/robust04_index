			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKID ROW ARTIST EXPERIENCING A RENAISSANCE;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: HIS WORK GOES ON DISPLAY IN LACE PROGRAM TO HELP THE DOWN AND OUT WHO  HAVE VISION.  </P> <P> Some might consider Frank Parker lucky by Skid Row standards. An artist with  his own "studio," Parker has found several small shops in which to sell his  works.  </P> <P> In addition, Parker has become fairly prominent among the surprisingly large  group of artists living on Skid Row. His drawings grace the covers of  publications by the Homeless Writers Coalition. Now, his works are being  displayed in two simultaneous downtown shows -- one at Los Angeles Contemporary  Exhibitions and the other at the Weingart Center Cafe.  </P> <P> Still, the going for Parker is not easy. While preparing for his current shows,  Parker found that several years' worth of his drawings, as well as a number of  his sculptures, had disappeared from his makeshift storage space in a friend's  garage. But rather than getting discouraged, Parker looked at the experience as  "a great excuse to do new works."  </P> <P> He's working in his "studio" -- actually an oblong concrete and brick storage  space with intermittently dripping overhead pipes adjacent to an unused loading  dock in an old Skid Row building.  </P> <P> Parker is one of more than 30 artists working through LACE's Skid Row Artists'  Fund, which provides artists with up to $25 monthly in art supplies. The newest  feature of the program, called "Art From the Streets," allows artists to show  their works in rotating lobby exhibitions.  </P> <P> "Through the exhibition program, people can see that people that are homeless  are creative, that they can make serious art and that they do have vision,"  said the program's coordinator, Adriene Jenik. "I'm not just interested in  showing homeless art because it's homeless art, and I don't think the artists  want to be exploited that way either. I want to show something that can be  taken seriously."  </P> <P> The "seriousness" of his art is why Jenik selected Parker for this particular  exhibition, which opens tonight and runs through July 29. On view are works  from Parker's "Conversation" series -- mixed-media pieces made of Scotch tape  and interwoven colored bits of telephone wire, as well as a sculptural piece  made from objects such as old mattress springs.  </P> <P> Before finding himself on Skid Row, Parker, 44, had shows at several locations  including a number of colleges and community spaces and galleries in Santa  Barbara, San Diego, New York and Pennsylvania. In 1977, he was featured in the  Long Beach Museum of Art's "Studio Z: Individual Collective." He lived for a  time in Venice, had a studio on Slauson Avenue, a steady job as an exhibit  technician at the Museum of Science and Industry, and was taking art courses at  Claremont Graduate School.  </P> <P> But when personal problems -- which he declined to discuss -- disrupted his  life in the late '70s, Parker began taking odd jobs. He dropped out of graduate  school, vowing to return someday, but eventually his money ran out. A little  over a year ago, he found himself on the streets of Skid Row, which he said was  "a better alternative" to some of his other options.  </P> <P> He was a regular at "Another Planet," the celebrated Skid Row cultural center  that had been formed out of a converted garage. But like many artists, Parker  was hit hard when the building burned down last August. He lost many of his  artworks, as well as all his slides and documentation of past works stored  there.  </P> <P> "Just doing my own work was hard to do," Parker said, noting that now he works  daily on his art. "I had no space of my own, it was hard to hold on to my tools  and there was no privacy."  </P> <P> Today he works as a handyman in exchange for his small studio/living space in  the old Wall and Boyd Building -- the same building in which noted artists  George Herms and Lita Albuquerque have their studios -- he is able to support  himself through sales of his small sculptures, which can be worn as jewelry  (most are priced from $5-$25). Also a big help, Parker said, are the free  supplies and the verbal support he receives from LACE.  </P> <P> The original Skid Row Artists' Fund -- paid for by an anonymous donor -- was  set up about a year ago through downtown's Roark Art Supplies, which sells  goods to LACE at below wholesale costs. Artists then come to LACE's Jenik for  their monthly supplies.  </P> <P> "We began the artists' fund basically because of where LACE is situated," Jenik  said. "Skid Row and (its) community members are certainly a part of our  community. People would come by looking for a job and see what we were doing  and say, 'Hey, I'm an artist, too.' So we began to set up a program to work  with the Skid Row people."  </P> <P> With the help of $5,000 from the city's Cultural Affairs Department, Jenik is  expanding the homeless artists' program once again. Beginning June 13, LACE  will co-sponsor weekly art classes to be taught by visiting artists at the  Homeless Outreach Program offices. Also provided will be desperately needed  storage space for artists to keep their art and supplies.  </P> <P> "It's a step toward the ideal situation, which would be for (the Skid Row  artists) to get a space of their own," Jenik said. "We hope to start  (money-making) projects and things like sales of artworks to make the program  self-maintaining."  </P> <P> Establishing the homeless artists programs has not been easy, Jenik said. Many  of the artists have no addresses or phone numbers, and sometimes she must  search the streets to find them. In addition, health problems have interfered,  such as with the first "Art From the Streets" exhibition, in which the  scheduled artist -- portraitist Myshicka Jerome -- was hospitalized with a bone  disease a few days before his show's opening.  </P> <P> "It's really crazy sometimes working with (homeless artists). There's no  telling what could happen at any moment," Jenik said. "So with all this stuff,  we're really flexible -- we have to be."  </P></p>

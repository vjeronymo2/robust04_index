			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" statement by Serbian Prime Minister Mirko </F> Marjanovic for Belgrade Television; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] The passing of the budget of the Republic of Serbia  means laying the foundations in the realization of the  reconstruction of the monetary system and economic revival of  the country. The basis of this program is a stable dinar,  stable prices, and the reanimation of production. We expected  the passing of the budget as it was carried out today and I can  say that, naturally, I am satisfied with this result in the  Serbian Assembly today. I would only like to emphasize that  individual opposition leaders objecting to the adoption of this  budget actually means a demagogic and defeatist approach and  proves once again that they were not right when they declined to  take part in the government and were left on the margin of all  events in the struggle for better life of this nation.</p>

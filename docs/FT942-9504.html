			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Ukrainians tend their gardens amid muddle and weakness: Jill Barshay on the consequences of government paralysis Ukraine's future is looking as uncertain as ever, despite the convening of a new parliament last week. The parliament was unable to elect a head and is preoccupied with forming politically expedient, but unstable, coalitions and arguing over the imperfect election law which brought it to power. No decisions appear to be in prospect on critical issues, such as whether to hold next month's presidential elections or to launch economic reform. President Leonid Kravchuk is so weak he cannot amass enough support to put issues on the parliament's agenda and the government, which is likely to be replaced in the coming months, is paralysed by infighting and the election season. Negotiations with Russia have collapsed over division of the Black Sea Fleet. An International Monetary Fund group is in Kiev, but Ukraine is still unable to meet the rather lenient conditions required to release Dollars 700m (Pounds 480m) in loans. 'Ukraine is a rudderless ship, with no direction, drifting at sea,' said one western diplomat. Despite the depth of the governmental paralysis, Ukraine remains socially and political stable. There have been no mass protests or strikes for nearly a year. While Crimea is continuing to strengthen its links with Russia, it has stepped back from outright secession. Nuclear warheads are being transferred to Russia according to the deal brokered by the US. Inflation has been reduced from 90 per cent a month last December to 6 per cent in April. A market economy has been slowly emerging as private businessmen openly flout Kiev's stifling laws to survive. But this promising underground economy, largely of trade and services, is functioning without rules, providing ample opportunity for growth in organised crime and corruption. At the same time the legal economy has plummeted further. After years of 20 per cent annual declines, Ukraine's official statistics show a 34 per cent drop in GDP in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year. Last Friday the factory which produces the affordable, albeit shabby, Zaporozhetz car announced production was to be halted because unreasonable taxes were taking 100 per cent - and more - of profits. Mr Kravchuk has been squeezing the debt-ridden state industry for his budget while those who produce non-durables have easily evaded taxes. Ukrainians, on average, earn about Dollars 18 a month - 40 per cent short of the Dollars 30 required to buy a basket of basic goods, such as bread and butter. Instead of going to work, Ukrainians spend most of their time planting vegetable gardens at their dachas to ensure they do not starve this year. Discontent among the old ex-communist establishment, Mr Kravchuk's main support base, is a great problem for him. His rhetoric on economic reform threatens their easy access to state subsidies as his policies destroy their ability to maintain even low levels of industrial production. Having previously said he would not stand in the presidential race and prepared to cancel presidential elections and rule by decree, Mr Kravchuk made an about-face and registered as a presidential candidate at the end of April. Though still trying to garner support to postpone elections through frequent television and radio broadcasts, the dejected leader left the opening meeting of parliament alone without uttering a word last Wednesday. The continuing muddle may provide a victory to the left if elections - both presidential and local - are held next month. Communists will be able to argue that the current decay is the result of market reforms, a potent notion in Ukraine where living standards were much higher under Soviet rule, rather than the result of inaction. 'Reform has never had a chance here, but it's being hung out to dry,' says a western official.</p>

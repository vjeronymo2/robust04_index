			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: UK vending contract FOUR SQUARE, a UK-based subsidiary of Mars, the US confectionery and petfood multinational, has won a Pounds 50m contract to supply Apex of Japan with 33,000 tea and coffee vending machines, as well as drinks, over the next three years. Apex is a market leader in Japan, operating more than 50,000 office-based drinks vending machines, with an annual turnover of Y7.3bn (Pounds 43m) in 1992. Japan has some 5.5m vending machines - about one for every 20 people - and almost half are drinks dispensers. Four Square, based at Basingstoke in the UK, is understood to have an annual turnover in the region of Pounds 100m; the deal with Apex thus represents an important boost to the company's revenues.</p>

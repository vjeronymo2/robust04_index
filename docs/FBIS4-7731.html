			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "President--Parliament, </F> Coalition, Government; Conflict Over Everything"]    [Excerpts] There are increasingly fewer issues in which  the president, parliament, and the government are harmoniously  cooperating with one another. The Constitution, the concordat,  the deputy ministerial posts in the Ministry of National  Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, the new Popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] Law, the vacant post of the deputy prime minister and  finance minister, the National Council of Radio and Television  [KRRiT]--these are the most important areas of the current  conflict. [passage omitted]    The next predictable disputes between the president and the  parliament along with the coalition will be over KRRiT, when the  report of the council is voted on and if the Constitutional  Tribunal decides that Walesa did not have the right to recall  Marek Markiewicz. Another controversial issue may be the  concordat, if the Sejm rejects it, first of all with the votes  of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].    A storm will be caused by the president's decision  concerning  the budget, regardless of what the president finally decides.  If he vetoes the budget law, the coalition will accuse him of  impeding reforms, populism, destructive activities. If he signs  this law, he will cause a storm himself because he will want to  justify the decision--to Solidarity, for instance. The  foretaste of the storm can already be felt when Walesa  criticizes the coalition for not implementing its preelection  promises and for deceiving the people.    Now and then one of the coalition politicians...  <H5>  Will Try To Frighten the President </H5>   ...with prospects of limiting his powers--that is, something  he does not like listening to the most. The president will  repay in kind with threats of earlier elections--that is, he  will hit the most sensitive spot of the parliament members and  the coalition. On this issue, however, probably neither party  will take any specific steps in the near future. The coalition  seems to be aware of the fact that an attempt to limit Walesa's  powers would mean total war.    In the Thursday [31 March] interview for the PAP press  agency, Walesa implied very clearly that, in such a situation,  he would ask the people to decide. "Then I would tell the  people: You fought for Walesa, we fought for a president, and  now we can see a monopoly of the communist type being  established. Do you agree to that? Are you not afraid that  communism is coming back in the way power is wielded and that it  wants to exclude the president--not Walesa but the president?  Therefore, if you do not wake up now, if you do not make your  deputies retreat from that, I will not guarantee further  stability processes."    In the future, we may witness a conflict over who should  carry out Poland's foreign policy. Lech Walesa likes to make  decisions in this area himself, and the activeness of the  parliament members who willingly travel abroad is beginning to  irritate him.    Walesa is not directing his criticism at the government or  the prime minister. If he vetoes the new popiwek law, it will  be a propaganda blow delivered to the parliament, to the  coalition that passed this law and not to the government, which  prepared it and forwarded it to the Sejm. If the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister is still vacant, it is the  result of the game played between Walesa and the coalition, not  the government.  <H5>  It Is Not the Government That Is the Evil Spirit </H5>   ...but the parliament and the coalition, or, in fact, the  SLD. This does not mean that he protects the government. The  reason for this is more banal: He may gain more, in terms of  prestige, in a war with the parliament or with the SLD; one of  the reasons for this is the fact that the government is for the  time being not perceived as one "close-knit" team. Now, it is  known that a good opponent is one that is clear and specific.</p>

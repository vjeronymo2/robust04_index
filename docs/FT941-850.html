			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Confidence in Latin America shaken - International The turmoil in Latin American markets last week following the assassination in Mexico of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, may further test the confidence of investors in the so-called emerging markets. After a strong performance last year, emerging debt markets ran out of steam at the beginning of 1994 and went into retreat. Yield spreads of Latin American bonds over US Treasuries had already deteriorated this year, due to fears of rising US interest rates. According to Salomon Brothers' Brady bond index, investors made a return of 43.87 per cent last year. Since the start of this year, the index has shown a negative return of 14.48 per cent. Investors had been bargain-hunting for Latin American bonds earlier in the week, in the belief that the market was looking cheap, but news of the assassination on Thursday sent prices of most Latin American bonds tumbling. According to traders, most activity was in liquid benchmark issues. For example, the yield spread on the Republic of Argentina's Dollars 1bn offering of 10-year global bonds widened from 300 basis points over US Treasuries before the assassination to more than 350 basis points immediately after the news. The spread has since narrowed to around 320 basis points and some traders expect the spread to improve further as the market regains its poise. By contrast, the spreads on Latin American Eurobonds denominated in D-Marks barely moved, mainly because the majority are owned by long-term investors. The spread on Argentina's DM1bn offering of five-year Eurobonds, which had been launched last September at a yield spread of 250 basis points over German government notes, stayed at around 208 basis points. Several factors are likely to help stabilise Latin American bond prices over the coming weeks, ranging from the Dollars 6bn credit line from the US and Mexico's admission into the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, the first Latin American nation to enter this influential club of industrialised democracies. Standard &amp; Poor's swift affirmation of its BB+ rating on Mexico's long-term dollar debt and the positive outlook on the rating has also given the market some support. Nevertheless, syndicate managers say the volatility in spreads over the last week has made it virtually impossible for Latin American borrowers to gain access to the market at the spreads they were able to command during last year's bull run. Mr Keith Vincent, head of emerging markets syndicate at Bankers Trust in London, says that although deals can still be done, it is difficult to get the best pricing and distribution. 'At this moment, trying to match previous benchmarks is not possible.' In addition, banks which won mandates from Latin American borrowers up to four months ago are having to go back to their clients to renegotiate the terms and structure of the planned deals, due to the acute price movements in the secondary market. More often than not, issuers which are not in a hurry for the cash are choosing to delay fundraising until conditions improve. On Friday, Petrobras, Brazil's state oil monopoly, announced that it was delaying the launch of a Dollars 150m issue of Eurobonds denominated in D-Marks, which had been planned for the end of March. But why has the assassination knocked not only the Mexican market, but other Latin American markets, and even some apparently unassociated emerging markets? The fact is that Mexico, because of its strong association with the US and its relatively advanced economic development, is viewed as a benchmark for the rest of Latin America. 'Mexico is seen as the creme de la creme, even though it doesn't yet have an investment grade rating,' says Mr Michael Brook, a director of West Merchant Bank. '(The assassination) has cast a long shadow.' Coming so soon after the rebellion in Chiapas, the assassination was seen by some investors as showing that political risk in Mexico has deteriorated, and the likelihood of an investment grade rating this year may have receded, according to Mr Brook. 'Psychologically, the reaction is 'if this can happen in Mexico, what could go wrong in Venezuela - or in Russia?'' said one trader in secondary market debt. Indeed, Venezuelan bonds were the worst performers among Latin American Brady bonds last week, slipping 5 per cent compared with 3 1/2 per cent for Mexico on Salomon's Brady bond index. Mexican par bonds ended the week at about 70 cents on the dollar, having dropped as low as 64 cents, following the assassination. Paradoxically, the markets may even, in the medium term, be in better shape now. 'The way I see the markets, we are now back at levels of a year ago. This is fair value. The rest (of the rally) was indiscriminate money,' said Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed income at F&amp;C Emerging Markets.</p>

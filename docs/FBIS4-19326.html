			<p>BFN     [Text] Wiesbaden/Biblis -- A leaky fuel rod in the  controversial Block A of the Biblis nuclear power plant in  southern Hesse is the presumable cause for higher radioactivity  in the cooling water. This was announced by the Hesse  Environment Ministry today. According to the ministry, a higher  degree of radioactivity than usual was detected in a sample of  the primary circuit on Friday [15 April]. Gaseous iodine 131  escaped from the apparently leaky fuel rod. Thus, the  radioactivity of the cooling water is to be examined twice daily  instead of once.    The director of the nuclear power plant, Klaus Distler,  however, spoke of a "routine procedure." Leaky fuel rods occur  in every power plant and do not suggest a technical problem.  Among the approximately 250,000 fuel rods that are being used  in Block A, such an event cannot be ruled out. "Thus, years  without leaky fuel rods are an exception," Distler stressed.  According to the director, the fuel rods are used between three  and four years.</p>

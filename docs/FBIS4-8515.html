			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 13 April carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast three reports on the continued  fighting in the republic.    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the  chetniks  are still at the access points to Gorazde. They have fiercely  begun the 17th day of their offensive on Gorazde by firing all  available weapons on residential areas and defense lines. Last  night and overnight, the situation was particularly dramatic in  the village of Vitkovici. Attempts to kill the local population  -- women, children, and old people -- continue this morning.  The chetniks are shelling the population of (?Basnjak),  Vinarici, and [name indistinct]. In the course of their  butchering, fascist rampage, the chetniks yesterday set ablaze  the villages of Kucine and Zmijuki and massacred the women and  children. We have no information on the number of slaughtered  and imprisoned. The number of villages that have been burned in  this offensive alone has climbed to 30, while casualties and  refugees amount to several thousand."    Mirza Sadikovic, correspondent from Bihac, says that  "Karadzic's terrorists overnight continued to attack the Bihac  commune. Buzim, (?Plavas), [name indistinct], and other  villages in the area continue to be the target of artillery  attacks. The aggressor also fired at the positions of the  defenders on this part of the Bosanksa Krupa front and on the  Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez. Several times the  chetniks attempted infantry breakthroughs in these areas, but  they were decisively repelled. The members of the paramilitary  forces of the Kladusa traitors also continued their activity.  They attacked in the areas of Todorovo, Pecingrad, Skokovi, and  [name indistinct] with chetnik [word indistinct] and artillery  support. Overnight, the chetniks also shelled the Bihac and  Cazin areas [words indistinct]."    Olovo correspondent Amira Salibasic reports on an extremely  poor line and says that "the night was somewhat calmer on the  Olovo front. However, the defense lines are still the target of  destructive howitzer, mortar, and tank shells."</p>

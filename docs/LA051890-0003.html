			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUJAN AND SQUIRRELS  </P> <P> There they go again. The environmentalists have placed another animal on the  endangered species list.  </P> <P> It is called the red squirrel. I wonder how much longer it will be before the  mosquitoes, flies, ants and cockroaches are on their list. It seems like the  environmentalist won't be satisfied until the animals and insects are in  complete control and we are all out of work.  </P> <P> FREDERICK D. MULLEN  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

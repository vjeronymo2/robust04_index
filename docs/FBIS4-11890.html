			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F> Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the "Arabs' Home"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Mr. Yemeni Foreign Minister and Chairman of  the 101st session of the Arab Foreign Ministers' Council:  Following the withdrawal of the international forces from  Somalia, which coincided with the signing of the national  reconciliation accord among the Somali leaders in Nairobi, what  is the role of the Arab forces? Was this topic placed on the  agenda?    [Basindwah] At this session the council was informed that  some Arab states that have contributed forces to the  peacekeeping troops in Somalia intend to withdraw their forces.  Naturally, if the Somalis agree among themselves and engage in  a quiet and objective dialogue, they will not need forces to  safeguard their security and stability. It seems that the  existing situation in Somalia will not continue. Somalia will  inevitably emerge from its current crisis, God willing.    [Hijazi] Yemen is a member of the Arab League. Yemen's  security is part of Arab national security. How can Yemen  overcome its domestic crisis and what are the latest  developments in this crisis?    [Basindwah] Thank you for your question. On this occasion I  would like to make it clear that the situation in Yemen is now  better than before. The cabinet convened in Aden on Wednesday.  It reconvened in Aden on Sunday. The cabinet is expected to  meet in Ta'izz tomorrow. The Presidential Council will meet in  Sanaa tomorrow. We hope all constitutional establishments will  resume their work in Sanaa within one month. Naturally, if what  has happened in Yemen had happened in another Arab country or  another developing country, civil war would have broken out.  Despite the passage of seven months since the crisis began, we  Yemenis have not been dragged into a civil war or ferocious  infighting. This proves that despite our differences and  disputes, we have been able to steady our nerves and apply  political pressure on each other without reaching the level of a  civil war.</p>

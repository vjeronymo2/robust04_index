			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Defeat of an  anti-China draft resolution at a U.N. commission meeting is a  victory for China as well as for the forces of justice in the  international community, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  said here today.    On March 9, the 50th session of the United Nations  Commission  on Human Rights decided, by a vote of 20 to 16, not to take  action on the draft resolution tabled by some Western countries  on the so-called "situation of human rights in China", thus  frustrating the attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs  under the pretext of human rights issues.    "This is not only a victory for China, but more important,  it  is a victory of the united struggle of the forces of justice in  the international community," the spokesman said.    In recent years, the spokesman noted, China has made  remarkable achievements in its reform and opening drive. A  situation unprecedented in its history has prevailed throughout  the country, featuring political stability, economic growth and  a life of peace and contentment.    However, he said, in total disregard of these facts, a few  Western countries once again tabled an anti-China draft  resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.    The spokesman pointed out: "This only shows that they are  not happy with the achievements the Chinese people have made.  In fact, by feigning concern about the human rights situation  in China, they harbor the true intention to exert political  pressure on China and interfere in its internal affairs."    This act of politicizing the human rights issues and  practice  of hegemony undoubtedly met with the opposition of the majority  members of the U.N. commission, he added.    The spokesman noted that the anti-China draft resolutions  tabled successively in 1990, 1992 and 1993 by some Western  countries all failed to be put to vote. This year, they  suffered yet another defeat.    He stated: "A just cause enjoys abundant support while an  unjust cause finds little support. The attempt by a small  number of countries to manipulate U.N. activities in the field  of human rights by way of power politics is unpopular and bond  to fail."    "Gone are the days when China was subjected to willful  bullying, humiliation and outside interference. And no one can  stop the Chinese people from marching victoriously along the  correct path of their own choosing," he stressed.    He expressed the admiration and thanks of the Chinese  Government to all countries that have upheld justice and  supported China and its appreciation for those that withheld  their support for the anti-China draft resolution.    "The Chinese Government wishes to reiterate its willingness  to work with the international community on the basis of  equality and mutual respect and under the guidance of the  principles of the U.N. Charter in a common effort to promote and  protect human rights," the spokesman concluded.</p>

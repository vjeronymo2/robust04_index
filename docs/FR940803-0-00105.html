			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AMFA also limits the maximum model year increase in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's CAFE attributable to dual-fueled automobiles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2 mpg for model years 1993 through 2004 and, if extended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Transportation, to 0.9 mpg for model years 2005  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 2008 for each compliance category of automobiles (i.e.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestic passenger, import passenger, domestic light truck, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import light truck). 15 U.S.C. 2013(g). Furthermore, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Transportation reduces the average fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard applicable to passenger automobiles to less than 27.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mpg for any model year, increases above 0.7 mpg in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's average fuel economy attributable to dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger automobiles are to be reduced by the amount the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard was lowered, but may not be reduced to yield less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.7 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the second area, fuel economy labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the AMFA section 8, 15 U.S.C. 2006(a), requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that specific fuel economy information for dedicated alterative-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled automobiles and dual-fueled automobiles appear on the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy label and in the Gas Mileage Guide published by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Energy. For dedicated automobiles, the AMFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that the fuel economy for labeling purposes shall be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel economy value calculated for CAFE purposes multiplied by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value, 0.15. 15 U.S.C. 2006(a)(4)(A). For dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobiles, the AMFA 15 U.S.C. 2006(a)(4)(B) states that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label must: (i) Indicate the fuel economy of such automobiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when operated on gasoline or diesel fuel; (ii) clearly identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such automobiles as dual-fueled automobiles; (iii) clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify the fuels on which such automobiles may be operated; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) contain a statement informing the consumer that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information is contained in the booklet published and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed by the Department of Energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To administer the provisions of the AMFA described above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 1, 1991. The purpose of the NPRM was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to propose to integrate the requirements of the AMFA into EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing fuel economy regulations (40 CFR part 600) and to frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues of potential interest to commenters. Again, as stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``Summary'' section, today's final rule does not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobiles that do not meet the eligibility requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favorable CAFE treatment specified in the AMFA. Also, to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant delays, this final rule only covers those fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the AMFA at the time of proposal, namely alcohols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and natural gas, and does not address the other fuels added by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Energy Policy Act of 1992, since this Act was passed well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after publication of the NPRM and late in the development of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule. EPA will include these other fuels in a future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate rulemaking. The sections that follow describe the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that have been adopted and the consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment that led to decisions regarding the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Description of the Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's final rule sets in place the CAFE credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism and the fuel economy labeling requirements for the 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and later model year alternative-fueled vehicles covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMFA, namely alcohol and natural gas automobiles. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since emission standards and emission measurement procedures have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already been developed for methanol-fueled automobiles (54 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14426), fuel economy measurement procedures for methanol-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are also included in today's rule. The fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations for methanol-fueled vehicles are based on the carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance technique which relies on the premise that the quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of carbon contained in the exhaust is equal to the quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon consumed by the engine as fuel. The proposed equation was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on fixed fuel properties. However, based on comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in response to the NPRM, EPA decided that measured fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties are more appropriate for the calculation of fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy and, therefore, today's final rules are based on measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel properties. This is further discussed in section V. ``Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participation''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is currently developing emission standards, emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures, and fuel economy calculation procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas-fueled vehicles in a separate rulemaking. The notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of proposed rulemaking, ``Standards for Emissions From Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor Vehicle Engines, and Certification Procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aftermarket Conversion Hardware'' was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52912). EPA expects that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule will be promulgated in advance of the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1993 model year annual production period, after which CAFE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the 1993 model year is calculated, thereby allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to obtain CAFE credits for 1993 model year and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later natural gas-fueled vehicles. In the event that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking cannot be promulgated in time, EPA expects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate those portions regarding fuel economy test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation procedures in order to ensure fuel economy credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are available for 1993 model year natural gas-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

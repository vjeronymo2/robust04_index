Asked to comment on the  Indian-born writer's fears that government backing was waning, Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher replied that "the government has not changed its position at  all on this." In Tehran, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said it would be  difficult to repair the diplomatic damage done by Rushdie's book, "The Satanic  Verses." "Even if the apostate Rushdie is executed, if Britain apologizes or if  the book is withdrawn, the rift remains part of a global arrogance plot,"  Tehran Radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.  </P></p>

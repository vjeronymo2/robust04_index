			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> COME AGAIN? Youth gangs in Irvine? Police say some gangs are forming (B10), but  what do school officials say? . . . School administrators are legendary for  their circumlocution, and the Irvine Unified School District's apparently are  no different. Asked whether Irvine campuses have gang activity, a spokesman  replied: "We're seeing some increase in the number of young people who are  demonstrating some posturing of group affiliation that may be inappropriate." .  . . Translation: "A little." Jeffrey Perlman and Helene Elliott and Tom  McQueeney  </P></p>

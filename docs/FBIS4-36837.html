			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations HQ. (New York), June 13, IRNA --  Iran's Permanent Envoy to the United Nations Kamal Kharazi today  protested the U.S. warships and helicopters' interruption and  chase of Iranian naval boats and helicopters engaged in routine  duty in the waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.    Kharazi in a letter to the UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali pointed out 10-cases of interruption by the  intruding American naval fleet in Iran's regional waters between  October 20 to February 5, 1994.    The Iranian non-military boats and helicopters were on their  routine inspection tour of off-shore oil platforms when the U.S.  warships, helicopters and fighters interrupted their course and  started taking video films and photographs of the Iranian  installations in the Persian Gulf.    The letter was circulated here as a U.N. document today.    Last month Iran had protested to America through its  interest  section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.</p>

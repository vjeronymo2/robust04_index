			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National </F> Party, by an unidentified EXTRA SLOVENSKO reporter; place and  date not given: "Nationally Aware `Diehards'"--reprinted from  issue No. 9 of EXTRA SLOVENSKO]    [Text] "Mr. Slota, you were elected chairman of the Slovak  National Party [SNS] at an extraordinary party congress, where  you "steamrolled" not only Ludovit Cernak but also Jozef Prokes.  What are your ideas regarding cooperation with your coalition  partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]?" [HZDS  weekly] EXTRA SLOVENSKO No. 9 asked Jan Slota, the new SNS  chairman.    [Slota] There exists a treaty regarding this issue, signed  by the former SNS chairman. No one from our party has cast  doubt on this treaty thus far so we continue to act in its  intentions. This is not to say, however, that we are  "subordinating ourselves" to the HZDS or that we represent some  platform within the framework of that movement. For example, we  have fundamental reservations about Defense Minister Andrejcak.  We support the HZDS also with regard to the referendum. I am  convinced that a minimum of 12 to 14 percent of nationally aware  Slovak "diehards" live in Slovakia. These people must be  persuaded that we are not hopping [from one extreme to another]  but that we stick to our line and pursue our target.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] You have proclaimed the return to national  principles. Could you explained that in greater detail?    [Slota] We proceed from the priorities of the SNS, which  are, first and foremost, securing the independence and defense  capability of the Slovak Republic at any price. This is the  Army's assignment. Unfortunately, many of the highest positions  in the Army are held by officers of Czech or Hungarian  nationality. Apart from that, the soldiers are poorly trained.  Another priority is education, a sphere in which the assertion  of the national principle ranks last. After all, it is immoral  when citizens of the state-forming nation are being assimilated  on the sovereign territory of the Slovak Republic! And, at long  last, there is culture. It is abnormal when we support from the  state budget the publication of press in Hungarian, which is  incessantly spitting on this Republic. Let us wake up, Slovaks!    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Will you contest the elections  independently or together with the HZDS or, possibly, with the  Christian Social Union?    [Slota] This can only be decided by an SNS congress. I can  only express my personal opinion. It is 100 percent sure that  we will obtain substantially more votes than in the last  elections. It goes without saying that we are interested in  nationally oriented forces--in particular, gaining seats in  parliament--lest we have a Hungarian-Bolshevik parliament. That  would mean our end as a national republic.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] After your election as SNS chairman, you  declared that Zhirinovskiy was an interesting personality and  that time would show what was going on in Russia. The world is  dissociating itself from him, however....    [Slota] Why should it dissociate itself? Zhirinovskiy is a  deputy to the Russian parliament and 40 million Russians voted  for his party! One can only have reservations about some of his  statements. When someone speaks four languages, including  Turkish, he cannot be a madman.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Would you be able to invite him to  Slovakia?    [Slota] I would not want to comment on that.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] What are your ideas regarding cooperation  with Prime Minister Meciar? Do you think you will come to an  agreement?    [Slota] I think that, essentially, there exists no reason  for us not to talk constructively. This does not mean, however,  that somebody will be there just to fill the numbers.... There  is much common ground between us, where our thinking is  identical.</p>

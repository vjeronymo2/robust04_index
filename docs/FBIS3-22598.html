According to officials at the provincial office for endemic  disease prevention and cure, the local incidence rate of snail  fever has dropped from 4.41 percent three years ago to the  present 1.07 percent, and its incidence rate among cattle has  plummeted from 10.6 percent to 3.5 percent.    The officials said the work was boosted with the aid of  world  bank loans, which the province began to use last year to bring  snail fever under control.    During the past year, the province has been organizing  specialists to spread knowledge in 41 counties on health care  education, disease statistics, and supervision and treatment of  endemic diseases.    The province is also promoting a comprehensive plan which  involves boosting local economy and optimizing agricultural  production.    On the other hand, scientific researchers have found more  effective ways to check the spread of endemic diseases.    In addition, the officials revealed, people in 63 percent of  the counties infested with endemic diseases are eating  iodine-bearing salt.    The incidence rate of malaria has dropped by 54 percent  compared with the previous year, and the spread of other  diseases such as endemic fluorosis, keshan disease and  osteoarthrosis deformans endemica has been checked, local  officials said.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / New marching orders for Red Army: Russia has bowed to the inevitable by breaking ranks THE 50-year-old Russian officer in the Central Asian garrison wept on hearing the news. But, however painful the decision, President Boris Yeltsin was bowing to the inevitable when he ordered the creation of a Russian army earlier this month. After the Soviet Union's collapse in December, Mr Yeltsin and a handful of other republic leaders had good political and economic reasons to try to preserve the Red Army as a united force for the Commonwealth of Independent States. Reality - including Ukraine's moves to build its own army - obliged the Commonwealth's biggest republic to abandon the idea. 'Yeltsin simply did what was necessary to terminate the anomaly of an army without a state,' explained one western military attache. That decision was cemented on Tuesday when most of the CIS defence ministers agreed to dissolve their joint command over all but strategic nuclear weapons, opening the way for the navy and air force, too, to be divided among the states. But as men who have spent most of their lives serving the Soviet Union come to terms with the idea of serving a new, Russian, homeland, politicians and commanders face a mountain of problems in transforming the world's largest conscript army into one or more national armies. Moscow must engage in tough negotiations with the outlying republics on who gets what men and equipment and the conditions on which troops financed by it will remain outside Russia, either to defend borders, or until they can be brought home. 'They can't simply abandon troops outside Russia. They've got enough armed orphans running around the country as it is,' said the military attache. President Yeltsin has promised to bring troops back quickly from republics where they risk being sucked into local wars. Yesterday he ordered the recall of the 14th army from Moldova. But it is likely that virtually all republics will negotiate to keep some Russian troops on their territory. This the defiant Baltic republics, which are pressing for an instant withdrawal of the Red Army but will need outside troops to man the radars which are part of the former Soviet Union's early warning systems against US long-range nuclear missiles. The hardline leaders of Central Asian republics will push for their own armies for the first time - having drawn their own conclusions from the failure of Tajik President Rahmon Nabiyev to convince CIS troops to mow down the political opponents who seized control of his government only a few weeks ago. But they, too, will probably retain some Russian assistance for defending strategic borders with countries such as Afghanistan. For all the political hazards, the main challenge will be coping with officers' plunging livproblem is not so much preventing a military coup but ensuring discipline and incentives for men to obey orders under whatever government they find themselves. Draft-evasion has reached epic proportions; only 30 per cent of recruits are expected to show up this spring. Officers' main complaints are about housing shortages, and difficulties of making ends meet. 'Do you have majors in the west who are beggars?' asked one officer, who, after 14 years of service, lives in a single room with his wife and two teenage children, and shares a bathroom and kitchen with two other families. In a typical struggle for survival, he moonlights to supplement a monthly salary of Rbs3,400 and is indignant that bus drivers earn twice as much. His savings of Rbs6,000 have been made worthless by market reforms which began with price liberalisation this month. The pain will only get worse with plans for sharp cuts in personnel as part of the government's aim of creating a semi-professional force of 1.5m men by the year 2000, down from the 2.63m currently included in the fledgling Russian army. The pressures are already clear: the target for 1.5m men was pushed back by four years just days after it was announced for 1996. The aim is to move away from the entrenched Russian tradition of having a professional officer corps side-by-side with low paid and humiliated 'serf-conscripts'. But the creation of a professional army, put by General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, at Rbs1.5 trillion (million million) will cost even more money to maintain than the present system and is unlikely to go smoothly or easily. 'One wants to believe in all this, but it is difficult,' said the officer. 'They have promised us so much already.' Competing for resources will be plans to switch Russia's heavily militarised economy into one capable of turning out both more civilian goods and better weapons.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Still struggling to get out of a spin: British textile companies must invest to be competitive in the 1990s This spring the City of London has turned its attention to the dark satanic mills of the textile industry as Tootal, one of Britain's oldest textile groups, battles against a Pounds 252m hostile takeover bid from Coats Viyella. Tootal is fighting for independence at a time when the British textile industry is under intense pressure. In the past two years hundreds of mills have closed and scores of companies have folded. There were nearly 100 job losses in textiles and clothing every working day last year. The critical questions for Tootal, Coats and their competitors is when will the industry - which employs 475,000 people and has a turnover of Pounds 14bn - recover and what will it look like at the end of the recession? Recession is scarcely a new phenomenon for the textile industry, which has been in decline since the early 1900s when it held a quarter of world trade. Its development since the second world war has been dominated by its struggle to find a role in a global market polarised between the Germans and Italians with their high-technology mills at the upper end and the low-cost Asian producers at the lower end. The recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s finally convinced British companies they could no longer compete successfully against the Asians. They then invested in modern spinning and weaving systems to try to upgrade their products and catch up with the Germans and Italians. For a few years they seemed to have succeeded. Productivity rose by 40 per cent between 1980 and 1988, when the industry invested Pounds 3bn in new equipment. By the mid-1980s, when consumer spending was buoyant and sterling was competitive against the US dollar (with which many Asian currencies are linked) British textile companies basked in the benefits of rationalisation and re-investment. 'A few years ago I really believed that all the work we had done had made sure we could compete against anyone anywhere,' said Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats. 'But I was wrong.' By the late 1980s when consumer spending started to slow and the pound strengthened, the textile sector returned to recession. The crux of its problems is that, despite all the investment of the mid-1980s, it is still less competitive than the Germans and Italians. A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that British clothing companies lagged behind the Germans in almost every area from training to machinery maintenance. The industry is now suffering on the domestic front not only from the slowdown in consumer spending but also because of the financial instability of its retail customers. At the same time the strong pound has made it more difficult for British products to compete against imports. The industry is also prey to the vagaries of the global textile trade. It is vulnerable to unpredictable swings in fashion and to unexpected changes in raw material prices. There are also sudden surges of imports, like a recent influx of cheap Chinese cotton knickers. And there is growing competition from subsidised industries, such as the Indian and Turkish spinning sectors. The whole industry has suffered in the recession, but the worst-affected areas are those that faced additional pressures. The knitting industry has been hit by the trend away from traditional knitwear and by a rapid rise in imports of socks from Indonesia and knitted babywear from Thailand. Its workforce has fallen by 17,000 to 65,000 and 150 knitting companies have closed in the past 18 months. In the short term the rationalisation is likely to continue. Coats's main aim in bidding for Tootal is to merge their international thread businesses. But Coats also hopes to combine their interests in the UK where Tootal employs 6,500 people and is a leading supplier of shirts and trousers to Marks and Spencer. This integration would probably involve combining administrative operations and some cuts in production capacity. Coats has said that, if the bid succeeds, there could be up to 500 job losses. Even if the bid fails, Tootal will continue with its own cost-cutting. As the takeover struggle continues there is no evidence of improvement in the general trading environment. The domestic market does seem to have stabilised in terms of demand, albeit at a low level. However, last month's rise in the rate of value added tax to 17.5 per cent is a serious concern. Higher clothing prices could not only depress demand, but will also intensify pressure on profitability. Retailers are trying to pass on the VAT increase to their clothing suppliers which in turn are seeking to hand it on to their yarn and cloth suppliers. Most companies are resigned to the recession continuing at least until the autumn. They should then see the first signs of revival if, as most forecasters expect, consumer spending recovers and the stronger dollar alleviates the pressure from Asian imports. 'Next year we should see a virtuous cycle of stronger demand and more favourable currency,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, which has extensive spinning and clothing interests. 'That will be nice but it will not secure the industry's future. For that we need to build a robust business.' The dominant issue for the industry is whether the recession has impeded its attempts to become more competitive in the international market. Even when the recession does end, one of its results will be that many companies will have cut capital expenditure at a time when the Germans and Italians - who already had more modern plants - have carried on investing. British investment peaked at Pounds 549m in 1988 and fell to about Pounds 450m last year. However the recession has been beneficial in some respects, notably by weeding out the least competitive areas of the industry. Small family businesses have borne the brunt. Most of the 150 knitting companies which closed were small 'sweatshop' concerns. Similarly many of the plants making cheaper products have disappeared, particularly in spinning and weaving. This means the surviving mills concentrate on the more expensive products that are less vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. A further consequence of the recession has been to accelerate changes within individual companies. One of the most important trends is internationalisation. Traditionally most textile groups have concentrated production in Britain. They are now manufacturing an increasing proportion of their merchandise overseas - mainly in lower-cost Asian countries - either in their own plants or from sub-contractors. This means a women's wear manufacturer, such as Dewhirst, cuts costs by sourcing the first batch of an order from Asia. It then makes later batches in its British factories which offer a speedier service by reducing delivery times. The trend towards overseas sourcing seems set to continue. William Baird, one of the largest clothing companies, staged a Pounds 39m rights issue this week to raise money for expansion. One of the main areas for investment will be Asia. 'We are still committed to investment in the UK,' said Mr Donald Parr, chairman. 'But our overseas interests will be the focus of expansion for the next five or six years.' Overseas sourcing is scarcely a panacea for the British textile industry. But it can not be a coincidence that the most resilient companies during the recession have been those with extensive overseas interests and strong investment records. Courtaulds Textiles, which began the 1980s as a traditional British-based group, ended the decade as a portfolio of specialised international businesses. It has suffered in the recession. It cut its workforce by 3,200 to 28,200 last year. But it still managed to maintain profits at Pounds 40m on sales of Pounds 984m in 1990 thanks to disciplined management and a broad international base. This is the type of company that is best placed to benefit when the industry pulls out of recession. It would be foolish to pretend that the 1990s offer anything to the British textile industry other than a continuation of the same struggle for international competitiveness. But Courtaulds Textiles' record suggests that if the surviving British companies are prepared to invest in technology, management and international expansion they should be able to secure a future in the volatile world of textiles.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caparo in Dollars 59m acquisition offer Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering concern, is said to have offered Dollars 59m (Pounds 38m) for the assets of Sharon Speciality Steel, the US steelmaker. The acquisition offer, Caparo's largest to date, was reported to have been disclosed in a reorganisation plan filed to a US bankruptcy court, which is administering Sharon under Chapter 11. It follows the announcement earlier this month that Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo, had signed a letter of intent to buy the US group. If the deal goes through, it would transform Caparo into a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ruth Kelly and Larry Elliott report: "Clarke Denies Rift </F> Over Loan Rate"]    [Text] The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, last night said he  was four-square behind the Bank of England Governor and refused  to jeopardise the Government's anti-inflationary credibility in  a short-term dash for growth to boost Conservative popularity.    His comments follow strong hints last week from the  Governor,  Eddie George, that the last cut in the base rate to 5.25 per  cent had been mistaken if inflation was to continue falling.    In the United States yesterday the Federal Reserve moved to  rein in inflation by raising both its interest rates by a full  half-point, more than the markets were expecting.    In an attempt to calm jittery global financial markets, it  hinted that the increases would be the last for the time being,  but the rise almost certainly ends any lingering hopes that  Britain's base rate could come down further, lowering the costs  of borrowing to industry and reducing mortgages for home-owners.    The Fed's move underpinned the Chancellor's point that  economic growth must not be allowed to get out of hand as it did  in the late l980's.    Speaking to industrialists at the Confederation of British  Industry's annual dinner, Mr Clarke admitted that the  Government's popularity was suffering because the economic  recovery was less than spectacular and said most people still  believed Britain was stuck in recession.    But he ruled out any suggestion that he was at odds with the  more cautious Mr George over the level of interest rates, and  was at pains to emphasise his determination to keep inflation  down even if that ran counter to "short-term political or  populist" objectives.    "Too many people still hanker after the go-for-growth in  living standards they enjoyed in the years of boom. Well this  Chancellor does not want a boom because boom gets followed by  bust," he said. Sustainable economic growth meant keeping  interest rates high enough to ensure inflation remained firmly  within his 1-4 per cent target band and would fall to the lower  half of that range by the end of the present Parliament --  probably in l966 or early l997.    But in the Bank of England's latest Inflation Report  released  last week, the Governor argued that at current interest rates  the "core" rate of inflation would remain stuck at 3-3.5 per  cent over the next two years.    The Chancellor, however said he had "let the Bank loose to  write its own inflation report" in order to improve the  credibility of policy, and there was no "clash of cultures or  objectives" between the Treasury and Threadneedle Street.    "Eddie George and I share the same aim of low inflation and  sound money. I decide, but we discuss and seek to agree," he  said.    Striking out at the right wing of the Tory party, who insist  Britain's place lies outside the European Union [EU], Mr Clarke  argued that the EU was "good for British industry and British  entrepreneurship" and if that meant taking on "those who cling  to a more dirigiste vision of Europe, then so be it."    He insisted that the argument was moving in Britain's  direction. "To be pro-European does not mean that we should  accept the soggy social democrat consensus of the European Union  in recent years."    Meanwhile, City analysts will be watching data released  today  on unemployment, average earnings, public borrowing and  inflation for any signs in a slowdown in activity after April's  wave of tax increases or, conversely, a hint of a pick-up in  inflationary pressures if growth is too robust.    The Prime Minister yesterday appeared to be softening up  MP's  at Question Time in the Commons for some bad economic news. He  said prospects were extremely good, but "every single indicator  in the months ahead may not be as good as we would wish."    In the United States, bond and share prices rose strongly  after the news of the increase in interest rates. However some  members of Congress fear the Fed has indulged in overkill and  may push the economy back towards recession in an election year.    The increase in the Fed funds rate -- the rate at which  banks  lend to each other -- to 4.25 per cent was the fourth in as many  months, though the three previous rises were each of a quarter  point. The half-point rise in the discount rate -- the rate at  which banks borrow money from the Fed -- to 3.5 per cent was the  first in five years.</p>

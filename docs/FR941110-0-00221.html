They said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers already have numerous opportunities to refute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey findings throughout the survey process. Some alleged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an additional process would only serve to delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement process which would be contrary to the OBRA '87  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate to minimize the time between the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations and final imposition of enforcement remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some also believed that if such a process were in place,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies may not be cited or, at a minimum, they would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be cited at lower scope and severity scale levels to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the universe for challenges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One consumer organization argued that the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is not a two-party system in which the facilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State negotiate. Rather, it is a contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement in which the State holds the public's trust and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acts as the public's agent to ensure that the contractees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the arrangement. They believed that if any party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have ``appeal'' rights, it is the residents who should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to contest survey findings that do not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities to comply with the law. They submitted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, that instead of establishing a dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process for providers, HCFA should build mechanisms into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey procedures to notify residents, families, ombudsmen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and others when surveyors, during the course of the survey,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not yet been able to substantiate suspected problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These procedures would provide an opportunity for residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and families to provide additional information to surveyors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, opposed to a dispute resolution process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remarked that there is currently so much interaction between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors and providers during the survey process that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers are actually interfering with the performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey. This commenter suggested that a sanction be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed against providers when this occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall, most commenters, including States, offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strong support for a dispute resolution process. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters were interested in resolving conflicts as early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the survey process as possible and prior to litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They prefer to minimize the number of issues that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance to formal litigation by resolving early those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflicts caused by misunderstandings, miscommunication,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversights, etc. However, the consumer advocacy groups were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adamant in their opposition, arguing that any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process will delay the enforcement process against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliant facilities and shift focus away from resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care. These commenters believe that the perceived need by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers for a dispute resolution process must be secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the responsibility HCFA, the States, and facilities have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide for the health and well-being of nursing home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We recognize the validity of both major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points of view and have concluded that both perspectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Fall of 1992, we asked the States to provide us  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a description of existing dispute resolution processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered to providers who disagree with survey findings. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States responded. Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not asked to provide their comments due to the small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of facilities surveyed. We discovered that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States currently have a dispute resolution process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevada's system of due process is required by State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other States' processes, although not legally mandated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are reflective of State policy and not legislation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies vary among States, and there are numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in the details of the processes of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall, the opportunities offered to providers by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to challenge survey findings can be divided into two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basic stages: during and after the survey. All States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer the providers a chance for rebuttal during at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of these stages; half of the States include both in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. During the survey, the opportunities afforded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers include the chance for the provider's staff to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interact with the survey team throughout the process and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific opportunity to discuss survey findings at the exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference. After the survey, many States allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers to elevate unresolved issues to survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management and/or the HCFA regional office for resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, providers in all States may record their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreement with survey findings on the Statement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deficiencies HCFA&hyph;2567.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our State Operations Manual currently requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States allow facilities to interact with the survey team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference, to raise unresolved issues to the survey agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or to the HCFA regional office and to record their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreements with survey findings on the HCFA&hyph;2567.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

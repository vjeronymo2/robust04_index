			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno remained cautious Monday [4 April] about  suggesting an economic recovery is under way, although he said  some bright signs have emerged.    Since the beginning of this year, some indicators in  consumption and production have pointed to improvements in  business activities, Mieno said in an opening address to a  three-day quarterly meeting of the central bank's branch  managers and overseas representatives. But "final demand as a  whole" still remains stagnant, as shown by declining corporate  capital investment, and a further careful watch is necessary to  see if those bright signs are sustained and spread to lift the  economy, Mieno said.    Mieno said personal consumption is showing signs of  "stopping  falling and recovering," and production is expected to increase  in the January-March quarter after posting a sharp decline in  the previous quarter. Under these circumstances, corporate  sentiment is regaining stability, he said.    Ongoing inventory adjustments and the spreading effects of  past fiscal and monetary measures as leading to these  improvements, he said. [sentence as received]    There is also a possibility, however, that they might have  stemmed from special window-dressing efforts by companies ahead  of the book closing last Thursday for fiscal 1993, the central  bank chief said.    Mieno also pointed to continued downward pressure on the  economy from ongoing corporate restructuring efforts to cope  with the yen's sharp appreciation over the past year, as well as  asset deflation after the collapse of the economic bubble of the  late 1980s.    On monetary policy, he said the central bank will continue  carefully monitoring economic and financial-market developments.  In this connection, the easing of credit so far is contributing  to form the basis of macroeconomic recovery by facilitating  corporate restructuring, Mieno said.    Short-term market rates are moving at low levels, although  long-term market rates have risen recently from year-earlier  levels because of the evaporation of "excessive market hopes"  for lower rates late last year, he said.    Mieno said the financial authorities must push forward  deregulation and other measures in capital markets to back up  efforts by companies to restructure and by financial  institutions to liquidate bad loans. He said "utmost use" of  markets is important to facilitate various adjustments and to  put the economy into a sustainable growth phase without  inflation.    Bank of Japan branch managers from 33 domestic branches and  three overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on  the economic conditions of their respective areas and to confirm  monetary policy.    Attention is fixed on whether the three-day meeting will  lead  the central bank to paint a brighter economic picture. At the  previous meeting, the branch managers spelled out a recovery in  corporate sentiment.    Mieno will hold a press conference Wednesday to wrap up the  meeting.</p>

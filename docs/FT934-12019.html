			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: MAN unit falls 87% to DM32m A FALL in demand and DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) provisions for job cuts slashed profits in the MAN group's commercial vehicles offshoot by 87 per cent in the year to end-June. Net earnings, which fell to DM32m from DM225m, may improve in the current year in spite of an expected further fall in turnover and a continuing decline in domestic demand, Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chairman, said yesterday. He refused to make specific forecasts, but pointed to an expected rise next year of almost 9 per cent in west European demand, excluding Germany, and rapid progress on job cuts and other cost-saving measures. Incoming orders in the first quarter of the new year were 6 per cent higher than a year earlier, and Mr Rupprecht said he expected new orders for the full 12 months to reach DM6.5bn compared with DM6.26bn last time. After shedding about 600 employees in the whole of last year, the company reduced its German and Austrian workforce by 1,700 people in the first quarter of the current financial year. A further 650 employees are scheduled to leave by the end of December and 1,000 more will go in the second half. In spite of poor trading conditions, the company claimed it managed to avoid the worst of the recession last year. While total west European registrations of trucks above six tonnes fell 23 per cent to 213,000 in the year to the end of June, only 8 per cent fewer MAN trucks entered service. Meanwhile, the brand's market share in this segment rose 6 percentage points to 26 per cent, Mr Rupprecht said. The company, which specialises in trucks in this weight range, said it expected modest growth in this sector for the remainder of the decade. After falling from a peak of 300,000 registrations in the calendar year 1989 to less than 200,000 in 1993, the total west European market is expected to grow only 1 per cent in 1994. Growth outside Germany was almost outweighed by an 8.6 per cent fall inside.</p>

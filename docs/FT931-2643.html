			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Shopacheck boost for Cattle's CATTLE'S (Holdings) reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992, mainly as a result of the continuing strong performance of its consumer credit business. Profits increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.8m) on turnover lower at Pounds 217.8m (Pounds 244.7m) mainly reflecting the flotation of a 55 per cent stake in Rosebys, the curtain and linen stores group, early last year. The core consumer credit division, led by Shopacheck, the door-to-door weekly credit business, increased profits to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9m) on turnover of Pounds 167.1m (Pounds 154.8m). Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, said the gain highlighted the rationalisation benefits following the acquisition of Compass Credit at the end of 1990. He added that the charge for bad debts fell 'despite the difficult economic background'. The insurance services division lifted profits to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 600,000) while the hire purchase and leasing division reduced losses to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.5m) despite a continuing high level of write-offs and increases in bad debt provisions reflecting the problems of its small business customers. The group has reduced its non-core activities, selling the Indoor Leisure Centre at a small loss in December and reducing the size of the retail video film hire and travel agency businesses and charging closure costs agains profits. Rosebys' contribution to pre-tax profits as an associate was Pounds 1.1m last year compared to Pounds 2.2m in the previous year when it was a wholly owned subsidiary. The disposal realised a surplus of Pounds 4.6m, of which Pounds 3.2m was transferred to reserves in respect of goodwill previously written off, and Pounds 1.4m was credited to the profit and loss account as an extraordinary profit. Earnings increased to 7.82p (6.13p) per share; a recommended final dividend of 2.6p lifts the total for the year from 3.8p to 4.7p, including a special distribution of 0.5p.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PANEL TOLD TO RECONSIDER LICENSE OF  DEVELOPER  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that the California Coastal  Commission erred in revoking the license of a Malibu developer accused of  grading 14 times the amount of earth his permit allowed, and must reconsider  the matter. Although it is a victory for developer Sheldon Gordon, Judge David  P. Yaffe's decision may have little impact on Gordon's proposal to build four  luxury homes in Malibu's exclusive Sweetwater Mesa area because it leaves the  future of the controversial project up to the commission to decide.  </P> <P> But Deputy Atty. Gen. Steven H. Kaufmann said the ruling represents "a Pyrrhic  victory at best." "In determining that, for technical reasons, the commission  may have acted inappropriately, the judge's decision does not remove the fact  that Mr. Gordon still faces the commission's judgment as to whether revocation  should occur," Kaufmann said.  </P></p>

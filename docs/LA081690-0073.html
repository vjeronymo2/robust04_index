			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY WHISTLE-BLOWERS FACE TRANSFER, PAY CUT  </P> <P> Four sailors-turned-whistle-blowers on the nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz may  no longer work on a nuclear vessel, and they face reassignment as well as a  salary cut, Navy officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Family members, awaiting the ship's arrival here Friday, countered that the  Navy has made scapegoats of the men instead of adequately investigating their  complaints.  </P> <P> The sailors told a Seattle television station earlier this month that crew  members aboard the Nimitz, based in Bremerton, Wash., had flouted safety  regulations, and the four threatened to sabotage the vessel's reactors to draw  attention to their complaints.  </P> <P> After an investigation, Navy officials acknowledged that several sailors  cheated on exams covering their technical knowledge of the carrier's nuclear  reactor procedures. But they quickly added that the cheating was not widespread  and did not endanger the ship or its crew.  </P> <P> "A handful of guys admitted they looked on their buddies' test paper during one  exam," said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. "But the reactors are  operating safely and the crew is well qualified."  </P> <P> Because the four sailors did not use military hot lines to air their concerns  and neglected to bring their complaints to supervising officers, the Navy lost  confidence in the sailors and revoked the credentials that allow them to work  on a nuclear vessel, Pritchard said.  </P> <P> With disguised voices and obscured faces, the sailors told television station  KIRO that crew members cheated on exams to compensate for their inadequate  training, that faulty hardware had been installed aboard the vessel and that  test results for radiation leaks were fabricated.  </P> <P> Rima Puma, mother of one of the four, Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Steven Puma,  said:  </P> <P> "Are they doing this in order to cover up their own safety inadequacies? Are  they saying my son is unreliable? Because they did something wrong, they are  going to try and shove it off on my son."  </P></p>

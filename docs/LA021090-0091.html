			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT PANEL LOOKS AT PALMDALE SOLAR PLANT  </P> <P> The head of the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners said he wants his  panel to consider permitting development of a major solar power plant on vacant  airport-owned land in Palmdale.  </P> <P> Airport commission President Jerry Epstein said he will propose that airport  officials consider allowing the world's largest solar energy producer to use as  many as "a few thousand" acres of the nearly 18,000 acres of airport land in  Palmdale.  </P> <P> The Westwood-based company, Luz International Ltd., made a presentation to  airport officials last month asking for land on which to build a $1-billion  solar energy plant in Palmdale.  </P> <P> At that time Epstein and other airport officials said in interviews they  doubted the plan would be approved. But Epstein later said The Times' report of  the meeting, under the headline "Airport Officials Reject Major Solar Energy  Plant on Palmdale Site," left the incorrect impression that the commission had  made a final decision against it.  </P> <P> Epstein said he will ask the board to consider the plan at its Feb. 21 meeting.  </P> <P> Los Angeles airport officials have been saving the land, most of which is  vacant, for a long-planned regional airport. But Epstein said Los Angeles,  which currently gets no solar power, also ought to consider opportunities to  develop cleaner sources of energy.  </P> <P> "We have the technology. Why not use it," said Epstein, who also heads a  city-county energy commission. Luz has proposed a city-financed facility that  could provide 10% of Los Angeles' energy needs. The company already operates  several solar plants in the Mojave Desert.  </P></p>

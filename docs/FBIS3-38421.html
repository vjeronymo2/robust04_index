Police in the canton St. Gallen  announced on Monday [31 January] that the likelihood "has  increased considerably" that cesium or rubidium might be on  board. However, all water samples taken at the Swiss banks near  Altenheim have so far been negative. Rumors have meanwhile been  confirmed that two of the five passengers who died in the crash  were allegedly involved in illegal deals with radioactive  materials. Two German businessmen reportedly acquired an  unknown quantity of cesium and rubidium in the Latvian capital  Riga in October 1993. They allegedly transported the material to  Prague. There Interpol lost track of the dealers. It is not  known whether the radioactive substances were really loaded onto  the Cessna plane. According to reports, the plane was to stop  at Altenheim airport (Switzerland); money for refueling had been  transmitted from Prague.    Besides the pilot, the plane carried two women -- possibly  from the Czech Republic. Authorities believe that the men may  also have been involved in the smuggling of women. The  businessmen from Berlin, a former owner of a construction  company and a sports official of the former German Democratic  Republic, apparently wanted to transport radioactive material to  France via Switzerland, as was reported.    The cause of the crash was still unclear on Monday evening.  The pilot made a contact flight because the weather was good.  The plane is probably at a depth of 120-180 meters. The Swiss  authorities hope to find the wreck with a special German ship in  the next few days. A total of 4 million people in Switzerland  and Germany up to the Stuttgart area are supplied with drinking  water from Lake Constance.</p>

Non-regional shareholders do not have permanent representation on the board. Mr Hans-Peter Repnik, parliamentary state secretary at the Ministry of Economic Co-operation and Development, also questioned whether a large increase in capital was necessary for the bank, given that it was to reduce lending to cover balance of payments deficits.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities warm to interest rate cut THE ONE-POINT reduction to 9 per cent in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate, followed by promises of mortgage rate cuts from one of the largest UK house lenders, was welcome news in the stock market yesterday. The response from equities was cautious at first, but sterling's relatively favourable performance encouraged hopes that further base rate cuts could follow soon. The FT-SE Index closed 25.9 up at 2,586. The stock market displayed nervousness regarding both the signs of political strains on the UK Conservative government ahead of tomorrow's debate in the House of Commons, and also a rash of rumours of further impending developments in ERM member currencies. Share prices opened lower and the FT-SE Index was nearly 15 points off in the first half-hour of electronic trading. But the Bank of England, in contradiction to the previous day, made early signals in the London money markets of its intention to cut rates. When the news came, equities hung fire, advanced, and then slipped back as dealers watched sterling's progress. At mid-morning, the currency watch intensified following disclosure that the UK monthly trade deficit had widened to Pounds 1.19bn in August, somewhat larger than had been expected in the City of London. However, while the burgeoning trade deficit was seen as a grim reminder of Britain's economic problems, it was not seen as any immediate threat to the chances of further cuts in base rates in the near future. Encouraged by a batch of corporate deals in the brewery sector, and suggestions that a bigger deal will unfold today, shares moved forward strongly, the Footsie registering at best a gain of 38.3, with the 2,600 level less than a couple of points away. The advance ran out of steam when New York opened and quickly dipped to show a fall of 26 Dow points in London hours, in spite of news of a 10.4 per cent increase in August housing starts, the largest rise for 19 months. Seaq volume remained high, at 987.8m shares against 953.4m on Monday, when retail, or customer, business worth Pounds 1.8bn continued to bear witness to the weight of institutional investment in equities since Britain's move from the ERM, which had been seen as opening the way for interest rate cuts. Fund managers were yesterday turning their attention away from the dollar-earners which starred in the equity market last week. Many of the big names, including Glaxo and RTZ, gave ground and early gains in other internationals were trimmed after Wall Street opened. Investors were buying more strongly into the domestic, interest rate-orientated issues, such as Sears, Kingfisher and GUS. Often the buying took the form of block deals as shares found ready purchasers across the full range. Although substantial funds have already flowed out of government bonds and into equities, further switches in strategies are expected following meetings this week at leading securities firms.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Quotes of the day 'It closes no doors except the door of violence and illegality - crucially it opens the door to those who abandon violence.' John Major 'A tortuously worded statement with many contradictions.' James Molyneaux 'My appeal to all sections of our people is to read the entire statement in full, and to have no knee-jerk reactions.' John Hume 'We cannot have winners and losers if we want lasting peace. It is fair to all and threatens nobody.' Albert Reynolds 'Ulster has been hung, drawn and quartered by Mr Reynolds, Mr Major and his cohorts in the IRA.' Ian Paisley 'It is one of those fairly broad-based declarations which rules nothing out and rules nothing in and presumably causes minimum offence to all parties, which will enable, perhaps, the more serious dialogue to follow on from this point.' Colin Parry, father of 12-year-old Warrington bomb victim Tim Parry</p>

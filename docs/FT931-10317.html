			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Technology: When all the chips are down - Sematech's tiny microchip highlights the resurgence of the US semiconductor industry It is an achievement that some experts have likened to putting a man on the moon. Using only US-built production tools, Sematech, the government-backed consortium set up to re-establish US pre-eminence in semiconductors, has produced microchips containing electronic elements just 0.35 microns wide - about half the size of the most advanced chips currently in production. Sematech's breakthrough may be more symbolic than practical. It is expected to be several years before 0.35 micron technology is used in full-scale manufacturing. None the less, the achievement highlights the remarkable resurgence of the US semiconductor industry after several years of having to bow to Japanese competition. US companies last year won a larger share of the world chip market than Japan for the first time since 1985. Intel has become the largest chip maker in the world, and Applied Materials, a neighbour in Silicon Valley, has overtaken Tokyo Electron of Japan to become the world's biggest supplier of semiconductor production equipment. By making prototype 0.35 micron chips, Sematech set out to demonstrate that US chip production technology was now at least on a par with the best in Japan. 'In the semiconductor world, this is equivalent to a moon landing,' says Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a California market research and consulting group. This is a far cry from the scepticism shown when Sematech was formed five years ago. Then, the US semiconductor industry was on its knees, outsmarted and outsold by Japanese competitors. The US share of the world chip market was falling rapidly. Japanese chips were widely held to be of higher quality than those made in the US, and Japanese companies dominated the world market for semiconductor production equipment and materials. Yet questions remain about how much credit Sematech should be given for the revival of the US chip industry and its equipment suppliers. Other factors include: the US-Japan semiconductor industry trade pact, which forced Japan to buy more foreign-made chips; the Japanese economic decline; the rise of Korean chip makers, who compete mainly with Japanese manufacturers of memory chips; and the strength of the world personal computer market, which has boosted sales of microprocessor chips, made primarily by US companies. Has the US semiconductor industry's comeback, therefore, really been a triumph of government intervention, or is it a demonstration of private-sector ingenuity and the forces of a free market? The question is pertinent as the new administration prepares to implement what is expected to be a more interventionist approach. 'Sematech is the enabler of the US semiconductor manufacturing resurgence,' says Jim Norling, president and general manager of Motorola's semiconductor business. 'It would not be an understatement to say that Sematech saved the (semiconductor production equipment) industry,' adds Papken Der Torossian, chairman of the Silicon Valley Group, an equipment manufacturer that has been one of the largest beneficiaries of Sematech research and development funding. Others take a more measured view, saying that Sematech served as a catalyst to get the industry to work together on common problems. Jim Bagley, president of Applied Materials, says: 'The next generation of wafer fabrication plants is expected to cost Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m) to Dollars 1bn per factory. The chip makers are saying that they cannot afford it and that equipment costs must come down, but the US equipment industry is barely breaking even. It is a Dollars 5.5bn industry that has zero profitability.' The solution, he and others believe, is greater co-operation between chip makers and equipment suppliers - as in Japan and elsewhere. Until regulations were loosened to allow Sematech members to work together on pre-competitive research, it did not happen in the US. Critics suggest that Sematech's Dollars 200m annual budget - half from member companies and half from the Pentagon - went to pay for some expensive, if important, meetings. The consortium has also, however, funded research and development that has significantly strengthened some US semiconductor production equipment companies. This has reduced US chip makers' dependency on foreign equipment producers, a critical goal of the Defence Department. Also, VLSI Research says US equipment suppliers have stemmed the erosion of their home market by foreign competitors and are beginning to gain ground in Japan and Europe. Not everyone in the US semiconductor industry is happy with Sematech's achievements, however. Some object to government funding of industry research. Others, including two of Sematech's original 14 member companies, feel the consortium has focused on the wrong issues. LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, dropped out of the consortium last year saying it had lost sight of its original goal of improving chip manufacturing methods. The Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, which has provided half of Sematech's funds, last year said it intended to cut annual funding from Dollars 100m to Dollars 80m. The Pentagon agency views the consortium as a 'tremendous success, resulting in broad infrastructural changes within the industry', according to a report published by the General Accounting Office last year. Darpa explained its proposed reduction in funding by saying the industry 'should bear the primary responsibility for ensuring continued support for Sematech because it is an industry-led consortium addressing industry needs'. Its original justification for funding Sematech was to ensure that the US would lead in the development of advanced weaponry based on semiconductor chips. In contrast, industry members of Sematech had a different, although complementary, objective - to revive their industry. With a Republican administration opposed to any form of 'industrial policy', the semiconductor industry executives who founded Sematech saw the Pentagon's concerns about dependency on foreign technology suppliers as an opportunity to gain government support. With the election of President Clinton, US chip makers can afford to be more frank. They have drawn up a 'road map' of the long-term strategy to maintain competitiveness. Based on the assumption of no increased government or private-sector funding for research and development, it is aimed at enabling industry and government to work together by assigning the most effective roles to individual semiconductor companies, Sematech, university research and government-funded national laboratories, in a co-ordinated effort. WJ Sanders III, chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a Sematech member company, says: 'I don't favour a lot of government involvement. I think the only reason Sematech made sense was that our external trading partners were pummelling us by using their government's capital.' While Darpa's money was critical to the formation of Sematech when the US semiconductor industry was in dire straits, the government agency was 'genteel' in its control over Sematech, observes Bagley, and its financial contribution relatively small. 'A hundred million dollars a year pales into insignificance in the context of US government spending . . . half the money and most of the resources for Sematech have come from industry.' If Sematech is to be the 'role model for government-industry co-operation', as Clinton said during his campaign, this points to modest government support for industry-led efforts rather than large-scale government programmes to restore industrial competitiveness.  ---------------------------------------------                           1991        1992 Company*               revenue      market                                  share (%)  --------------------------------------------- Intel (3)                5,064         7.7 NEC (1)                  4,976         7.6 Toshiba (2)              4,765         7.3 Motorola (4)             4,635         7.1 Hitachi (5)              3,902         6.0 Texas Instruments (6)    3,052         4.7 Fujitsu (7)              2,583         3.9 Mitsubishi (8)           2,307         3.5 Philips (10)             2,108         3.2 Matsushita (9)           1,929         2.9 Others                  30,266        46.1  --------------------------------------------- Total                   65,587       100.0  --------------------------------------------- *1991 ranking in brackets  --------------------------------------------- Source: Dataquest  ---------------------------------------------</p>

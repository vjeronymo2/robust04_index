			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hambros This has turned into a really bad week for merchant banks. The temptation after Hambros' profits warning yesterday is to conclude that something is wrong which no amount of strategic fine-tuning can rectify. Whereas Warburg suffered as a result of its global aspirations which had led to an increased emphasis on trading, Hambros is diversified with a range of niche activities like estate agency and insurance loss-adjustment. Even in the bond, markets its focus is on issues in high-yielding antipodean currencies: it declines to take the big houses on in US dollar Eurobonds. Yet this spread of business has not spared it from the ravages of the market. For Hambros, this raises a specific worry about dividend cover, which now starts to look rather thin. Two profit warnings in this sector in as many days must focus minds elsewhere too. If the quality of earnings from investment banking and the ratings attached to them are low, then it may make less sense for banks like Barclays to focus on such activity as an engine of growth. Institutions like Schroders may become more reluctant to push further into distribution, unless they believe they can make a decent return without relying on proprietary trading.</p>

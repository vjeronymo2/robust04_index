			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under Marketing Order 966, and approximately 50 handlers. Also, there are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under Marketing Order 984, and approximately 65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The budgets of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period were prepared by the Committee and the Board, the agencies responsible for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Florida Tomato Committee are producers. The members of the California Walnut Board are producers and handlers. They are familiar with the Committee's and Board's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input into these processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee and Board expenses by expected respective shipments of Florida tomatoes and merchantable California walnuts. Because these rates will be applied to actual shipments of tomatoes and of certified merchantable walnuts, the assessment rates must be established at levels that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's and Board's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Tomato Committee met September 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $2,682,000, which is $4,000 less than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $6,250 for office rent, $200 for miscellaneous, and $4,000 for research expense, will be offset by decreases of $7,000 for office salaries and $7,450 for employees' retirement program. Major expense items include $276,000 for office salaries, $200,000 for research expense, and $2,000,000 for education and promotion expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 58,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,320,000 in assessment income. This, along with $20,000 in interest and other income and $342,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period were $1,349,348, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Walnut Marketing Board met September 10, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $1,941,647, $69,551 more than the previous year. Increases include $4,511 for administrative salaries, $171 for general insurance, $200 for audit, $7,649 for group life, retirement, and medical plan, $835 for office salaries, $7,904 for office rent, $6,000 for office supplies and miscellaneous, $1,000 for telephone and FAX, $2,000 for equipment maintenance and warranties, $9,000 for furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $7,450 for production research director, and the addition of a $43,000 acreage survey category. These increases will be partially offset by decreases of $300 for social security and hospital insurance taxes, $5,000 for domestic market research and development, and $14,869 for production research. Major expenses include $101,331 for administrative salaries, $40,771 for office salaries, $875,000 for domestic market research and development, $490,488 for production research, $91,068 for production research director, and $43,000 for a walnut acreage survey. A reserve for contingencies of $50,000 is also included in the 1993&hyph;94 budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.009 per kernelweight pound, $0.001 less than the previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,157,386 kernelweight pounds of merchantable walnuts, will yield $1,941,647 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available to the handlers from whom collected within that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interim final rules were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in October 27, 1993, for 7 CFR part 966 (58 FR 57719); and on October 28, 1993, for 7 CFR Part 984 (58 FR 57959). Those rules added &sect;966.231 and &sect;984.344 which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committee and Board. Those rules provided that interested persons could file comments through November 26, 1993, for 7 CFR part 966 and through November 29, 1993, for 7 CFR part 984. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

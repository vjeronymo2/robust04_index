			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Vereinsbank improves 27% in first 10 months Bayerische Vereinsbank yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in operating profits for the first 10 months of this year and promised shareholders a DM16 dividend for 1993, up DM3 on 1992. The Munich-based banking group said operating earnings, after allowing for a 14 per cent increase in loan risk provisions to DM772m (Dollars 454m), climbed to DM992m. Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chairman, said most of the improvement stemmed from a 13 per cent rise in net commission income to DM859m and earnings from financial transactions which more than doubled compared with the same period in 1992 to DM241m. He attributed a 12 per cent jump in interest income to DM3bn to strong growth in property financing. Mr Schmidt said most of the increase in risk provisions was to cover the needs of the domestic credit business. Country risks played a subordinate role, he said. In general, there were no grounds for less caution on the risks front, he added, Experience showed that the impact of recession on the banking sector was usually delayed. Countering between-the-lines charges in the media that banks benefited from economic slumps, he said they functioned like air-bags. 'They need good profits to cushion their customers from the effects of recession,' he added. With the aim of 'dressing warmly' in the light of increasing risks and stronger competition, the bank intended to increase its capital base through a 1-8 rights issue. Details would be decided later this month, he said. Half of the planned dividend increase was a bonus to mark the bank's 125th anniversary, Mr Schmidt noted. The rest was compensation for the effects of new corporate taxation laws to be introduced on January 1, which would leave domestic shareholders disadvantaged if the payout were left unchanged.</p>

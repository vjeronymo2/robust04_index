			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Books: Will the real Piero . . . - Art MY BEST Old Master books of the year range geographically from Arezzo to deeply obscure English parish-churches. First, then, three books, each called Piero della Francesca, marking the quincentenary of that complex, heavenly artist. Without being truly memorable, each has good points and prices are nicely spread. Each comes up with amusingly certain views on the most disputed identities of the 15th century; the three gentlemen on the right in the Urbino 'Flagellation'. Two gentleman and an archangel, according to Ronald Lightbown whose PDF (Abbeville Press: Pounds 60, 308 pages) is a handsome book although the colour reproduction is not wonderful. It gives a careful account of Piero's hazy career, is notably strong on costume, but skimpy on Piero and perspective. Partially recycling a century-old theory, Lightbown identifies the three as a bearded Greek appealing to Francesco Sforza for a crusade against the Turk, listened to by Byzantium's guardian angel. For Carlo Bertelli, the barefoot, golden youth is he who, according to the old legend, was restored to life by the touch of the True Cross unearthed by Empress Helena - the self-same scene Piero painted in the Arezzo frescoes. Despite a woeful translation, Bertelli's PDF (Yale University Press; Pounds 35, 240 pages) is stimulating and the catalogue is certainly worth having. Differing from Lightbown, Bertelli rejects the Williamstown 'Madonna and Child' - and gives a piquant run-down of Flagellation theories. Marilyn Arenburg Lavin's PDF (Thames and Hudson; Pounds 12.95, 128 pages) is good value, a short essay plus incomplete catalogue. Clever but at times way off-beam, she identifies the problematic threesome as Ludovico Gonzaga and a noble friend. Each had recently lost a beloved relative and so Piero provided an 'image of consolation'; the blonde figure, astonishingly, is said to represent the dear departed. Hugely admired as Britain's great country-houses are, trying to find out in any detail about their history and contents is a frustrating business. Boughton House: The English Versailles (Faber &amp; Faber; Pounds 100, 240 pages), edited by Tessa Murdoch and published in association with Christie's, points the way at its hefty price towards better treatment of the intelligent country-house visitor. There could be no better place to start such an enterprise than Boughton, English home of the Dukes of Buccleuch whose collections are of legendary beauty and importance. Boughton is open to the public, in a discreet fashion on August afternoons, but such is its magnificence that it deserves to be far better-known. Essentially 17th century, the house and many of the contents are due to Ralph Duke of Montagu, an ambitious, unscrupulous Francophile who dominates the book. Well-written essays by experts describe exquisite French furniture (some pieces given by Louis XIV to the eager Duke Ralph), paintings, 15th century Oriental carpets, tapestries, armour, and more. One of the year's more intriguing art-books is Crista Grossinger's North-European Panel Paintings (Harvey Miller; Pounds 48, 302 pages). The author has tracked down all the Northern Renaissance panel-paintings lurking in English parish-churches, alms-houses, Catholic schools, and Oxbridge colleges. More than 70 of them are described and reproduced in this interesting book. With few exceptions, these were made-for-export devotional images produced - not to say churned out - by Brussels and Antwerp workshops, following designs handed down by masters such as Pieter Coecke van Aelst. A mass of such work was being shipped to England before the Reformation, barely a single example of which has survived. The presence of these paintings therefore testifies to the taste of 19th-century collectors, enthusiasts for 'Primitives' and, in many cases, for Roman Catholicism. Now that vicars tremble if anything in their churches is worth more than a few pounds, it is remarkable that so many consented to have their charming paintings put on the map for art-lovers - always assuming you can find the church-key.</p>

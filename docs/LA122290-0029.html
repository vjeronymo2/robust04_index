			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANDPA AND NEW KIDS  </P> <P> I am Frank Sinatra's granddaughter and I'm writing about the article (Morning  Report, Nov. 28) about my grandfather and the New Kids on the Block. First of  all, I am 15 years old, not 12, and there must have been some misunderstanding  about me and the New Kids.  </P> <P> I told my grandpa that I thought it was a good idea if he made a recording with  them, but I am not a "rabid New Kids fan" and it was not what I "wanted for  Christmas." The credit should go to my grandfather because he asked me, or told  me, about the idea months ago. I had nothing to do with it. He must have  thought that I was a fan, but I really am not. The whole thing wasn't even my  idea, so I shouldn't get any credit.  </P> <P> I would appreciate it if this could be cleared up . . . and if you want to know  who my favorite singer is, it's my grandpa!  </P> <P> AMANDA LAMBERT  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

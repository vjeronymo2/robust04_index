			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: How unity sentiment hits the bond markets IN THE run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the Financial Times will show the impact of political developments on the French, German, Italian and UK government bond markets by tracking the movements in bond yields, writes Sara Webb. Denmark's rejection of the treaty in June dealt a blow to Europe's government bond markets by casting doubt on prospects for European union. Until then, investors had hoped to benefit from the convergence in European inflation rates and interest rates: they had invested in the higher-yielding bond markets, such as Spain and Italy, assuming that as Spanish and Italian interest rates converged with those in Germany they would make a profit on their bond holdings. Denmark's rejection of the treaty made them wary of the high-yielding markets - a reaction accentuated by fears about the French vote. If France looks like backing the treaty, the high-yielding markets such as Italy - and to a lesser extent, France and the UK - are likely to benefit and show a fall in bond yields. If France looks set to reject Maastricht, these markets will see a rise in yields (corresponding to a fall in bond prices), while German bonds are likely to gain as investors seek the safety of the D-Mark.</p>

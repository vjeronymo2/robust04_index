			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 13 January PAEVALEHT, p 1] </F>   [Text] Thursday, January 13 -- The Moderate faction of the  Riigikogu [parliament] held a news conference yesterday on the  recent crisis around the appointment of ministers.    Rural Centrist Ivar Raig, Social Democrat Ardo Ojasalu and  faction member Heiki Nestor claimed that President Lennart Meri  is provided with false information. They explained their claim  with the president's opposition to the replacement of former  Economy Minister Toomas Sildmae. Raig claimed that the actual  situation was exactly opposite to what Meri had said, stressing  that the ministry had not submitted a single original draft law  to the Riigikogu. He also rejected the president's accusations  that the prime minister was building an administrative state.  The presidential chancellery has placed the president in an  unpleasant situation, he said.    Heiki Nestor claimed that economic circles are exerting  pressure on the president, while Ardo Ojasalu regretted the  descent "on the level of everyday politics". Raig added that  Toomas Sildmae was the only winner in the conflict.    The Moderates also commented on the possibility of a breakup  of their faction, claiming that an agreement had been achieved,  according to which no breakup will take place in the nearest  three months. This was done as a favour to the independent  faction members who would have had to make their choice in a  short time otherwise.</p>

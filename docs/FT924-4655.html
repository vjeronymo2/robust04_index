			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Itoman ends half-year in the red ITOMAN, the scandal-tainted Japanese trading house, reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.5bn (Dollars 68.5m) for the first half as its executives yesterday signed a merger agreement with the Sumitomo group that will dissolve the company in March. The trading house, which made a profit of Y1.5bn for the six months to September, said sales fell 10.2 per cent to Y265bn, while a Y39.7bn provision for loan losses led to an after-tax loss of Y48.6bn. Itoman, founded in 1883, is the best-known company to fall victim to the collapse of Japan's financial bubble. The company was undermined by a mid-1980s diversification into stock and property speculation, and by massive purchases of art works whose prices also plunged. The provision for loan losses is to cover loans to Itoman Finance and a string of other, financially-troubled, subsidiaries which were the vehicles for some of the company's unwise excursions into the resort market and property-related lending. For the full year, Itoman's last year of existence, the company expects sales of Y540bn, down 6.3 per cent, and a pre-tax loss of Y17bn, against a profit of Y1.5bn last year. More write-offs and provisions will lead to an after-tax loss of Y90bn, following a profit last year of Y23.4bn. At the close of the year, Itoman will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, a metal trader and a member of the Sumitomo group, which has taken responsibility for cleaning up the mess at the trading house. Itoman still has an extensive international network, and is strong in Asian trade in food, textiles and machinery, providing the unlisted Sumikin with a far broader business base. Under the agreement signed yesterday, five Itoman shares will be swapped for one Sumikin share, and the Sumitomo company will take control of all Itoman employees in March. In the meantime, Itoman will attempt to sell its Osaka headquarters to cover some of its outstanding debts and those of its ailing subsidiaries. Sumikin Bussan is an affiliate of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a core company of the Sumitomo keiretsu, or corporate group. Sumitomo Bank was a lender to Itoman, and had transferred staff to the trading house during the era of excess in the late 1980s and, later, in a vain attempt to salvage the debt-stricken company. At the height of its speculative life in 1990, Itoman was estimated to have outstanding debts of Y1,300bn, and the troubles at the trading house were a cause of the fall of Mr Ichiro Isoda, forced to resign that year as the chairman of Sumitomo Bank.</p>

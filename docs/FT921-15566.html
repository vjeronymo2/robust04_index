			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Chemicals output set to lift 2% CHEMICALS manufacturing will grow by 2 per cent this year. But Mr Richard Freeman, Imperial Chemical Industries' chief economist warned that investment will continue to decline sharply, falling 6 per cent compared with 15 per cent last year. Any improvement in output will come after a stagnant 1991 and, with most of the gain expected in the second half of this year, is in line with the forecasts for much of the rest of British manufacturing. The demand for chemicals will rise a little faster than GDP, accompanied by a 3 1/2 per cent growth in imports, compared with 1 per cent last year. Export growth will slow slightly from 3 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent, said Mr Freeman at the annual business outlook conference of the UK Chemical Industries Association. The UK's performance will be in line with that of the chemicals industry in the rest of Europe, in spite of a halving of demand for chemicals products in Germany. The association warned that some of the government statistics used were unreliable, and any revisions would probably be downward.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition lifts Watson &amp; Philip Watson &amp; Philip, the convenience store and food supplier, yesterday announced a return to interim profits growth after two years of decline with a 26 per cent jump at the pre-tax level to Pounds 5.06m. The acquisition of the Circle K convenience store chain in 1993 was largely behind the profits rise during the six months to May 1, which contrasted with an 18 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 218m. Sales were depressed by the group's decision to withdraw from the Spar/VG supply business. Mr David Bremner, chief executive, said the results vindicated W&amp;P's decision to focus on the convenience store format and move away from lower-margin, fast food supply. The interim dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 4.7p (4.4p), while earnings per share rose by 25 per cent from 8.1p to 10.1p. Mr Bremner said dividend increases were expected to lag earnings growth until W&amp;P could rebuild cover of about two times. The convenience store division showed underlying sales growth of about 2 per cent, while margins had improved from 2.3 per cent to 2.8 per cent. This was the result of introducing higher margin goods such as newspapers and chilled foods, as well as better purchasing practices. Mr Bremner said W&amp;P intended to accelerate the introduction of electronic point of sales equipment in the convenience stores. In the longer-term, this would bring considerable cost savings. W&amp;P aimed to double the margins in this business over the next five years to about 5 per cent. The group opened 24 new stores in the first half for a total of 331. A further 24 are planned for the second six months. The food services division, which provides supplies to hotels, pubs and clubs, showed a 42 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 300,000 on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 42m. Operating margins rose by 36 per cent to 0.8 per cent. The cash and carry business suffered a 5.4 per cent drop in sales to Pounds 83m, leaving profits 7 per cent lower at Pounds 860,000. Mr Bremner said the business continued to generate cash which could be invested in the two core divisions. Interest payments rose by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m, with net debt of Pounds 23m. This represented some 48 per cent of shareholders' funds, against 40 per cent last year. Mr Bremner said gearing was expected to fall back to 40 per cent by the year-end.</p>

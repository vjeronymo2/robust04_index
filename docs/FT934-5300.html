			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Advisers worried about reduced crop diversity There could be far fewer crop varieties in future as set-aside and farmers' increasing use of home-saved seed reduce the revenues that plant breeders can devote to investment, according to Adas, the UK government's agricultural advisory agency. Launching a report on the arable industry yesterday, Mr Melvyn Askew, head of Adas crop development, said this could leave crops more vulnerable to diseases and pests. 'The more diversity we have, the less chance we have of a disease or pest wiping everything out,' he said, adding that the area sown with new cereal varieties had fallen by up to 53 per cent in the UK in the past five years. He also pointed out that the US Department of Agriculture had drawn up a list of 600 new crop varieties that could be developed for non-food uses such as paint, printing ink and fibres, if breeders had the necessary financial resources. To increase revenues, breeders should receive 'intellectual property' payments on home-saved seed, he suggested. Plant breeding and seed supply are just one of the agricultural service industries to be hit by falling farm expenditure. The report says UK pesticide sales have dropped 13.5 per cent in value from their 1989 high, while inorganic fertiliser sales are down 17.7 per cent in volume from 1987. The number of tractors sold fell by 37 per cent between 1988 and last year, and the downward trend is expected to continue despite a 30 per cent rise this year due largely to the extra farm income derived from the devaluation of sterling last September. The report examines the impact on farm incomes of reforms of the European Union's common agricultural policy reforms and movements in the sterling. A typical cereal farm of 200 hectares would have income of Pounds 30,000 in 1995 compared with Pounds 31,000 last year and Pounds 29,000 this year, if sterling remains at its current exchange rate. However, a 5 per cent strengthening of the pound would reduce income to Pounds 22,000. In 1991 it was Pounds 18,000.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Besieged Georgian president offers vote on leadership GEORGIA'S beleaguered president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, said yesterday he was prepared to hold a referendum on whether he should continue in power. Speaking at a news conference inside the bunker beneath the Georgian parliament in the capital Tbilisi, where he was beginning a third week as a virtual prisoner of opposition forces demanding his resignation, Mr Gamsakhurdia indicated for the first time that he was prepared to put his popularity to the test. 'If the opposition seeks my resignation as president, it must be by referendum. I am ready but they don't want it. They know that they will be defeated,' he said. Mr Gamsakhurdia did not rule out that United Nations observers might supervise such a referendum, but said he was not sure the UN would agree to this as Georgia was not a member. Earlier, Mr Gamsakhurdia had met about half his 85 personally appointed regional officials to discuss the formation of local detachments of his supporters to keep order and stop the spread of weapons. A crowd of more than 1,000 defied an opposition ban on public meetings and demonstrated in support of Mr Gamsakhurdia outside Tbilisi's central station. There was no repeat of the violence outside the Didube suburban station on Friday, when masked opposition gunmen fired on a crowd of Gamsakhurdia supporters. Four people are now believed to have died in Friday's incident, with more than 30 injured. Mr Gamsakhurdia repeated his appeal to other nations to defend his democratically elected government against a 'violent coup d'etat by a junta of terrorists'. He said, however, that as he had no telephone links, he had not been able to talk directly with any western country or former Soviet republics. While maintaining his defiant tone, and dismissing an opposition attack on the government building as 'impossible', Mr Gamsakhurdia was subdued and showed more signs of stress than when he met a small group of reporters last Thursday. He admitted that he may have made mistakes during his presidency. He also said the lack of direct communication posed severe problems for his government, and spoke for the first time of the difficulties of life in the bunker. 'The conditions are very bad. Many people are sleeping on chairs or on the floor, and it is very hard to bring in food. We are kept going by our faith and our love of Georgia and the Georgian people,' he said. A priest performs daily services for the hundreds of people in the basement complex. The opposition leaders retreated over the weekend from earlier threats that they would storm the parliament building, saying they preferred to wait for Mr Gamsakhurdia to give himself up. Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the leaders of the opposition military council which claims to have seized power in the country, said yesterday that his forces controlled 80 per cent of Tbilisi. But the opposition blockade of the government remains incomplete, with several streets south of the building still passable, although they are vulnerable to snipers. Rift hard to heal, Page 2</p>

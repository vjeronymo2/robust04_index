			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: France languishing from lack of liquidity - A continuing poor performance What is good for Renault is not necessarily good for the markets. The French government may be congratulating itself on the apparent success of the partial privatisation of the vehicle group this week, but the sale of these shares may spell further bad news for the performance of equities. Mr David Harrington, French markets analyst with James Capel in Paris, estimates that upwards of FFr120bn in capital has been drained from the markets by a record year of privatisations, rights issues and other public offers - up from a record FFr89bn in 1993. Renault, UAP, Credit Commercial de France, Elf Acquitaine, Paribas, Michelin, Alcatel Alsthom, Peugot: the list is endless. It has sharply contributed to the lack of liquidity on the market, which in turn has led to further disappointing returns for investors. The CAC-40 index has languished over the last few months, closing yesterday at 1,926.50. 'Obviously France has been a disaster this year,' says Mr Harrington. 'It's been one of the worst performing equity markets,' says Mr Piers Butler, head of French equity sales with Smith New Court in London. He adds thatinstitutions with a spread of investments across Europe had overweighted their portfolios into France in the belief of good growth prospects, and been disappointed. Mr Frederic Redel, strategist for the French market with Societe Generale in Paris, argues: 'There has been under-performance since the end of 1992.' He says that the difficulties developed in two stages. In 1993, France remained one of the few countries with a strong currency. The effect on the exchange rate put pressure on domestic companies, causing sharp falls in their profitability. This year, the spread between OATs, French government bonds, and their German equivalents dropped almost to zero. He stresses the influence of new issues soaking up liquidity, and well as first-half profits which were generally disappointing. Mr Harrington points to other factors which he believes have dragged down the market. He says that the French stock market lacks the cyclical constituents of many other markets such as Germany, for example. High up his list is also the growing cloud of corruption overhanging many leading French companies. 'Several have had their ratings slashed,' he says. 'It may have stripped 25 per cent off the value of the CAC 40 companies.' However, he thinks there may now be signs that companies are beginning to recover from the criticisms. Much will depend on the willingness of the government to push through reforms of the funding of political parties - including, as suggested recently, the possibility of a complete ban on corporate donations. Looking forward, Mr Butler predicts the beginnings of recovery, partly triggered by recent optimistic economic data. 'Some of the smart money seems to be coming back in now,' he says. 'People are starting to think that stocks look attractively valued.' Mr Harrington is less optimistic. He says that in the short term the markets will remain for traders rather than investors. 'There may be a trading rally but I have longer-term worries about tax, the economy and unemployment,' he says. He predicts earnings per share growth for the CAC 40 companies of 38 per cent this year and 36 per cent next year - back to more normal levels. Mr Redel estimates that the CAC 40 index will reach 2,000 by the end of this year, and 2,400 by the end of 1995. The biggest uncertainty that most commentators highlight over the next few months is the presidential elections, which are due in May but may be brought forward through the tactics or advancing illness now affecting Mr Francois Mitterand, the current resident of the Elsee Palace. Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris, was the first serious candidate to declare that he was running at the start of November, in a move which is likely to split the political right. He shares membership of the Gaullist RPR party with Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who is likely to declare by January. Meanwhile, opinion polls rate Mr Jacques Delors, the socialist president of the European Commission until January, on a par with Mr Balladur. He is also likely to run, and recently published a book which has been interpreted by some as a manifesto, although he has not yet confirmed his decision. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, recently said that none of the leading candidates would do anything to upset the current government's programme of economic liberalisation. But some argue that Mr Chirac - more than Mr Delors - remains a wild card who may yet threaten reflationary policies. Mr Harrington says the most important issue for the government will be to appease the bond markets to ensure that they remain in line with those in Germany, through an insistence on maintaining budgetary restraint. 'But what is good for the bond market is not necessary good for the underlying economy or for equities,' he says.</p>

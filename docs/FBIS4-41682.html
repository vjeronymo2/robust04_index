			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Valiyev] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, 27 Jun -- Despite the DPRK's departure  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the  monitoring equipment installed by the agency at the North Korean  nuclear facilities at the village of Yongbyong, 100 km from  Pyongyang, is working normally.    This was stated today in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent by Choe Chong-Sun, chief of the external affairs  administration of the Committee for Atomic Energy of the DPRK.  If anything is required to be replaced in the course of the  operation of this equipment, we will consult the IAEA, he  pointed out. In addition, two of the agency's inspectors remain  on the territory of the republic. They are, it is true, leaving  the DPRK tomorrow, but there are two experts coming to replace  them on the same day who will continue the inspection work.  Representatives of North Korea also remain in Vienna, where the  IAEA headquarters are located.    In the words of Choe Chong-sun, as before, the DPRK still  does not pin especial hopes on cooperation with the IAEA. He  estimated the agency's aid to Pyongyang last year at $500,000 in  the field of agriculture, medicine and the manufacture of  certain goods.    The main aim of the reactor in Yongbyob, constructed with  the  close cooperation of the former USSR, is the development of  nuclear energy to supply the requirements for developing the  national economy, and the DPRK government is conducting an  immutable policy in this respect, he said. This type of  graphite reactor is the most rational for the country's  conditions, since the country possesses reserves of uranium and  graphite.    To clear suspicion, the DPRK last year put forward in talks  with the United States the idea of replacing the present reactor  with a light water reactor. But the main aim is nevertheless  not the reactor itself, Choe Chong-sun stressed, but the  country's being fully supplied with electricity. In the present  conditions we simply cannot help using the existing 5-megawatt  reactor for our own needs, he pointed out.    Naturally, the USSR provided assistance in the construction  of the reactor, but in its successor -- Russia -- there is now a  difficult situation, so the republic does not pin especial hopes  on it in this matter, he said. I think, Cho'e Cong-sun noted,  that we now have hardly any cooperation with Russia in the  nuclear field.    Nor, he said, is Pyongyang especially counting on other  countries in the matter of creating a light water reactor or in  the field of nuclear experts. All the work is being carried out  by Korean scientists. Overall, the DPRK does not feel any  special technological need to replace the reactor and is making  such plans only in order to remove from itself the suspicion of  secret development of nuclear weapons, he announced.    Choe Chong-sun announced that the DPRK has plutonium, which  is used for experimental purposes in the radio chemistry  laboratory in Yongbyon, but he did not name the existing  quantity.    Concluding the conversation, he expressed indignation at  what  in his view is the false coverage of the North Korean nuclear  program by the Western mass information media.</p>

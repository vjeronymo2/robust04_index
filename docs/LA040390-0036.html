			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL CARE CUT AS 1,900 KAISER WORKERS GO ON STRIKE  </P> <P> Jerry Voegtli normally designs hospital offices. But on Monday he was tramping  the halls of Kaiser Permanente's Woodland Hills hospital in a white coat with a  stethoscope in his pocket.  </P> <P> "They made me a doctor," he joked.  </P> <P> Actually, things weren't that bad on the first day of a strike by the Hospital  and Service Employees Union at seven of Kaiser Permanente's Southern California  hospitals. Voegtli was working as a respiratory therapist, a job he had  performed for many years before being transferred three years ago to Kaiser  headquarters in Pasadena, where he now works as a senior planner.  </P> <P> But with 1,000 of 1,800 workers out on strike in Woodland Hills, and another  900 of 2,500 out in Panorama City, those remaining on the job were being  pressed into a variety of unaccustomed assignments to fill in for the striking  technicians and licensed vocational nurses.  </P> <P> Jean Strauss, a top administrator, handed packets of information to 200 workers  from Kaiser facilities as far away as Bakersfield who volunteered to help  during the strike. The packets contained a map to keep the newcomers from  getting lost.  </P> <P> She said the hospital was functioning well, although 17 non-critical-care  patients were transferred to Humana West Hills Hospital, and the hospital was  refusing to accept patients from ambulances unless the victims were in danger  of dying. Thirty more patients were transferred from Panorama City's facility.  </P> <P> Lynn Brassfield, a spokeswoman for the hospital in Woodland Hills, said Kaiser  Permanente member-patients were being asked to reschedule medical appointments  to reduce the load on the volunteer workers. Several floors were closed as the  hospital's capacity was reduced from 212 beds to 88 beds.  </P> <P> Kaiser officials began preparing for the strike three weeks ago, said  Brassfield. Each employee received a card that requested background information  on any medical skills they possessed. When the strike was called, people were  matched with jobs that needed filling.  </P> <P> Sunday, ambulances were kept busy moving patients out of the hospital before  the strike deadline at 12:01 a.m., Monday.  </P> <P> The strike by hospital workers in Woodland Hills got off to an almost polite  start. A score of pickets marched along De Soto Avenue in front of the  hospital, passing out information apologizing for the inconvenience.  </P></p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Morsel fails to satisfy the hungry - London Toss hungry markets only a morsel and they are likely to turn on you. The government and Bank of England were taught the lesson this week by equity, bond and foreign exchange markets. A one-quarter point cut in the base rate on Tuesday was not what markets were expecting or what they wanted. They were hoping to feed the bulls a half point in the spring. Caught on the hop for the second time in three days, the markets were in no mood to buy the authorities' explanation for the cut. The Bank said it was appropriate to lower the rate because inflation was well under control. It forecast that the retail price index minus mortgages would probably be running at just over 3 per cent by the end of next year, well within the government's target of 1-4 per cent. The markets were worried, though, by the Bank's admission that inflation was more likely to rise than fall. Moreover, the Bank said that getting inflation into the bottom half of the range would require wage negotiators and others to lower their inflationary expectations. With a big rise in taxes looming in April, that was asking a lot. They worried also that a quarter point cut, the first reduction of such a modest size in nine years, meant that the bottom of the interest rate cycle was in sight. All this came after a string of previous signals from the Bank that there was no need to cut rates in the near term. If economic logic was lacking then the cut had to be politically inspired, market participants concluded. Michael Portillo, chief secretary of the Treasury, did not help by trying to dismiss the fear. 'This has nothing to do with elections and tax rises,' he said. With rather unfortunate timing, Eddie George, the Bank governor, had argued only last Sunday that an independent Bank would sometimes be out of step with the government. 'There would be circumstances when we would want to see interest rates higher than the government because we would not be facing the same short-term political pressures.' When it came to the day of the rate cut, Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George went there separate ways, each to do what they do best. The Chancellor headed for Paris to deliver a speech in French and to lobby for Nigel Lawson's candidacy for the OECD secretary-generalship. The governor headed off to Basle for closed-door talks with other central bankers. Thus unsettled, it was no surprise that the FT-SE 100 finished the week down 96.5 points net at 3,378.9, long-dated gilts lost 1 1/2 points and sterling lost 2.5 cents against the dollar and 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark. The contrast with the US was stark. A rise of one-quarter point in the Fed Funds rate a week ago caused US markets to wobble but by early this week they had regained their poise. Apparently, they had bought the official line that a rate rise was a shot across inflation's bows. High drama marked Monday's opening to the week. How would markets respond to the big sell-off on Wall Street the previous Friday? They started badly with the Footsie trading as much as 96 points down at one point in the day and gilts falling sharply. But the absence of selling by UK institutions, a recovery in gilts and a rebound on Wall Street brought partial relief. First thing on Tuesday morning, the focus of the UK markets was yanked back to domestic questions by the base rate cut. But the long-term repercussions of the US rate rise will echo through global markets for months to come. The week's turmoil, inevitably, has heightened the City's debate over where equities go from here. They are over-valued when judged, for example, by the index-linked gilts/dividend yield ratio, argues Ian Harnett, chief economist and market strategist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. They are under-valued, according to Paul Walton, market strategist at James Capel. He looks back to the early 1980s when the UK economy was in a similar position about 1 1/2 years after a devaluation and at the end of a big bond rally. Then as now, the yield ratio of bonds to dividends had plenty of scope to improve. He asserts that a 2.25 per cent yield ratio, equivalent to a 3 per cent dividend yield, equates to a level of 3,750 on the Footsie. Moreover, he expects dividends to grow faster than widely forecast as companies get into the reporting season over the next few weeks. Next year could bring a rate of dividend growth near 10 per cent. Market outperformance of individual stocks this week was limited to a handful of companies, most of which were connected with bids. Most impressively, GKN, the vehicle parts maker, launched a hostile bid for the 53 per cent of Westland it does not own. The offer values the helicopter maker at Pounds 496m: GKN claims there is synergy between its armoured vehicles and helicopters. The City was dubious about the logic, coming as it did only a week after British Aerospace said there was no reason to make both air and ground vehicles. GKN ended the week down 23p at 557p and Westland, fighting an improbable battle against such a large minority owner, ended up 29p at 333p. The betting is GKN will get Westland if it wants it, but at a higher price. But it was back to feeding time by the end of the week. Governor George appeared to have learnt Tuesday's lesson. On Thursday evening he attended a sumptuous banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor to mark this year's tercentenary of the Bank. Unlike the Barclays manager who recently charged his client for accepting his lunch invitation, the governor assured his City guests he would not charge them for the time of all his colleagues present.</p>

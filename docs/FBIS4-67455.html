			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Pavlov, under rubric "Sensation": "Russia </F> -- The Country of Sighs"]    [Text] According to data obtained from the RF [Russian  Federation] Academy of Sciences, the domestic flora absorbs more  carbon dioxide than is produced on the entire Russian territory.  It follows from this that our country, with all its antediluvean  industry and its smoking transportation is doing its best to  save mankind from the greenhouse effect. These unexpected  results that were achieved after prolonged experiments and  miscalculations, are apparently capable of giving trumps not  only to our industrialists in the fight against the "Greens,"  but also to the politicians who are discussing ecological  problems on an international level.    Sergey Kurayev, chief of the Climatic Programs Department of  Rosgidromet [Russian Hydrometeorological Service], states:    "The chief contribution to the global warming of the climate  is made by carbon dioxide. It is not by accident that the  developed countries have pledged to stabilize emissions of this  gas. The United States, for example, `blow' into the atmosphere  22 percent of the worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, which  is more than Russia (11 percent) and China (10 percent)  combined. But, in our opinion, the crux of the matter is not how  much you emit, but, rather, how much you take back. Currently at  the negotiations dealing with the convention, a question that is  being raised sharply is whether one should employ the  balance-sheet approach: to require a country to report on the  difference between emission and absorption. Otherwise, in  accordance with the currently accepted methodology for making  computations, the largest polluter of the earth's atmosphere is  Luxembourg: the country is minuscule, there are no forests, but  there are a tremendous number of motor vehicles."    As became known recently, 4.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide  "goes into the sky" annually from the territory of Russia, and  4.62 billion tons is absorbed. The total result is that 420  million tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed annually by our  forests. (Although there are other opinions on this score.) The  most interesting thing is that there are few people who can  venture a guess about our negative balance with regard to carbon  dioxide. In any case. when I mentioned this at a recent meeting  with officials from the German Ministry of Ecology, the Germans'  eyes bulged out. I shall quote a few lines from a report written  by RF Academy of Sciences academician Zavarzin: "The obtained  results definitely indicate the role played by Russia and other  countries in the humid zone of the Northern Hemisphere as being  the Earth's lungs. Contrary to the generally accepted opinion,  the countries in the tropic zone are not absorbers of carbon  dioxide on a world scale."</p>

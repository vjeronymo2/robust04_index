			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: London stock market moves closer to Europe THE London stock market is to take a further stride into continental Europe when broking firms which operate entirely outside the UK will be admitted to its international share market. Two Spanish broking firms, one of them owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, are understood to have applied to join Seaq International, the London exchange's quote system which supports a large telephone market in foreign shares. Neither broker has operations in London, putting them outside the direct control of the UK market regulators. The development is being delayed, however, by the need to satisfy the UK's Financial Services Act, which governs investment business in the UK. Under this act, the brokers will only be allowed to quote prices on Seaq International once there is a formal memorandum of understanding between the Spanish and UK regulatory authorities. This would allow the UK authorities to accept the Spanish firms as being properly regulated. No memorandum of understanding exists between the UK and Spain, although it is believed that progress is being made to put one in place. Some brokers quote prices on Seaq International from outside the UK, although they have operations which come under the direct supervision of the UK authorities. These are James Capel, S G Warburg, CCF, Credit Suisse First Boston and Madoff Securities.</p>

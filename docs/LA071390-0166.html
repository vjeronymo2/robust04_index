			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BART SIMPSON'S SMIRKING FACE SHOWS UP ON LSD-LACED STAMP  </P> <P> Bart Simpson, the television cartoon character whose image can be found on  everything from coffee mugs to T-shirts, is turning up on stamps of the  psychedelic drug LSD.  </P> <P> Bart's smirking face has appeared on blotter acid, LSD-laced stamps that are  sold in sheets, police said.  </P> <P> Michael Borcsok, 21, of Albany was charged Tuesday with possession of 261  "hits" of hallucinogenic Bart Simpson stamps, police said.  </P> <P> Another batch of the stamps surfaced last week in Pittsfield, Mass., about 40  miles east of Albany, police there said.  </P> <P> "These stamps are very obviously aimed at young children. Kids love Bart  Simpson," said Steve Dnistrian, a spokesman for Phoenix House, a New York drug  rehabilitation center.  </P> <P> Cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy have been placed on blotter  acid sheets since the 1960s, when the illegal drug became widely sold.  </P></p>

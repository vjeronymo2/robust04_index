			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Consultations on the Black Sea Fleet </F> Continue"]    [Text] Ukraine's first deputy minister of defense and  chief of the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces A. Lopata  and Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense I. Bizhan held a  briefing for diplomats accredited in Ukraine on the incident  that took place in Odessa between subdivisions of the Odessa  Military District and the Black Sea Fleet. Lopata sent a  telegram to the Russian Ministry of Defense in which he asked  that the departure of the vessel the Cheleken from Odessa be  halted until the situation is finally clarified. Ukrainian  Minister of Defense V. Radetskyy tried to get in touch with P.  Grachev, his counterpart in the Russian Federation. He sent  Grachev a telegram in which the essence of the conflict and the  position of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense were explained.  Grachev's reply revealed a total lack of knowledge of the  circumstances and a deliberate distortion of facts. For  example, in his telegram, Grachev referred to the Cheleken as a  Russian vessel.    On the proposal by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, on 12  April, consultations started between the Ministries of Defense  of Ukraine and Russia and a search for ways to resolve the Black  Sea Fleet problem. The delegation of the Russian Federation  includes chief commander of the Naval Forces F. Gromov and  Ambassador for Special Missions Yu. Dubinin. The Ukrainian  delegation is headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs B. Tarasyuk.  On the first day, the sides did not reach any agreement. On 13  April, the consultations continued in Sevastopol.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Electricity companies Companies paying dividend increases of 20 per cent are either privatised or throw-backs to the 1980s. Unfortunately for lucky regional electricity company shareholders, this year's interim largesse will be tempered by the final payment and total dividend increases are unlikely to be more than 15 per cent. Still, that leaves REC investors with little to grumble about. Even the companies accept that their current profitability cannot last and will be curbed by the current regulatory review. A once and for all cut in electricity prices, as well as a tightening of the price cap seem likely. While that could cut profits by more than 20 per cent, the RECs would still have positive cash flow. With cover still high and net cash in the bank, paying handsomely progressive dividends is thus little problem. Indeed, the RECs' over-capitalisation argues for more drastic action. One possibility would be to demerge rather than sell the National Grid. Putting its capital and dividend streams directly into REC shareholders' hands would certainly unlock value. After that, a wholesale capital restructuring to regear balance sheets and return cash would be preferable to squandering money chasing wild geese in the manner of the water companies.</p>

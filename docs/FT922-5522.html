			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pinault's General plots his European assault - Francois Pinault talks about expansion plans for his retail interests Mr Francois Pinault has a habit of sprinkling his conversation with references to General 'Stormin'' Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the allied forces in the Gulf war. 'Stormin'' Norman, Mr Pinault is quick to point out, won the war. Mr Pinault, who has already turned Pinault, his tiny timber business, into one of France's largest distribution groups, has every intention of winning too. So far, Mr Pinault's campaign has been fought mainly on French soil, culminating late last year with his successful - if highly controversial - takeover of Au Printemps, one of France's best known retailing groups. Now he is casting his sights further afield; his main aim for the next few years will be to expand some of the Printemps' businesses - principally the La Redoute mail order business and Conforama chain of furniture stores - into the European market. 'Europe is our target,' said Mr Pinault from the top floor of his headquarters in the swanky seventh arrondissement of Paris. 'We have the right concepts and we have the right team. Our future lies in developing them in other countries.' Mr Pinault is well known in France, where he is seen as one of the most aggressive entrepreneurs. The French press brackets him with Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group, and Mr Vincent Bollore, who heads the industrial company, Bollore. They are self-made men who built their businesses through audacious acquisitions from outside the well-bred ranks of the business establishment. Mr Pinault's early deals, in the early 1960s, were in the timber industry, where he built his original distribution business in Brittany. He diversified into wood importing, and then into retailing, with a network of shops selling first to the trade and later to consumers. He came to prominence in France in 1987 by buying Chapelle Darblay, an ailing paper mill baled out by state subsidies. Three years later Mr Pinault turned a tidy profit by selling it. He then expanded further by buying Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale (CFAO), which had interests in everything from supermarkets to car dealerships. The biggest deal was the FFr5.3bn (Dollars 970m) partial bid for Printemps, which showed Mr Pinault at his most pugilistic as he shrugged off protests from minority shareholders, furious at being excluded from his offer. The acquisition sparked an official review of France's takeover legislation, but Mr Pinault bagged his prey. Printemps set the seal on Mr Pinault's strategy of turning his company from a collection of timber businesses, exposed to the cyclical construction sector, into what he calls a 'multi-disciplinary distribution group'. Construction, he claims, is 'too cyclical' and 'too vulnerable to competition from Asia and eastern Europe'. He says he feels more comfortable with a combination of higher margin activities in retailing and wholesale distribution, provided 'you are present in enough different sectors to be protected against problems in individual markets'. He has been left with a company with annualised sales of FFr70bn - about 30 per cent of which comes from outside France - and a workforce of 65,000. He has also been left with net debt of FFr17bn which, even Mr Pinault admits, must be reduced. Debt reduction was under way two weeks ago with the sale of Pinault's original timber interests to Dapta-Malinjoud, the French DIY group. Mr Pinault says other sales are in the pipeline, although he will not specify which businesses are on the block. The likeliest candidates, however, are the manufacturing companies, which represent 20 per cent of sales and do not fit with the new focus on distribution. Paris analysts are sanguine about Pinault's prospects of pulling off the disposals despite the depressed state of the construction market. Mr Philippe Bastin, distribution analyst at James Capel, has pencilled in a reduction in net debt to FFr14bn by the end of 1992 and FFr13bn a year later. He also forecasts net profits of FFr750m this year and FFr980m for 1993. Mr Pinault is resigned to 'a year of consolidation' before he pursues his plans for Conforama and La Redoute. He is also resigned to relinquishing his old role as a deal-maker to concentrate on organic growth. He has already made a number of management changes, including the appointment of Mr Jean-Paul Huchon, former head of Printemps, as group chief executive. 'Look at that,' he says, waving at a bare desk. 'There's nothing on it. Other people are running the business. Now it's up to them.'</p>

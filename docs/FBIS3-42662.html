Andreyev:  "We Have Something To Offer Partners"]    [Text]    [Andreyev] Recently in Moscow the first session of the  organizing committee for the "Technology From Russia" exhibit  took place, which will be held in mid-May in the U.S.  capital--Washington. Can you tell us about the results [of the  session]?    [Volskiy] Last year the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs [RUIE] jointly with its American partners decided  to hold an exhibit at which it would be possible to show the  leading achievements of Russian science and engineering.    The idea of holding this exhibit was supported both by the  Russian government (in December the Council of Ministers issued  a directive and the organizing committee was created with the  participation of heads of the country's leading ministries and  departments) and by the American government.    We are talking about an exhibit which would be able to make  a  breakthrough into the now unified North American market, where  namely technology is needed.    [Andreyev] Who will participate from the Russian side?    [Volskiy] Invitations to participate have been sent to more  than one thousand enterprises, scientific-research, and  scientific-production centers. As of today we have several  hundred responses, primarily from large enterprises which  understand the importance of a civilized and purposeful entrance  into the outside market. Moreover, at the same time as our  exhibit an American industrial exhibit "MAK-94" will be held,  and ,thus, there is the possibility of direct contact between  the interested parties. On our side we are proposing to show  the latest achievements in the spheres of aerospace industry,  shipbuilding, medical equipment, communications and computer  science, the mining industry, etc. In addition, there will be a  series of seminars with prticipation of representatives of the  largest American firms.    [Andreyev] The exhibit will be held on a commercial basis,  and, apparently, many of our country's enterprises, which are in  the throes of financial crisis, do not have the money to  participate.    [Volskiy] Yes, the cost of the complete package is about  $10,000 (with payment in rubles according to the current  exchange rate). This is an impressive sum, but it includes  exhibit space, round trip flight, lodging and complete room and  board from 5-16 May, participation in all measures of the  exhibit, and talks with American partners. Taking into account  how foolishly many of our enterprises spend their money on  advertising their products, such a purposeful investment  absolutely justifies itself. And for a number of enterprises,  which produce unique technology but are in a difficult financial  situation, we will search for sponsors. The organizational  committee decided this.    [Andreyev] When is the deadline for applications?    [Volskiy] According to an agreement with the American side,  which is showing enormous interest in the exhibit, the date for  submitting applications will last until 15 February. Those  enterprises and organizations which are ready to exhibit their  products can write to the exhibit at the address: 109240,  Moscow, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment 17, apartment 312.  Telephone: 915 4831. Fax: 926 2052.</p>

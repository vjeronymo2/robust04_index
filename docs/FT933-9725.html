			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Fashion: Your skirt is lovely, Sir - His habit started 11 years ago, when he popped into a smart London shop and bought a long checked skirt for Pounds 80. In the first of a short series on people who buy clothes for their partners, Nick Lander explains the pleasure he gets buying clothes for his wife, Jancis Robinson - usually on impulse and always without her I MUST confess to an addictive habit, one that I have suffered from for the past 11 years. It has proved expensive but not extravagant and has given me a great deal of pleasure without harming anything other than my wallet. It began modestly just after 10am one December morning at Brown's in South Molton Street, London. Looking furtively both ways to make sure I would not be spotted, I walked in and bought a long, checked Perry Ellis skirt for Pounds 80. My habit continued in a basement in Soho, took a strong hold in a designer's shop off Carnaby Street and reached its most costly form nine years later at Jaeger in Regent Street. But I have indulged in it around the world - on the last occasion, three months ago, in a very plush shopping plaza in Hong Kong. I really enjoy buying clothes for my wife, usually on impulse and always without her. It is not just the giving which supplies the pleasure. Nor watching her put on what I have bought and wondering whether she will like it (so far the success rate is 100 per cent). What I like is that buying the clothes and watching my wife wear them dramatically increases the sexual message that all good fashion designers try to instil in their clothes. I have no fashion knowledge or training but I know what I like - strong, individual designs or patterns, good fabrics well-cut, clothes that hang well. I like, too, those things which appeal immediately, even on the rack, but give the impression that they will last. I know that these are not uncommon likes, but for me there are two extra sources of pleasure: first, imagining Jancis in them when I am in the shop and she is not, which is obviously the fantasy element; second, seeing her wear them when I revert to the role of proud husband. The designer Betty Jackson nurtured my habit. When I tentatively mentioned to her that I was looking for something for my wife, she told me to come and look around her workshop. I was smitten, and a number of outfits followed: an olive green wool skirt with two possible tops and a grey, patterned jacket and jodhpurs. This is now the only shopping I find exciting. A couple of years later, flipping through Vogue, my eye was caught by a short, risque red velvet dress, designed by Helen Storey or Karen Boyd (I forget which, for reasons which will become clear). I strolled confidently to the designers' shared shop to be shown by the assistant not only the dress I had spotted but its sister, a short crimson skirt and matching jacket with a plunging neckline. Both were Pounds 140. It was late on a cold December evening but the shop assistant showed great concern. I was indecisive. Even when she put them on the mannequin I found it difficult to choose. Then she showed her initiative, closed the shop door and modelled them for me. An hour-and-a-half later, still undecided, I bought both. Since then, no designer label has given me the slightest apprehension. I have flirted with Ally Cappellino and bought a very expensive Jean Muir outfit when our marriage passed a significant landmark. This cost over Pounds 500, but I knew it was right from the moment I saw it - a plain silk top, knee length linen skirt and a wonderful white linen jacket with a large, black fish motif all over. Just the thing to be seen in a restaurant with. I do not often baulk at the price, though I did once. Five years ago a Chanel suit seemed appropriate but the price, more than Pounds 800, was totally out of the question. Fortunately, my knowledgeable mother-in-law knew the mill in the north of England which wove the fabric and, more important, the mill shop. A tailor in Soho did the rest for a quarter of the price. It is not really the price which intimidates because I always have a maximum in mind. It is how I am treated once I have had the temerity to cross what was considered a no-go area for males that determines whether I will stay and part with my hard-earned credit card. I immediately left a shop in Knightsbridge when I was shown a lovely dress priced at twice my maximum. What has added considerably to the pleasure has been the reaction of almost all the shop assistants I have encountered. At first they show surprise mixed with amusement, but this turns quickly to friendly concern. The young woman at Jaeger seemed as excited as I was with the Jean Muir, and genuinely touched by my gesture. As she wrapped the parcel she told me she had just become engaged and hoped her future husband would come home with similar packages. I am sure I ask the assistants questions that make their working life more interesting. What could be the biggest obstacle - size - has never been a problem. I try and find someone in the shop who is roughly the same size as Jancis, but everyone I have bought from has said that I can change clothes if necessary. And although I am quite firm with the price of the main outfit, I am a pushover when it comes to accessories. Fashion designers and retailers of women's clothes may do well to cultivate the male buyer. On a recent food writers' trip to Hong Kong, our party walked past a shop with a striking Donna Karan dress in the window. It was a long-sleeved, body-hugging red Lycra dress with a broad red bow at the neck. I stopped to admire it, as did the only female member of our party who selflessly volunteered to model it for me. I bought the dress, which cost Pounds 75, and on the way to the airport she confessed that she had gone back the next day and bought a similar one for herself.</p>

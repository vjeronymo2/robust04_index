			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD extended early gains to close on the London bullion market at Dollars 343 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.15 from Friday's finish on the back of constructive technicals after an afternoon fix of Dollars 342.70. Dealers said that the market appeared to be building a base of support around Dollars 342, but concern remained over producer sell orders believed to be in place around current levels. A break through Dollars 345-Dollars 346 would signal a sharp move to Dollars 350. Comex gold futures were firmer at midday. 'Gold is holding its gains from last week so it looks good,' said one New York analyst. London COCOA prices closed down after speculative long liquidation in New York ahead of July's first notice day tomorrow. There appeared to be no sign of any major selling by producers, but the prospect of further sales continued to weigh on sentiment. Dealers said signs of increased flexibility from Brazil at producer talks in Ivory Coast were seen as mildly constructive. On the LME solid buying interest helped keep TIN'S upward momentum intact, with three-month prices hitting a new 25-month high of Dollars 6,590 a tonne. Many expect prices to hit an upside objective of Dollars 7,000 by the end of the month. Compiled from Reuters</p>

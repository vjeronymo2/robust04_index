			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Long View: Shares under pressure A first quarter setback for the London stock market is seasonally quite unusual, and can be blamed on overseas events, notably the upsets in international bonds. Plainly, though, UK equities were looking expensive at the end of last year. I described them here as being 'only for the brave and nimble' although the flood tide of global liquidity might yet carry them to a dividend yield of 3 per cent. In the event the All-Share Index rose another 5 per cent to a peak on February 2, and the yield fell to a scant 3.2 per cent. Then, like so many other securities markets, the London stock market was spooked by the US Federal Reserve's initial quarter-point increase in dollar short-term interest rates on February 4. The international origin of London's setback is evident from the behaviour of the different indices. The market leaders which comprise the FTSE-100 Index were down 10 per cent in the three months (and by 12 1/2 per cent from the peak) but the All-Share was off only 7 per cent and the SmallCap Index was in fact marginally higher. Even now the average dividend yield on the SmallCap constituents is under 3 per cent, while Footsie stocks yield 3.9 per cent. Overseas holders of blue chips have been selling, but the mainly domestic holders of second-liners have not budged. Much more violent events have been taking place in bonds, where long gilts, for instance, started the year on a freakishly low yield of 6.37 per cent, which has subsequently jumped (by about 1 1/2 percentage points at the worst). In US Treasury bonds, where all the trouble really started, the benchmark 30-year issue lost about 13 per cent of its capital value in the first quarter, greatly underperforming US equities (down only about 4 per cent). Although some analysts are claiming that this bond market collapse implies a rise in expectations of inflation, I believe this is a false conclusion. We have simply witnessed the collapse of a speculative bubble. It appears to have been very much of a bond market version of the equity market boom and crash in 1987. That was interpreted in some quarters as heralding a new Great Depression, but nothing on that scale has happened. Similarly, the problems of the bond market have little economic consequence in themselves, except to illustrate the proneness of the modern financial system to speculative excesses - which appear to be transferring to the commodities markets. The bond bubble had the effect of distorting the relationships between bonds and equities. In the UK this has been further complicated by the presence of index-linked gilts, so that there is a real long-term interest rate (at present about 3.4 per cent) in the market as well as a fixed interest rate (7.7 per cent) and an equity dividend yield (3.7 per cent on the All-Share). Market strategists attempt to fit these into a kind of matrix to allow for inflation and dividend growth, plus margins for risk. By the end of last year the low fixed-interest yield was putting heavy downward pressure on the index-linked real yield. Meanwhile room was created for equities to rise despite the poor value they represented on fundamental grounds of dividends and earnings. The subsequent jump in the real yield on index-linkers has in effect forced equity yields up, because risky shares have to yield significantly more than safe gilts (unless there are exceptional prospects for short-term dividend growth). True, index-linked gilts only have about 5 per cent of the market value of equities, so you might say that the tail is improbably wagging the dog; but the London equity market has always been highly yield-conscious by international standards. Meanwhile the equity yield has also been tugged upwards by fixed interest yields, to maintain a yield ratio of about 2. This was a common ratio during the 1980s, but as I have written before, it has varied widely over the longer term (being under 1 until the late 1950s) and is also very different in other countries. To justify a ratio of around 2 you need to assume moderately high inflation as well as decent economic growth. If inflation stays low, as on balance I believe it will, the ratio will surely have to fall: I would be happier with a figure of about 1.5 or 1.6. If inflation rises sharply share prices will fall anyway, as both short and long interest rates jump. If anything UK economic expansion has been looking too hot for the equity market's comfort recently; the best hope now is that the tax increases which have just taken effect will cool this growth. If not, the lack of balance in the upturn - too much consumer spending, too little investment - will lead to a typical UK balance of payments crisis. The economic statistics are of such poor quality that it is impossible to be confident of what is going on. But. as far as the corporate sector is concerned, profit and dividend growth almost appears too buoyant, so that in the water sector, for instance, a political backlash is beginning to develop. If the economy slows a sterling crisis may be avoided but investors may feelthat they have become complacent about profits growth over the next year or two. Plainly, share prices in the UK offer rather better value now than they did at the beginning of the year. The prospective yield on the market leaders, allowing for dividend rises in the rest of the results season, is probably around 4 per cent. We are approaching that period of the year, however, when seasonal pressures are more more regularly negative. We have not seen a full unwinding yet of the phase of overvaluation that began to develop, along with the bond market bubble, in the third quarter of last year. But prepare your buying list anyway. Reasonable value may not now be too far away, perhaps created by a political scare or two.</p>

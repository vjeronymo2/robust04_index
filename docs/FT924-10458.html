			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Argentina sells 80% of state-owned steel mill ARGENTINA has privatised its largest state-owned steel mill, selling 80 per cent of Aceros Parana to a consortium led by Techint, an Argentine industrial conglomerate for Dollars 409m. Techint, the only company to bid for Aceros Parana, is one of Argentina's largest industrial groups and owner of the Siderca and Propulsora specialty steel companies. It bought Aceros Parana, previously called Somisa, in alliance with Usiminas and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil and Chile's CAP. The buyers offered Dollars 140m in cash, plus Dollars 12.1m in foreign debt certificates, which trade at half their face value. They are to spend a further Dollars 12.6m to comply with Argentina's rigid labour laws which force them to sack and re-hire Aceros Parana's 5,800 employees. Furthermore, the buyers must take on Dollars 250m in financial and contractual liabilities. Aceros Parana suffered large losses in 1991, when sales of about Dollars 500m were outstripped by losses of Dollars 570m. The buyers expect it to move into the black in 1995 with a Dollars 37m profit. Techint - which is injecting Dollars 50m into the venture - is likely to own 30 per cent of the new group, while Usiminas is expected to hold 5 per cent.</p>

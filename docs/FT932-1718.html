			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): A computing world beyond science fiction - Management VISIONS OF THE FUTURE: ART, TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTING IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY edited by Clifford A. Pickover Science Reviews, 212 pages THE JOURNAL Popular Mechanics in 1949 tentatively predicted 'computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and perhaps only weigh 1.5 tons.' Now Visions of the Future, a catholic congregation of essays on technology and computing over the next decade, is suggesting that we may soon have computers floating in our bloodstream. They are already in the palm of our hand. The book's faults are understandable: it spreads itself thinly over Artificial Intelligence, electronic storytelling, weather mapping, Virtual Reality and even the Global Enneper-Weierstrauss representation for Minimal Surfaces. This loose gathering of tentative technology should be balanced by reading an account of changes in computing such as Technology 2001: The Future of Computing and Communications (MIT Press, 1991). However, Visions of the Future maps out a variety of roles for computer technologies and applications, ranging from golf to traffic control via molecular biology and prehistory. Amid this diversity, three unifying themes emerge. The first is the interdisciplinary nature of the new technology. Computing as a technical process may be electronic, but as a human procedure it is eclectic. Here are essays on visualising numbers, on teaching writing to groups of students, and on a model career as a computer sculptor. The second theme is the matter of how changes in computer design will affect how we communicate with each other over the next 20 years. Electronic mail and computer conferencing are still teenagers at IBM, but the pace of change itself will quicken as computer hardware improves. Here, Davis Albert Foulger of IBM's TJ Watson Research Center at Yorktown Heights has a fascinating essay on computer communication which runs from Marshall McLuhan through Star Trek. He presents a three-dimensional model media space, showing the relations between types of communication: film, TV, animation, letters, telephone. Computer communications, being so adaptable, create links between other media to produce programmes of text, pictures, voiceovers and direct contact between users, what Foulger calls 'voice-into-text concurrent interaction.' The third theme should be a comfort: as computers advance, humans can feel more satisfied with their own brains. Granted, computers now surpass us in technical logical skills; rational thinking, around 100,000 years old, is a still relatively new, and serious competition arrived only with the computer. But human survival (and that of our ancestors) has for millions of years depended on skills which computers cannot perform: seeing and moving in the physical world. A computer which can model fractal geometry and Mandelbrot Sets at millions of calculations per second still cannot recognise itself in a mirror. Computers can search a database, but only when instructed to look for data or patterns of data already present. The success of books as forms of information storage - robust, browsable, accessible, - has yet to be surpassed. The look and feel of books are better for half-remembered information, that paragraph at the foot of a left-hand page beginning with a part-remembered line, or that name rhyming with 'orange'. Behind the 20 essays in Visions of The Future lies an unexpressed question. If, as some claim, human identity (rather than personal identity) can be reduced to the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, in what sense can computers - reduced to strings of programmes - be said to have identity? The answer hangs on the difference between carbon-based and silicon-based units.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Freudian line between fact and fantasy LUCY'S NOSE by Cecily Mackworth Carcanet Pounds 12.95, 180 pages 'LUCY R' was the Scottish governess who consulted Freud because she could smell only burnt pudding and the whiff of cigar smoke. Freud tested his 'talking cure' on her, dredging up memories and emotions associated with the smells while the governess lay primly on his couch, and then told her 'I believe you are in love with your employer'. Soon afterwards, Lucy was 'cured', slipped out of Freud's life and is remembered only as a brief case history in his early work, Five Studies in Hysteria. Who was Lucy, and what happened to her? Lucy's Nose began as Cecily Mackworth's attempt to find out. She searched the Vienna archives, but discovered that while more famous Freud patients - the Rat Man, the Wolf Man, Little Hans  - had been easily identified and traced, nothing is known of Lucy, not even her name, beyond the fact of her visits to Freud's surgery at 19, Bergasse, over several months in 1892-93. So Lucy's Nose became her fictionalised story of Lucy, interwoven with details of Freud's life at the time of the case and an account of her own researches. Mackworth's Lucy is a tightly-laced, naive woman of 30 who has suddenly found herself dancing to the foreign tune of fin de siecle Vienna. The palmy days of partying and kaffee und kuchen are worlds away from her native Glasgow; her temperamental, guilt-ridden employer might have stepped out of the love-circle of Schnitzler's La Ronde. No wonder the rococo extravagance sends poor Lucy's fantasies of love and fulfilment out of control, and olfactory hallucinations take over; nevertheless her Scottish sobriety can't help conflict with the wild ideas of Vienna's trendy young doctor. 'But I am not asleep', she insists, when Freud tries to hypnotise her. And - her parting shot  - 'after all, I can have thoughts and feelings to myself'. Like every exchange between Freud and Lucy in Mackworth's story, this comes straight out of Freud's own account. One reason why Freud continues to be so widely read today is the fluency and absolute conviction of his writing; his case histories read like compressed novels. Lucy's Nose is one of these novels uncompressed, a classic tale of fear and repression unfolding into shaky self-knowledge. The 'factual' encounters between doctor and patient are the pillars of this version; Ms Mackworth's sensitively tuned embellishments extend not only to Lucy's mid-session hopes and dreams but to those of the struggling doctor too. No famous post-1900 Freud here, his couch filled by a succession of glamorous women, but an over-eager doctor, crushed when a patient responds badly, desperate to cling on to a promising case, fighting intellectual isolation and Viennese anti-Semitism. 'The poets and philosophers before me discovered the unconscious. What I discovered was the scientific method by which the unconscious can be studied', said Freud. In recent years, doubt has been cast on the complete authenticity of some of his examples; that a compelling and convincing fiction like this one can be woven out of a case history suggests that the fine line between fact and fantasy in Freud's writing is not of the first importance, that Freudian psychology took on a momentum depending less on the rigour of Freud's scientific method than on insights developed by the man himself. Ms Mackworth's book, unravelling Lucy's story through images and undercurrents of thought, well-paced, scholarly in its refusal to take any assumption for granted, honest in its account of her own dead-ends of research, is in a sense a tribute. At times her enthusiasm for Freud's Vienna carries her away ('off they stride into the bitter central European winter'), but mostly the subjectivism is liberating, allowing her to follow hunches and intuitions which a stricter approach would prevent. The result is a happy hybrid, a work in the small and excellent tradition of recent studies - Richard Holmes' Footsteps, Denis Donoghue's Warrenpoint - which combine biography and criticism with autobiography and personal anecdote: for anyone who likes his reading offbeat, a quietly fascinating and perceptive tale.</p>

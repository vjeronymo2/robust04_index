The Trusts are registered under the Act as unit investment trust, and their units of interest are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Bear Stearns, one of the cosponsors of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors the Trusts and numerous other unit investment trusts. Gruntal, also a cosponsor of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors various other unit investment trusts with Bear Stearns (Bear Stearns and Gruntal are collectively referred to as the ``Sponsors''). Each Trust is organized under a Trust Indenture and Agreement between the Trust, the Sponsors, and United States Trust Company of New York or Bank of New York, as trustee, which varies from Trust to Trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On August 28, 1991, the SEC issued an order (the ``Prior Order'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  permitting unitholders of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, to exchange their units for units in another available Trust or Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of a reduced sales charge. The Prior order also permits a conversion offer in which the unitholders of any registered unit investment trust for which there is no active secondary market may redeem their units with their respective trustees and apply the proceeds to the purchase of units of one or more of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of the same reduced sales charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment Company Act Release Nos. 18254 (Aug. 1, 1991) (notice) and 18290 (Aug. 28, 1991) (order).

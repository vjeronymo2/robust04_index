			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GINGRICH DENIES ANY WRONGDOING, LABELS ALEXANDER AS 'ALMOST IRRATIONAL'  </P> <P> Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended himself Friday against growing allegations  of House rules violations, saying the charges come from "enraged" Democrats led  by "an almost irrational" Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.).  </P> <P> Gingrich, the combative assistant House Republican leader, said on ABC's "Good  Morning America" that Democrats have vowed revenge since he spurred the ethics  case that led to the June resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.).  </P> <P> "I think there are people who are enraged that I insisted on investigating Jim  Wright and I think, frankly, they will try to do virtually anything to try to  prove that you can't stand up to that kind of power and get away with it," he  said.  </P> <P> Alexander already has filed a complaint against Gingrich with the House ethics  committee and said Thursday he is preparing to amend the charge to include as  many as 200 additional rules violations.  </P></p>

Recently, soldiers of the Kim Song-un unit, while defending  the motherland as firm as a rock, built fashionable dwelling  houses for 72 families and delivered them to villagers.    Army units including the Han Kye-sun and Kang Sang-sop units  have actively helped nearby cooperative farms in their  springtime farming with manpower and materials and looked after  the life of families of soldiers who fell in the fatherland  liberation war, and people's army dependents.    Many soldiers went to coal and ore mines, cooperative farms  and other units of the national economy during their leave and  gave a helping hand to the working people there.    People's Army soldiers also built reservoirs and bridges  across rivers and streams for villagers. "Army-civilian fields",  "Army- civilian bridges" and "Army-civilian reservoirs" can be  seen in many places of the country.    Kim Myong-su, Chon Chang-kun reservoir and farm's fields.

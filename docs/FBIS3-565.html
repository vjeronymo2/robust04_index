"The COSATU Executive Committee  is totally opposed to any change in the election date, for  whatever reason," the statement said.    "This date has now become carved in stone and it would be a  disaster for our country if we allowed those opposed to progress  to hold the elections hostage," it added.    The committee pledged the full support of COSATU and its  affiliates to striking workers in Bophuthatswana. "We fully  support the demands of people in that region for  re-incorporation and free political activity, as well as the  securing of their pension monies, which are not safe while in  the grip of the corrupt (President Lucas) Mangope regime".    The committee said Mr Mangope's refusal to submit to the  democratic process had left people in that region with no option  but to bring him to his knees.    The committee also rejected the replacement of the South  African Police by a private security firm at major airports.  "At this crucial time it is highly irresponsible to allow such  sensitive public institutions to become vulnerable to attack by  forces opposing the democratic process. COSATU demands the  immediate reversal of this decision," the statement said.</p>

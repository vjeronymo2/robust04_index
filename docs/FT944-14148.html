			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Asia 'may need to rely on foreign capital' Asia's high savings rates may be insufficient to finance the region's ambitious infrastructure spending plans in the medium term, forcing governments gradually to increase their reliance on foreign capital, according to a study by American Express Bank. 'The share of population living in the cities will have doubled between 1985 and 2010. This creates a huge demand for infrastructure,' says Mr Tapan Datta, the economist who compiled the study. Though savings rates are likely to remain high in line with economic growth, the region is unlikely to generate enough resources domestically to finance this development. The need to import capital will weaken countries' current-account balance of payments, though the deficits should be manageable, the report says. Some countries may also re-spond by policy moves to damp consumption in an effort to pro-mote still higher savings rates. The need to finance infrastructure will also stimulate further liberalisation of financial markets so that savings can be deployed more efficiently, Mr Datta said. This would include the development of domestic bond markets. Singapore had the highest savings rate in the region last year at 48.3 per cent, the study adds. But China, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand all enjoyed rates of about 35 per cent or more. The savings rate is personal, corporate and government savings measured as a proportion of gross domestic product. The greatest need for foreign capital will face those countries such as Pakistan and the Philippines where savings rates, at 13.5 and 14.6 per cent respectively, and living standards are low. Such countries may need to maintain high real interest rates that curb economic growth. Outside Japan, the Asian demographic cycle will continue to support high savings rates as population growth slows and the proportion of people dependent on savings declines. The bank says that Japan's high savings rate, of 32.8 per cent last year, in part reflects the recent fall in land prices. The savings rate slowed when land prices rose sharply in the late 1980s and may be expected to do so again when land prices stop falling. Saving rates may fall in Japan as the proportion of retired people in the population increases, though the effect is likely to remain small until the turn of the century. After that, the number of retired people in the population will rise sharply.</p>

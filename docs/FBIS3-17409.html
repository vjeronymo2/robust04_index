			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- Russian Minister of  Economics Aleksandr Shokhin said that "the redistribution of  duties within the cabinet will take place soon."    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said  that  on March 23 President Boris Yeltsin appointed him vice-prime  minister. The appointment fills up the vacancy that existed in  the government since January 10. There is one first vice-prime  minister and four vice-prime ministers in the Russian Government  now.    Shokhin expressed the supposition that he may be put in  charge of economy, finances and cooperation with CIS states and  international organisations. He added, however, that the exact  range of issues to be handled by him will be determined at a  meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next  few days.    Speaking about the draft budget for 1994, Shokhin said that  the major problem is the "low collectibility of federal taxes."  He said the government plans to carry out a programme of  measures to rescind previously adopted laws. He did not  specify. He stressed that "between the government and the  parliament normal conditions have been created for a civilised  discussion of the draft budget."    The newly appointed vice-prime minister said that the  recently imposed import tariffs is a "rather advanced variant  which had been discussed in the government for six months." It  is seeking to reconcile the positions of domestic producers and  consumers. The inflow of goods from abroad has led to the drop  in demand for domestic products and closure of enterprises.  Shokhin did not rule out the possibility of establishing, in  the future, certain privileges for potential western investors  seeking to invest in the Russian economy, rather than sell  finished products.    Asked about the problem of non-payments between enterprises,  Shokhin noted that he sees the solution in "tightening payment  discipline between economic entities and introducing a  simplified mechanism for solving disputes."</p>

The installation of the ROTHR in Puerto Rico is proposed as an addition to the national and local counter-narcotic strategy by focusing detection and enforcement efforts at their sources. It will complement ROTHR systems in Virginia and Texas and other surveillance installations to provide virtually complete coverage of the Caribbean Basin and the northern portion of South America. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ROTHR system has three components; Transmitter, Receiver, and an Operation Control Center. The proposed action would locate a Transmitter on Vieques Island and a Receiver in southwestern Puerto Rico. The Operation Control Center functions will be performed at a currently existing facility in Norfolk, Virginia. The Transmitter will require approximately 100 acres of land, and will consist of 34 metal, vertical antenna towers and 34 wooden, vertical poles, supporting a curtain of antenna wires. Towers would range in height from 71 feet to 125 feet. The Receiver will require approximately 200 acres of land, and will consist of 372 pairs of aluminum, monopole antennas, each about 17 feet high and extending approximately 8,600 linear feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives for both the Transmitter and Receiver sites, including the no action alternative, will be addressed in the EIS. Three Transmitter site alternatives are located on Navy property on Vieques Island, two in the Camp Garcia area and one north of Playa Grande. No preferred alternative for the Transmitter site has been identified. A preferred alternative for the Receiver site is located on private property in the Valle de Lajas, northwest of the Ensenada Community, Guanica and southeast of the town of Lajas. The Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corporation (PRIDCO) would obtain individual leases from property owners and assemble these as one lease to the Navy. Alternative Receiver sites, another in the Valle de Lajas and a site east of the city of Salinas, have also been identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major environmental issues identified to be addressed in the EIS include wetlands, threatened and endangered species, floodplains, historic and pre-historic cultural resources, soil erosion, aesthetics, and electromagnetic effects. The Draft EIS is planned to be available to the public in early 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of the Navy will hold two public scoping meetings to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to identify significant issues related to the proposed action. Scoping meetings will be held as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;June 9, 1994 from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. at the Community Center (main street next to public library), La Parguera, PR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;June 11, 1994 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Municipal Assembly Hall, Vieques, PR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following a brief overview of the proposed action (presented in both English and Spanish at each scoping meeting), comments will be heard. Each attendee will be requested to indicate, when registering, whether he/she intends to deliver oral comments at the meeting. Comments may be made in either English or Spanish and will be translated sequentially in summary form. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to five minutes. All interested federal, Commonwealth, and local agencies, and interested persons are invited and encouraged to attend one or both of these meetings to submit comments in writing as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Commander, Atlantic Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Norfolk, Virginia 23511&hyph;6287, Attn: Ms. Linda Blount (Code 2032LB), telephone (804) 445&hyph;2304. Questions may also be directed to Mr. Jose Negron, (809) 865&hyph;4429, or CDR Lou Marchett, (809 865&hyph;4152, at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, or to LCDR Michael McCloskey at Commander, Forces Air Caribbean (809) 723&hyph;9844. All comments must be received no later than June 30, 1994, to ensure consideration in preparation of the EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lewis T.

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Early end to financial rand unlikely: S Africa's finance minister talks to Tony Hawkins and Mark Suzman In the clearest signal of exchange control policy since the inception of South Africa's government of national unity, the country's finance minister has said that the financial rand, the country's investment currency, is not likely to be abolished 'for some time'. There has been widespread speculation that the financial rand might be discontinued later this year. This would be a significant step towards the abolition of exchange controls; their existence is cited by potential foreign investors as one of their main concerns. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Derek Keys, reappointed as finance minister last month by President Nelson Mandela, acknowledged the pressure for change: 'I don't want to defend the existing situation. I think it's awful.' But, at the same time, he set out three preconditions which seem to rule out the move during 1994. Interviewed shortly after last week's budget, Mr Keys said it would need a clear international and domestic vote of confidence in the new government of national unity, an understanding with the trade unions on the need for wage restraint and higher foreign exchange reserves, which at present amount to around about six weeks' import cover. Mr Keys was confident about South Africa's economic prospects, forecasting 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year and inflation at no more than 7.5 per cent. Responding to questions about the financial rand, however, Mr Keys was remarkably frank. 'If you had told me when I took the job of minister of finance that two and a quarter years later I would be sitting with exactly the same policy on foreign exchange that I inherited, I would have been disgusted. I have not just not made progress. I have actually regressed.' An ideal scenario would be that the reserves build up at the same rate as the speculation increases about the end of the Finrand, leading to a point at which both of them have developed sufficient momentum that one can do something for which the markets have really prepared themselves. But if it doesn't happen and we have speculation increasing while the reserves don't go up, then this could possibly create a minor crisis. 'But even that could be better than what we've got. We've had this system now for a very long time. People are absolutely fed up with it.' One of the most critical factors was confidence in South Africa, said Mr Keys: 'But we don't have an outstanding vote of confidence at present. Not just as far as the outside world is concerned - but as far as South Africans themselves are concerned, building up their assets in this country and feeling secure about it. Then in my opinion, the (level of) reserves wouldn't be critical, because you take the chance that the act of doing away with it was itself a confidence-creating act, and you get great benefit from that. But I just haven't received that message yet.' Mr Keys ruled out negotiating an International Monetary Fund loan in advance of abolishing the financial rand, and which could be held ready to boost reserves if necessary. 'No IMF loan is going to save you if you get confidence reading wrong,' said the minister. Some understanding on wage restraint would also be necessary, he said. 'I think a compact as such is not on the cards, but I think a tacit never-expressed understanding is possible.' Mr Keys accepted that several other African countries had been able to liberalise exchange controls. South Africa's circumstances, he argued, were very different. For about 50 years, said the minister, South African residents had been unable to diversify their assets. 'You have wealthy residents here in command of large pools of savings. You have institutions whose entire management cadre has longed for this opportunity to diversify worldwide. 'So for reasons totally other than those of panic or usual capital flight, you have a large pool of capital that longs to enter the world. 'Now that's fine. All sorts of good results would flow from that, including that we would then have plenty of shares available for the investors who wanted to come in, because they complain because they can't get decent amounts of SA shares.' But there was a 'bridging problem,' said the minister: 'A lot will go before a lot come in. And my advisers tell me that in that first phase interest rates here could go to 30 per cent. I wouldn't like to see this government facing the consequences of interest rates going to 30 per cent. I have a duty to prevent that.' Mr Keys continued: 'This is a government of national unity, operating on a basis of consensus. We've marked out enough consensus areas. To try and include taking a fundamentally new approach to the foreign exchange situation is not impossible, but its going to take some time.'</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Freedom of the Press Violations Criticized    2. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi Banned From Preaching    3. Islamist Detainees Go on Hunger Strike    4. Clinton's Double Standards Policy Criticized    5. Religious Scholar Warns Against Cultural Invasion    6. Union Criticizes Clinton's Jerusalem Remarks  <H5>  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS VIOLATIONS CRITICIZED </H5>   Under a banner headline, the paper features a front-page  400-word statement by the Labor Party's Political Bureau in  which it decries the action of the state prosecution organs in  summoning the officials and writers of the newspaper AL-SHA'B  for questioning concerning "unfounded accusations" about what  the paper published in connection with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. The statement says that the "State Security  Investigations Department is considered a police organ  responsible for maintaining security and order, and cannot  assume the role of a press censor."    In a related unattributed 150-word report on this issue's  front page, AL-SHA'B says that the "Egyptian Human Rights  Organization has called on the authorities to stop the ongoing  investigations by the Supreme State Security Office against  officials of the Labor Party and AL-SHA'B newspaper regarding  articles the paper has published in protest against the Israeli  massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque."    A 2,500-word editorial by Majdi Ahmad Husayn on pages 1 and  2  highlights the authorities' disregard for the freedom of the  press and defends AL-SHA'B's reports and coverage of the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its stories of corruption.    On pages 1 and 7, the paper publishes a 300-word report that  Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of the Labor Party, has  been summoned for questioning regarding an article he wrote in  the 8 March issue of AL-SHA'B under the headline: "This Popular  Awakening Must Continue in Order To Correct Our Internal  Conditions." The report says that Murad is accused of inciting  hatred of the regime, preventing the state authorities from  exercising their powers, and supporting the ideas of the  fundamentalist groups.  <H5>  SHAYKH 'ABD-AL-KAFI BANNED FROM PREACHING </H5>   A 150-word front-page report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im notes  that "the security services have banned Shaykh Dr. 'Umar  'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching in his Asad Ibn-al-Furat Mosque in  al-Duqqi and from giving religious lessons. The mosque has been  placed under the control of the Awqaf Ministry."  <H5>  ISLAMIST DETAINEES GO ON HUNGER STRIKE </H5>   A brief 30-word report on page 1 says that "the imprisoned  Islamist detainees have declared a hunger strike in protest  against ill-treatment, denial of visitation rights, confiscation  of blankets and clothing, and the torture of some detainees on a  regular basis in the Abu-Za'bal Prison. The strike began a few  days ago in the al-'Aqrab, Abu-Za'bal, and Turah prisons."  <H5>  CLINTON'S DOUBLE STANDARDS POLICY CRITICIZED </H5>   In an 1,800-word article on page 5, Mustafa Mashhur, a  Muslim  Brotherhood leader, strongly criticizes U.S. President Bill  Clinton for his remarks on Jerusalem and his Middle East policy,  assertomg Clinton has double standards favoring Israel. He  calls on the Muslims and the Muslim rulers to close ranks and  face these challenges.  <H5>  RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR WARNS AGAINST CULTURAL INVASION </H5>   In a 300-word article on page 12, religious scholar Muhammad  al-Ghazali warns against the West's cultural invasion, which he  says has created bands of apostates who are destroying the  religious heritage. He says that these "apostate bands are  deliberately mixing freedom of thought and freedom of  disbelief." He concludes: "We must confront these apostate  bands with the necessary contempt and hostility, and unveil the  parties for which they work so that the people can beware of  them."  <H5>  UNION CRITICIZES CLINTON'S JERUSALEM REMARKS </H5>   On page 12, Al-SHA'B publishes a 350-word statement by the  Union of Scientific Professions about the U.S. President's  statement on Jerusalem. The statement says that "contrary to  all diplomatic norms and international laws and treaties, and  under pressure from the Zionist lobby, U.S. President Bill  Clinton made a press statement in which he in effect recognized  Islamic Jerusalem as the eternal capital of world Zionism, which  has usurped Palestine." The statement adds that the union sees  in this "irresponsible statement a clear threat to the Muslims  and the Arabs and a declaration of war against our nation by the  U.S. President."</p>

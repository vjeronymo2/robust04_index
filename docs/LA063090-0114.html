			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 SOUTHLAND S&amp;LS ON PRIORITY LIST FOR FBI INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> Federal thrift regulators and the FBI have given top priority to investigations  of seven failed Orange County and Los Angeles savings and loans as part of the  Bush Administration's new coordinated effort to push for criminal prosecutions  in thrift fraud cases.  </P> <P> A surprise among the seven targeted S&amp;Ls is Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in  Huntington Beach, where there was no previous hint of a criminal probe.  Regulators seized the insolvent S&amp;L on Feb. 23, ousting its officers and  chairman, long-time industry leader Leonard Shane.  </P> <P> Lawrence G. Lawler, special agent in charge of the FBI district in Los Angeles,  said Mercury and the other S&amp;Ls have been singled out for special scrutiny  by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the nation's S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> He said that, while the OTS does not set his priorities, his office had already  determined that its biggest thrift fraud cases involved the same seven  institutions, including one of the nation's most notorious collapses, that of  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> Lawler identified the other top priorities as First Network Savings Bank,  Westwood Savings &amp; Loan and Brookside Savings &amp; Loan, all in Los  Angeles, and two defunct thrifts, American Diversified Savings Bank in Costa  Mesa and Consolidated Savings Bank in Irvine. All but Brookside and Westwood  have been reported previously as under investigation.  </P> <P> "Those cases are the reason we can't get to the other investigations," Lawler  said about a backlog of 286 requests to probe financial institution fraud.  </P> <P> The seven institutions are among 29 failed thrifts and six failed banks that  Lawler's office is investigating currently.  </P> <P> Lawler said the OTS information was given to him last week when he was in  Washington for a news conference at which President Bush outlined his  stepped-up strategy to put "the cheats and the chiselers and the charlatans" of  the savings and loan industry behind bars.  </P> <P> The OTS would not identify its priority cases. But T. Timothy Ryan Jr.,  director of OTS, said he has turned over to the Justice Department a list of  100 thrifts that regulators want the FBI to view as priority investigations.  Regulators consider 20 of those cases to be top priority, he said. The seven  local thrifts are among them.  </P> <P> Ryan is heading the Administration's effort to focus Justice on major cases and  to raise the public's awareness of the thrift fraud problem. Bush created a new  Justice Department post to handle financial institution fraud and asked  Congress to authorize $25 million more for extra federal agents to investigate  and prosecute financial fraud.  </P> <P> Lawler, whose FBI district covers seven counties stretching from Orange County  to San Luis Obispo County, declined to provide details of the investigations of  the thrifts.  </P> <P> The FBI usually discloses only that bank fraud and embezzlement investigations  are pending at specific institutions. In some cases, the agency will not even  acknowledge that an investigation is being conducted. Earlier this week, for  instance, it still refused to confirm that it was probing Lincoln Savings.  </P> <P> The addition of Mercury to the top-priority list surprised industry observers,  including William D. Davis, the commissioner of the state Department of Savings  and Loan. Davis said he had no inkling of any possible criminal wrongdoing at  the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Shane, Mercury's former chairman, has been one of the industry's most  persuasive and compelling spokesmen and a campaigner for the traditional thrift  role of home lending. Through much of the last decade, he has been both adviser  to and supporter of regulators, though the relationship has soured in the last  two years. And he has been vocal in his call to rid the industry of crooks and  others who recklessly invested insured deposits in risky ventures.  </P> <P> Shane said Friday that he was not aware of an investigation of Mercury and had  no idea what it was about. "I can't imagine why, unless it was our complaints  they're investigating," he said. He would not elaborate on the complaints, but  they are believed to involve several former executives in a loan-kickback  scheme.  </P> <P> Mercury has been touched by scandal twice before. The thrift lost $17 million  in the early and mid-1980s when a former executive and a contractor engaged in  a loan-kickback scheme in Northern California and when a Southern California  builder used fraudulent documentation to obtain loans. The losses were written  off in 1986.  </P> <P> Accounting errors and two defaulted hotel loans eventually sank the thrift in  red ink. It lost $53.6 million in 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> The takeover of Lincoln in April, 1989, and its aftermath, including a House  Banking Committee hearing into the collapse, has been well documented. More  than two dozen major civil lawsuits have been filed against the former  operators and others, and regulators have filed a racketeering suit against  them.  </P> <P> American Diversified and Consolidated, both seized in 1986, were involved in a  number of deals together, including the sale of vacant Carson land that was  once a hazardous waste site. Consolidated was closed a few months after it was  seized. Regulators closed American Diversified in June, 1987, refunding a  record $1.14 billion to depositors.  </P> <P> First Network, seized April 20, was headed by Carl M. Rheuban, an amateur  magician, philanthropist and developer who had close ties to Democratic  politicians. Rheuban was a major contributor to political campaigns, including  those of Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.).  </P> <P> Westwood and Brookside were seized last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Bates contributed to this report.  </P></p>

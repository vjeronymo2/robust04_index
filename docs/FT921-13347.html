			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Record result for Principality BS THE Principality Building Society achieved record results last year despite the downturn in the economy and the malaise in the housing market. The society reported pre-tax profits up 4.6 per cent to Pounds 15.1m. Total assets topped Pounds 1bn for the first time, reaching Pounds 1.03bn by the year end. Mortgage lending at Pounds 175.1m was only Pounds 5.1m below the peak achieved in 1990, said Mr John Mitchell, chairman. The society was helped by a good result from Peter Alan, its wholly-owned estate agency, which lifted sales by 13 per cent.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts predict better results than expected - S G Warburg Investment bank S. G. Warburg on Tuesday will announce earnings for the six months ended September 30. Securities analysts are offering no prizes for guessing the results. Last month Warburg put out a profits warning, saying it expected to report earnings of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m for the period, down sharply from the Pounds 148.8m in the same period in 1993. Analysts at BZW predict the actual number will be near the higher end of the forecast range. However, those at James Capel estimate that the actual profits may prove somewhat higher than the gloomy forecast would suggest. Even so, analysts said the investment banking division is unlikely to have provided shareholders with a return on capital of more than one per cent. Given that Warburg's 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, Mercury Asset Management, has said it expects earnings for the period to be somewhat above the Pounds 50.4m it reported last year, the statement suggests the invest-ment bank's profits were very modest. Mr Philip Gibbs, analyst at BZW, notes that the investment bank has several divisions such as custody and sales-aid leasing which alone could account for the difference between the MAM profits and the Warburg full group profits. 'You must have made a profit in some areas. A profit as low as that implies that a particular area must be in loss,' he said. Indeed, analysts said, Warburg's profits picture underscores the merits of maintaining a healthy asset management arm. This is particularly important for an integrated investment bank whose earnings are at the whim of volatile securities markets, they said.</p>

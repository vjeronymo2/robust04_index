			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND PIGSKIN GAME;  </P> <P> IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP FOR COLORADO, TENNESSEE  </P> <P> Colorado and Tennessee are about to embark on what they trust will be 13-game  seasons, and their coaches want the teams to remember this: The bowl game is  the one at the end.  </P> <P> The game they will play at Anaheim Stadium Aug. 26, the first Disneyland  Pigskin game, only has the look of a bowl game, matching two teams that  finished the 1989 season with 11-1 records and enter this season ranked among  the nation's best.  </P> <P> "We don't want to treat this like a bowl game because it's just the first game  of a long season," said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, who guided the Buffaloes  through an emotion-charged season last year during which quarterback Sal Aunese  died of complications from stomach cancer in September.  </P> <P> Colorado, dedicating its season to Aunese and making a memorial of his locker,  went undefeated last year until a 21-6 loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl  left them a step shy of a national championship.  </P> <P> Joe Garten, Colorado's consensus All-American offensive lineman from Valencia  High School and a contender for the Outland Trophy this season, said the team  has been ready to reassert itself since that loss.  </P> <P> "You bet," Garten said. "We wanted to start it right then."  </P> <P> They are back for another run, this time behind a coach whose job is secure for  the rest of his career. McCartney, who turns 50 this month, signed a 15-year  contract in July.  </P> <P> Once again, Colorado will make its run behind Darian Hagan, the junior whom  Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors calls the "most exciting quarterback I have seen  run the option in my entire coaching career."  </P> <P> Hagan ran for 1,004 yards last season and passed for 1,002 in the offense that  has come to be known as the I-bone, and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy  voting.  </P> <P> Colorado will be without running back Eric Bieniemy, who is suspended for the  game for disciplinary reasons.  </P> <P> Tennessee will begin this season against a team whose name is not much  different from last year's opening opponent, Colorado State.  </P> <P> The Volunteers struggled against a lesser opponent before winning, 17-14. They  cannot afford to start slowly this year.  </P> <P> "This is a big game," Tennessee quarterback Andy Kelly said. "Colorado is a big  challenge this early in the season."  </P> <P> Tennessee's only loss last season was to Southeastern Conference rival Alabama,  47-30, and Majors focuses his attention on the SEC race.  </P> <P> "You'd swap this for a conference win," he said. "I'd swap anything for a  conference win."  </P> <P> Majors breathed a sigh of relief this summer when he learned running back Chuck  Webb had satisfied academic eligibility requirements.  </P> <P> "I think Chuck Webb has the talent to be as fine a running back as there is in  the country," Majors said.  </P> <P> Webb rushed for an average of 123.6 yards a game last season, despite not  becoming a starter until the sixth game.  </P> <P> Game organizers said 25,000 to 30,000 tickets have been sold for the game.  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Taiwan to stem inflow of equity funding A DECISION by Taiwan's central bank to restrict the flow of equity investment funds into the island has stunned foreign fund managers and sparked a dispute over financial policy within the government, Reuter reports from Taipei. The decision threatens to damage the confidence of foreign investors and hurt Taipei's efforts to internationalise its stock market, which opened to foreign institutions at the start of last year, industry analysts and officials say. 'If you want foreigners to invest in your market, the free flow of funds is a condition . . . Taiwan loses credibility because of this,' said the vice president of a foreign securities firm. 'Taiwan can no longer justify the use of such measures,' said one Finance Ministry official, adding that his ministry hoped to persuade the central bank to alter its policy. The central bank began earlier this month to delay its approvals of remittances of funds by foreign firms investing in the island's equity markets, according to Finance Ministry officials and foreign securities firms. The policy aims to curb pressure for appreciation of the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar by reducing the capital flowing into the island. The Taiwan dollar, buoyed by a trade surplus and domestic interest rates well above US rates, has risen to about 25 to the US dollar from 27 at the end of June last year, threatening the competitiveness of Taiwan's exports. The central bank yesterday continued to refuse to make an official policy statement. But the Commercial Times, a leading financial daily, quoted Mr Samuel Shieh, central bank governor, as saying inflows of foreign equity funds would be restricted indefinitely as the central bank monitored foreign exchange developments. News of the policy pushed share prices sharply lower yesterday. The market's weighted index fell 3.3 per cent to close at 4,859.48.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Casino raises the stakes - French food retailers have been fighting on price. Now they are finding that big is beautiful For the next few weeks, an army of bankers, brokers and lawyers will be installed at Casino, one of France's largest food retailing groups, to put the finishing touches to its acquisition of the Rallye chain of hypermarkets and supermarkets. For Casino, the addition of the Rallye stores offers a much needed opportunity to achieve the critical mass that its own hypermarkets and supermarkets need to survive in the increasingly competitive world of French food retailing. For the rest of the sector, the Casino deal will make life more competitive than ever. At first glance, the problems of French food retailers look much the same as those of their counterparts in other European economies. The French market is mature and for the past year or so the hypermarkets and supermarkets have been engaged in a ferocious price war. Meanwhile the concentration of ownership within European food manufacturing has eroded the retailers' bargaining power with their suppliers. The growth of groups such as France's BSN, the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and Nestle of Switzerland has put the retailers in a weaker negotiating position. But the French food retailers also face problems of their own. They are threatened by the rapid expansion of German discount outlets, notably Aldi and Norma, in France. Moreover, the French companies' margins, at an average of 1.5 per cent, are among the lowest in Europe. So far, the French food retailers have adopted a dual response to these issues. First, they have accelerated their expansion into other countries to compensate for lack of growth in their own. The large hypermarket chains, Carrefour and Promodes, have successfully diversified into southern Europe and rather less successfully into the US. Some smaller supermarket groups, such as Docks de France, have followed them into Spain. Meanwhile, the retailers are confronting increasingly powerful suppliers by expanding their own businesses to improve their bargaining position. The five largest players in French food retailing - Carrefour, Casino and Promodes, together with Leclerc and Intermarche, the associations of independents - increased their share of retail sales from 16 to 20.6 per cent in the five years to 1990 according to Insee, the state statistics institute. This expansion is continuing. Carrefour last year bought the Euromarche and Montlaur chains. As Michel Bon, its chairman, says: 'Volume is the key to success in our business'. Casino, which was in danger of being squeezed out of the market with turnover of just FFr42bn (Pounds 4.26bn) compared with Carrefour's FFr100bn, is following suit with the Rallye deal. Thanks to Rallye, Casino will gain an extra FFr24bn of sales. These deals are creating problems for the rest of the retail sector. 'The level of sales needed for a company to remain competitive is increasing all the time,' said one analyst. After the Casino-Rallye deal, there will be three French hypermarket chains with annual sales over FFr65bn - Carrefour, Promodes and Casino. Christiane Thorne, European retailing analyst at Phillips &amp; Drew in London, argues that that this will intensify the pressure on the other large players, Auchan and Cora. But size alone is not enough. The French food retailers have yet to complete the reorganisation of their businesses so they can take advantage of their new bulk buying power. Carrefour is introducing a more centralised structure so that it can make the most of its size. Promodes is going one step further. It already has a fairly centralised buying operation in France and is now co-ordinating its activities across Europe. This spring, it opened a new international buying office in Switzerland to negotiate with its multinational suppliers. The bulk of Promodes' buying is still conducted on a national basis. Despite the internationalisation of food manufacturing, there are still huge differences in taste from country to country so there are relatively few truly international brands. But the Swiss operation does have the additional advantage of helping Promodes in the new markets, notably Germany, where its local competitors have been putting pressure on their suppliers to boycott the French insurgent. At the same time, the French food retailers are also trying to increase their historically low margins by increasing their own-label portfolios  - where margins are generally higher - and by investing in operational improvements such as laser scanning, which ought to be operative in all French hypermarkets by the end of next year. These initiatives will be hampered by the continuing expansion of the German discounters, which opened 60 new outlets in France last year alone, bringing the total to 144. Some French companies have retaliated by expanding their own cut-price chains, notably Carrefour with Ed l'Epicier. But the German discounters still pose a serious threat, particularly to the urban supermarkets under the Leclerc and Intermarche umbrellas. Casino, aided and abetted by its army of advisers, may have won one round in the fight for the French food market thanks to the Rallye deal, but the real battle has only just begun.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FRENCH RETAIL SALES BREAKDOWN BY OUTLET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Market share   Market share     %                            In 1985 (%)    In 1990 (%)   change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hypermarkets                  16.0          20.6         +28.8 Supermarkets                  12.0          14.5         +20.8 Department stores              2.3           2.0         -13.0 Variety stores                 2.3           1.7         -26.0 Mail order                     1.3           1.3           -- Chains of small shops          4.1           2.8         -31.7 Specialist retailers           6.1           8.4         +37.7 Small independent retailers   55.9          48.7         -12.9 Total retail sales           100.0         100.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: INSE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

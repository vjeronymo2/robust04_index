			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The magazine SEMANA disclosed today that Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff, acting on his own and without  consulting anyone, has been conducting negotiations for more  than a month with members of the Cali Cartel. According to the  publication, the document signed by De Greiff himself reportedly  gave a kind of safe-conduct pass to alleged Cali and Tulua drug  traffickers to keep them from being arrested in the future. The  names of these drug traffickers are well-known figure Pacho  Herrera, Jose Olmedo Campo, and a man named Renteria. According  to the magazine, the passes would clearly show Prosecutor De  Greiff has been in direct contact with the Cali Cartel  chieftains for more than a month, without previously consulting  the government or informing the security corps or the Attorney  General's Office. SEMANA said a top government source expressed  the government's surprise about the actions taken individually  and privately by the prosecutor, since late last year the  government and this office agreed to keep each other informed of  any developments.    According to SEMANA, the serious thing about the case is not  the fact that the prosecutor is acting like a loose cannon, but  that from the moment when the drug traffickers first went to his  office--that is on 14 January--it marked the beginning of the  preliminary investigations. In other words, this marked the  beginning of the search for evidence that must be provided by  the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], the Dijin  [Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] in Colombia,  and Interpol. The odd thing is that the Prosecutor General's  Office did not officially inform any of these organizations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New and energetic steps toward a market economy will  be made this year in Ukraine. This is the essence of several  measures adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. They are directed  at fulfilling the state program for demonopolizing the economy  and developing overall competence which was already drafted by  the legislature. The legal basis of the aforementioned  processes will be upgraded by adopting new normative acts. Each  branch and region will receive a complex program of market  changes. Other measures address the issues of providing the  information, personnel, and other facilities necessary for the  implementation of this program.</p>

The statement followed reports that President Alfredo Cristiani had sent a long and confusing letter to Mr Boutros Ghali, giving qualified approval to the UN peace plan. The UN chief said the president had given a commitment that the government will continue to implement its obligations under the UN agreements, subject to continuing consultations on one unspecified point, and that it will do nothing which could obstruct the objective of ending the armed conflict as quickly as possible.

Mr Cristiani is under intense pressure from extreme-right elements in his country to reject the UN peace plan. Salvadorean left-wing rebels announced yesterday they would demobilise on Saturday another 1,700 fighters, as a show of support for the UN plan to advance the peace process. About 3,400 rebels, or 40 percent of them, would remain armed past the weekend.</p>

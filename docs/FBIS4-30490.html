			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kyoto University Professor Takamitsu Sawa: </F> "Liberalism Is the Main Direction of the World"]    [Text] [Boxed item: "Deregulation." In its  interim report of 8 November 1993, former Prime Minister  Hosokawa's private advisory organ, the Economic Reform Research  Council, headed by Keidanren President Gaishi Hiraiwa stressed  in principle deregulation of economic controls and proposed  measures such as simplification of standards certifications and  inspections that pose barriers for entry into Japan's markets,  promotion of competition in the financial sector, and relaxation  of controls on land and housing. In its final report of 16  December, the council stressed the "reform of the former  export-oriented economic structure into a  domestic-demand-oriented economic structure by relaxing  regulations, restructuring businesses, investing in housing and  social capital, and shrinking differentials between domestic and  international prices."]    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that your recent book,  Political-Economic Academics of the Heisei Recession,  predicts that the 1990's will become the age of liberalism.    [Sawa] In his book The Cycles of American History,  published in 1986, U.S. historian Arthur Schlesinger predicted  that the 1990's would become the age of liberalism providing for  tolerance for the socially weak. In the 1992 presidential  elections, liberal Clinton won and Schlesinger's prediction  proved to be accurate. I believe liberalism is currently a  worldwide trend. The worldwide recession has caused people to  reaffirm the role of government. Moreover, since socialism has  collapsed, even if one advocates a managed form of capitalism,  he need not be concerned about being called a socialist  sympathizer. Even in Japan, the collapse of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] government will force an option between  conservative and liberal approaches.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Individuals who professed "liberalism" have  withdrawn from the coalition government.    [Sawa] We can recognize the Hosokawa government for its  accomplishments in the area of political reform. However, the  government that was united on the basis of political and  anti-LDP principles failed miserably in the area of economic  reform. A split developed between conservatives of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, who attempted to push a  national welfare tax, and liberals of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger, who opposed the  law. It was only logical that the liberals followed with a  withdrawal from the coalition. The Hata government led by  Shinseito will probably embark on the new conservative reforms  advocated in Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's book,  Blueprint for Building a New Japan.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of principle are we speaking of in  the area of economic policy when we refer to new conservative  principles?    [Sawa] New conservatism is based on the idea that government  intervention in the marketplace is inimical. It also holds that  public services should benefit only those who are not  economically fortunate and it cannot accept the principle that  only those who are wealthy must shoulder those costs. As an  example, in the area of tax systems, conservatives think that  income taxes which are incrementally higher for higher income  levels should be abolished. Thus, conservatives try to  simultaneously reduce income taxes while hiking indirect taxes.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are your thoughts on liberal economic  policies?    [Sawa] Liberals think that markets are imperfect and that  markets alone cannot correct imbalances such as unemployment;  they emphasize government roles, such as creation of employment  opportunities and income redistribution. They stress basic  welfare policies that call for high welfare spending as well as  high welfare costs. However, in the area of taxes, they respect  progressive income taxes as a way of correcting inequities in  income distribution and oppose income tax cuts that give  preferential treatment to the wealthy and simultaneous hikes in  indirect taxes. However, liberals once failed in the creation of  "big government" and will probably aim for a "wise government"  on the basis of lessons learned from the difficult experiences  of the past.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do conservative and liberal approaches to  deregulation differ?    [Sawa] Conservatives think that highest priority should be  given to deregulation to create a free and transparent market.  On the other hand, liberals assert that unfair controls that  shackle competition should be abolished, but that normally,  deregulation should be implemented in good economic times and  that deregulation in recession can worsen unemployment.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of industrial policies do you  envision from the liberals?    [Sawa] Liberals, who place more importance on employment  issues than do conservatives, will probably seek government  participation in the development and reinforcement of high-tech  industries and establishment of infrastructure for an  internationally competitive industry dealing in services,  information, and software. They will also promote  decentralization of government as being effective in stimulating  domestic demand and creating employment.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas can you think of in terms  of new economic international contributions from the standpoint  of a liberal?    [Sawa] International contributions in the area of global  environmental preservation would be desirable. As an example,  collection of environment taxes at a low rate based on carbon  dioxide emissions could provide tax revenue to be used in energy  conservation investments, subsidies for purchase of insulation  for privately owned homes, and government assistance to  developing nations in the form of ODA [official development  assistance] in the area of environment. Such simultaneous  collection of taxes and offsetting spending programs should  minimize fears of obstructing economic growth.</p>

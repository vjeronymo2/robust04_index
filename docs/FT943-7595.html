			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Copenhagen Unidanmark reports interim results tomorrow. Hoare Govett says that valuation adjustments on the bond portfolio will distort the underlying picture, but the broker is more optimistic about underlying trends and hopes that a satisfactory figure could encourage switching out of Den Danske Bank, which produced disappointing interims last week.</p>

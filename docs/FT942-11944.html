			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up VENEZUELA It was a volatile week in the country's capital markets after the resignation of Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, the governor of the central bank, following disagreements over monetary policy. The appointment of a new governor, Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, does not necessarily provide an end to the difficulties, according to some analysts. Mr Victor Galliano of Latinvest in London commented that the key issue was whether the new governor would exercise independence. However, Mr Galliano added that the finance ministry had indicated that it was not willing to reduce interest rates until inflation was down - inflation currently stands at about 50 per cent annualised - a factor which lay behind Mrs de Frivoy's resignation. TURKEY Istanbul's composite index closed the week 18 per cent down as the market was buffeted once again by negative news. Standard and Poor's cut its rating on the country's long-term currency debt to B-plus from BB. S &amp; P said that the downgrade and an ongoing review for a further potential downgrade reflected growing external liquidity and balance-of-payments pressures. Attention has now turned to the IMF which is meeting economic officials in Ankara this week for talks on a standby agreement. SRI LANKA Equities in Colombo recorded their sharpest ever one day fall last Friday on worries over political and economic uncertainty. The all share index shed 4.3 per cent. Investors have been unnerved by the victory of opposition parties in local government elections at the end of March. Share prices have been falling after the market gained some 40 per cent in the first two months. According to IFC data, Sri Lanka remains 14 per cent up in dollar terms since the beginning of the year. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

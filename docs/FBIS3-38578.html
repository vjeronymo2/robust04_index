"Close air support has the full support of Mr. Stoltenberg  and myself," Lord Owen told reporters after he and Stoltenberg,  who have tried unsuccessfully to broker a peace agreement  between Bosnia's warring factions, met here with Romanian  Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu.    He added however, "We would be much happier if we can  achieve  the UN mandate without that."    Lord Owen, who represents the European Community, said:  "What has been agreed by the UN Security Council is that there  should be a close air support" and "that UN forces, when charged  with a UN mandate, have the right to protection for themselves  and for carrying out the mandate of the Security Council."    He said: "These are air strikes that we'll take primarily in  a defensive position."    Stoltenberg, who represents the United Nations, arrived here  with Lord Owen late Wednesday as part of a tour of several  countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

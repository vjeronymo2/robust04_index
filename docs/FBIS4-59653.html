			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- An official security source  at the Interior Ministry today announced that the security  forces raided 11 hideouts at the same time in the Governorates  of Cairo, al-Jizah, Ismailia, al-Daqahliyah, and al-Qalyubiyah  arresting the associates of terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the  leader of the terrorist groups. They represent the command  group, which includes the base of the organization's military  wing in the central region, and the officials in charge of  surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation.    In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various  types were seized. One of those cars was used in the  assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram  on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu  Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at  them on the Cairo-Ismailia agricultural road.    When residences of members of the command and implementation  groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and  incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and  information about officials on the assassination list and some  cash.    The source said the operation was part of activity by the  State Security Intelligence following the death of Tal'at Yasin  Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. Security operations  were developed using information and seized organizational  papers about all recent terrorist activities.    The source said that in light of information gathered from  close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts  inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to  define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of  certain internal organizations trying to support those  terrorists and push them to implement their various operations.    Acting on this information, the source explained, the State  Security Intelligence, assisted by the various investigative  agencies, continued to implement its security plan to arrest the  remaining terrorist groups that by their acts are trying to  prove they still exist in the country.    The source said that the operation was also based on the  intensive investigations and accurate monitoring carried out by  the State Security Intelligence after receiving permission from  the chief public attorney and in coordination with antiterrorism  forces and the various criminal investigation agencies.    The official security source said that, still backed by the  permission of the High State Security Prosecution Office, the  security forces extended the arrest operations to include those  responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the  leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside.  It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by  two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret  organizational activities. One of these is lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and  accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in  the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized  organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of  financing the organization from funds he received from the  leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam.    The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to  45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000.    The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of  the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in  the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for  his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same  year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens  in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was  also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was  arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought  and inciting violence.    The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a  warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of  1994, concerning the military wing of the terrorist groups  organization, which is currently being examined.    The security source said that the defendants told State  Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to  the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of  communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a  task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the  orders of Hammam.    The source said that the defendants' confessions also show  that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group.  Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani  received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and  $3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's  terrorist activities.    Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at  his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as  they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There  security sources seized documents and other material. While the  security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in  Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced  difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was  instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for  treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and  kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April,  the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung  failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said.    The security source added that the State Security  Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had  already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security  organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military  wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain  areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates.    In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic  weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg  of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices.  The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the  military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The  officials in charge of communications and accommodations were  also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in  connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials,  trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants  have been referred to the competent prosecution offices.    The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed  to  involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander  Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel  Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of  the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement  in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in  al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry  source.    The security source noted that as a result of these  security operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of  the terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested  and approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In  addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three  pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol,  25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live  ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of  chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material  for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been  seized.    The source noted that the Higher State Security Prosecution  Office is questioning the arrested defendants. Prosecutors have  also inspected all the places and dens where the defendants were  arrested and have seized all items found there as part of the  investigations. The source pointed out that to maintain the  confidentiality of the investigations, the State Security  Intelligence has not announced the names of all the defendants  since more arrests are being conducted. The source noted that  investigations and surveillance operations are still underway to  arrest the remaining terrorists still at large, who include the  following important figures: Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan  al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal  'Abd-al-Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi  'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah, Islam Ahmad Muhammad  Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are other terrorist  elements whose activities are being monitored abroad.    The Interior Ministry appeals to citizens who have any  information on these terrorists to report it to the nearest  police station. It stresses that it is fully aware of all the  activities by some quarters that are supporting terrorism in one  way or another to serve their own interests. These quarters use  some of the incidents that may occur in the course of the  confrontation with terrorists as an opportunity to boost their  own image among the masses. The ministry emphasizes that it  will stand firmly and decisively against these quarters should  they try to act against law and order under this cover, which  only aims to create unrest among the masses.    The source added that the Interior Ministry is keeping a  close watch on the activities of the terrorist groups while  adhering to its firm stances that abide by the law. It  appreciates the people's support for its decisive confrontation  with the criminal and terrorist elements targeting the nation.  The ministry will announce within a few days the names of a  number of arrested terrorists who have repented and renounced  extremism and all forms of terrorist practices.    While emphasizing this strong position, the Interior  Ministry  calls on the people to adhere to the principles of religion and  denounce the terrorist acts that run contrary to the noble  Islamic faith and undermine the march of economic reform, which  seeks to serve the interests of the nation and its people.</p>

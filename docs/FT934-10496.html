			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Russian military doctrine finds favour with US THE US yesterday gave cautious approval to the new military doctrine outlined by Russia earlier this week. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told the Senate foreign relations committee he had little concern either about Russia's abandoning its pledge of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, or about provisions for the involvement of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations in neighbouring states of the former Soviet Union. 'In the new doctrine, Russia has said essentially that it will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states who are parties to the non-proliferation treaty. In fact, the nuclear doctrine announced in this statement is not very different from our own,' Mr Christopher said. 'Frankly, the US and its allies never took the old Soviet doctrine as a serious indication as to what the USSR might actually do with its massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.' Mr Christopher welcomed the new doctrine's statement that its basic objective was to complete the withdrawal of Russian troops to Russian territory, and said he had received assurances in Moscow last week that the government was 'committed to reaching a prompt agreement with both Latvia and Estonia on the withdrawal of Russian troops. He said US understanding of the new doctrine's reference to military operations outside Russia's borders contained the proviso that such operations would be conducted only in co-operation with the states involved. 'In short, Russia must be part of the solution and not part of the problem with respect to the regional conflicts. Nothing that we have seen in this new doctrine contradicts that crucial principle.'</p>

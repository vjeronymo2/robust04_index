			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Pain localised as NHS moves from central bargaining: Lisa Wood reports on the problems facing the unions' new breed of health service pay negotiators Mrs Rosalind Waugh, a hospital radiographer, is one of a new breed of local union pay negotiators in the National Health Service. It is a role she does not savour. She said: 'You are torn. On the one hand, you do not feel you have the time to do the negotiations properly. On the other, you feel guilty about being away from your patients.' Local union negotiators, such as Mrs Waugh, who works at South Tees NHS Trust in north-east England, are a minority. Only a handful of the 419 new NHS trusts - which include community and ambulance services as well as hospitals - conduct comprehensive pay bargaining at local level. However, the Department of Health signalled in its evidence to the independent pay review body which recommends the pay of nurses and midwives that it wants all the trusts to break away from national systems of pay determination. The department, backed by the Treasury, believes pay rates that are entirely nationally determined leave NHS employers unable to respond to local labour markets. It is an agenda for change that many of the NHS trusts will be hard-pressed to implement. Mr Ray Mailly, president of the Association of Health Care Human Resource Managers, said: 'The agenda for trusts is very complex. Local pay is one item on a list of about 30 priorities within trusts.' The association told the pay review body that it could take trusts another couple of years before they all had fully-fledged local pay arrangements. The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts has told the pay review body that it wants a two-tier system, with a nationally-based award - preferably less than inflation - coupled to a second award determined by local trusts. But it has been difficult for the trusts, grappling with the NHS internal market, to introduce local packages based on job evaluation and performance-related pay for workers. Mr Arthur Allen, for South Tees Trust, a hospital with 4,000 employees, said: 'It hasn't been plain sailing. After two years we have only recently got agreement with the unions.' Mr Mailly added: 'It takes a lot of work to develop the capacity for local pay bargaining. It is not just in terms of numbers of personnel dealing with the issues but also developing information systems and technical support.' In terms of outcome of local pay bargaining, unions such as Unison and the Royal College of Nursing, which are the main representative bodies for the UK's 600,000 nurses, say that their members have generally lost out. Mr Allen of South Tees said: 'It's a complex picture. Job evaluation, for example, has resulted in night nursing staff getting less than those on national conditions while those on day shifts get more.' Mrs Waugh, district secretary of the Society of Radiographers, said that in her X-ray department there were winners and losers. 'It's slightly better in terms of basic salaries for junior staff, but for senior grades there is a drop with, for example, a reduction in remuneration for working emergency duties.' She added: 'The management is rushing headlong into this. But they and the trade union representatives haven't got the expertise in negotiations. We've been pitched into this - but we are health workers not full-time negotiators.'</p>

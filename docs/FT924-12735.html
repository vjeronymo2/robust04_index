			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Research shows benefits of lower pesticide use TWO STUDIES just published look at the links between farming and the environment and highlight the growing importance to the agricultural industry of countryside management. The first is a Ministry of Agriculture publication on the findings of its pioneer study of pesticide use at its research centre at Boxworth in Cambridgeshire. One of its main messages to the farmer is that using less pesticide can improve gross margins in spite of lower yields. Tests were made over nine years on a total area of more than 120 hectares (296 acres). Using a comprehensive insurance policy of routine applications to eliminate any possibility of pests, weeds or disease led to wheat yields of 7.74 tonnes a hectare and a gross margin of Pounds 454 a hectare. But more considered use halved the number of applications in a year, leaving a yield of 6.84 tonnes a hectare and a gross margin of Pounds 477. What was considered low usage of chemical treatments during the Boxworth experiment between 1981 and 1990 now looks high - an indication of how much pesticide use has fallen over the last few years. The Agriculture Ministry and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have jointly funded a study by a team from Wye College in Kent into the economics of greener farming practices. The resulting pamphlet, published yesterday, is the first time that government initiatives such as the Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes have been thoroughly analysed. Mr Nicholas Woolley of the RICS said that taxpayers had a right to know if they were getting value for money, while farmers needed to know the benefits to them. In some ares, for example, ESA payments had increased farm income, but reduced the market value of the land. Pesticides, Cereal Farming and the Environment - The Boxworth Project. Ed.

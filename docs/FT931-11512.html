			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Business task forces to aid assault on red tape: More than 7,000 regulations to be reviewed SEVEN task forces of businessmen and women are to be called in to review more than 7,000 government regulations affecting the private sector, as ministers begin a new offensive against red tape. Its scope covers health and safety rules which brand Tipp-Ex corrector fluid, Brillo pads and Jif cleaner as dangerous substances; regulations which set such tough standards for outside play areas that many playgroups simply keep children indoors; and food safety laws which forced retailers to install freezers which failed to meet subsequent legislation, introduced by a different department, to reduce the environmental impact of refrigerants through CFCs. Rules already scrapped or listed for scrapping in the drive to cut red tape, which is being backed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, include regulations about the distances between clothes pegs in changing rooms and requirements for factory walls to be washed every 14 months. A Downing Street seminar of cabinet ministers agreed yesterday that small groups of private sector appointees should be set up to look at regulation in areas such as construction, engineering, chemicals and financial services. They will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, the government's deregulation adviser, and are intended to be able to call on trade associations and the largest companies in the relevant sectors to ensure that ministers obtain a proper picture of what business would like to see achieved in the review. The aim is to look again at the need for all the existing regulations, including European Community legislation, and the UK's rigorous approach to its implementation. Business organisations and small business owners last night welcomed the announcement of the government's initiative, but said a lot of hard work would be necessary for it to have any significant impact. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour spokesperson on the Citizen's Charter, attacked as 'misguided' the setting up of a further seven committees all headed by business people. 'Regulations on, for example, train safety and food hygiene are not matters for business to decide,' she said. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr Major will receive progress reports every two months, as part of the effort to ensure that the deregulation drive retains more momentum than its predecessors. In the Commons, Mr Major said ministers had agreed that 'in future, any proposal for new regulations will have specifically to spell out the cost for Britain's companies'. The current estimate of the cost to business of enforcing government regulations is Pounds 800m-Pounds 1bn a year. Small business welcomes cutting of red tape Page 10</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Southwestern Bell abandons cable TV link-up with Cox Southwestern Bell, the US regional telecommunications group, yesterday announced it was abandoning a plan to form a Dollars 4.9bn cable television partnership with Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned media group, because of increasing federal government regulation of the cable industry's finances. This is the second large link-up between a US cable company and a local telephone group to be abandoned this year. It reinforces the growing belief among analysts that tie-ups between the two industries are going to proceed much more slowly than envisaged last year when Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based phone group, and Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable company, appeared to set a trend by announcing plans for a Dollars 22bn merger. That deal was widely hailed as speeding up the availability of multimedia interactive communications services, but Bell Atlantic and TCI abandoned their merger plans in February. Like Southwestern Bell, they blamed the collapse on new rules for the cable industry announced that month by the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the communications industries. The FCC demanded that the cable industry cut its prices to consumers by 7 per cent. Mr Jim Kahan, a senior executive at Southwestern Bell, said yesterday that the company was convinced that the new regulatory environment, created by the 1992 Cable Reregulation Act and reflected in the FCC's new rules, 'significantly hinders the ability of the partnership as initially structured to meet its growth and financial objectives'. Southwestern Bell provides telecommunications services in Texas and some neighbouring states. Atlanta-based Cox is a Dollars 2.5bn turnover media group with interests ranging from newspapers to television broadcasting stations. Under the deal they announced last December, Southwestern planned to invest Dollars 1.6bn to take a 40 per cent stake in a private partnership which would own 21 of Cox's cable systems, with about 1.6m subscribers in 16 states. Cox and Southwestern were already partners in running cable systems in Britain and they emphasised yesterday that they would continue to 'aggressively pursue' this venture.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / US calls Mideast aid meeting THE US yesterday called a conference of potential donors to drum up aid in support of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, would convene a donors' conference to help co-ordinate aid for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 'Today, on behalf of President Clinton, I announce our intention to lead a wide-ranging effort not simply to give peace a chance but to ensure that it will not fail,' Mr Christopher said in a speech at New York's Columbia University. Administration officials said the purpose of the conference was not just economic, but to demonstrate backing for last week's agreement and to maintain momentum for the peace process. Mr Christopher said the US would itself contribute Dollars 250m in cash, loans and guarantees over the next two years. Senior administration officials said the conference was likely to be held in Washington in the next two weeks, taking advantage of the arrival in the US of finance and foreign ministers attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the United Nations General Assembly. They hoped the conference would produce several hundred million dollars of commitments to cover the next 18 months, making a successful start towards the World Bank's Dollars 300m a year estimate of investment needs over the next 10 years. Mr Christopher's speech yesterday, the first in a series of foreign policy statements planned ahead of President Clinton's address to the UN on Monday, declared the US's strong commitment to an active and assertive role in international affairs. 'We must remain engaged not out of altruism, nor out of what one scholar has called the 'imperial temptation', but because there are real American interests that will suffer if we are seduced by the isolationist myth,' Mr Christopher said. The International Monetary Fund has approved a three-year, Dollars 569m loan to help Egypt open up and reform its economy, Reuter reports from Washington. Although Egypt does not plan to draw down the loan, Cairo needed IMF approval of its economic reform programme to win over Dollars 3bn in debt forgiveness from the US and other creditor nations. Under a 1991 deal, creditor nations agreed to write off 50 per cent of Egypt's Dollars 25bn debt. Assad cool on deal with Israel; Arafat in Jordan, Page 4</p>

Vargas, 22, was abducted by  Afonso Dhlakama's movement in central Mozambique in 1988. He  said he left Renamo on 4 July 1993 and since then has been  living under the protection of friends and acquaintances in  Maputo.    Speaking in Maputo to the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, Raul  Domingos said Vargas is Mozambique Liberation Front spy and a  thief. He added: Vargas has stolen over $300,000. Raul  Domingos, who is head of Renamo's delegation to the Cease-Fire  Commission, said there could be other spies in the organization,  but he promised to thwart their activities.</p>

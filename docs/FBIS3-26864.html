In particular, 30 square km  piece of land in Yangpu, which is being developed by foreign  businessmen, is affirmed and seen by various sectors as the  "Yangpu Model."    According to official Hainan statistics, so far, 24  development zones in the province approved by the State Council  and the provincial government have been established throughout  the province, with the planned area totaling 294.84 square km;  18 approved provincial-level scenic spots have been established,  with a total planned area of 877.09 square km; and 95 projects  to develop stretches of land have been established by various  counties and cities of their own accord, with the planned area  reaching 488.21 square km. To develop the abovementioned plots  of land, a total of 17.417 billion yuan and $398 million was  invested and the construction of as many as 725 projects began.    At present, many large industrial projects, each with an  investment amount of hundreds of million yuan, have established  inside development zones, including a silicon chip plant, a  cotton-acrylic tire fabric [mian lun lian zi bu 4875 4858 1588  1311 1580] plant, and the Hainan Natural Chemical Fertilizer  Plant. The authorities concerned have pointed out: There is  full growth in the development zones in Hainan in general and  Haikou in particular, will become a modern city equipped with  all the necessary facilities. For example, over the past five  years, more than 3 billion yuan in development funds have been  invested in the financial trade development zone in Haikou, the  area under construction exceeded 2 million square meters, and  the construction of more than 110 high-storey and  super-high-storey buildings has been completed. On the other  hand, over the past several years, Jinpan Industrial Development  Zone, which is also located in Haikou, introduced a total of 109  industrial projects, 28 of which have begun operating, thus  creating over 1 billion yuan in output value.    The flourishing development of stretches of land in Hainan  is  closely related to its enjoyment of the preferential policies  granted by the central authorities and the provincial  government. Zones developing stretches of land as "experimental  zones" in the province's reform and opening up, have taken the  first step to make experiments. As far as the pattern of  development and administration is concerned, enterprises are  allowed to vigorously explore new patterns of development and  administration in line with the requirements of the market  economy.    At present, various development zones can choose from a  number of development and administrative patterns, which are  flexible and diversified, in light of their own conditions:  Government-entrusted enterprise contracting development, joint  development by government and enterprises, sole investment by  enterprises, joint development, solely-invested development by  foreign businessmen, unified management by government organs,  unified management by development companies, management by  organizations jointly formed by the government and enterprises,  and unified management by foreign businessmen.    Preferential policies lift restrictions on constructors of  development zones. Due to the reorganization of joint-stock  companies, which was first implemented in the development zones,  more than 4 billion yuan of capital stocks have been raised  within the companies and in society and invested in the  construction of over 20 development zones.</p>

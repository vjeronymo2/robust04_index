			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK ENDS SIGN DEBATE WITH COMPROMISE  </P> <P> With compromise being urged from almost every quarter, the City Council has  ended a months-long controversy by unanimously requiring the use of slightly  more English on business signs.  </P> <P> The new ordinance mandates that every business sign must include an explanation  in English of the name or the nature of the establishment. In some cases, city  officials could require both the name and type of business to be included in  English on signs. With these restrictions, foreign languages can still be used  on any sign.  </P> <P> The previous ordinance, enacted in 1986, allowed a business to post a sign in a  foreign language as long as it included an English-language description of the  firm's general activity, such as pharmacy, bakery or law office. If the firm  used several signs, at least one sign would have to state the nature of the  business in English.  </P> <P> Although some council members were talking last fall about requiring  three-quarters of any business sign to be in English, that idea never made it  through a lengthy review process by city officials, the council, the Design  Review Board and the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> In taking its vote Monday, the council considered recommendations from both the  design board and the commission. The new ordinance included suggestions made by  both agencies, which had concluded last fall that no stricter measures were  needed.  </P> <P> During the 2 1/2-hour discussion Monday, the consensus of council members and  those who addressed the council was embodied in a comment by resident Bob  McCloskey who said: "I'd like to see this issue put to rest, once and for all."  </P> <P> As council members discussed the English-language issue among themselves, a  compromise emerged with Councilman Christopher F. Houseman and Councilwomen  Betty Couch and Judy Chu making suggestions.  </P> <P> Houseman, Couch and Chu suggested using either the English language or simply  letters of the English alphabet on signs. To illustrate what would happen if  only the English language could be used, Houseman cited El Pollo Loco, the  fast-food chicken restaurant. Throughout the world, he said, the business is  known as El Pollo Loco, "but in Monterey Park it would be the Crazy Chicken."  </P> <P> Likewise, Chu said, why should the Uno Mas restaurant be forced to be  translated to One More. Under the proposal as eventually passed, such changes  are not necessary because the signs can use either English letters or the  English language.  </P> <P> Even Mayor Barry L. Hatch indicated he would vote for a compromise proposal,  but not before he forcefully argued that all signs should be in English.  </P> <P> "How are you going to satisfy everybody?" Hatch asked. "If you're going to have  Chinese (on signs), then you're going to have to have Korean and French and  German and Vietnamese and Cambodian and Spanish and everything else."  </P> <P> The only foreign language that need appear, he said, might be a small sign in a  window indicating that, say, Spanish or Chinese is spoken in an establishment.  To make his point, Hatch, who speaks Cantonese, which he learned as a Mormon  missionary, spoke in Chinese for a moment.  </P> <P> "You talk about racism," Hatch said. "We are alienating people by dividing them  with the language they don't understand."  </P> <P> In December, on a 3-2 vote, the council rejected Hatch's request for a study on  the possibility of holding a referendum on how much English should be required  on a sign.  </P> <P> The use of English, Hatch said, "is the one strand of fiber that holds us  together."  </P> <P> Although Chu said she did not entirely agree with the proposal that was passed,  she said she would support it because "I really do feel strongly that this  issue has to be brought to a close."  </P> <P> When the council's unanimous vote was displayed at 11:27 p.m. on a tally board  in the chamber, audience members applauded and Houseman shouted "Hallelujah!"  </P> <P> Before the vote, a dozen speakers addressed the council, voicing a range of  viewpoints. On occasion, tempers were short.  </P> <P> Resident Harry Kemmerer suggested that signs in a foreign language, such as  Chinese, contribute to Monterey Park's uniqueness and therefore make the city  attractive to tourists who can boost the economy. "I see the Asian equivalent  of Beverly Hills shopping centers here," said Kemmerer, who as a 23-year  resident has witnessed the ethnic transformation of the city. He added that he  "never heard of any tourists avoiding San Francisco's famous Chinatown because  they couldn't read the signs."  </P> <P> "There's enough English now on signs for health and safety reasons," he said.  "Let's stop harassing the Asian business people with unnecessary sign ordinance  changes that are designed only to soothe the offended sensibilities of some in  the Anglo community."  </P> <P> Hatch interrupted him, saying that Kemmerer was deviating. "I think you might  bring up some emotions we're trying to avoid here this evening," Hatch said.  </P> <P> Kemmerer concluded, saying: "Let's work toward a kinder, gentler, All-American  city that demonstrates how to live with and enjoy and benefit from our cultural  diversity."  </P> <P> One businessman, Francis Hong, told the council he opposed any further changes  that might cost him money to alter the sign for his food import business. When  the 1986 law went into effect, he said, it cost $2,600, which the city  provided, to upgrade his sign.  </P> <P> Under the changes approved Monday, the city will take until September to  determine what businesses are in compliance. Then the businesses will have an  additional 60 days after that to comply. City Planning Administrator M. Margo  Wheeler said she will study what, if any, funds may be available to assist  businesses to comply with the ordinance.  </P> <P> Momentum for changes in the sign code had been building since last spring, when  Hatch renewed his 1986 campaign pledge to address the issue. Couch last year  also advocated that the city follow the lead of other communities, such as  Arcadia, which requires three-quarters of a sign's lettering to be in English.  </P> <P> Discussions about what percentage of English should be on signs, resident Irv  Gilman told the council, "would start a war and I'm just sick and tired of  war." Besides, he said, "there are many, many bigger problems that face  Monterey Park."  </P> <P> But another resident, Edward Sanchez, complained that too many signs use a  language he doesn't understand. "I don't want to see a bunch of (Chinese)  characters. I want to see: 'Hardware Sold Here.' "  </P> <P> That sort of sentiment inspired the English-language requirement in 1986.  Guidelines to be used by the design review board, which reviews permits for  signs, were enacted the previous year.  </P> <P> The guidelines, stricter than the 1986 sign ordinance, carried less legal force  than the ordinance. Still, the board uses the guidelines to help make its  decisions.  </P> <P> Design board member Verne Heitman told the council, "Our main concerns are  communication and aesthetics." This also was one of Couch's motivations in  pushing for a change in the ordinance, she said. She cited the problems posed  by signs often using two languages.  </P> <P> Aesthetics were addressed in a number of other changes in the ordinance the  council enacted. Changes were made to deal with the placement, the color and  the size of signs.  </P></p>

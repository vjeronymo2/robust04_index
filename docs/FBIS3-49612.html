This result can be considered as disappointing for all the  former members of the Warsaw Treaty including Romania, said  Petre Roman. In the present context of the European security,  Romania considers itself entitled to a larger and more assuring  status with regard to its national security.    Petre Roman said the Partnership for Peace represented a  compromise between two recent tendencies in Europe: On one  side, the direct and strong request for NATO membership by the  former socialist countries as they do not feel safe because of  the revival of imperialist tendencies in Russia where the  democratic process is far from being a firmly established  reality and, on the other side, the very insistent, even tough  request of Russia that NATO extending should not take place.    In front of the revival of certain hegemonic tendencies, of  certain strategies of spheres of influence, Romania cannot feel  secure as long as it has not found its natural place in the  Western world which means its NATO membership, PD leader Petre  Roman said.    Petre Roman appreciated as very important the fact that the  United States had warned that if militarist and expansionist  tendencies continued in Russia, the NATO would proceed to its  enlargement toward the countries in the Central and Eastern  Europe, including Romania.</p>

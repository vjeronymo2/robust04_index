			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN ANTONIO'S MAYOR MAY RUN AGAIN, AFTER ALL  </P> <P> Pleased that voters have approved building a new, domed stadium, Mayor Henry G.  Cisneros said he may run for re-election, although he earlier said he would  leave politics because of personal problems.  </P> <P> Cisneros said Sunday he would decide whether to enter the May 2 election  contest after he talks with former Mayor Lila Cockrell, who already has  announced her candidacy.  </P> <P> Cockrell is considered the front-runner and has only one announced opponent,  insurance businessman Carl Mauthe.  </P> <P> Cisneros, a prominent Latino twice considered for the Democratic Party's vice  presidential nomination, said he will review his options during a trip to  Massachusetts this week.  </P> <P> Last October, Cisneros, who is married, acknowledged having a close personal  relationship with political fund-raiser Linda Medlar, who also is married. The  previous month, he said he would abandon politics in order to spend more time  with his young son, John Paul, who is in poor health.  </P> <P> Cisneros answered questions about his political plans as he met with reporters  after a sales tax referendum to build the $174-million Alamodome stadium was  passed Saturday.  </P></p>

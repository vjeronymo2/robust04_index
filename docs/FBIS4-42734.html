			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nordic countries have undertaken to assist the  Baltic countries in the establishment of their joint  peacekeeping battalion. The countries' defense ministers have  signed an agreement on the matter in Visby, Sweden. The Nordic  countries will support the project with both training and  material assistance. Timo Seppaenen reports from Visby:    [Seppaenen] The Baltic countries' joint peacekeeping  battalion will be set up to operate in duties defined by the  United Nations and the CSCE. The battalion will be formed by an  Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian infantry company as well as  the countries' joint logistics company and headquarters. The  Baltic countries' readiness to create a modern peacekeeping  force is very poor. For that reason, the countries need the  assistance of the Nordic countries in handling even the most  fundamental matters.    Under the agreement concluded today, the Nordic countries  will be supporting the establishment of the peacekeeping  battalion for three years. The first step in the project is  language training. As early as the beginning of September, the  Baltic peacekeepers are to be taught English-language military  terms. The main part of the assistance offered by the Nordic  countries consists of various forms of training. For instance,  Finland's contribution to the cooperation consists mainly of  that. The Baltic peacekeepers can receive training for instance  at the Military Academy or at Niinisalo [near Helsinki] where  military observer training is given.    The Nordic countries have also promised material aid to the  Baltic countries. For the time being, only a small part of it  will consist of weapons, but in time the Baltic peacekeepers are  also likely to receive weapons from the Nordic countries, says  Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn.    [Begin Rehn recording] When we are thinking of the  peacekeeping battalion to come some time in the future, it might  be quite natural that if they want, if the personal armaments  used by our UN peacekeepers [as heard], we might perhaps sell  them later.

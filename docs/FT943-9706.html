			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Athens tax gamble pays dividends: Improving signs in Greece's state finances Greece's economy minister, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, sent his economic advisers on holiday this week, reassured by figures from the finance ministry showing a substantial rise in tax revenues. For the first time in four years, inflows have started to match the budget projection. Revenues for May-July were up by 22 per cent, exactly on target, after increasing by only 11 per cent over the previous three months. The Greek propensity for making wildly optimistic revenue forecasts is one reason why confidence remains low in the government's ability to reduce its borrowing requirement, projected to reach 10.4 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Another is the reluctance of successive governments to tackle tax evasion, although the black economy is estimated at more than 30 per cent of gross domestic product. Burdened by a public debt amounting to 110 per cent of GDP, an inflation rate of 11.2 per cent and flat growth, Greece appears to have only a faint chance of achieving the Maastricht targets for European economic union. Yet Mr Papantoniou has brushed aside warnings from the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and, most recently, the International Monetary Fund, that a fiscal package was vital to prevent a revenue shortfall this year, projected at Dr400bn-Dr500bn (Pounds 1.09bn-Pounds 1.36bn). 'I knew it was a risk to insist there was no need for new measures, but that the existing system should be properly implemented,' he says. 'But it's starting to pay off.' The catalyst, he says, was a new tax law aimed at reducing VAT evasion by seizing goods and imposing stiff fines on traders whose paperwork is incomplete. At the same time, the finance ministry offered generous settlement terms for 7.5m pending tax disputes involving a total of Dr1,300bn in arrears, hoping to recover a total of Dr200bn this year. 'There's been a positive response because the settlement is automatic and doesn't mean going to court or negotiating with the tax authorities,' Mr Papantoniou adds. The sceptical view is that much of the revenue increase derives from taxpayers' willingness to make settlements, rather than from more efficient revenue collection. On the other hand, the rise in VAT receipts, up by 13 per cent since May, against 6 per cent in the first quarter, suggests that the finance ministry's surprise check-ups on businesses are having an effect. Mr Papantoniou maintains the budget shortfall can be contained at around Dr300bn this year. It would be covered by floating 25 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, on the Athens stock exchange in November. Opportunities for raising extra revenue are more plentiful now that the governing Socialists have reversed their opposition to privatisation, backing partial flotations of state enterprises. DEP, a profitable holding group for state-controlled oil refining and petrochemicals companies due to be floated in 1995, will hand over Dr50bn to the finance ministry this year as a cash advance. With the government hoping to raise Dr700bn from privatisations over the next three years, sales and long leases of state-owned assets, like resort hotels and marinas, are also back on the agenda. However, the Socialists' insistence that the state should retain management control of public sector companies chosen for flotation could deter investors. The IMF points out in its latest report on the Greek economy that partial privatisation 'would neither have significant benefits in terms of efficiency nor generate substantial revenues'. Analysts also complain that the government's preoccupation with raising cash obscures the problem of stimulating GDP growth, projected at an average 1.3 per cent over the next three years, against 2.2 per cent for the rest of the European Union. While EU transfers from the Delors II package for modernising infrastructure will start flowing this autumn, boosting the state investment budget by more than 6 per cent in 1994, the outlook for private investment is constrained by interest rates approaching 30 per cent. Private investment growth this year is forecast at 2.5-3 per cent, after a fall in 1993. A private sector research group, IOBE, predicts that investment in manufacturing will improve by 7 per cent this year, but notes that 'while business prospects have not deteriorated, investment activity in industry remains hesitant'.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: UTC cuts deficit to Dollars 333m in final period UNITED Technologies, which yesterday announced big job cuts at its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, also reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 333m but said the full-year operating performances of all its businesses had improved, with the exception of Pratt &amp; Whitney. The fourth-quarter loss, the result of Dollars 701m of pre-tax charges, worked through at Dollars 2.77 a share and compared with a loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a share, in the same period of 1991 when UTC took restructuring and environmental charges totalling Dollars 1.53bn. Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 5.755bn, against Dollars 5.808bn. For 1992 as a whole, UTC reported a net loss of Dollars 287m, or Dollars 2.67 a share, after charges and accounting changes, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars 8.91 a share, for 1991. Mr Robert Daniell, UTC's chairman, said Pratt &amp; Whitney's 1992 earnings before charges and accounting changes declined to Dollars 320m from Dollars 502m the previous year, and Dollars 596m of the Dollars 701m fourth-quarter charges applied to this business. In the fourth quarter, excluding charges and accounting changes, Pratt &amp; Whitney's operating income dropped to Dollars 28m from Dollars 138m, due to lower commercial jet engine spare part sales and reduced engine shipments. The flight systems business saw an increase in fourth-quarter operating profit from Dollars 63m to Dollars 129m, thanks in part to an improved operating performance at Sikorsky,the helicopter manufacturer. Building systems saw operating income rise from Dollars 63m to Dollars 99m, with air conditioning manufacturer Carrier enjoying a strong performance in North America and Otis, the elevator business, achieving increased service volume overseas. The automotive components business had operating income of Dollars 29m, against Dollars 23m.</p>

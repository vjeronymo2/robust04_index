			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Poland's struggle for stability: Martin Wolf discusses the growing political pressures on a government wrestling with resistance to radical economic reform 'To think that two and two are four And neither five nor three The heart of man has long been sore and long 'tis like to be.' Poland's search for economic stability is reaching the decisive stage. Those efforts have been made more difficult by external shocks. But they are threatened quite as much by internal pressures. The government is being called upon to pretend, principally for electoral reasons, that two and two makes, if not the five of A E Housman's poem, at least four and a half. Agreements were ratified last month on more than Dollars 1.6bn in new borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and a reduction of at least 50 per cent in Poland's official external debt. Both were granted in homage to the zeal of Leszek Balcerowicz, minister of finance and deputy prime minister in the two post-communist governments. But some hope, and others fear, that the pilot is now to be tossed overboard and the course subsequently changed. A planned meeting of economists convened by the advisory council to President Lech Walesa was widely expected to initiate that change. But this meeting was postponed until May 17, following discussion between the president and the prime minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. Both the idea of that meeting and its postponement reflect the battle now taking place. The collapse of Poland's communist regime in 1989 represented the downfall of an economic system that turned two and two into three. In the last stages of that collapse the government behaved as if they made five. Since Poland had long since ceased to be internationally creditworthy, the laws of economic arithmetic were imposed via accelerating inflation. The efforts of the two post-communist Polish governments to stabilise the economy involve the reimposition of the laws of arithmetic overtly, where inflation had imposed them covertly. Two and two must make four not only at the level of the economy as a whole, but also at that of individual enterprises. Under the planned economy the central authority was supposed to impose discipline upon enterprises. As authority collapsed, so did the discipline. Structural reform is designed to substitute the market's invisible hand for the planner's iron fist. Enterprises will not only be forced to balance their books, but at prices that reflect economic scarcities. It has become conventional wisdom that the movement to democracy is a necessary complement to such radical reforms. One would like to believe this. But it is probably untrue. The reforms are imposing upheavals that many find arbitrary. A revolution supported by the proletariat must reduce the relative position of that class in favour of a middle and upper-middle class that either does not exist or, to the extent that it does, consists largely of the communist nomenklatura. The democratic process allows full expression of the fears of those who can see what they will lose in the near term; it can barely represent those whose future gains are obscure or altogether invisible. It is unlikely to be an accident that many successful stabilisations cum market-oriented reforms have taken place under authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes (as in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Chile or Mexico), or under foreign occupation (as in post-war Germany and Japan). It is similarly no accident that the east Asian record of market-oriented interventionism, proposed as a model for eastern Europe by Stanley Katz (FT 24 April 1991), is also a record of political authoritarianism. These were what Deepak Lal of University College London has called 'autonomous' as opposed to 'factional' states.(1) The autonomous state can serve its own ends, not those of constituents. When an autonomous state is both benevolent and intelligent (a decidedly rare event, rashly presumed by most welfare economics to be the norm), it can impose sensible reforms where a factional state must seek consent. The experience of Argentina and Brazil, both of which moved from authoritarianism towards democracy in the 1980s, reveals the dangers. Half-hearted efforts at stabilisation have brought both states short-term success, followed by overwhelming political resistance and then reversal. Each failure reduces the credibility of the next attempt, the ultimate consequence being not merely economic disarray, but an almost total loss of faith in democratic political institutions. The economic disarray is itself important. Along with the cycle of inflation followed by disinflation go unstable real and nominal interest rates and wildly varying rates of economic growth. In the presence of such instabilities long-term investment becomes virtually impossible. Such a relapse must be the greatest single threat to successful economic reform in Poland. Unfortunately, the danger is far from remote, for four reasons: the delay in completing the stabilisation is eroding both consent and credibility; external circumstances have proved highly unfavourable; there was already a modest relapse in the second half of 1990; and political pressure for relaxation of the squeeze is building up. The Polish 'shock' has often been criticised for being too swift. So far as economic stabilisation and changes in relative prices are concerned, the opposite is more likely to be true. A population which had gained a long-sought change in political and economic regime may tolerate a short shock, even if it is severe, followed by improvement, even if it is limited, more readily than years of deterioration. Furthermore, the rapid move to a decentralised economy, now under way, could not be safely conducted if the relative prices on the basis of which decisions were to be made were highly distorted, as is noted by Paul Hare and Gorden Hughes in a paper for the Centre for Economic Policy Research.(2) What may be justified, instead, are temporary fiscal transfers, aimed at ensuring that enterprises which are economically valuable in the short term are not closed down prematurely, this being a recommendation made last year by John Flemming, now at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.(3) The speed with which prices are liberalised is as important for stabilisation as it is for economic efficiency. In Poland's case the bulk of the adjustment took place in January 1990 when consumer prices rose 79.6 per cent, but there have been a number of subsequent adjustments, notably in January 1991, when they rose by 12.7 per cent. Mr Balcerowicz refers to such increases as 'not a resurgence of inflation, but as a 'correction'. He is right. But it is unlikely that the Polish people will understand the difference. Even now, adjustments that were partially postponed from earlier in the year need to be made to the domestic prices of natural gas and electricity. It is partly because of such shocks that the government is expecting 55 per cent inflation this year, as against its earlier forecast of 36 per cent. Even the forecast by the central planning office, under Mr Jerzy Eysmont, that inflation would exceed 80 per cent is not out of the question. An important reason for these successive shocks has been the move to dollar and world prices of imports of Soviet oil. No less important to the Polish economy has been the associated collapse in exports to the Soviet Union and the post-communist countries of eastern and central Europe. These external shocks are a part of the reason why the 12 per cent decline in real Gross Domestic Product of last year is expected to be followed by, at best, no growth this year and, at worst, by a further decline of 5 per cent. External events are not the only reason for continued inflation and economic decline. In the first half of last year the Polish government over-achieved on all its stabilisation targets, imposing a far deeper reduction in real wages and output than it had expected. This was partly because it failed to foresee the consequences for aggregate supply of the huge changes in relative prices, as discussed by S Gomulka of the London School of Economics (4), and partly because of the way state enterprises responded to the reduction in demand, a point explored by Mark Shaffer, also at the LSE (5). Meanwhile, inflation fell, more slowly than had been hoped, to a trough of 1.8 per cent in August. With a presidential election as well, it is little wonder that the government relaxed fiscal and monetary policy somewhat in the second half of 1990. However understandable, this relaxation proved premature. It had a noticeable - though modest - effect on output, but a more noticeable one on inflation, which jumped to about 5 per cent a month. As a consequence of that relaxation, combined with the external shock, Poland will be struggling to control high levels of inflation throughout 1991 and probably 1992 as well. In particular, wages in state enterprise are now under the effective ceiling of a penal tax on increases larger than 60 per cent of the rise in consumer prices. Pressure is now building up against this deeply unpopular policy. Pressure is also building up on the exchange rate, which has remained constant at 9,500 zloties to the dollar since January 1990, even though nominal wages have increased by more than 150 per cent. If inflation proceeds as is now expected, a devaluation - and so yet another shock to inflationary expectations - would seem difficult to avoid, notwithstanding the denials of the National Bank of Poland. As if all that were not enough, a parliamentary election is to be fought in the autumn, with many in the government fearful of the support shown in the presidential election for Mr Stan Tyminski. People like Mr Eysmont, who is also a member of the Centre Alliance, an emerging Christian democratic grouping, argue that Poland needs economic expansion. He regards inflation as high as 100 per cent this year and 50 per cent next year as acceptable. Mr Eysmont argues that 'risks must be taken' because 'the greatest danger is stagflation'. But abandonment of a partially successful stabilisation is almost certain to bring soaring inflation back once more, as the flight from the zloty recommences. The choice that Poland faces is between an unavoidably painful attempt to eliminate inflation now and a renewed and almost certainly still more painful (because less credible) attempt to eliminate it next year. The lesson is not that gradual stabilisation pays, but that it does not. The question not merely for Poland, but for many other countries too, is whether fledgling democracies are able to act upon that lesson before they are forced to learn it. 1.

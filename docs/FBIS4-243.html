			<p>BFN     [Text] On 4 April the Luanda government ordered two of its  infantry regiments, backed by heavy artillery pieces, to storm  N'Dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. A military  source says MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party] troops equipped with M-46, 85-mm, 46-mm, and  30-mm guns, and various BM-21 multiple rocket launchers, have  left Dange- ia-Menha. Today, the troops shelled villages along  the Dange-ia- Menha-N'Dlatando road. The source added that the  Luanda government intends to disembark special forces behind  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  lines in Cuanza Norte Province. Measures have been taken to  defend civilians.    The Luanda regime is also involved in offensive operations  in  Huila and Cuando Cubango Provinces. MPLA-PT troops are fleeing  in disarray after failing to storm the capital of Quibala  District from positions in Ebo. Yesterday, UNITA repelled  MPLA-PT troops led by Lieutenant General Antas after seven hours  of fierce clashes in Conde region. Our correspondent reports  that the enemy abandoned two BMP-1 amphibious vehicles, two  76-mm guns, one 14.5-mm antiaircraft gun, one RPG-7, several  tonnes of assorted war materiel, and large quantities of  commodities carrying World Food Program labels. The MPLA-PT  offensive in Cuanza Sul Province has claimed the lives of more  than 200 innocent civilians in Conde. The area was shelled by  Lt. Gen. Antas' long-ranging artillery pieces. These are  preliminary figures.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: Bingham String Quartet - Purcell Room The current Park Lane Group series is entitled 'String Quartets Plus . . .'; on Monday the quartet was the Bingham team, and their 'plus' the pianist Andrew West (for Shostakovich's Piano Quintet). Though the PLG's first objective is to promote contemporary music, represented here by Elizabeth Maconchy's Quartet no. 6 (1950) and Iannis Xenakis's recent Tetora, they aim also to promote younger artists who are seriously attuned to new music. Hence the Bingham Quartet, whose faithfully searching accounts of Maconchy's quartets from no. 5 to no. 8 have already been committed to a Unicorn-Kanchana CD. Truth to tell, the best Bingham performances by a long way were of the Maconchy 6th and the Xenakis. In the former they have been coached to excellent purpose by the composer herself, and they made its sinewy lines tell plainly. An extra touch of astringency in their address would still have been welcome: a bracing, downright Roman virtue in all 13 of Maconchy's quartets is the leanness of their arguments, and nothing is gained by softening their edges. Everything is open to the ear (and mind) - they say candidly what they mean, but never stoop to ingratiate themselves. That's why I think that her conveniently concise quartets are likely to find permanent niches in the repertoire. The Xenakis Tetora - Dorian for '4', apparently - prompted the gutsiest, most full-blooded Bingham playing. Tetora belongs to the composer's 'ethnic' vein, not to the actuarial fantasies that first made his name. Its workings-out are dense but always folkish, and they sustain a steady pressure of raw, earthy feeling even while they rotate the material in tight little circles. In Shostakovich's fine Quintet, however, only the pianist West appreciated its extrovert dimensions - grandly rhetorical at the start, exuberant and unbuttoned in the Finale  - and he was audibly at pains to trim his scale to the wan, respectful Bingham measure. We'd had enough of that already in their Haydn, the B minor quartet from his op. 33, where they managed to reduce every bright thrust (there are many, some of them gypsy-inspired) to juiceless pantomime: as if they took the piece to be Eminently Worthy, but of course not much fun to play or to hear. Haydn would have been astonished, and probably insulted. There were moments of curdled pitch, too, and the leader's exposed sallies too often squeaked and wheezed.</p>

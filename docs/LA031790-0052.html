			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECEPTIVE 'INFOMERCIALS'  </P> <P> Given that my profession -- public relations -- has a reputation for  "deceiving" the public, it may be surprising that I am disgusted by TV  "infomercials" ("Amazing Discovery: These Shows Are Ads" by Howard Rosenberg,  March 12).  </P> <P> Every one of these programs -- whether it sells hair-loss cure-alls or  sunglasses that enables one to see behind himself (wow, what a necessary  product!) -- uses phases such as "our researchers" or "leading medical  authorities" without substantiation and rebuttal.  </P> <P> When a print ad closely resembles a news article, the notice "Paid  Advertisement" is clearly visible. Why don't infomercials have "Paid  Advertisement" running constantly -- or frequently -- across the bottom of the  screen?  </P> <P> Such notices at the beginning and end of each program are not enough, because  many viewers tune in late or cut out early.  </P> <P> RICHARD BORDEN, Moorpark  </P></p>

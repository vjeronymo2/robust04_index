			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television Heimat (BBC 2, 11.20) continues its slow but gripping march through the history of Germany in the 20th century. Continuing on the Teutonic theme, there is Sam Peckinpah's harrowingly realistic film Cross of Iron (BBC 1, 11.00). Set on the Eastern Front, the film looks at the nature of warfare through the eyes of four German soldiers. But with that exception, this is an evening with so little - beyond another dose of The Bill (ITV, 8.00) - to recommend it that a good book is surely the answer. However, if you are absolutely determined to spend it square-eying and fancy something in the current affairs line, there is Public Eye (BBC 2, 8.0). The film outlines the tough measures which from April, under the Child Support Act, will in theory be implemented to catch those many back-sliding fathers who won't - or can't - disgorge the maintenance they owe for their children. If, by some unlikely chance, the so-called cult American comedy series Nurses (C4, 10.00) has attracted followers, they should take note that tonight sees an end of the bad business.</p>

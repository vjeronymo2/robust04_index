			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / SE in move to sell information wholesale THE London Stock Exchange is close to contracting out its Topic information system in a move designed to turn it into a wholesaler of stock market information, rather than a retailer. Together with its desire to hand over settlement to a new clearing house in the wake of the Taurus fiasco, this would leave London with a slimmed-down stock market authority with operations only around half of their present level. The plan to contract out Topic, known within the exchange as 'Project Jupiter', has replaced earlier moves to sell what is the leading carrier of price information and news for the UK stock market. The exchange will benefit from a royalty from future profits on Topic, and could eventually sell it to the new operator. Selling information and charging settlement fees last year contributed Pounds 101m of the exchange's Pounds 194m of income. By largely pulling out of these businesses, the institution - still reeling from its costly failure to complete the Taurus automated settlement system - would fall back on charging trading fees to its members and listing fees to companies. The exchange intends to remain a low-cost wholesaler of share price information. It is planning to spend Pounds 18m on a new 'ticker plant'  - to take share price information from the market's central computers and provide electronic information feeds to retailers such as Reuters and the new Topic operator. 'The board has taken the decision to exit the end-user terminal business,' said one director. 'The Topic base is under lots of pressure. Its system is old hat now.' The exchange is currently upgrading the Topic system, and is likely to want to continue to have an influence in its development once it is contracted out. Telerate, the US provider of financial information, is believed to be the exchange's favoured contractor, although discussions are also continuing with the Swiss-based Telecurs and at least two other companies. In spite of the blow to the stock market's morale caused by the abandonment of Taurus, believed to have cost the securities industry Pounds 400m or more, the exchange seems likely to move ahead with another ambitious technology project, to build a new trading system. This project, which is estimated to cost the exchange Pounds 75m, has already been attacked by some securities houses as a 'white elephant' on a par with Taurus. The exchange's board plans to review the system again at its next board meeting in April. Exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, and directors contacted by the Financial Times, all agreed that the so-called Technology Transformation Project would have to proceed if London's dominance of share trading in Europe was to be secured.</p>

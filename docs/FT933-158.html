			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish heads south It is a mark of the absurdity of modern accounting that Grand Metropolitan and Scottish &amp; Newcastle cannot agree on the price at which they struck their Chef &amp; Brewer deal. Happily, both sides accept that Pounds 622m in cash will change hands, but GrandMet, which has an interest in talking up the total, says the package is worth Pounds 736m while S&amp;N, with the aim of minimising the price, says the true figure is Pounds 703m. Most of the difference relates to the provision made by GrandMet to offset the cost of buying beer at above-market prices from Courage. GrandMet's figure allows for release of this provision, but S&amp;N will also have to buy expensive beer from Courage until 1995. So if the price it is paying for Chef &amp; Brewer looks cheap, it is cheap for a reason. That does not make the acquisition a bad deal. The strategic advantage of a retailing position in the south made Chef &amp; Brewer worth more to S&amp;N than to Whitbread, which found the eventual asking price too steep. In theory, S&amp;N brands will gain national reach and there will be no more question of dismissing it as a regional brewer. Relief that this strategic hurdle has been cleared may finally allow the shares to outperform, but it would be rash to count on too much too soon. The benefits will not accrue overnight, or without a lot more work. There is not only the daunting challenge of disposing of surplus pubs in a difficult market. The Chef &amp; Brewer estate also needs considerable investment, while it will be 1995 before S&amp;N will be able to put much of its own beer through the system. Eventually, its acquisition could make it a formidable competitor to Whitbread in south-eastern pub retailing. Yet Whitbread has been investing in its retail estate throughout the recession. It has a head start.</p>

Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech  announced after four hours of talks with a fishermen's  delegation in Rennes that Brussels has agreed to reintroduce  minimum prices on certain species of fish. Here is an extract  from the minister's news conference, which finished a moment ago:    [Begin Puech recording] Regarding crews and families, the  social aspect has, I believe, been dealt with as was requested.  I now turn to the issue of prices, of markets. We are  implementing, as I indicated the other day, the means that are  available: 50 million francs have been released immediately for  producers' organizations, so that they can intervene  efficiently. [passage omitted]    We have also obtained agreement from the European Commission  in Brussels that minimum prices should be reintroduced. Minimum  prices are once again operative. [end recording]    Philippe Lefebvre, you are in front of the regional council  building. I suppose that the fishermen's delegation will now  try to sell these proposals to their members and to calm them  down a bit.    [Lefebvre] Yes, the delegation led by Dominique Lapart went  down to Rue Gambetta, near the regional council building, about  10 minutes ago to try to calm the fishermen's anger. Their  efforts appear, however, to have been in vain, since the crowd  immediately began chanting: We have not obtained anything. They  are not satisfied with Puech's measures. Some of them intend to  stay in Rennes tonight. The town can brace itself for the  worse. Some of the fishermen will be leaving, but they have  announced their intention to stop on the way to empty more cases  of imported fish in warehouses somewhere between Rennes and  their final destination.    This is all we can say for now. So, to sum up, we have had  two reactions to the measures announced: a rather calm welcome  from the delegates, but their members seem rather disappointed,  and clashes are continuing near the town hall between  demonstrators and riot police.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TANGLE FOR INQUIRING MINDS;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER, OFTEN ACCUSED OF JOURNALISTIC IMPROPRIETIES,  CRIES FOUL OVER CBS' PROFILE OF THE PAPER ON '60 MINUTES' SUNDAY.  </P> <P> Some conflicts simply invite spectators to sit back and enjoy the fray, so  fittingly suited are the combatants -- Godzilla vs. Rodan, Truman Capote vs.  Gore Vidal. Count among them the current clash between journalism's two titans  of the sensational expose, "60 Minutes" of CBS and the National Enquirer of the  grocery store check-out line.  </P> <P> No doubt lots of people would relish seeing the National Enquirer -- "the  National Rag" to many a burned celebrity -- squirm under the tight focus of a  "60 Minutes" investigation. And "60 Minutes" detractors might be cheered to  hear that the Enquirer has accused the CBS broadcast of improper journalistic  practices, including the use of allegedly stolen material, for its piece on the  Enquirer being aired Sunday night.  </P> <P> The Enquirer has been made nervous enough that it has hired a well-known  private eye to track the source of the material that landed in "60 Minutes' "  hands. And adding an element of intrigue is the tale of one of "60 Minutes' "  main sources, a print reporter whose own article on the Enquirer appeared  earlier this week in Los Angeles magazine, that he was allegedly harassed by  the detective, and that his phone may even have been tapped.  </P> <P> The Enquirer says that its detective has harassed no one, and that its lawyers  have only tried to dissuade "60 Minutes" from airing a "false story."  </P> <P> At the heart of the friction is the Enquirer's legendary system of sourcing --  its super-secret list of individuals who are paid for juicy tidbits used by the  supermarket tabloid, mostly in stories about Hollywood celebrities. The  tabloid's inclination toward the provocative and near-incredible angle --  Roseanne Barr using voodoo curses, for instance -- has made it the scourge of  that element of Hollywood most often its subject.  </P> <P> The Enquirer has always defended its veracity, standing on its vast network of  paid sources.  </P> <P> But that network of sources is what comes under scrutiny in Sunday's broadcast,  on which Ed Bradley is the correspondent. The Enquirer fears that the segment  will try to demonstrate that the publication makes up stories with phony  sources.  </P> <P> In a letter trying to dissuade the broadcast from that theme, Michael Boylan,  vice chairman of the Enquirer's parent company, the GP Group, told "60 Minutes"  executive producer Don Hewitt that part of the Enquirer's list of confidential  sources had been stolen in the paper's "war" with a group of celebrities and  their private detectives.  </P> <P> Boylan said in the letter that the Enquirer's complex system of paying its  sources, devised to maintain secrecy, had not been understood by "60 Minutes"  and that it sometimes even causes confusion among sources, because they may be  asked to get information without being told the full story to which they are  contributing.  </P> <P> In other words, it might look like the Enquirer makes up sources to support its  stories.  </P> <P> That is precisely the conclusion arrived at by Rod Lurie, a contributing editor  for Los Angeles magazine who was interviewed by "60 Minutes" for its broadcast  and, like "60 Minutes," came into possession of a 10-page list of the  Enquirer's paid sources earlier this year.  </P> <P> Lurie's own investigation into the Enquirer led him to a trail of sources who  told him they were regularly paid for information relating to stories they knew  nothing about.  </P> <P> While it might seem that the prospect of "60 Minutes" skewering the Enquirer  would be a cause for cheer in Hollywood, the impending broadcast has had the  opposite effect in some corners of show business, where for weeks many have  lived in fear of being exposed as sources for the dreaded supermarket scourge.  Publicists, agents, even the occasional celebrity who fed tips to the Enquirer,  dreaded the revelation.  </P> <P> But Grace Diekhaus, producer of the "60 Minutes" piece, said that they have  nothing to fear. "We weren't interested in 'outing' these people," she said.  </P> <P> Unlike Lurie, Diekhaus said that her dealings with the Enquirer have not been  overtly confrontational, but she thinks the tabloid has gotten itself unduly  overwrought. The Enquirer abruptly canceled an on-camera interview, and then  asked her to submit questions in writing.  </P> <P> "We don't do that for the President of the United States, so why do it for the  National Enquirer?" she asked.  </P> <P> Boylan, in an interview, said that editor Iain Calder and articles editor Steve  Coz declined to appear on camera for "60 Minutes" because they believed they  would either be forced to compromise their sources or would appear too evasive  to help their cause. In any event, he said, he believed "60 Minutes" was not  interested in the Enquirer's explanation of its accounting methods, but is  after something more sensational.  </P> <P> Diekhaus has another explanation: "The people who poke their nose into  everybody else's business didn't want anybody poking their nose into theirs."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified Central News Unit correspondent from </F> Mashhad on 1 May--recorded]    [Text] The director general of the Aliens' Department in  the Interior Ministry, Hoseyni, spoke to correspondents in  Mashhad last night and said: On the basis of the new plan,  nearly 35,000 Iraqi and Afghan citizens--who have received  refugee status papers from the Islamic Republic of Iran--should  report to the offices of the Aliens' Department of the Law  Enforcement forces in the provincial centers to get their new  refugee documents.    Regarding the continuation of the repatriation scheme for  Afghan refugees in Iran, he said: With the concurrence of the  Afghan Government and the United Nations, the return of  approximately 850,000 Afghan refugees has been scheduled.    The director general of the Interior Ministry stated: About  543,000 of these refugees are people who have been given a  temporary resident permit for six months under the scheme for  identifying unauthorized refugees in Iran. They have a grace  period until 2 July this year to remain in Iran.    On the legal problems pertaining to those persons who have  Iranian and Afghan spouses, he clarified that the Government of  Afghanistan has pledged that it will take the legal rights of  the Iranian spouses into consideration. He stressed that the  Islamic Republic of Iran's policy is the voluntary and honorable  return of refugees. As for those refugees who have come to Iran  from Kabul and Herat and are living in difficult conditions, he  said: We have announced that we have no restrictions on the  acceptance of refugees, but we prefer to assist them inside  Afghanistan's territory.    Commenting on the Islamic Republic of Iran's acceptance of a  new group of refugees from Iraq, he said: In view of the  pitiful plight of the Shiites in southern Iraq, nearly 7,000  Iraqi refugees have been housed in camps in Fars, Lorestan, and  Khuzestan Provinces.    The director general of the Interior Ministry said: So far,  no Azeri refugee is present in Iran and our Red Crescent  organization is providing assistance to 50,000 Azeris in seven  camps inside Azerbaijani territory.</p>

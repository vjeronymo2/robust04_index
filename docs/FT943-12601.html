			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Books: Stark tale of decade's evil drug - The horrific challenges posed to society by crack cocaine CRACK OF DOOM by Jon Silverman Headline Pounds 16.99, 256 pages Newspaper headlines and American films form most people's perceptions of crack cocaine. Jon Silverman's book reveals what the drug looks like, its origins, how it is used, its cost and its effect on the user. He also describes those involved directly with it: the law enforcers, the increasingly ruthless dealers and the desperate addicts. His insights dispel any lingering doubts about the evil of crack cocaine and the threat it poses to our society. The focus is mainly on Britain and Silverman levels some criticism at our failure to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with it. Crack is a relatively new drug in Britain, so to some extent the criticism is justified. But it is still difficult to find any government or law enforcement agency which would claim to have the answers. Earlier this month, I attended a conference in New York with representatives from many countries; we shared views, we compared problems, we examined our policies and solutions. But we are all in the same boat - there is still no comprehensive answer to the crack problem. The text outlines that problem and describes specific operations by the Customs and the police. Some of these accounts are personalised a little too much, making it appear as if it was a single officer with persistence or flair who was the sole driving force. While this is partly true, an individual needs the support of a team and the strength of an organisation behind him or her to operate effectively. Silverman does, however, capture well the feelings and emotions of officers involved in operations - their fears and frustrations, the highs and lows, their personal sacrifice in the constant pursuit of justice. As to the traffickers and peddlers of this obnoxious cocktail, crack; towards the end of his book Silverman mentions the white criminals who see drug trafficking as less dangerous and more lucrative than robbing banks and have their own way of importation (probably gleaned from American movies). He pays most attention, however, to the formation, growth and development of the Jamaican criminals known as 'Yardies'. The early political support for these vicious criminals, their spread through the US into Britain, the trail of senseless violence and the apparent lack of remorse is terrifying. The accounts of summary executions, gang warfare not seen since the days of Prohibition, torture - one woman had a hot iron pressed against her face then was doused with boiling water to make her talk - is horrific. The haphazard nature of their groupings, their false identities, the peripatetic nature of their lives - moving on false passports, between here, the US and other countries - make these criminals difficult to target. The job of the police is made even harder by the fear of violence among potential informants, the near impossibility of operating undercover in these areas and the fear of being dubbed racist for mounting large operations in black areas. The advent of personal radios and an army of children willing to act as lookouts and warning sirens exacerbates the problems, which are ably covered by Silverman. For users of the drug, the picture is perhaps bleakest of all. Their lives are taken over completely by little rocks of crack as they fall, almost irreversibly, into the fires of utter dependence and show a willingness to maim, kill or even sell their children to maintain their habit. The human depravity which lead to the sacking of Rome pales into insignificance alongside the lives of some crack users. Whether we feel that they are victims or villains, we cannot or must not ignore them - and as yet we have no proven cure for their addiction. In this very readable snapshot of a 20th-century drug, Silverman offers the reader an honest picture of the effects of such a vicious drug on our society but does not, and probably cannot, offer solutions. He hopes that crack will run a cycle - he postulates 10 years and says we have five to go. I will not hold my breath. The reader can, however, be assured that all law enforcement agencies throughout the world now know a great deal more about crack and its wake of violence and criminality. Improved intelligence networks, spearheaded in Europe by Europol; better liaison and sharing of information supported by the recently formed National Criminal Intelligence Service, and multi-agency targeting operations of the criminals involved are all part of our 1990s armoury and in this we do achieve much success. But if we are to eradicate this drug from our society we must help people, particularly our young, to recognise crack for the plague that it is and convince them to avoid it. They need help and they need it now. Keith Hellawell QPM, is chief constable of West Yorkshire Police.</p>

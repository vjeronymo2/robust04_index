			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Serb offensive steps up pressure on Izetbegovic SERB forces yesterday resumed their offensive on Mount Igman, a key point in the defence of Sarajevo, stepping up pressure on Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to attend peace talks on the republic's ethnic partition. Sarajevo radio reported heavy fighting after Serbs launched a three-pronged attack on the hill, which dominates and protects Bosnia's capital from the south. The mainly Moslem Bosnian forces held their positions despite an overnight armoured Serb assault, according to an army statement. Belgrade radio confirmed the clashes around Igman but claimed Moslems had shelled Ilidza, a Serb-held suburb, prompting the Serbian counterattack. Last night Bosnia's 10-man presidency expressed doubt about the value of attending the Geneva peace talks while the Serb advance continued. However, Bosnian radio said the presidency had indicated it was ready to attend and had agreed on a delegation. The defeats around Sarajevo apparently led the Bosnian presidency to sack Mr Mustafa Hajrulajovic, commander of the first army corps. United Nations observers were denied access to Igman by Serb forces on the grounds that it was too dangerous. Relief workers were worried about the possible influx of 30,000 refugees from the Igman area. 'This could be a staggering and extremely tragic event because there is no spare capacity for people to be housed in Sarajevo,' said Mr Peter Kessler, of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. UN workers rescued 230 severely retarded children in hospital in Fojnica, 30 miles west of Sarajevo. Relief workers last night were trying to negotiate the passage of an emergency food convoy to the handicapped children, who had not been fed in three days. They discovered five babies in critical condition who, along with the children, had been abandoned when the town fell last week to Moslem forces, reported Sarajevo radio.</p>

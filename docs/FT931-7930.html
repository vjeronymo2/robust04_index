			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Financing the deficit THE BRITISH government will borrow some Pounds 38bn (6 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product) in the current financial year and, argues the Institute of Fiscal Studies, another Pounds 54bn in 1993-94. That is just the beginning. Under plausible assumptions, the government will be borrowing Pounds 1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country every year for many years to come. But even such a borrower enjoys some choices. They are not unlimited. Wherever the government borrows and however it borrows, it faces highly positive real rates of interest. The only escape from the trap would be borrowing in conventional long-term gilts, followed by a burst of inflation. This was what happened after the second world war. It must not happen again. Even so, the government can - and should - try to minimise the real interest rates it faces. Mr Lamont's target for inflation is 1-4 per cent. Judged by the spread between index-linked and 15-year conventional gilts, now 4.8 percentage points, the non-taxpaying investors who purchase most of these securities are not convinced by Mr Lamont. The government should put its money where its mouth is, by borrowing in index-linked gilts. It could also borrow short term at 6 per cent, rather than long at over 8 per cent. That is not how things have been in 1992-93. The government's borrowings this year include nothing shorter than a year, Pounds 5bn in conventional gilts of 1-5 years maturity, Pounds 22bn in conventional gilts of over five years maturity, a mere Pounds 3 3/4 bn in index-linked gilts and Pounds 4bn via National Savings. Government funding also includes some Pounds 8 1/2 bn in net foreign exchange intervention. The Bank of England argues that the funding pattern is determined by what investors want. But is it not rather a question of price? Maybe the government regards index-linked gilts as an expensive way to fund, because it does not believe in its own targets for inflation. Similarly, the government may not believe short rates of interest are a bargain for borrowers - house buyers, please note - because it expects them to shoot up once more. As for turning borrowed D-Marks into sterling, this might be rather profitable now, though it was certainly not before September 17. The government needs also to reconsider from whom it borrows. The full-fund rule, which requires it to sell securities to the non-bank private sector equal to the public sector borrowing requirement, was designed in the mid-1980s to ensure that government borrowing (or repayment) would have no effect on broad money. That never made sense when the government had ceased to believe broad money was important. It makes even less sense now that the chancellor has a monitoring range for M4 of 4-8 per cent. Since its growth has been well below the bottom of that range, why not monetise some of the PSBR, ask the monetarists? Others hold out the hope of lower yields on gilts, reduced pressure on institutional cash flow and a supply of higher quality assets for battered banks. The case seems strong, but the government cannot just end the full-fund rule. It has to replace it with another one: an M4 target, for example, or perhaps a longer period over which full-funding would apply. Otherwise, the beneficial effects of underfunding on gilt prices could be more than offset by the effects of higher expected inflation on interest rates. Expected inflation, not the mechanics of funding, is the fundamental issue. Provided the government is thought to be committed to low inflation, it should be able to finance the PSBR at manageable cost. The danger is the fear that, as debt mounts, so too will the temptation towards another inflationary default. Funding policy can aid credibility. But a government, like any other borrower, can borrow cheaply and effectively only if it demonstrates that its appetite has limits. This is the fifth in a series of leaders on the March Budget.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: European drive by big US mutual fund PUTNAM, one of the biggest US mutual funds, has mounted a fresh campaign to penetrate the European institutional and retail fund management industry. The Boston-based subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan yesterday announced the appointment of a British unit trust expert, Mr Jonathan Custance Baker, to the new London-based post of director of European business development. Although Putnam has maintained a London investment office for some years, and is thought to have been an underbidder two years ago for Gartmore, the London investment house bought by Banque Indosuez, its marketing presence in Europe has been minimal. However, it established a Japanese operation a year ago and, in the meantime, its business in the US has been booming, with worldwide assets up 23 per cent to Dollars 52bn during 1991. Putnam manages investments for 1.7m individuals and more than 200 institutional investors globally. Mr Custance Baker, 42, ran James Capel's unit trust business until six months ago. Previously, he was the founding president of the GT group's mutual funds operation in San Francisco. Until recently, he was on the executive committee of the Unit Trust Association. 'Putnam wants to make sure it is doing things in a way that will achieve long-term success rather than instant results,' he said.</p>

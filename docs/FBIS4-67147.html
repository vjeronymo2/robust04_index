			<p>Trafficking   Halted   <F P=102> PY0605021394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 5 May 94 p  8 </F>  <F P=103> PY0605021394 </F> <F P=104>  Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese </F> BFN     [Text] If it is left up to the Military Police [PM] to  investigate the connections between the illegal numbers lottery  and international drug trafficking, District Attorney Antonio  Carlos Biscaia may become frustrated. The investigations have  stopped and, according to sources from the PM Secret Service  (P-2), anyone who insists on investigating on his own could be  punished. Authorizations for cars and agents necessary for  operations that must be carried out in Bangu, Campos, and Angra  dos Reis--where there is a strong indication of links between  illegal lottery kingpins and drug traffickers--have been  canceled.    Biscaia, who does not trust the civilian police, is unable  to  investigate any charges of drug trafficking links due to lack of  support from the PM. The P-2 agents have not even analyzed a  telephone book confiscated in an illegal lottery kingpin's home  in Praca da Se, Bangu, which contains telephone numbers of the  Cali cartel in Colombia, the main drug trafficking cartel in the  world. According to secret service sources, the PM alleges that  such operations are meant to politically harm former Rio de  Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and current Governor Nilo  Batista.    The information leaked by an accountant for illegal lottery  kingpin Castor de Andrade to the PM secret service--which links  Fernando de Miranda Iggnacio, Andrade's son-in-law, who is  detained at a Polinter [Inter-State Police] precinct, with  Colombian drug traffickers--could also not be confirmed, because  the P-2, with the dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Marco Antonio  Paes de Oliveira, has practically been dismantled. The most  active P-2 agents were transferred to other units or given  anticipated vacations.    According to the same sources, any evidence of the links  between the illegal lottery and drug trafficking could  strengthen the district attorney's position and, on the other  hand, weaken the state government and PDT [Democratic Labor  Party] politicians mentioned in the lists of the illegal lottery  kingpins.    To worsen the situation, the Federal Police is on strike,  and  the information about passport numbers, and arrivals and  departures from the country, cannot be checked out, not even by  the prosecutors. For this reason, and to gain time, Biscaia is  concentrating on the charges of active and passive corruption  which require only the analysis of computer diskettes and  accounting books confiscated from the illegal lottery kingpins,  and which list the names of politicians, prosecutors, judges,  journalists, artists, and athletes.</p>

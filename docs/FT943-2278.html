			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Shareholders approve Coles buy-back plan Shareholders in Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, yesterday approved the company's plans to buy back 21.45 per cent of its equity, for ADollars 1.26bn (Dollars 920m). The shares are currently held by Kmart, the US discount and specialty store operator. Coles had run into criticism because the price at which the buy-back is due to take place had been pitched at ADollars 4.55 a share - a significant premium to the recent market price, which closed 1 cent higher at ADollars 4.02 yesterday. Some shareholders were also concerned about the ADollars 28m fee Coles was obliged to pay Kmart in the event that the deal did not go ahead. At the meeting, in Melbourne, Mr Lawrence Gruzman, a shareholder and well-known dissident at Coles, spoke out against the plan. But two motions for the deal were approved. The first, concerning Coles's plan to buy back 129m shares, or just under 10 per cent, directly and to cancel these was passed with 93 per cent of voting shareholders in favour. The second motion, which permits Coles to acquire a Kmart unit that holds the remaining shares, passed on a show of hands.</p>

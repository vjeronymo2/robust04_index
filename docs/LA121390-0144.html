			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> FORMER COURTHOUSE WILL BE BOUGHT FOR REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The City Council has voted to buy the former Los Angeles County Municipal  Courthouse in the 8000 block of 3rd Street for $1.13 million. The 1.04-acre  parcel may be developed into theaters and restaurants as a redevelopment  project, said Robert Messinger, assistant to City Manager Gerald M. Caton.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors is expected to give final approval to the sale  later this month, Messinger said.  </P> <P> The city will loan its Redevelopment Agency $4 million from general city funds  to buy the former courthouse and another property at the southeast corner of  Lakewood and Firestone boulevards. City redevelopment officials have been  negotiating for months to buy the second property from the St. George Greek  Orthodox Church. The tentative selling price is about $3 million but  negotiations are continuing, Messinger said.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency will eventually pay back the loan from the city with  property tax revenue.  </P></p>

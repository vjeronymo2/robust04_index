			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Samper by Carlos Murcia; date, place </F> not given]    [Text] After the 13 March election and his  selection as the presidential candidate at the Liberal  Convention, Ernesto Samper Pizano now leads all the polls. This  is due in large part to his proposal for a social coalition  known as the Alliance for Colombia, which has made been well  received by a variety of sectors. The candidate expects that his  campaign will continue to proceed well, as his platform has more  credibility than that of the conservative Andres Pastrana.    [Murcia] How is the Alliance for Colombia doing? What  support  have you picked up from people who have joined the coalition,  and what further support do you hope to get?    [Samper] The response to that appeal has exceeded our  expectations. All over the country there are large numbers of  Colombians who want to join this Social Alliance for the people.  We are appealing to all the people, without distinction of  party, race, creed, or ethnic background, so that together we  can bring about positive changes for the people of Colombia. The  commitment I have made to those who have supported me and the  people have made to Samper is to support the platform I  presented to the Colombian people, which I ratified at the  convention: to generate more or better jobs; to invest in social  areas so that the benefits of economic liberalization will reach  all Colombians; to increase decentralization; and a new peace  policy that will enable us to achieve our dream of living  together in harmony. This is a long-term proposal that arises  from the liberal majorities, not a strategy to win the elections.    [Murcia] Do you think you can renew liberalism so that it  will once again represent broad sectors of society that today  feel they have been abandoned?    [Samper] Liberalism cannot simply sit back with its election  majorities; it needs to reach out to the masses who have been  isolated because they do not feel they are represented in the  community. I have said that in Colombia there is much more  liberalism than the Liberal Party, and with the task of  modernization, institutionalization, improvement of ethical  standards, modernization, and participation that the recently  appointed commission will promote, which will be chaired by vice  presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle, with the  participation of young people and women, we will work so that  this feeling will be converted into support for the party.    [Murcia] Peace was a fundamental theme in your speech at the  Liberal Convention. Will there be peace in your government? Do  you not feel that the approval of Protocol II in Geneva, as  proposed in your speech, means making concessions to the  guerrillas?    [Samper] At this time, there is no issue of more importance  to the nation than achieving peace. If we take away from the  nation the brake of violence, growth and opportunities for the  Colombian people will take off. That is why I said that I will  always listen to anyone in Colombia who wants to talk about  reconciliation. We will bring about peace by returning to the  state its legitimate monopoly over force, but also by increasing  its social presence in areas in conflict with more and better  health care, more and better education, more and better housing,  and most of all, more and better jobs. Jobs are the new name of  peace in Colombia.    [Murcia] Pastrana says he receives support in public rallies  and you in private meetings behind closed doors. What do you  think of that statement?    [Samper] That support which they scornfully say comes from  "private meetings" is the same support that Andres Pastrana was  seeking a few days ago. We cannot ignore the fact that politics  is also conducted by presenting ideas to business groups, in  forums, and in universities; these proposals are the very ones  that have received majority support from major conservative,  progressive, independent, and leftist sectors.    [Murcia] Some critics oppose your ticket with De la Calle,  saying that both of you have abandoned your principles in order  to win votes....    [Samper] All the liberal candidates in the recent primary  agreed on the need to promote the second phase of economic  liberalization, the social phase, the phase of the people, based  on this social capitalism program which rejects the option of  savage capitalism. Those statements are made by people who are  concerned because the Samper-De la Calle ticket has received  impressive support not only from liberalism that is more  enthusiastic and united than ever, but also from broad-based  sectors of society.    [Murcia] What will your relations be with the new secretary  general of the OAS, and how will this position benefit Colombia?    [Samper] President Gaviria's election is a recognition of  his  status as a continental leader and of the fight Colombia has  waged against the drug traffic and narcoterrorism. I am sure  that President Gaviria will provide extraordinary leadership for  the OAS with his well-known ability and dynamism. Obviously, in  the next government we will make use of his presence in this  organization to promote issues of great importance to Colombia,  like the creation of an Interamerican trade bloc.    [Murcia] Will you alter your campaign strategy because of  the  change in the election date? Are you not afraid there may be  more abstentions in the second round because of the soccer world  championship?    [Samper] We will continue the same campaign pace, presenting  our ideas on creating jobs, paying the social debt to women in  Colombia, and investing in people. For the second round, I have  promised all the Colombian people to keep from spoiling the  world championships. With their support, we will win the first  round by a "knockout," so we will be able to enjoy the games  without being concerned about the elections. I also have to keep  the promise I made to accompany the team, as president-elect, to  the United States.    [Murcia] As president, what will your position be on  economic  groups?    [Samper] The same that it was when I was minister of  development: to establish strict controls to avoid monopolistic  practices so that no company can abuse its dominant market  position. Obviously, with economic liberalization and foreign  competition the possibilities of monopolies will be limited, but  we need to pass strict legislation to restrict practices which  hurt the consumer. But we cannot forget that Colombia needs to  strengthen businesses and groups that can compete in the world  market. And finally, when public assets are privatized, that  must help to democratize ownership of property, not concentrate  it in a few hands.    [Murcia] Do you think Luis Fernando Ramirez is ineligible to  be a vice presidential candidate?    [Samper] Humberto De la Calle Lombana has been studying the  issue of ineligibility. I believe the Colombian people must have  absolute legal certainty when they go to the ballot boxes to  elect the next president and vice president. Still, the most  important thing is for the Colombian people to meditate calmly  and responsibly about whether they would feel more comfortable  with De la Calle or with Ramirez if the president were no longer  there. And what has been perceived so far in the polls is the  confidence and support that Humberto De la Calle generates as a  possible successor for the president.    Today the candidate Samper is ending his "spiritual retreat"  at a ranch near Bogota.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Move fails to calm backbench tax fears The government's decision to cut interest rates pleased Conservative MPs, but failed to calm backbench fears that the chancellor will raise taxes in next week's Budget. Mr John Major, the prime minister, boasted at question time in the Commons that short-term interest rates were at the lowest level since 1977. As opposition backbenchers pointed out that Labour was then in power, Mr Major told them: 'Precisely, and at that time, inflation was 13 per cent, and pensioners and savers were being robbed of 7 per cent (sic).' Mr Major added to speculation about the possibility of Budget tax increases by lecturing Mr John Smith, the opposition leader, on the government's determination to close the gap between revenue and expenditure. Questioned about the impact of increases in national insurance contributions, announced in the last Budget, Mr Major said it was 'essential to make sure that we remove the fiscal gap'. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the reduction but said it had been 'too long delayed and is less than industry expected, wanted or needs'. Mr Brown said that Britain needed 'lower interest rates as part of a clear economic strategy, which the chancellor has failed to enunciate six months after he took office'. In spite of the exchanges, however, many backbench Tories privately agreed with the judgment of Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, that the interest rate cut was 'no big deal'. Mr Beith said the cut was 'a very small reduction which is hardly going to set industry humming, and might not even be passed on fully to home buyers'. He added: 'The danger is that it will prove to be a sweetener to a bad Budget of crisis cuts in capital expenditure.' Sir John Watts, the Conservative chairman of the Commons treasury committee, said he hoped that the small size of the reduction indicated that tax increases in next week's Budget would be smaller than feared. He said: 'If this is only a little bit of sugar coating, perhaps we should only expect a very small bitter pill. Certainly that would be my hope.'</p>

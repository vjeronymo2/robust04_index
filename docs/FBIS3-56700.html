			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Bovt under the "Russia Revises Its </F> Foreign Policy" rubric: "The Foreign Affairs Ministry Is  Ridding Itself of the `Belovezhskaya Forest Syndrome'"]    [Text] Yesterday a two-day conference on aspects of  Russia's policy with respect to the CIS and the Baltic countries  opened in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For the  first time all the ambassadors of the former Soviet republics  have gathered in Moscow. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made a  speech whose keynote was the protection of Russia's interests in  the CIS and Baltic countries. The process of the conference  itself confirms KOMMERSANT-DAILY's predictions that the more  often Russian leaders assure that there will be no revision of  the country's foreign policy after the 12 December elections,  the more obvious it becomes that this revision has grown urgent.  The conference is analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator  Georgiy Bovt.    Andrey Kozyrev stated that as of now protection of the  interests of Russians in the former Soviet republics is one of  the strategic priorities for Moscow. Meanwhile the Concept on  Foreign Policy, adopted by the Security Council in March 1993,  in its section dealing with relations with the CIS, makes no  mention of this problem whatsoever (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and  Moldova were simply passed over in silence); the section on  relations with the Baltic states does not elaborate on this  problem sufficiently. The year 1993, however, can be called  "the year of Russian refugees." They have been emigrating in  masses even from such seemingly "agreeable" countries as  Kyrgyzstan. Their exodus has intensified from Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan, the war-torn Tajikistan, and -- as a result of the  "policy of soft eviction" -- from the Baltic countries. The  number of Russian-speaking refugees (defined according to UN  criteria) has already reached 2 million people.    The 12 December elections showed that the artful rhetoric of  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Russian  Federation Communist Party has found a response among the  greater part of the electorate. The thesis that votes for the  Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party are votes  "against the methods of reforms" is partly a delusion. In fact  the disintegration of the USSR is still being painfully  perceived by many in Russia -- even if at the emotional,  everyday level. It seems that the Russian Foreign Affairs  Ministry also understands this. Although in a recent article in  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Andrey Kozyrev still maintained that the  president is the guarantee of Russia's course and its protection  against national extremism, and that this course itself will  remain just as predictable, open, and oriented toward  partner-like relations with the outside world, the minister's  speech yesterday showed that adjustments are already being made.    For the first time he openly articulated the thought that  has  long been aired in corridors on Smolenskaya Ploshchad [Foreign  Ministry] that the former Soviet republics are the sources of  "main threats" to Russia's interests. This was followed up with  another fundamentally new conclusion: Moscow's strategic task  consists in "preserving a military presence" in this region.  Because, as Kozyrev now believes, to pull out of the CIS  completely is just as absurd as to send tanks there. The  minister fears a strategic vacuum that could be filled by  unfriendly forces; he did not specify who he has in mind -- the  mujahedin in Tajikistan, the fundamentalists in the  Transcaucasus, the Romanian nationalists in Moldova, or even  NATO in the Baltics.    The head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry also touched on the  problems of an economic union in the CIS. Noting the risk  involved in hasty actions, he nonetheless gave a possible  appraisal of Russia's and Belarus' plans to merge their monetary  systems. It seems that the wish to get rid of the guilt complex  for the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements -- even at the price of  the ruble's destabilization -- is increasingly affecting the  politicians who remain in the government. Meanwhile the idea of  "Western liberalism" may be replaced, for instance, by the idea  of "putting together a quasi-USSR." It is too soon to say yet  which motives will prevail: The neighbors' overwhelming  attraction to NATO, the wish to win the electorate back from the  Liberal Democratic Party, or the intention to divert the  Russians' attention from the collapsed reforms.</p>

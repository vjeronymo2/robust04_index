A working committee would consist of two cabinet ministers,  Sok An from the Cambodian Peoples Party and Veng Sereivut from  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], and Khmer Rouge officials  Tep Khunnal and Chhuon Prasit, the prince said.    Sok An said he believed the meeting would take place soon,  as  the prince said the radical faction was eager to talk. But he  admitted that despite the progress toward negotiations, fighting  continued, although both sides were blaming the other as the  aggressor.    "In some places the Khmer Rouge take the iniative to attack  government positions and we have to defend ourselves," Sok An  said.    Thai military officials however told a different story,  saying government forces had attacked Khmer Rouge bases south of  the border town of Poipet in the third consecutive day of  clashes.    The information ministry acknowledged that government troops  were still "keeping pressure" on the guerrillas in the area  around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern  Siem Reap province.    "Our main aim is to defend government positions but that  does  not mean that we have to keep quiet. Sometimes we need to move  first," Sok An said.    To be discussed by both sides is King Norodom Sihanouk's  peace proposal, in which he suggests that "acceptable" Khmer  Rouge members will be given senior cabinet posts if the  guerrillas cease military activity, open their zones and merge  their fighters with the national army.    During a recent clandestine meeting between Khmer Rouge  nominal leader Khieu Samphan and Prince Ranariddh, both sides  agreed to set up the working committee to discuss the  implementation of the king's proposal. But the prince later  questioned the rebel leader's sincerity, after Khieu Samphan  would not first agree to a ceasefire.    "We are willing to end all problems by political means --  that's the government policy," said Sok An, adding that a  ceasefire was a priority. "But first we have to stop the killing  of the people."    But in a letter to Prince Ranariddh dated December 28, Khieu  Samphan complained that the peace plan was being jeopardised by  "a lot of political propaganda and military activities aimed at  destroying Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge)".    Another government minister admitted earlier a "political"  dimension to the upsurge in fighting. "It's normal," he said.  "When you start to negotiate, you have to put your weight in the  military side also."    Thai military officials reported some 300 troops backed by  two T-54 tanks attacked Khmer Rouge positions at Phum Kaedon,  forcing about 1,000 people to flee towards nearby Thailand. The  Thai army was on alert following the government's heavy mortar  and artillery attacks on the Khmer Rouge on Saturday.</p>

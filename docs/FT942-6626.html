			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Diplomatic diary dodges the issues - Malcolm Rutherford awaits conclusions from an ambassador dogged by late development MANDARIN by Nicholas Henderson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 517 pages Sir Nicholas Henderson has written a curiously old-fashioned diary about his life and times as a British Ambassador, all of them spent in relatively mainstream places - Warsaw, Bonn, Paris and Washington, in that order. The final entry, after his departure from Washington in 1982, notes suggestions from friends that he ought to have reached some conclusions: for example, on 'the conduct of diplomacy in the modern age'. He rejected the advice and ends with a French postcard featuring an ageing lion next to what looks like a shaggy dog. The caption is La retraite a 60 ans. Possibly the conclusions will come in another volume, for Henderson is a prolific writer and also a late developer. Mandarin drops a lot of names and a few clangers - like listening to jazz at the Reservation (sic) Hall in New Orleans. The book tells some good stories, several of them about Edward Heath. When the former prime minister arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris on his way to collect an honorary degree at the Sorbonne, the porter recognised him: 'Je vous connais, n'est-ce pas? Vous etes Mr Harold Wilson.' And when Henderson told Harold Macmillan that what Heath lacked was the influence of a good woman, Macmillan replied thoughtfully that a bad woman would be even better. Social details are carefully observed. The ambassador was not surprised to read that one of the few frivolous activities Margaret Thatcher had undertaken at Oxford was to learn ballroom dancing because he had already danced with her in Washington when Ronald Reagan failed to ask her. Some of the entries are more serious: for instance, a visit to Francois Michelin in Clermont-Ferrand. Probably no foreign diplomat had met the old tyre-maker before. Michelin told Henderson that the French problem was that the people were not inventive; the education system did not encourage it. Yet here there is a problem of a different kind. What was the ambassador doing in Clermont-Ferrand in the first place? Apparently he went out of his own admirable curiousity. Michelin had recently given an unprecedented interview to Paris Match about labour troubles at the plant: Henderson read it only afterwards. This late development dogged, possibly made, his career. When Henderson arrived as ambassador to Bonn in 1972, he reported to London that the German government 'now regarded the British government as the ally with whom they spoke first and whose views they expected to be closest to their own'. Some of us who were there at the time pointed out that he might be pushing it a bit. Yet it took several years - and a promotion to Paris - for him to realise that the Franco-German relationship (Brandt-Pompidou, then Schmidt-Giscard) would go on maturing. Like most of the British diplomats of his generation, he fails to address why they were none too keen on European union at the start. There are other lacunae. Henderson noted with surprise that some of the French regions have similarities with the German Lander. Doesn't the Foreign Office teach anybody anything, or don't young diplomats travel? He was also taken aback by the fact that Britain's integration with the European Community could be held up by exchange rates and the weakness of sterling - see his account of Heath's visit to Bonn in 1973. Later he learned from the experience. In his valedictory letter to the foreign office from Paris he wrote of how Britain's relative economic and industrial decline was bound to hamper the country's diplomacy. The report was published in The Economist, yet must have been perfectly obvious to anyone who had read the magazine (let alone the Financial Times) over the years. Still, it was greeted as a revelation and Henderson went on to Washington. Possibly he spent too long abroad. His remarks about the home country are frequently disparaging, if true. 'London,' he noted in 1982, 'with holes in the roads and piles of bricks and corrugated iron on many abandoned building sites, the warning lights half fused, has a third world look about it'. A decade earlier he had been scarcely aware of the three day week. His most illuminating comment on his role as an ambassador is that while he was in Paris nobody in London suggested he should do anything in particular. So he made up the job as he went along. He was a great success with people and one should not underestimate the ambassador's role as host, especially in Paris and Washington. But a final chapter on what it was all about and how to do better in future might help.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abhay Vaidya: "Clinton's Step To Repair Ties </F> With India"]    [Text] Washington, April 14--In an effort to repair his  relations with the Indian community in the United States, the  U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, in a letter to Mr Niranjan  Shah, a Chicago-based industrialist and trustee of the  Federation of Associations, has expressed strong support for  India's economic reforms.    He also praised the cooperation between the two countries in  science and technology, the United Nations' peace-keeping  operations in Somalia and Cambodia, formulating the  comprehensive test-ban treaty and the chemical weapons  convention.    Despite differences on some non-proliferation issues, we  have  worked together on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a  chemical weapons convention," Mr Clinton said in his letter of  March 29.    The tone and content of Mr Clinton's letter is significant  in  the light of recent fence-mending efforts by senior U.S.  officials like the deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott,  and the assistant secretary, Ms Robin Raphel.    Significantly, Mr Clinton refrained from making direct  references to the Kashmir issue.    He appreciated the efforts by private Indian organisations  and the Indian government in addressing important human rights  issues in the subcontinent, he wrote.    "Our concern about human rights are part and parcel of a  mature relationship between democracies," Mr Clinton said in his  letter, adding, "We recognise the important work done by Indian  private groups and individuals and the efforts by the government  to address human rights problems."    "We also encourage India to pursue peaceful solutions to  problems at home and abroad that have posed threats to the  security of that great nation," Mr Clinton said.    The President assured Mr Shah that the ties between India  and  the United States "are solid and that there is great potential  for further growth and cooperation between us."    Mr Shah told TOINS [Times of India News Service] that he was  concerned about the deterioration in Indo-U.S. relations after a  series of provocative statements last year by Ms Raphel.    In January he and some other prominent Indian-Americans from  Chicago met Ms Raphel to express their concern over her remarks  on Kashmir.    On February 28, Mr Shah brought Ms Raphel's remarks on  Kashmir to Mr Clinton attention when he visited Chicago in a  re-election bid by the Congressman, Mr Dan Rostenkowski.    During that meeting, Mr Shah said, the president made some  positive assurances with regard to the Indian-American community.    Interestingly, it was only a few months ago that the White  House had provoked a strong protest from Indians over Mr  Clinton's reply to a letter from a Washington-based Kashmiri  secessionist, Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai.    In a December 27 reply to Dr Fai Mr Clinton had said he was  "looking forward to working with you and others to help bring  peace to Kashmir."    These words had prompted an intense reaction in India and  among Indians in the United States.    After that controversy, the White House appears to have  restrained itself, seeking to prevent more controversies over  the U.S. position on the Kashmir issue.    This became apparent when Mr Clinton declined to reply to  the  Indo-American Kashmir Forum president, Dr Vijay K. Sazawal, who  had written to the president about the tragic plight of Kashmiri  Pandits in India.    Mr Sazawal's January 7 letter was passed on by the White  House to the U.S. State Department for a reply. Mr Ron D.  Lorton, director of the office of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka,  Maldives and Bhutan affairs, despatched a two-para reply saying:  "I share your concern about the human rights situation in  Kashmir, including the problems faced by the Kashmir Pandits. I  hope that peace can soon be restored to this beautiful but  troubled place."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] In an eventful session, the plenum of the  Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] approved the commissions  for the next legislature. Most of them will be headed by  representatives of the ruling alliance. The opposition factions  opposed this and even walked out of the session saying they had  been neglected.    The majority, with 39 votes, imposed their will on the  formation of the new ordinary commissions, thereby ensuring the  ruling party's supremacy in and control of the commissions.    The following members of the ruling alliance and allied  factions are commission presidents: Carlos Blanco, New Majority  Movement, Human Rights; Carlos Torres, New Majority Movement,  Constitution and Rules and Regulations; Jorge Velasquez, New  Majority Movement, Economy; Marta Chavez, New Majority Movement,  Supervision; Cesar Fernandez Arce, New Majority Movement,  Justice; Cesar Larrebure, We Are Independent, Agriculture; Celso  Sotomarino, Popular Christian Party, Production; Romulo Guerra,  Change 90, Health and Family; Jorge Figueroa, Change 90, Budget;  Rafael Rey, Renewal Movement, Education and Sports; Carlos  Reategui, New Majority, Energy; Genaro Colchado, Change 90,  Environment; Ricardo Marcenaro, New Majority Movement, Labor;  Luz Salgado, Change 90, Decentralization; Osvaldo Sandoval, New  Majority Movement, Foreign Relations; and Andres Reggiardo,  Change 90, Defense and Internal Order.    The opposition vigorously complained, primarily questioning  Roger Caceres' removal from the Human Rights Commission. The  ruling party was accused of removing and appointing minority  congressmen at will, while ensuring control of key commissions  for themselves. The opposition deputies subsequently left the  floor.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The list  of commissions has been approved without a quorum. They are  lying to the country and have continued the session without a  quorum. Whatever is approved here must be rejected, even through  legal action.    [Second unidentified congressman] I must stress that no  congressman has been denied participation in the commission of  his preference. The only difference is that the commissions in  which they are not chairmen they can be secretaries, but no one  has been neglected or denied participation in the commission of  his choice.    [Third unidentified congressman] I have taken note and there  are only three or four problem cases whose solutions depend on  agreements to be reached. We are only waiting for the cases to  be sent to us, and we will approve whatever is decided. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Audit committees Is the UK moving surreptitiously towards German-style two-tier boardrooms? The original Cadbury Report on corporate governance studiously avoided recommending the Teutonic approach. But the Audit Agenda, a discussion document published this week by the Auditing Practices Committee, recommends an expanded role for audit committees. The report proposes that these committees, typically comprising non-executive directors, should be beefed up to take on greater responsibility for monitoring aspects of management performance on behalf of shareholders. If adopted, the proposal would mean non-executives taking on a watchdog role, not dissimilar to that of the German supervisory board. The danger of this approach is that it could sow tension between executive and non-executive directors. It also threatens to divide the so-called unitary principle, established in UK company law, which lays down that the board as a whole is responsible for a company's affairs. As the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft shows, the problem with the German system is that in times of crisis it is not clear who has the ultimate responsibility for the company. In that case the supervisory board simply blamed the management for the debacle. Audit committees are a good thing insofar as they focus management attention on audits and internal controls. Their growing popularity since Cadbury helps correct some of the deficiencies of UK governance. But further expansion of their powers should not be at the expense of lower standards of accountability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] On 9 June, the Propaganda Department and the  Organization Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC  Committee, the Work Committee for Regional Government Organs,  and the Regional Bureau of External Propaganda held at the Tibet  People's Hall their second report meeting on the current  situation.    Cadres from propaganda and foreign affairs offices at and  above the county and department level and cadres from other  departments at and above the prefectural level attended the  report meeting.    The meeting was presided over by (Du Tai), executive deputy  director of the Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous  Regional CPC Committee. (Qu Jia), head of the Foreign Affairs  Office of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government, who  personally attended the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights  Committee, made a report to participants at the meeting on the  situation of the international struggle for human rights.    (Qu Jia) said: The Chinese delegation once again smashed the  scheme by the Western hostile forces and a small number of  separatists at the international meeting to split China. Facts  have once again proved that the force of righteousness will  eventually defeat those ulterior motives. At the 50th meeting  of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu Jia) used his personal  experience as a person of the Tibetan nationality to refute  unbridled rumors and intentional slanders against the human  rights situation in China's Tibetan region by a small number of  people.    (Qu Jia) said: Some representatives of nongovernment  organizations used rumors, which they themselves admitted to be  unproven hearsay, to fabricate and distort the human rights  situation in this autonomous region. They also cited documents  of the so-called Tibetan government in exile. Therefore, people  can easily see that their real intention was not their concern  for human rights but rather their activities to split China by  using the human rights issue.    What is the human rights situation in Tibet? Only the people  in Tibet are highly qualified to make statements on this issue.  People all know that Tibet is an inalienable part of China.  Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially since the  democratic reform in 1959, the human rights situation for the  broad masses of people in Tibet has undergone a fundamental  change. Great improvements have been made in economic and  social development. The people's living conditions have been  significantly improved. The customs and habits of people of  Tibetan nationality have been respected, and the policy of  freedom of religion has been fully implemented.    Various policies carried out in Tibet by the central  government, especially a series of special policies especially  formulated for Tibet in the last 10-odd years, have been greatly  supported by the broad masses of people of Tibetan nationality.  They have deeply realized that the past several decades have  been the best period concerning the human rights situation in  Tibet. The situation in Tibet can be seen by the people. If  people take a just stand, they can certainly see the overall and  genuine situation.    At the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu  Jia) pointed out that in 1993, in addition to the touring of  Tibet by some 30,000 foreigners and people from Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan, 344 people from 24 countries came to visit  and inspect the situation in Tibet, including leading members of  governments, parliaments, and political parties, as well as  reporters and officials of foreign embassies and consulates in  China. They have visited cities, villages, factories, schools,  hospitals, and temples in Tibet and have held extensive contacts  with people of various circles. After personally seeing the  situation in Tibet, they generally recognized development and  progress in Tibet. Even some people who had a considerable  prejudice against the situation in Tibet cannot but say that  only hearing a one-sided view on Tibet is not justifiable.    In presenting an introduction to the 50th meeting of the  World Human Rights Committee on China's nationalities policy,  (Qu Jia) emphatically pointed out that the Chinese Government  always adheres to the policy of equality for all nationalities  because this is a fundamental principle stipulated by the  Chinese Constitution. In China, people of all nationalities,  regardless of their total population, the extent of their social  and economic development, and differences in customs, religious  beliefs, and languages, all are equal in terms of their status  and all enjoy equal rights and benefits. The Chinese Government  has always made efforts to strengthen the unity and harmony of  people of various nationalities in the country. In formulating  political, economic, and social development policies, the  Chinese Governments has paid special attention to protecting the  rights of minority people. In handling nationality affairs  work, the government will extensively solicit opinions of  various related nationalities and do things through full  consultation. Meanwhile, through enacting laws and adopting  concrete measures, the government has guaranteed that people of  various minority nationalities can take part in the  administration of state and local affairs in various fields.    To help people of minority nationalities develop economic,  cultural, and other social undertakings and to catch up with  more developed regions as quickly as possible, the Chinese  Government has always attached great importance to providing  necessary assistance to minority peoples in terms of money,  supplies, and manpower. In formulating plans for the  development of the national economy, the Chinese Government has  always adopted a policy of giving preferential treatment to the  regions in which minority peoples reside. Meanwhile, the state  has required and encouraged developed areas to help regions in  which minority peoples reside, it has advocated mutual  assistance between regions, and it has implemented the system of  the regional autonomy of minority nationalities. The system of  regional autonomy is an important political system stipulated by  the Chinese Constitution to protect the rights and interests of  people of minority nationalities. In areas in which people of  minority nationalities reside, the state established autonomous  organs to enable minority people to exercise their rights to  administer the internal and local affairs of their own  nationality. According to related stipulations of the Chinese  Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on  National Regional Autonomy, the autonomous organs of various  autonomous areas are state organs of local political power. In  addition to the functions and power of other state organs of  various provinces and municipalities, those organs also have  autonomous power related to the political, economic, cultural,  education, and other fields. The implementation of this system  has protected various democratic rights of minority people and  has promoted development in various fields in regions in which  people of minority nationalities reside. China is a country  with a legal system. Through the legislation of related laws,  China has affirmed and protected the rights of minority people,  guaranteed the equal position of various nationalities, and  adjusted relations among various nationalities. At present,  China has enacted laws to protect people of minority  nationalities. These include nationwide laws such as the  Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on  National Regional Autonomy, and local laws and regulations on  self-autonomy formulated by various nationality autonomous  areas. The contents of those laws and regulations cover  minority people's political, economic, cultural, and educational  fields, as well as their languages and religious beliefs. It  can be said that China has in the main formed a legal system to  protect various rights and interests of people of minority  nationalities.    Facts speak louder than words. The practices over more than  four decades have proved that China's policy for nationality  affairs has achieved success. The international community will  not be deceived by the lies spread by a small number of people  in the world. Our government has always stressed and made great  efforts to promote the human rights of all Chinese people,  including the people of Tibetan nationality. The efforts and  achievements cannot be denied by some lies by those people.    The report made by (Qu Jia) won warm applause from the  participants.    At the report meeting, (Du Tai), executive deputy director  of  the propaganda department of the regional party committee,  emphatically pointed out: Although we have repeatedly foiled  the scheme of splitting the motherland by international hostile  forces and a small number of separatists at home and abroad, we  must not slacken our vigilance. We must strengthen our belief  in our cause and fully understand the protracted and complicated  nature of the struggle against separatism. We must not to the  slightest degree slacken in our efforts.</p>

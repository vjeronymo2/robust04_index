			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Polls mixed on backing for Perot TWO national public opinion polls released yesterday put Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate, first and last in the race for the US presidency. A Washington Post-ABC poll gave Mr Perot 34 per cent, President George Bush 31 per cent and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas 29 per cent. A CBS tally had Mr Bush in the lead with 35 per cent, against 27 per cent for Mr Clinton and 26 per cent for Mr Perot. The polls were published on the day of the final party primaries in six states, including California, the biggest. Since Mr Perot is on no ballot, only rough estimates of his popularity will be available through exit polling and, where allowed, in votes for uncommitted delegates. The write-in option is largely precluded. The Post-ABC survey, which said Mr Perot's lead was statistically insignificant nationally, is most interesting for its regional breakdown. It showed Mr Perot ahead in the west - followed by Mr Clinton and then Mr Bush  -and tied with the president in the north-east, where Mr Clinton trailed appreciably. However, the likely Democratic nominee led in the south, followed by Mr Perot and Mr Bush. In the mid-west Mr Bush held a small lead over Mr Perot with Mr Clinton third.</p>

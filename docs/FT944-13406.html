			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (4): The big sales are just beginning - Privatisation Mr Abderrahman Saaidi, Morocco's privatisation minister, insists: 'We are not selling the furniture.' But the country's plans for selling state holdings are unparalleled in their size and scope anywhere in Africa or the Middle East. A law allowing the sale of state interests in certain specified sectors was first passed in 1989. The earlier policy of Moroccanisation, abandoned in the late 1980s, was being thrown into reverse. But the programme began cautiously, circumscribed by evident political reservations. Activities such as the phosphate industry, public utilities, oil refining and the national flag-carrier Royal Air Maroc were at that stage clearly excluded. Privatisation did not get under way until 1993 with the sale of the government's stake in a yeast producer to French and Moroccan interests. The first major operation was the takeover of majority control of the biggest cement company, Cior, by Holderbank of Switzerland. To date, state shareholdings in 24 enterprises have been sold, bringing in revenues of some Dh3.5bn. By the end of next year, the whole of the initial list of 112 privatisable interests - 37 hotels and 75 companies - is due to have been transferred to the private sector, with proceeds expected to reach Dh17bn, or almost Dollars 2bn. These are out of a total of some 800 state companies, in part dating from French policies during the protectorate of 1912-1956, and accounting for about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product. A variety of formulas has been devised for the new balance of ownership, between foreign companies, Moroccan-based interests, employees and the stock market. In the sale of the CTM-LN bus company, a slice was reserved for Moroccans living abroad. In the distribution of petroleum products, the state has already sold all its holdings, with Shell and Mobil buying back the government's 50 per cent stake. have been counted as successes, with stock market offerings heavily oversubscribed. The government is expected to have little difficulty with the remainder of its list, except perhaps in finding buyers for textile factories which have recently been starved of orders. Eleven state holdings are currently on the market. Mr Saaidi, who recently went to London, Birmingham and Glasgow to present his plans and glean the benefits of the UK's experience in privatisation, says the big sales are just beginning. The biggest is the state's majority stake in Societe Nationale d'Investissement, a conglomerate which was used as a vehicle for Moroccanisation in the 1970s and which embraces 41 companies ranging from beer to banking and from consumer credit to chemicals. Mr Saaidi, a tax accountant by profession, says it would have taken too long to sell each interest individually. The government will place a further 16 per cent of the group on the stock market, where it is already traded, and is offering the remainder of its 67 per cent holding to a consortium, setting a floor price for the 51 per cent stake of Dh1.275bn (Dollars 143m). The buyers will be committed to putting part of that stake on the market within three years, with the idea that they will have this time to make alliances to establish majority control. The intended result of this complex set of conditions is that between 43 and 48 per cent of the shares will be traded on the Casablanca stock ex- change, with the current private sector partners holding 17 per cent and new partners 35 to 40 per cent. The new core shareholders must be companies domiciled in Morocco and must hold 35 per cent of the group for at least five years. Within that period, they will be allowed to restructure holdings, but not sell more than 15 per cent of book value of the portfolio each year, and must then reinvest at least 80 per cent of the proceeds in other non-real estate holdings. Also being sold, as one lot, are majority stakes in three sugar companies. Sugar producers' co-operatives are given the first option but may be unable to muster the funds. Still to be sold in the net few months are stakes of 35 to 99 per cent in Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, the Sonasid steel products company, newspaper distributor Sochepresse, gas storage company Somas, and Simef, a maker of diesel and electric motors. Meanwhile, a more ambitious phase is in preparation, opening up areas that were specifically ruled as being out-of-bounds in the initial plans, including public utilities with multi-billion-dollar investment needs which Morocco is in no position to cover without increasing its debt burden. Technocratic ministers such as Mr Saaidi argue that there are no longer any taboos about what can or cannot be sold. 'We have no complexes any more,' he says. 'Political and public opinion is ready to accept a widening of the scope of privatisation.' These plans include privatising the state telecommunications authority, which has a four-year Dollars 2bn programme to finance, and introducing competition in mobile telephone services. The state will also subcontract part of its electricity generating needs, almost certainly to foreign interests, with financing requirements in the industry estimated at some Dollars 3bn between public and private sectors. The new entrant will be required to manage two sites and build two more, selling the electricity to the state company which will remain the monopoly distributor. 'That does not mean it cannot change in the future,' says Mr Saaidi. Water supply is also a candidate for privatisation, although probably not until later on. And Royal Air Maroc is no longer considered off-limits. What is expected to remain firmly in state hands is the mining of phosphates through the Office Cherifien des Phosphates, as a strategic export sector. But plans are under discussion for hiving off production of phosphate derivatives to private concerns. At the same time, the government is exploring other options for bringing in private sector management through contractors and concessions. The message about entrepreneurship has sunk in deep. Even the running of the baths at the sumptuous new Hassan II mosque in Casablanca is being put out to contract.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of </F> Trade, before the annual congress of the International Union of  Producers and Distributors of Electricity in Birmingham:  "Liberalized Energy Market Vital for Europe"]    [Text] Speaking at the Annual Congress of the International  Union of Producers and Distributors of Electricity (UNIPEDE) in  Birmingham, Mr. Heseltine said:    ``Significant barriers to trade still remain. We in the UK  have been active in our support for liberalization of the energy  market in the European Union because we recognize that  competitive forces are needed to reduce costs and improve the  competitiveness of European industry. We have therefore been  disappointed at the slow progress which has been made on the  European Commission's efforts to establish an open internal  market in energy.    ``The Commission's proposal under discussion at present  represents the first step on the road to liberalization. I do  not underestimate the magnitude of the change which moving to a  competitive environment will mean for many countries. And it  will take time to carry out the restructuring needed. It is  therefore imperative that we make the start now and redouble our  efforts to reach agreement.    ``Because we all have so much to gain from liberalization, I  would like to take this opportunity to allay some of the fears  which have been expressed about opening up energy markets to  competition. I have heard it said that it will deter long-term,  large-scale investment by increasing uncertainty and thereby  risk. But our experience in the UK has proved quite the  reverse. Since 1989 investment in generation has almost trebled  in real terms. And investment in transmission is four times  what it was before privatisation.    ``Some also claim that national electricity systems must be  controlled and planned, otherwise they will become unstable with  wild swings between over-supply and under-supply. Again quite  the opposite has happened in the UK. The system is better  balanced than it was before with a more diverse range of primary  fuels being used in generation. The move towards gas fired  generation, which is so often portrayed by critics as an  unwelcome effect of privatisation has in fact played a major  part in bringing about the present diversity of the system.    ``And with diversity comes increased security of supply. If  European electricity networks were opened up and we had a true  single energy market this security through diversity could be  available to everyone. ``In the 40 years since this congress  was last held in the UK, electricity supply in this country has  been through a period of growth and more recently a period of  major structural and management change. We are proud of what  has been achieved here and are eager to share our experience.  In a world of increasingly open markets, liberalization in the  energy sector has much to offer.''</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: EU funding competition launched A new competition for projects to bid for European Union economic regeneration funds, called Regional Challenge, is to follow City Challenge and Rural Challenge, which were designed to help urban and rural areas in economic difficulty. Regional Challenge is related to money from the European Regional Development Fund, set up to help the EU's less prosperous areas. The government is promising prize money of Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m to an unspecified number of schemes, put together by local public-private-sector partnerships, in the first round of the competition. More competitions are to be held three years later.</p>

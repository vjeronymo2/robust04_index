"Literally they're moving out in convoys, not in individual  vehicles," said UN Spokesman Lt. Col Bill Aikman.    The pullout of Serb forces came soon after Russian announced  that it had persuaded the Serbs to comply with an agreement  concluded on February 9 with the United Nations forces and the  Muslim-led Bosnian army.    Aikman said that General Michael Rose, commander of the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFER) in Bosnia, "has received information  from senior levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will  have their equipment out of a 20-kilometer zone within 36 hours,  that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night."    On February 5, a mortar attack on a crowded market center in  Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed  68 people and injured over 200. Four days later, the NATO asked  all warring sides to withdraw from the area and issued an  ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on positions around  the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday.</p>

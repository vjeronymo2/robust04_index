			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis has called on  NATO to support the implementation of President Glavkos  Kliridhis' proposal to demilitarize Cyprus. In a letter to the  alliance's Secretary General Manfred Woerner, Mikhailidhis  points out that implementing the proposal would remove tension  and the danger of conflagration and create the appropriate  climate for effective negotiations on the Cyprus issue.    The letter also points out the negative Turkish position on  the confidence-building measures and stresses that the Greek  Cypriot side's goal remains finding a lasting Cyprus solution  through negotiation.    Mikhailidhis sent his letter on the occasion of the NATO  summit. He also says that the demilitarization proposal is  accompanied by the Cypriot Government's willingness to pay for  an increased UN peacekeeping force, since the main obstacle to a  lasting and viable solution is the presence of the Turkish  occupation troops in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis also recalls that the  UN secretary general, in his latest report to the Security  Council, stressed that the status quo in Cyprus was imposed  through the use of force and is being maintained with military  force.    Mikhailidhis asks that his letter be communicated to all the  NATO member states.</p>

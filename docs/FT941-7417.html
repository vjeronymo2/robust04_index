			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Restructuring costs British Gas Pounds 1.6bn British Gas yesterday counted the cost of losing its residential monopoly when it announced a Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge to pay for a corporate restructuring that will prepare it for future competition. The company said 5,000 more jobs would have to go on top of the 20,000 which it announced last year. The total number is equivalent to about a third of the workforce. But Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, would not rule out additional job cuts in future, even though the restructuring will reduce the company's cost base by Pounds 600m. He said some of the restructuring costs could be traced to government decrees that British Gas separate its storage and transportation business from its trading arm. But most of the restructuring was 'management driven to get us into a form in which we can succeed in competitive markets'. Mr Richard Giordano, the executive chairman appointed last year to help the company adopt a more competitive strategy, acknowledged that 'a restructuring of this magnitude will be painful for some'. But he noted that independent gas traders had captured 73 per cent of the firm contract market by the end of 1993, compared with 49 per cent a year earlier. Unions reacted to the job cuts by demanding that the government intervene to ensure that workers were not consigned to long-term unemployment. Mr Robin Cook, Labour party energy spokesman, called on British Gas not to make any compulsory redundancies. The heavy restructuring charges resulted in a net loss on an historical cost basis for the fourth quarter of Pounds 694m against a Pounds 234m profit the previous year. It dragged the full year figure into a loss of Pounds 285m, compared with a profit of Pounds 681m last time. Full year operating profits of Pounds 1.68bn (Pounds 1.66bn) before exceptional charges showed that the underlying business was stable. The restructuring charge was generally welcomed by analysts, who said it showed that British Gas was serious about cutting costs. British Gas shares fell 11p to close at 328p. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, revised its outlook on British Gas's long-term rating, citing continued uncertainty over future regulation.

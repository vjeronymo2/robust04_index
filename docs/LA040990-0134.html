			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL '90 PREVIEW;  </P> <P> ANATOMY OF A PITCH;  </P> <P> HOW SPIN AFFECTS FLIGHT  </P> <P> Over the years, there have been a number of theories on why pitches move the  way they do. One theory, in fact, contended that pitches don't break at all,  rather it is an optical illusion. However, researchers have more recently  concluded that aerodynamics play an integral part as the air, spin, speed and  direction of the ball from its release point all converge.  </P> <P> The underspin of a fastball (left) forces air downward, causing the ball to  rise on a wedge of built-up air while the spin helps to roll away air above the  ball.  </P> <P> Breaking pitches (right) utilize the same principles to gain sideways and  downward arc from the forward spin of the ball. The knuckler, which has very  little rotation, is unpredictable in its movement because it responds to  fluctuation air conditions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FASTBALL  </P> <P> Rising fastball, the Koufax specialty. Held across two wide seams (pitches held  across seams gain rotation and speed). Fairly straight, but rises because of  velocity and backspin. This is the standard fastball. Movement depends on  slight variations of grip and delivery. Speed is generated mostly from the  legs, the whipping motion of the arm, and wrist snap. "I'll take movement over  velocity," said Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski. "I'll take a guy who  throws 88 miles per hour with movement over a guy who throws 90, straight. Then  again, I'd like to work with the guy who throws 90."  </P> <P> Sinking fastball, a la Hershiser. Held with or across the two narrow seams,  with pressure applied by the index finger. Bites down and away because of  diagonal overspin created by staying on top of the ball. Can be run up and in  by change of hand angle.  </P> <P> Cut fastball: Overloading pressure of middle finger forces ball to sail in on  hitter. A left-hander uses it to pitch in on a right-handed batter, a  right-hander uses it to pitch in on a left-handed hitter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BREAKING PITCHES  </P> <P> Curve: Speed of the curve can be varied by arm speed and tightness of grip.  There are also a variety of grips and arm angles that alter the angle at which  the curve breaks. Almost all are thrown with topspin to create a downward break  as contrasted to a slider, which breaks across the plate. A straight overhand  curve of the Koufax variety has a limited strike zone because it generally  breaks between the waist and knees, producing more swinging strikes than called  strikes. Typically, curves are about 10 miles per hour slower than a fastball.  </P> <P> Slider: The slider is thrown by overloading the middle finger across the narrow  seams. It is thrown like a football with the arm speed of a fastball, good  extension and a snap at the end. A Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton specialty, it  produces the look of a fastball with a sharp break; down and in from a  right-hander to a left-handed batter; down and away from a right-hander to a  right-handed batter. Its speed is generally 4 to 5 miles per hour slower than  the fastball. A curve is generally 10 mph slower than the fastball with a  bigger arc than the slider.  </P> <P> Changeup: Thrown with the deceptive arm speed of a fastball. There are also  changeups thrown off the curve. velocity is altered by the grip. There are a  variety of changeups, including the palmball, three finger and circle change,  in which the index finger is curled inside the thumb and placed at the side of  the ball, with the middle, fourth and little fingers on top of the ball. Frank  Viola, who has one of the best changeups among active pitchers, throws a circle  change. The changup is used frequently by pitchers behind in the count, when  the hitter is sitting on the fastball. It is considered an 'out' pitch with the  goal of catching the hitter off balance and on his front foot, resulting in an  easy ground ball or pop-up. San Francisco Manager Roger Craig: "Unless you have  an overpowering fastball like Ryan or the movement of a Hershiser, you've got  to be able to throw a breaking ball or off-speed pitch when you're behind on  the count."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPLIT-FINGER  </P> <P> Thrown by placing the ball comfortably in the split between index and middle  fingers and delivered with a fastball motion. Some can throw it with the same  velocity of a fastball. For others, it is more of a changeup. Even if straight  it has the effect of an off-speed pitch since the hitter sees the same motion,  arm speed and rotation of the fastball, generally without the same velocity,  which, in turn, can produce a break that is reminiscent of a spitball -- the  ball, in the vernacular, dropping off a table. Those who dislike the  split-finger contend that constant use -- like with any other pitch -- seems to  deprive a pitcher of the velocity needed for his fastball when he needs his  best velocity in a strikeout situation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCREWBALL  </P> <P> The screwball is a breaking pitch that a right-hander can throw effectively to  a left-handed batter and a left-hander can throw effectively to a right-handed  batter because in those situations it breaks down and away from the hitter. The  ball is generally gripped without use of the seams, the thumb underneath and  the index and middle fingers together on top, the ball resting in the front  half of those fingers. It is delivered from a three-quarter or overhand motion  with an inward snap of the arm to create the reverse and off-speed break. It  had been the bread and butter pitch of Fernando Valenzuela. Among the pitchers  who throw it effectively, it often replaces the curve. However, it is  considered one of the most stressful pitches on the arm because of the reverse  motion and snapping the ball away from your body rather than with it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KNUCKLEBALL  </P> <P> Made famous by Hoyt Wilhelm and the Niekro brothers, it is a pitch that can be  thrown by people without strong arms, but requires extensive training to help  keep it under some control. The pitch is difficult to hit and just as difficult  to catch. It is generally held by digging the fingertips into the ball and  delivered almost with a pushing motion. The movement is inconsistent and speed  is as slow as 60 mph. On approach to the plate, the ball breaks at different  points, its movement is lateral and vertical and there is almost no spin on the  ball. However, like Charlie Hough, most pitchers who throw it successfully have  built up calluses on their fingertips, which help them dig into the ball  firmly.  </P></p>

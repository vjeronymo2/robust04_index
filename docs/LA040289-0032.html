			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY STRATEGY;  </P> <P> FOREIGN CADETS ARE EXPOSED TO AMERICAN IDEALS AT WEST POINT  </P> <P> The United States Military Academy is legendary for producing such all-American  war heroes as Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower. But  the "country" in West Point's motto "Duty, Honor, Country" does not necessarily  mean the United States.  </P> <P> For the last century, West Point has also been a training ground for future  generals of foreign armies -- dictatorships as well as democracies.  </P> <P> Soldiers such as Filipino Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the late Nicaraguan dictator  Anastasio D. Somoza and pre-revolutionary Chinese Army Gen. Ying Hsing Wen  marched out of West Point's storied Long Gray Line to play key historical  roles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 30 Foreign Cadets  </P> <P> This year's foreign plebes come from Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon, Liberia,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Malawi, Singapore, Jordan, Turkey and Zimbabwe.  Currently, 30 foreign cadets are training at West Point from Bangladesh, Haiti,  Senegal, Cameroon, Liberia and Botswana, among other places.  </P> <P> Once approved by the secretary of defense, a nation's politics or relations  with the United States are not considered in judging an applicant's merits,  says Capt. Robin Carrington, admissions officer for foreign cadets.  </P> <P> "We do not deal with philosophy," Carrington said. "We try to keep standards  for foreign cadets exactly the same as U.S. citizens."  </P> <P> There are cadets from countries ruled by hard-line dictators who do not  tolerate dissent or hold elections, as well as from countries with democratic  governments like that of the United States.  </P> <P> The purpose of educating foreign cadets at West Point, according to a  congressional report, is to build good will and expose future foreign military  leaders to American ideals, especially in developing nations where the United  States seeks to promote stability.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Similar Programs  </P> <P> Annapolis and the Air Force Academy have similar programs. By law, each  military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time. At the moment, the Air  Force academy has 37 and the naval academy 32.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students from selected countries to  attend the Air Force Academy and learn more about the way we do business in  this country and go back home with a first-rate military education and  hopefully be better allies," said Lt. Col. John Swiney, associate director of  admissions at the U.S. Air Force Academy.  </P> <P> Fidel Ramos graduated from West Point with honors in 1950. Thirty-six years  later, he played a pivotal role in the revolt that ended Ferdinand E. Marcos'  20-year reign in the Philippines and put Corazon Aquino in power.  </P> <P> Ramos developed friendships with West Point classmates who went on to powerful  posts in the U.S. military, including Charles Gabriel, an Air Force chief of  staff, and John Wickham, who became the U.S. Army's chief of staff.  </P> <P> Ramos is now Philippine defense secretary and one of his country's most popular  figures. A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, Ramos is using his education  to fight a communist insurgency and quell coups in the Philippines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Benefits for Countries  </P> <P> Natee Wongissares, a senior from Bangkok, Thailand, agrees that both countries  have benefited from Thailand's cadets at West Point.  </P> <P> "In the future these people (West Point graduates) have a tendency toward the  United States," the Thai cadet said. "They can affect the relationship between  the two countries for a better relationship, they will work together."  </P> <P> Unstable political climates in some Third World countries, where change is more  apt to take the form of a coup than a democratic vote, have created unusual  situations for West Point graduates.  </P> <P> Capt. Moises Cortizo, Class of 1980, is a loyal aide to Panamanian strongman  Manuel A. Noriega, at odds with the United States since his indictment by an  American grand jury on drug trafficking charges last year.  </P> <P> Ricardo Ernesto Castro, Class of 1973, sought political asylum in the United  States after testifying before Congress about his activities as a leader of a  Salvadoran death squad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Somoza a Graduate  </P> <P> Anastasio D. Somoza, son of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, was given  command of the Nicaraguan national guard when he graduated from West Point in  1946. He went on to succeed his father as president before the Sandinista  revolution ended that regime.  </P> <P> West Point's first foreign cadets came from South America, but the program has  expanded virtually worldwide. Countries with cadets at West Point are no longer  necessarily U.S. allies.  </P> <P> Soviet cadets may enter West Point classrooms next fall under a program  approved by the Ronald Reagan Administration allowing West Point and Soviet  military academies to exchange cadets for two-week visits.  </P> <P> American cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at a foreign  military academy in one of more than 30 countries including Venezuela, Jordan,  Belgium, Morocco, the Dominican Republic and Japan.  </P> <P> Of more than 70 nations invited, 25 to 30 send applications. Many of America's  strongest allies do not send cadets to West Point. NATO member countries are  invited but don't participate, although a Canadian midshipman is attending the  naval academy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Designated Spaces  </P> <P> Foreign cadets don't compete against American candidates, says academy  spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger. "These spaces are specifically designated for  non-American cadets. They have to meet the same basic criteria as a cadet here  would."  </P> <P> At West Point all cadets eat the same food, adhere to the same dress code, take  the same courses and meet the same requirements for graduation.  </P> <P> In addition to chemistry, engineering and science courses, they can study the  history of technology and warfare, the American experience in Korea and  Vietnam, space mechanics, terrain analysis, military computer systems, military  ethics and nuclear reactor design.  </P> <P> "They are usually very, very serious students and good students. Depending on  where they are from, some struggle with English," Carrington said.  </P> <P> Some have more than a language barrier to overcome.  </P> <P> Carrington recalls one cadet from an African tribe who had never flown on an  airplane until he came to West Point. He had only heard about water coming out  of the walls, but had never seen or taken a shower and had to be shown how to  drink out of a soda can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Culture Shock  </P> <P> "There is some culture shock, especially in the beginning," Carrington said.  </P> <P> Otherwise, foreign cadets are not so different from American boys who grow up  dreaming of going to West Point.  </P> <P> In Bangkok, Natee Wongissares dreamed of becoming a West Point cadet. "It was  my life goal since I was 12 to get to West Point," he says. "Since I saw a  movie about Eisenhower when he was a general, I wanted to be just like him."  </P></p>

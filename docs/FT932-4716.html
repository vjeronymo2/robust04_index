			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Progress continues on plans for a nuclear waste repository Sir, Bronwen Maddox ('Storing up long-term doubts', June 4) suggests that this company's plans for a nuclear waste repository are 'stalled'. In fact we are making steady progress. In April, Cumbria County Council granted planning permission for an extensive array of monitoring and geotechnical boreholes at our Longlands Farm site near Sellafield. Once we have initial results from that drilling, early next year, we will be able to finalise a planning application for our proposed rock characterisation facility, or 'rock laboratory'. The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, in its latest annual report, reiterated its welcome for our plans for that underground facility. As we stated last autumn, work in the rock laboratory will be essential to develop the 'unequivocal evidence' on hydrogeological conditions to which the committee's report has referred and which we and the safety regulators will need before waste disposal could begin. Neither are repository costs 'unknown'. The NAO itself has reported current best estimates of undiscounted lifetime costs in the region of Pounds 3bn. Tighter estimating will follow as improving knowledge of the site allows us to undertake more detailed engineering studies - keeping within known technology and aiming at minimum cost. While the cost of underground disposal is high in absolute terms it is small in relation to the quantity of nuclear electricity generated. Thus, a Pounds 3bn cost would be equivalent, even in the crudest undiscounted terms, to only about a tenth of a penny per kWh of nuclear power generated since the l950s and up to 2030. Inevitably, there are uncertainties over precise timing of our programme - as our published plans acknowledge. These reflect the scientific realities of the step-by-step approach necessary for a confident and cost-effective evaluation of site suitability and also the constraints of the planning system. But, with a flexible strategy and the necessary resources committed on the ground, we are maintaining momentum to make early deep disposal a reality, as government policy requires.

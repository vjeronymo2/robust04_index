			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Bn: "Official Visit by the President of the </F> Chinese Parliament in Switzerland: Meeting with Stich and  Cotti"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern 23 Jan -- Qiao Shi, PRC NPC [National People's  Congress] president, began a four-day official visit in  Switzerland on Sunday [23 January]. On Monday he will meet Otto  Stich, president of the Confederation, and Flavio Cotti, chief  of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. At the heart of  the talks will be bilateral economic relations and the question  of Tibet. Two associations have protested against the visit of  the former head of secret police.    Qiao Shi was received at Kloten Airport by Ricardo Jagmetti,  president of the State Council. Besides economic relations  between the two countries, the question of Tibet will probably  be tackled, as John Clerc, secretary general of the Federal  Assembly, indicated.  <H5>  CERN and Chillon Castle </H5>   The president of the Chinese NPC will be welcomed on Monday  by Federal Counselors Otto Stich and Flavio Cotti as well as by  Gret Haller, president of the National Council. On Tuesday, Mr.  Qiao will visit CERN [European Organization for Nuclear  Research] in Geneva and Chillon Castle, both in the French part  of Switzerland. He concludes his visit on Wednesday with a stop  at the federal polytechnic school.    Mr. Qiao, 69, is considered the third most powerful man in  the Beijing regime. A member of the Politbureau permanent  committee, he is also a former head of the secret police.    The visit by the president of the Chinese NPC has already  resulted in protests. The Swiss German central PEN-Club, which  protested on Saturday, stated that Qiao Shi is one of the  principal authorities responsible for the bloody human rights  repressions in China during the last decade.    The central PEN-Club points to thousands of people,  including  many writers, who have been imprisoned in China without judicial  procedure.    They add that economic interests do not justify inviting  Qiao  Shi to Switzerland.  <H5>  Colonialist and Soldiers </H5>   On Friday, the association "Tibetan Youth in Europe" had  asked the Federal Council to discuss the violations of human  rights in Tibet with Qiao Shi. Due to the colonization politics  and to the reinforcement of the Chinese military presence, 6  million Tibetans are now confronted with 7 million Chinese  colonialists and soldiers, the association stated.    The last visit to Switzerland by a high level Chinese  visitor  was in January 1992, when State Council Premier Li Peng had a  talk with Confederation President Rene Felber and with Public  Economic Chief Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. During that meeting, some  200 Tibetans and members of human rights organizations held a  demonstration.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Clear and velvet tones at their best Sir, I am writing to protest at your music critic's review of Kathleen Battle's recital with the Philharmonia ('Battle with the Philharmonia', October 14). To say that her rendering of Mozart's Exultate Jubilate was 'a boring vocal display' is both grossly unfair and pitifully inaccurate. It is well known that Miss Battle does not have a loud booming voice. I was sitting quite far back in the hall and I was apprehensive that I might not hear well. However, I found that I could hear her quite clearly. The piece was sung with on abundance of subtle tone colours. Far from 'one mezzo-forte-ish dynamic' she maintained a beautifully controlled and sustained fortissimo which was never harsh and strident. She sang with an apparently effortless mastery of the music which left the audience in a state of joyful bliss - as was evidenced by the prolonged and enthusiastic applause. It is to Andre Previn's credit that he composed his song cycle Honey and Rue for Battle's voice. The result was truly magnificent. We were treated to a display of her velvet tones at their best, full of light and shade, and great warmth: a heavenly interpretation with its high point the fourth song 'Do you know him' which, far from calling for 'earthiness', requires and was rendered with a beautiful timeless ethereal quality. Only a very unmusical person could fail to be moved. It is indeed sad when such great artistry is so ill received and unrecognised. Gail Chan, 31 Norland Square, London W11 4PU</p>

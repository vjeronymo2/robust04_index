			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LANCASTER WOMAN PULLED FROM FIRE  </P> <P> Two neighbors who found an elderly Lancaster woman standing in a daze in her  burning apartment and pulled her to safety probably saved her life,  firefighters said today.  </P> <P> Anna Mae Ray, 68, was in stable condition at Lancaster Community Hospital,  where she was treated for smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> Neighbors Sammy Ramos, 44, and Ray Valencia, 46, acted quickly at about 5 p.m.  Sunday when they saw smoke pouring from Ray's apartment in a single-story  duplex in the 45000 block of North Fig Street.  </P> <P> Valencia used a garden hose to fight the flames while Ramos made his way  through the smoke and found Ray standing near the fire, which was apparently  caused by a cigarette left burning on a coffee table.  </P> <P> "The fire was cooking pretty good," Ramos said. "She was very confused, kind of  disoriented. I grabbed her by both arms, turned her around and just kind of  walked her out."  </P> <P> The fire caused about $45,000 damage, firefighters said.  </P></p>

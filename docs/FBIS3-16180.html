			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 11, BNS -- The Latvijas Gaze (Latvian  Gas) statestock company is unable to pay its 23-million-U.S.  dollar debt to Russia's Gazprom by April 1.    The repayment deadline is included in the March 5 contract  between Latvijas Gaze and Gazprom on Russian gas supplies to  Latvia in 1994.    The enterprise will not be able to pay the debt on time  because a World Bank credit may be delayed.    As reported, the Latvian Government allowed Latvijas Gaze to  use the Japanese Import-Export Bank's credit, part of a G-24  credit to Latvia, to fulfill its obligations to Gazprom.    The debt of the CIS and the Baltic states to Gazprom in 1993  constituted 4 billion U.S. dollars.    On the other hand, consumers owe Latvijas Gaze 44 million  U.S. dollars. The largest debtors are Latvenergo (Ls 11,000)  and Sloka papermill (Ls 3,200).    Latvijas Gaze sued more than 80 enterprises to the Economic  Court. The court has ruled in all cases in favor of Latvijas  Gaze but the debtors fail to fulfill the court rulings.</p>

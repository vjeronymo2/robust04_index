EPA is changing the present definition of the glycol ethers category to exclude the high molecular weight glycol ethers that do not, in EPA's judgement, meet the criteria set out in EPCRA section 313(d). This redefinition of the glycol ethers category, which is based on EPA's review of available human health data on short-chain length glycol ethers, eliminates the EPCRA section 313 reporting requirements for those glycol ethers known as surfactant glycol ethers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule is effective June 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Maria J.

Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Statutory Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action is issued under section 313(d) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11023, ``EPCRA''). EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using toxic chemicals to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA published guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action becomes effective immediately. Thus, the last year in which facilities had to report releases of high molecular weight glycol ethers now excluded from the list was 1993, covering releases that occurred in 1992. The effect of this category redefinition is that, since the high molecular weight glycol ethers being excluded from the category will not be on the section 313 list when facilities report in 1994 for releases that occurred in 1993, these reports and all subsequent reports need not include release data for these glycol ethers. Facilities will therefore not have to collect release information for any releases of the excluded glycol ethers that occurred during the 1993 reporting year or for any releases that occur in the future. Section 313(d)(4) provides that ``[a]ny revision [to the section 313 list] made on or after January 1 and before December 1 of any calendar year shall take effect beginning with the next calendar year. Any revision made on or after December 1 and before January 1 shall take effect beginning with the calendar year following the next calendar year.'' The Agency interprets this delayed effective date provision to apply only to actions that add chemicals to the section 313 list. For deletions, the Agency may, in its discretion, make such actions immediately effective. An immediate effective date is authorized, in these circumstances, under 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(1) since a deletion from the section 313 list relieves a regulatory restriction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the purpose behind the section 313(d)(4) effective date provision is to allow facilities adequate planning time to incorporate newly added chemicals to their Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) release data collection processes. A facility would not need additional planning time to not report releases of a given chemical. Thus, a reasonable construction of section 313(d)(4), given the overall purpose and structure of EPCRA _ to provide the public with information about chemicals which meet the criteria for inclusion on the section 313 list _ is to apply the delayed effective date requirement only to additions to the list. Where the Agency has determined, as it has with the excluded glycol ethers, that a chemical does not satisfy the criteria of section 313(d)(2)(A)&hyph;(C), no purpose is served by requiring facilities to collect release data or file release reports for that chemical, or, therefore, by leaving that chemical on the section 313 list for any additional period of time. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that section 313(d)(4) was intended to apply to deletions as well as additions; indeed, such a construction would be incongruous, since deleted chemicals, by definition, do not satisfy the criteria for being on the section 313 list and their deletion from that list should not be delayed in the absence of any compelling reason to the contrary. This construction of section 313(d)(4) is also consistent with previous rules deleting chemicals from the section 313 list. Indeed, the Agency has not given any of its rules deleting chemicals from the section 313 list the delayed effective dates specified in section 313(d)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not deleted all glycol ethers from reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313. Reporting will still be required for those glycol ethers which meet the revised definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Description of the EPCRA Section 313 Glycol Ethers Category <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36180), EPA issued a proposed rule to redefine the glycol ethers category on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA has evaluated the current scope of the section 313 glycol ethers category and believes that it is overly broad. The existing category includes substances that traditionally have not been considered glycol ethers. Also, it is apparent that this category contains members that do not meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for listing. EPA has reviewed the current glycol ethers category and is redefining it to exclude the surfactant glycol ethers. Surfactant glycol ethers are those glycol ethers with pendant alkyl groups which typically consist of eight or more carbon atoms (i.e., high molecular weight glycol ethers). However, EPA does not believe that the category can be more narrowly defined at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's revised glycol ethers category for which section 313 reporting is required, consists of those glycol ethers which meet the following definition:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Certain Glycol Ethers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> R - (OCH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  - OR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> n = 1, 2, or 3;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R = alkyl C7 or less, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R = phenyl or alkyl substituted phenyl;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R' = H or alkyl C7 or less; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OR' consisting of carboxylic acid ester, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, or sulfonate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rationale for Redefinition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's concerns for the included chemicals is based on a review of available human health data on short-chain length glycol ethers. Specifically, EPA believes that these chemicals meet the criterion of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) because the individual members of this category can be reasonably anticipated to cause one or more of the following effects: Kidney toxicity, liver toxicity, adverse blood effects, adverse central nervous system effects, reproductive effects, and developmental effects. EPA believes that the category can be redefined to exclude those glycol ethers known as surfactant glycol ethers because these high molecular weight glycol ethers do not meet the listing criteria in section 313(d)(2)(A) or (B). None of the chemicals in the current glycol ethers category meet the toxicity criterion of section 313(d)(2)(C) based on their ecotoxicity. EPA's rationale for this redefinition is detailed in the proposed rule and is based on the Agency's review of various relevant materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received 11 comments on the proposed rule, all in support of the proposed redefinition of the glycol ethers category. However, several of the commenters expressed the opinion that the proposed rule does not narrow the definition sufficiently, and that EPA should consider a further narrowing of the definition in the future. As discussed below, EPA does not believe that it currently has sufficient data to further narrow the category definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Propylene Glycol Ethers Panel, and CMA Ethylene Glycol Ethers Panel, stated that the name of the category should be changed to ``certain glycol ethers'' to more accurately characterize the chemicals that are within the category. EPA has incorporated this comment, since this category does not consist of all chemicals that contain the glycol ether functionality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, General Electric, suggested that the definition should not identify reportable glycol ethers by molecular structure. Instead, the commenter recommended listing the glycol ethers of concern individually, and identifying those which must be reported on an individual basis. All remaining glycol ethers would then be reported in an aggregate form. EPA believes this approach to defining the category is inappropriate and unnecessary. EPA has identified by molecular formula a specific group of glycol ethers having a common structure that pose similar hazards. EPA currently believes that the most appropriate way to report on this group of glycol ethers is in aggregate by category. A listing of glycol ethers as proposed by the commenter may exclude from reporting certain glycol ethers within the scope of the definition in this rulemaking that meet the section 313(d)(2) criterion. Therefore, EPA is adopting the redefinition of the glycol ethers category based on a molecular structure formula. A reporting facility must make aggregate reporting threshold and estimated release determinations for all glycol ethers in the category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Soap and Detergent Association proposed that the revised definition exclude sulfonate in the category of OR' because ``carbon sulfur bonds are not easily broken and, therefore, sulfonates are not readily hydrolyzable from surfactants.'' EPA proposed the inclusion of sulfonate not because of the possible reaction at the carbon sulfur bond in the sulfonate, e.g., desulfonation of aromatic sulfonates, but rather because the sulfonate ion is a reactive leaving group and thus can reasonably be anticipated to be hydrolyzed to yield a glycol ether of concern. Specifically hydrolysis of R-(OCH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (where R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is any organic substituent) yields R-(OCH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OH and R''SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OH. Therefore, EPA reaffirms its inclusion of sulfonate as an appropriate member in the category of OR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0254 grid5678 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chemical Manufacturers Association stated that the category should be limited to four specific ethylene glycol ether solvents: 2-Methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, and their acetates. As stated in the proposed rule, with respect to the glycol ethers and developmental effects, there is evidence that the toxicity is reduced going from the methyl to the butyl ether. However, data for other toxic effects on glycol ethers with pendant alkyl groups of one to seven carbons or a phenyl group do not indicate a trend towards increased toxicity based on chain length for other toxic effects. Low molecular weight ethylene glycol ethers disturb the hemopoiesis and the blood picture at low doses. Hemolysis has been reported in varying degrees for ethylene glycol ethers of one to five carbons in the alkyl chain. The optimum alkyl chain length for hemolysis is four carbons. 2-Phenoxyethanol has also been found to cause intravascular hemolysis. Therefore, the concerns for ethylene glycol ethers are not limited to the four specific compounds mentioned by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, EPA requested comment on whether the definition of R' should include only straight chained alkyl groups of seven of fewer carbons or both straight and branched alkyl groups of seven or fewer carbons. No comments on this issue were received. Therefore, the definition of R' will include both straight and branched alkyl groups of seven or fewer carbons. Rochester Midland, Soap and Detergent Association, Henkel Corporation, and Union Carbide Corporation asked that the definition also exclude alkylated phenols containing seven or more carbon atoms. As stated in the proposed rule, 2-phenoxyethanol is known to cause hemolysis. No data have been found for alkyl substituted phenoxyethanol derivatives. Henkel Corporation stated that ``[t]he C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  alkyl phenol ethoxylates have also been used for many years as surfactants. There is no evidence that they present adverse human effects such as those which caused the listing of the glycol ether category or would otherwise meet the section 313 criteria.'' However, this commenter did not supply data to substantiate this assertion. The Soap and Detergent Corporation provided two studies to support its position (Smyth and Calandra, 1969; Dudek and Ribelin, 1988). Neither of these studies specifies the composition of the test material by number of ethylene oxide units. The commenter did provide the typical weight percent of the test substances as sold in commerce. Even if EPA assumed these typical compositions represent the test materials of these two studies, the dose levels presented in the studies would not be considered adequate to establish the lack of toxicity associated with ethylene glycol ethers with alkyl groups consisting of seven or greater carbon atoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because only phenoxyethanol has been tested for systemic toxicity, change in the glycol ethers category definition which would exclude alkylphenol ethoxylates is not supportable, based on the available data. To evaluate the alkylphenol ethoxylates subcategory of the ethylene glycol ether category, EPA would require subchronic toxicity data for one or more specific members of the category (e.g., 2-nonylphenoxyethanol). In the absence of these data, the Agency believes that the glycol ethers category should continue to include these substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Electric contended that individual glycol ethers should be listed in lieu of a category because EPCRA section 313 ``clearly states that additions to the EPCRA section 313 list must be done on a chemical-by-chemical basis. Each statutory provision that deals with revising the section 313 list speaks only in terms of a chemical-by-chemical basis, and EPCRA is silent on the issue of regulating by chemical categories.'' The Agency believes that the statutory authority to add ``a chemical'' to the list may be reasonably interpreted to include the authority to add groups or categories of chemicals to the list, particularly in light of the fact that the original list adopted by Congress in section 313(c) of EPCRA included 20 chemical categories. These consist mostly of metal compounds categories, but also include categories of organic chemicals, such as glycol ethers (as noted in the proposed rule, Congress listed this category without a delimiting definition). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Electric further contended that Congress listed ``glycol ethers'' in addition to the two individually listed glycol ethers, ``2-methoxyethanol'' and ``2-ethoxyethanol,'' to allow facilities the option of aggregating the releases of the two individually listed glycol ether chemicals and filing one TRI Form R report for ``glycol ether'' rather than two separate Form R reports. EPA does not accept this interpretation of Congress' intent in listing 20 chemical categories on the original EPCRA section 313(c) list of chemicals subject to TRI reporting. There is no clear statement of Congressional intent to adopt the type of ``optional'' reporting scheme advocated by General Electric. Indeed, the legislative history cited by General Electric supports EPA's current interpretation and implementation of EPCRA's reporting structure, i.e., persons manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using more than one member of a chemical category above the applicable reporting threshold may report the releases of all such chemicals, in the aggregate, on a single Form R report, rather than listing data separately for each chemical in the group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, contrary to General Electric's contention, several of the original chemical categories did not have corresponding ``individual'' chemicals listed on the original (CAS number specific) section 313(c) list. In their comments, General Electric acknowledged this to be the case only with regard to the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) category. However, there was no individual listing for any barium compounds, cadmium compounds, chromium compounds, or several other metal compounds in the original list transmitted to EPA by Congress. See 53 FR 4500; February 16, 1988. Taken to its logical conclusion, General Electric's interpretation would result in no reporting of any members of the PBBs category unless and until EPA listed individual members of that category. EPA does not believe that this would be consistent with Congress' intent in listing this category on the initial section 313(c) list. If Congress had intended to include category listings as an optional method of reporting individually listed chemicals, it could have clearly stated so in the statute. At a minimum, some members of all the listed chemical categories would have been included in the CAS number specific list. In sum, EPA believes that its interpretation of the category reporting structure is a reasonable reading of EPCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Electric objected to the continued listing of a glycol ethers category because categories are difficult for EPA to administer and/or for the public and industry to understand. In addition, the commenter contended that industry compliance with reporting and supplier notification requirements is more difficult for categories, such as glycol ethers, because facilities are not provided with discrete chemical names and Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers. The commenter contended that these problems are magnified in the case of the glycol ethers category because the category is defined by molecular structure formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the glycol ethers category consists of chemicals that are similar chemically and in potential effect, EPA believes that this category will not be difficult for the public or industry to understand or for the Agency to administer. The Agency will work with the public and the regulated community to develop, as appropriate, any interpretations and guidance the Agency determines are necessary to facilitate accurate reporting for the ``certain glycol ethers'' category. The Agency does not believe that the glycol ethers category is unique in that it is defined by molecular structure formula. All of the metal compound categories are defined based on molecular structure formula, i.e., to be considered a member of a metal compound category, the compound must consist of the parent metal and at least one substituent group. Both the chlorophenols and cyanide compound categories are defined by molecular structure formulas on the EPCRA section 313 list. EPA believes that defining the category by molecular structure formula ensures that all members of the category that meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria are included and thus reportable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters, the Soap and Detergent Association, Proctor and Gamble Co., and Union Carbide contended that EPA should be consistent between EPCRA and TSCA on its treatment of identical materials. Union Carbide cited the TSCA section 8(b) Inventory provisions. EPA believes that the differing treatment of glycol ether species with a low degree of ethoxylation under EPCRA and TSCA is appropriate given the differing purposes and standards of TSCA section 8(b) and EPCRA section 313. TSCA is concerned with the regulation of unreasonable risks to human health and the environment posed by chemical substances and mixtures in commerce; the section 8(b) Inventory, with few exceptions, provides a list of those chemical substances and mixtures. For purposes of developing an inventory of chemical substances in commerce, it is less important to specify whether those substances consist of a discrete species, e.g., chloroform, or a species with a range of molecular weights. EPCRA's goal is to provide the general public with a broad range of information on releases of certain chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under TSCA, for example, glycol ether surfactant ``mixtures'' are considered as a single entity for purposes of entry on the Inventory; however, for purposes of reviewing the potential health or environmental unreasonable risks posed by activities involving such chemical substances, the impacts of their various components would be considered. Because the intent of EPCRA section 313 is community right-to-know, EPA wants to ensure that the public has access to information on each listed toxic chemical or chemical category to which the public could be exposed, regardless of whether it is in a mixture. Therefore, where a surfactant contains species with a low degree of ethoxylation that fit the glycol ether category definition, EPA requires that those chemicals be reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Union Carbide also contended that ``[a]s a legal matter, the current and proposed definitions exclude polymers from the category of glycol ethers. Since polymers potentially include their low molecular weight species (n = 1, 2, 3), the exemption for polymers precludes the need to report low molecular weight species under [s]ection 313.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees with Union Carbide's conclusion regarding species with low degrees of ethoxylation. The proposed definition being finalized today continues to exclude polymer molecules (i.e., those molecules which include at least four covalently linked subunits at least two of which are internal subunits), and to include low molecular weight glycol ethers with a low degree of ethoxylation. The change in regulatory text deleting the phrase ``polymers are excluded from this category,'' does not change EPA's position regarding the scope of the glycol ethers category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, stated support for the proposal to change the definition of glycol ethers on other EPA lists. Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred to affect the definition or regulatory requirements for glycol ethers under any statute or EPA program other than the Toxic Release Inventory reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313 and the Pollution Prevention Act section 6607. Specifically, the redefinition of glycol ethers on the EPCRA section 313 list does not in any way alter their definition under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. section 7412(b) as amended, or, by virtue of their status as ``hazardous air pollutants'' (HAP) under the CAA, as ``hazardous substances'' under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C section 9601(14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  VI.

Regulatory Assessment Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this final rule is not ``significant'' and therefore not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 372 exempts certain small businesses (specifically, those facilities with fewer than 10 full-time employees) from reporting. This exclusion exempts about one-half of all manufacturing facilities in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 from section 313 reporting. Additionally, facilities which manufacture or process less than 25,000 pounds or otherwise use less than 10,000 pounds of these chemicals annually are not required to report for these chemicals. Thus, many small facilities will not incur any regulatory costs in association with this rule. Small businesses are not expected to be adversely affected by this rule, since the rule would increase the likelihood that they would not be required to report glycol ether releases. Therefore, EPA certifies that this rule is not likely to significantly impact small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are no unique reporting requirements associated with this final rule because it redefines the glycol ethers category to exclude certain high molecular weight glycol ethers from reporting under section 313. Reporting of chemicals that are subject to section 313 has been approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and has been assigned the OMB control  number 2070&hyph;0093. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for section 313 chemicals is estimated to average 43 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. This rule's redefinition will reduce the number of responses required, thus reducing overall burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Community right-to-know, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Toxic chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lynn R.

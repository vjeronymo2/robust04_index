			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Habit Hannashi: "Government-Opposition Contacts </F> Have Not Yet Begun"]    [Text] Officials of some of the major parties have  announced that contacts between the political parties and the  government have not yet revived. Responsible sources in Hamas,  the Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA), and the National  Liberation Front (FLN) said that contacts might not begin before  the new president announces the broad outlines of the policy he  will follow.    Liamine Zeroual has not yet spoken. He has not addressed the  nation in the week since his appointment as head of state.  However, the president may address the nation on Tuesday, 8  February. Some sources say that Zeroual will deliver his "second  speech to the nation" before 9 February, the second anniversary  of the declaration of the state of emergency.    The big political parties that boycotted the conference say  they are waiting for concrete political measures that will help  begin serious dialogue and restore civil peace. This is the  basic demand before the government now.    Officials in National Human Rights Watch, the organization  directly concerned about such measures to calm the situation,  say that they "have made steps in this direction and are  awaiting a response from the authorities." However, they did not  clarify the nature of these measures and instead denied knowing  of any amnesty measures that the government has taken or is in  the process of taking.    As for contacts with the FIS, signs of relief are becoming  increasingly clear. In an interview with AL-WATAN, Youcel El  Khatib said that the FIS has accepted the principle of dialogue  and has agreed to participate in bringing the country out of the  crisis and ending the bloodshed. This statement agrees  completely with the "declaration against violence" that the  overseas FIS parliamentary delegation signed on Sunday. In a  similar interview with the daily AL-MUJAHID, El Khatib said that  the dialogue with FIS representatives was positive and that the  FIS personalities enjoyed credibility and were representative of  the party's base, even if the dialogue did not specifically  involve Ali Benhadj and Abassi Madani. According to El Khatib,  "members who are founders and officials of the FIS can be found  among these personalities," but he refused to give the  names--"for security reasons," as he said.    It appears that the crisis of representation latent in the  parties, including the FIS, will find a solution. In the wake of  progress regarding relations with the FIS, El Khatib expressed  the hope that the major parties would participate in forming the  transitional National Assembly of 170 seats to be split between  the political parties and the associations.</p>

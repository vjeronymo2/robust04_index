			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Who's next in Italy's probe of corruption?: As more arrests are made, it is feared democracy may be undermined ITALIAN magistrates investigating corruption seem to be systematically going through the pages of Who's Who. Each day brings a fresh list of well-known names who are either arrested or wanted for questioning. And the momentum of investigation has begun to quicken. This week those under investigation have included Mr Giorgio La Malfa, head of the Republican Party and Mr Raul Gardini, the most dashing Italian entrepreneur of the 1980s. Those arrested included Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Giampiero Pesenti, who controls Italy's biggest cement company. But as the momentum quickens, there is a growing chorus of alarm among politicians over the extent to which the spreading investigations - involving magistrates in at least five major cities - is compromising the Italian establishment. Politicians of all parties now freely admit the political system is completely corrupted and that perhaps more than a third of the current parliament could fall foul of the law. Mr Giovanni Conso, a distinguished judge, and recently appointed minister of justice, has argued that a solution must be found to prevent matters getting out of hand. This week he announced his ministry was working on legislation which would attempt to balance the need for justice with the need to prevent democracy from being undermined by mass incrimination of the country's leading politicians and businessmen. But it is hard to see how parliament can legislate anything resembling a pardon or amnesty in the present climate. This would risk not only alienating public opinion but also creating a conflict between the judiciary and the legislature. The politicians believe the solution has to lie in a redefinition of what constitutes illicit party finance and the penal consequences for who have handled such funds. The main thread in all the investigations is that of politicians receiving money from state or private companies allegedly to finance their large party bureaucracies in return for business favours. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, this week favoured a form of depenalising the illicit financing of political parties: 'I believe robbery is always immoral but the violation of the laws on financing political parties is not theft. It is an irregularity to which we have made a crime with penal sanctions.' In other words obtaining funds illicitly and not declaring them is a misdemeanour which should merit at best a fine. Since the Christian Democrat party is the most exposed, along with its coalition partners the Socialists, this attitude might seem self-serving. His critics suggested such treatment was inconceivable either for politicians who had forced companies to contribute to party coffers (extortion) or where companies had paid over money to assure the award of a contract. Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and a strong moraliser, also this week hinted at special treatment for politicians who had taken money for their parties. But his purpose was also self-seeking since the PDS and former communists caught up in the investigation have all claimed they were working for the noble cause of the party. Personal enrichment, he claimed, was a worse crime. 'At the judicial level everyone is equal before the law. But on the moral level one ought to make the distinction between those accused of having illegally financed politics and those who have enriched themselves in politics.' The magistrates themselves recognise the difficulties of dealing with an ever increasing number of interrogations, and an ever larger pile of files and indictments. One suggestion has been to ask all those who have paid or received bribes over a certain figure since 1980 to come forward and declare them. The monies would then be asked to be restituted, and where there was damage to a third party, damages would have to be paid.</p>

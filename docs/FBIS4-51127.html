			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The coming visit to  China by Russian Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin is an event  of great significance in Russian-Chinese ties, said Russian  Ambassador to China Igor A. Rogachev.    The visit will help to propel the bilateral ties, the  ambassador told XINHUA here in a recent interview.    The Russian prime minister is scheduled to arrive here  tomorrow for a four-day official visit to China at the  invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng.    During the first-ever visit here by a Russian prime  minister,  leaders of the two countries will exchange views on the  deepening of bilateral ties, especially those in the economic  and trade fields, the ambassador said.    Half a dozen or so documents of co-operation are expected to  be signed here, covering topics ranging from economy and  environmental protection to agriculture and other fields, he  added.    He noted that this year, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, and Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin visited here. The latter arrived  here Wednesday [25 May] to co-chair the second session of the  Russia-China Committee on Co-operation in Economy, Trade,  Science and Technology.    The Russian side is making preparations for the early  realization of the second summit meeting with China, he  revealed, adding that Chernomyrdin's visit is the most important  event in the run-up to the summit.    On domestic situation, Rogachev noted that Russia is  experiencing more and more factors of stability.    Referring to the development of the bilateral ties in the  past two years, Rogachev noted that since President Yeltsin's  visit here in late 1992 there have been more high-level contacts  between the two countries. Last year Russia and China received,  respectively, some 40 delegations from the other side, all at or  above the ministerial level.    The bilateral co-operation in economy and trade, science and  technology and other fields have also logged "remarkable" and  "satisfactory" achievements, he said.    Last year, the two-way trade volume reached a record high of  7.68 billion U.S. dollars, up 30 percent over the previous year.    The two economies are highly complementary and the potential  for bilateral economic co-operation is "great", Rogachev said.    He held that the Russian-Chinese economic and trade  co-operation should be directed gradually toward the setting up  of joint ventures. In this way, the two sides can fully employ  Russia's fuel and other natural resources and China's rich  agricultural and labor resources.    As to some new problems emerging from the bulging economic  and trade co-operation between the two countries, more efforts  are needed from both sides to solve them, the Russian ambassador  said.</p>

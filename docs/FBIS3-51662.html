			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Chamber of Deputies Special Committee yesterday  approved most of the measures of the fiscal adjustment plan  proposed by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The  increase of the income tax on individuals and companies was  approved by consensus, as was the restructuring of the ITR  [Rural Land Tax] and the creation of a tax on the distribution  of dividends. However, the withholding of 15 percent of the  taxes of states and municipalities and 10 percent of the IPI  [Tax on Manufactured Products] of exporter states were rejected.  The income expected to be earned through this source will be  compensated for through the Cofins [social security  contributions], through combatting tax evasion, and through the  sale of the participation of BNDES [National Bank for Economic  and Social Development] in several companies. The approval of  the fiscal adjustment was celebrated as a victory by the finance  minister, who made it understood that the URV [Real Value Unit]  will be adopted within 15 days.</p>

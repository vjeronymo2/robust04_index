The catastrophic impact of a major quake on the  Newport-Inglewood Fault is explained in LIFE, along with a two-page color map  (N8) and a guide to making your home safe (N2). The good news: $33,000 has been  raised for a unique plan by emergency physicians to stash medical gear at fire  stations and schools and train doctors to react. "They want to be effective,"  says Dr. Robert H. Bade, the county's emergency physician, "not just helpless  survivors."  </P></p>

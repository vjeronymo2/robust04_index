			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Djukic, vice-chairman of the Croatian </F> parliament and chairman of the Serbian People's Party, by Zeljko  Luburovic; place and date not given: "Autonomy for Serbs in  Croatia Is Similar to That in Vojvodina"]    [Text] Is there any better occasion for a talk with Milan  Djukic, parliamentary vice-chairman and chairman of the Serbian  People's Party [SNS], than that following the signing of the  Geneva agreement between Serbia and Croatia? There does not  seem to be. Yet, many severe remarks by Djukic about Croatian  state policy demand an explanation.    [Luburovic] Could you comment on the Geneva agreement  between Croatia and Serbia?    [Djukic] That agreement is certainly a step forward, but  only toward the establishment of a mutual dialogue between  Croatia and Serbia, that is Yugoslavia and Croatia. However,  the agreement does not bring about any advance in the quest for  a settlement of the crisis in Croatia.    Serbia and Serbian policy are key factors in solving the  problem of the reintegration of the UN Protection Areas into the  legal system of the Republic of Croatia. Precisely for that  reason, as far as the agreement is concerned, at the moment my  attitude would be closer to the assessment made by Milosevic  rather than that of Tudjman.    [Luburovic] In that context, how should the words of  [Krajina Serb leader] Milan Martic be interpreted, when he  stated after the victory in the Krajina elections that "the only  relations that Krajina may have with Croatia are neighborly  relations?" Does that comply with your assessment?    [Djukic] That only speaks for the fact that Milosevic has  not yet given a sign that the UN Protection Areas in Croatia  might possibly be reintegrated into the integral Croatian state.  Therefore, for the time being, Martic also cannot but follow  Serbian policy on the occupied Croatian territories. At the  very moment when Milosevic's attitude toward the Serbs in  Croatia and the settlement of their political problem and status  becomes more specific, Martic will also become more specific in  those terms.    [Luburovic] Do you think that it is better for Croatia for  Martic to have won the so-called Krajina elections, or would it  have been better if Milan Babic had won?    [Djukic] It is better that Martic won, because he blindly  follows Serbian policy.    [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that Milosevic will  support the reintegration of the occupied regions into the  Croatian legal system.    [Djukic] Not only am I sure about it -- I am more than sure.  And that certainty of mine comes from the fact that the UN  Protection Areas cannot find any grounds for survival except  within Croatia. If that is a fundamental truth, than it is  logical that Milosevic will also have to come to the same  conclusion, and he may already have come to it. However, he is  still making good use of those areas while calculating his  general policy. That policy has not been rounded off, because  the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is still uncertain.    [Luburovic] Do you link the conclusion of the Bosnian issue  to the conclusion of the Croatian issue?    [Djukic] Absolutely.    [Luburovic] In what sense?    [Djukic] It is very important for Croatia that Bosnia-  Herzegovina remains a union of three constituent peoples. There  are two possibilities for Croatia -- either it will form a  confederation with the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and  the Bosnian republic [Bosnjacka republika], or Herzeg-Bosnia  will secede and join Croatia, while in that case the Serbian  republic in Bosnia would join Serbia as well. In that case the  question remains open as to what should be done with the UN  Protection Areas, in which the population is predominantly  Serbian. Those regions are conquered, and we, as well as the  world, have to acknowledge that as a political reality, or a  reality of time, or any other reality whatsoever.    A part of that reality is also that the Serbs from the  unoccupied part of Croatia are leaving in ever greater numbers,  which considerably changes the attitude toward Croatia.    [Luburovic] Where are those Serbs leaving for?    [Djukic] Yugoslavia and Western Europe.    [Luburovic] These are recent trends, are they not?    [Djukic] Yes, they are.    [Luburovic] Do you have any exact data on that matter?    [Djukic] According to our estimates, in the free territory  of Croatia there are 200,000 to 220,000 Serbs. Which means that  almost a third of the Serbs who lived in 1990 in those free  territories of Croatia are leaving. This is a great political  danger for a Croatian policy that wants to solve the problem in  a peaceful way.    [Luburovic] How do you assess the arrival of Jovan, the  Orthodox metropolitan of Ljubljana and Zagreb, in Zagreb?    [Djukic] That is certainly a step toward the normalization  of integral Croato-Serbian relations. That is a sign of the  sudden furtherance of that normalization, which contributes to  the affirmation of religious freedom in Croatia.    [Luburovic] Do you think that the return of Metropolitan  Jovan to Zagreb is an autonomous decision of the Serbian  Orthodox church, or is it politically colored?    [Djukic] It is an autonomous decision by the Serbian  Orthodox Church, which is confirmed by the reaction of the  Orthodox Church in Croatia with respect to the Croatian  authorities, the Serbs in Croatia, and so forth.  <H5>  Yes, We Are Refraining From Discussing Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   [Luburovic] It is noteworthy that SNS deputies always  refrain from taking part in the parliamentary debates on  Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also abstain from voting on the issue.  Why?    [Djukic] You are right in saying that we do refrain from  that. It has to do with our attitude, which we have made public  by criticizing Tudjman's proposal, which he made in Germany,  that a confederation with Herzeg-Bosnia and the Bosnian republic  should be formed. We objected to that proposal because it deals  with legal and political subjects that are internationally  unrecognized for the time being. Therefore, we believe that the  problem of Bosnia- Herzegovina is a problem of the three  constituent peoples, and in no case a matter of the Croatian  concern.    [Luburovic] Still, the Constitution of the Republic of  Croatia obliges President Tudjman and the parliament to take  particular care of those Croatian people outside Croatia.    [Djukic] Look, the Constitution could have obliged them to  do many things, if those things had been stated in it. We  should take care of them, but no greater care of the Croats in  Bosnia- Herzegovina than of the Croats in Vojvodina, or Serbia,  for instance. I think that when that unfortunate war came  about, we were supposed to take better care of the Bosnian  Croats, but not in such a way that today almost the entire world  is condemning the way in which it is being done. And all that  was unfolding in such a way that the relationship between the  Croats and the Serbs in Croatia have been pushed to the margins.    [Luburovic] What do you think about the negotiations of the  Croatian authorities with the representatives of the rebel Serbs?    [Djukic] Those negotiations may last for many years. We  have always held a positive attitude toward them.    [Luburovic] You are not a member of the negotiating team,  are you?    [Djukic] No, I am not, but if you want to know why, you  should seek the answer in Croatian policy.    [Luburovic] From the point of view of the media, one gets  the impression that Milorad Pupovac is a new political player in  the game of the normalization of Serbo-Croatian relations. Is  that an indication that the time of Milan Djukic has passed?    [Djukic] The time of Milan Djukic will have passed only when  he leaves politics. Whom Croatia exploits, and in which way,  when dealing with the issue of Serbs in Croatia, is a matter of  those who take upon themselves such roles, without recognizing  themselves in them, while it is also a matter of a Croatian  policy that may think that in such a way something might  possibly be accomplished.    Basically, the determination of the SNS and its  representatives is not to be a disposable party, to avoid any  conflicts with the opposition, nor to be suppressed by the  attacks and assaults that speculate about who we are and whom we  support. We shall persevere with the determination that the  Serbs should recognize themselves in Croatia in a just way, that  Croatia should become a civil state, and that we should elect a  president who will have enough strength to greet his fellow  citizens, and not just Croats.    [Luburovic] Do you think that Tudjman is not such a  president?    [Djukic] We are certainly rather dissatisfied with the  policy of President Tudjman with regard to the Serbs in Croatia.    [Luburovic] Why?    [Djukic] We want President Tudjman to be as much the  president of the Serbs as he is of the Croats in Croatia. He  cannot be the president of the Serbs if he a priori, as early as  in his reception address, says that he is the president of  Croats and all other citizens. I beg your pardon, "all other  citizens" means that the category of citizens is a second class  category. Look, if Zagreb is the capital of the Croats, then a  nasty part of the Serbs in Croatia might ask themselves: Wait a  minute, if that is so, then what is the capital of the Serbs in  Croatia? And I must also add that the president himself is  actually making the Serbs demand that Knin be their capital.    [Luburevic] What are your relations with President Tudjman  like?    [Djukic] At least I think they are correct. Which means  that I have never spoken to the president as though I had any  complexes, or feared him while approaching him, let alone  disrespected him. I recognize him as the president of the  state, but I also freely tell him what is right and what is  wrong. I think that many would wonder if it is possible that I  dare to tell the president straightforwardly everything that I  really think, which is always in the best interest of Croatia,  the Croatian people, meaning Croats as well as Serbs, and all  others.    [Luburovic] The critics of President Tudjman most usually  portray him black and white. He is either good or bad. How  would you portray him?    [Djukic] I dislike President Tudjman's occasional lack of  strength in his own determination when confronted with the  political attitudes of some individuals. Which means that  Tudjman could be better as a president. Furthermore, he ought  to understand that the Serbs make a great distinction between  the Croatian state and the Croatian authorities. That is very  important. However, it can be noticed that the president  equates the Croatian authorities and the Croatian state. We  draw a distinction on that point. We respect, love, and esteem  the Croatian state. That is our right and our obligation....  <H3>  Serbs' Rights and Anti-Fascist Council of National  Liberation of Yugoslavia </H3>   [Luburovic] Is it also a desire?    [Djukic] Yes, it is also our desire, but loyalty must not be  demanded from us Serbs and stressed as a condition. And that is  because there are also nasty Croats. I cannot understand why a  Serb, who was twice jailed during the old regime, cannot obtain  citizenship for that reason, while a Croat, who was indicted  many times, can. Therefore I want to say as a Serb that I live  in my country, and that is Croatia. I shall respect and value  the Croatian authorities as far as they really serve my needs  and interests, particularly when there is an entire people whose  affairs are to be settled.    Croatia was guilty of a great failure in 1990 when the  authorities tried to preserve Croatia within the borders that  had been established in AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National  Liberation of Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia, while not giving a thought  to the problem of how to solve the question of statuses that had  changed with Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia. At the time  Croatia did not think that the Serbs, by seceding from  Yugoslavia, should also keep rights they had obtained earlier.    [Luburovic] If I understand you correctly, you are saying  that the war that happened here was the fault of the Croats?    [Djukic] It was not the Croats' fault, but the fact that it  is a Croatian co-fault is undisputable.    [Luburovic] In other words, you believe that all the  guarantees that the Croatian state has given to the Serbs so far  have come too late.    [Djukic] Absolutely.    [Luburovic] But Martic maintains the same.    [Djukic] It is hard to change Martic's conviction now in  terms of what would have happened if Croatia had agreed in 1990  to establish a civic society, and to give the Serbs cultural  autonomy. And we also know that the cultural autonomy of the  Ruthenians, Italians, and others was guaranteed for over 50  years by the 1974 Constitution [as published]. So, it is late  now. You see, since the adoption of the Constitutional Law two  years have passed, while it has still not been implemented.    [Luburovic] Are you saying that the Serbs should be given  more than they are given by the Constitutional Law on  Minorities' Rights?    [Djukic] The problem is that the Serbs have not been given  anything. They have obtained something on paper, which we  welcomed, and which we believe should be implemented in all  segments of society. If Croatian policy had done that, the  situation would certainly have been different.    [Luburovic] Excuse me, but there have recently been frequent  cases of Serbs, who live at the time in the occupied regions,  being granted citizenship certificates and their overdue  pensions are also being paid.    [Djukic] That is true. But there was no need to generate  problems where no problems existed.    [Luburovic] There are opinions in the Croatian public that  the occupied regions could be easily reintegrated in the system  of the Croatian Republic by taking the military option.    [Djukic] In my opinion, the military option does not exist  any more, not even in theory. The forces of the right and  impulsive spirits may demand that, but we have to find the  strength and resources to make the people return to their homes.    [Luburovic] What you have just said sounds to me like a  piece of hackneyed demagogy, particularly because the leaders of  the Serbs in the occupied regions of Croatia incessantly point  out that Croatia and the so-called Krajina of theirs are two  neighboring countries. How are they supposed to come to their  senses?    [Djukic] Come on, what else can you expect from them when  they know what awaits certain individuals at the end of the  story?    [Luburovic] Some analysts claim that no Serbian option in  Croatia has as much strength to convince the Serbs from the UN  Protections Areas of the necessity for the war finally to end as  Branko Horvat's Serbian Democratic Union [SDU] does.    [Djukic] Anybody who can do anything in that respect is  welcome. Which is to say, if the SDU has such strength, there  is no reason for it not to contribute to the cessation of the  war. However, the Serbs are clever enough, and know exactly what  the Serbian options are, and what the Croatian options are, that  is to say, which options protect their national identity.    Thus we know that the SDU is a Croatian party, that its  leader is a Croat, but also that there certainly are Serbs who  support it. Today no one could persuade Martic by saying: Come  on, please, join Croatia.    [Luburovic] Several days ago a group of Serb representatives  in the parliament founded a sort of Serb representatives' club.  They had also entered the parliament as Serbs, while some of  them even as independent candidates. What made them  characterize themselves as Serbs rather than as citizens of  Croatia with a certain political platform, or at least as a club  of representatives of all the national minorities in Croatia?    [Djukic] We, the SNS, and our club have been stressing that  issue since we entered the parliament. You must have noticed  that we entered the parliament as Serbs, in compliance with the  Constitutional Law. We did that because, according to the law,  the Serbs are supposed to have 13 representatives in the  parliament. And all these people who are joining the Croatian  parties are joining them as citizens of Croatia who support that  particular platform. Excuse me, but in 1990 we had 31 Serbs in  the parliament, as was confirmed by President Tudjman in his  address to the United Nations. That was when five  representatives of the Serbian Democratic Party left the  parliament.    Tudjman said himself that those who had left the parliament  were the legitimate representatives of Serbs. Which is to say,  that there are Serbs in the Social Democratic Party is not  questionable, but counting them among those 13 is. You cannot  have a Serb, a representative of the Croatian Social Liberal  Party, support something that is in the interest of the  protection of the Serbian minority in Croatia.   <H5>    [Box, page 5] </H5>   [Luburovic] Are you referring to an autonomy model for the  Serbs in Croatia like that of Kosovo and Vojvodina in former  Yugoslavia?    [Djukic] Yes, I am referring to the Vojvodina model in 1974.  However, that contradicts Churkin's theory about a state within  a state, because, as far as I know, no example of such a state  within a state exists in the world. However, I do not want to  speak about form, but rather about content. That means that the  districts of Glina and Knin must be given back to us, rather  than to be organized within two counties. Furthermore, the  question of the territorial degree of that autonomy still  remains open. As does the question of eastern Slavonia and  Baranja.    [Luburovic] I do not understand what is open in those  questions?    [Djukic] They are open because there are Serbs living there  now. And we are making efforts to ensure the return of the  refugees to their homes. If that happens, as it ought to  happen, then the Serbs will no longer be a majority there, so  what we would understand as an autonomous province is the region  of the present districts of Glina and Knin, where the borders of  townships would be taken into account in determining the borders  of the districts, rather than the existing administrative  borders.    Certain alterations should be made in that respect, because  there is the question, for instance, of whether it makes any  sense for the village of Vrhovine to remain outside the borders  of the autonomous province. If the refugees do not return, then  the entire political reality will be changed. And I am afraid  that, given the current policy, the refugees will not be going  back very soon.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORD OF MOUTH: TASTE OF L.A. CAN BE HAD IN SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Get out your spoons. Ready your forks. And bring along your dancing shoes too.  The fourth annual Taste of L.A. starts Saturday at Santa Monica's Civic Center,  offering an opportunity to sample food from 50 of the finest restaurants in  town. The festival runs this weekend and next from noon-11 p.m.  </P> <P> In addition to more food than you'll probably be able to taste, there will be  cooking demonstrations, an art festival and constant entertainment. Admission  is $8 for adults, $4 for children, $6 for senior citizens; tastes are priced at  $1-$5, and 10% of the gross on-site proceeds goes to various organizations that  aid the homeless.

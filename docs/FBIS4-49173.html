			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bao Shishao (0545 0013 4801) and Cang Lide (0221 </F> 4539 1795): "Nixon: A Statesman With Strategic Insight"]    [Text] At 2108 on 22 April 1994, Richard Nixon, a  contemporary U.S. statesman with deep strategic insight and a  former U.S. President, passed away at New York Hospital--Cornell  Medical Center, after suffering a stroke. President Clinton  announced the news in person at the White House Rose Garden two  hours later, and ordered that flags over the whole country  should fly at half-mast for 30 days to express mourning.    Richard Nixon was born on 9 January 1913 in Yorba Linda, a  small town near Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Duke  University Law School in 1937. During World War II, he served  in the U.S. Navy and was sent on missions in the South Pacific  region.    From 1946 onward, Nixon held the office of representative  and  senator, ran for governor, and was twice nominated Republican  presidential candidate. For eight years, from 1952 to 1960,  Nixon held the post of vice president under Eisenhower. He ran  for president in 1960, but was narrowly defeated by the Democrat  candidate Kennedy.    In 1968, he was elected 37th U.S. president. He was  reelected president in 1972, but was forced to resign and leave  the White House in 1974 because of his involvement in the  "Watergate Affair."    During his six-year presidency, Nixon fully displayed his  deep insight as an international strategist and his courage and  resourcefulness as a statesman. His historic visit to China in  1972 must be the most eye-catching event. In February 1972, he  and Premier Zhou Enlai signed a joint communique in Shanghai,  thus opening the door to U.S.-Chinese relations.    Nixon had great respect for Mao Zedong. Addressing a banquet  during his first visit to China, he said: "Chairman Mao once  wrote: `So many deeds brook no delay! The globe spins on, and  time will not stay. Ten thousand years would be too long; let  us seize the hour, and seize the day.' Now it is time for us to  seize the hour, and it is time for our peoples to scale new  heights."    After that, Nixon visited China many times. In the last book  he wrote, he said: "Today, China's economic power makes U.S.  lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it will  make them rude [wu li 2477 4409] [Nixon's original wording is  "irrelevant"]. Within two decades, it will make them laughable.  By then the Chinese may threaten to withhold MFN status from the  United States."    The "Watergate Affair" occurred in the United States when  Nixon was playing an influential role in the international  arena. So he became the first incumbent president in history to  resign during his term of office. This was no doubt a  formidable blow to Nixon.    However, step by step he finally returned to the political  arena. In February 1976, he revisited China as an ordinary  citizen. In 1977, he was interviewed by television reporters.  In 1978, he started writing his memoirs. In 1981, he attended  the funeral of assassinated Egyptian President Sadat, in the  capacity of a member of the U.S. delegation. This was the first  time he had attended an international function in an official  capacity since leaving the White House. In the last few years,  he paid special attention to international developments. Less  than a month before his death, he braved severe cold to visit  Moscow.    Several days before he was hospitalized, he received a copy  of his last work, "After Peace," and he planned to read it over  once again. Even before he fell ill, he was writing a speech  which he was to deliver to raise funds for the Republican Party.    Nixon's death has shocked the world. Many national leaders,  including Chinese leaders, have sent messages of condolence,  praising this statesman's strategic insight and political  courage.    Four living former U.S. presidents were highly appreciative  of Nixon's political life. Gerald Ford said: "Nixon was, if  not the best, at least one of the best presidents in terms of  foreign policy." Ronald Reagan said: "His accomplishments in  foreign policy will reserve him a high standing in history."  Jimmy Carter said: "His historic visits to China and the  Soviet Union paved the way for Deng Xiaoping's visit in person  to the United States; and for the normalization of  Sino-U.S.-USSR relations as well." George Bush said: "The  difficulties he was faced with during his presidency may have  shortened his term of office. But what we must remember are the  many outstanding achievements he scored in both domestic and  foreign affairs."    Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger had the following  comments: Nixon was in fact an idealist, but at the same time  he was also a realist. He believed that idealism does not  hinder, but rather, indeed, needs an understanding of the world  with its true face. The analysis that lets ideals serve the  world rendered him a man always full of vitality.    From 27 April, Nixon will forever rest at his place of  birth,  Yorba Linda. Four years ago, in the same place, when attending  the inaugural ceremony for a library named after him, he  summarized his philosophy of life as follows: "Failure is  certainly sorrowful, but the greatest sorrow is the absence of  both victory and failure in one's life."</p>

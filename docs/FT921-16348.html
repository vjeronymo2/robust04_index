			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi hints at interest in La Cinq MR SILVIO BERLUSCONI, the controversial Italian media mogul, has indicated an interest in taking charge of La Cinq, the collapsed French television station in which he is a major shareholder. La Cinq, which has for some time been struggling to resolve its financial problems, on New Year's Eve announced its intention to file for bankruptcy. Once an administrator has been appointed there will be three months to find a new owner, or to put together a rescue package, otherwise the channel will close. Mr Berlusconi, who owns 25 per cent of La Cinq through Fininvest, one of his holding companies, has been a sizeable shareholder ever since the station's launch in 1986 as part of the French government's television deregulation drive. Initially Mr Berlusconi ran La Cinq together with Mr Jerome Seydoux, the textile magnate who is a close associate of President Francois Mitterand. Mr Seydoux was ousted in 1987, after Mr Jacques Chirac's right wing government came to power, in favour of Mr Robert Hersant, the conservative press baron. Mr Berlusconi has since taken a back seat. For the past 18 months La Cinq has been run by Hachette, the media group which also owns 25 per cent of the station. Mr Berlusconi is now interested in running La Cinq 'providing the conditions are right', according to Mr Angelo Codignoni, Fininvest's representative in France. One potential obstacle would be that Mr Berlusconi already holds the maximum stake - 25 per cent - in La Cinq permitted under French law. Moreover, the French government also imposes strict controls over the sourcing and content of television programmes. Given that French television has been structured specifically to prevent a repetition of the Italian system - where Mr Berlusconi's channels are notorious for showing soft pornography and pulp programmes - it seems unlikely that the government would amend its legislation specifically to allow him to play a more active role in La Cinq. However, the French authorities are keen to find a way of salvaging their fifth channel. The disappearance of La Cinq would have serious implications throughout the French television industry. Telediffusion de France (TDF) the satellite operator that broadcasts La Cinq, warned yesterday that the channel's closure would have 'damaging consequences' for its finances.</p>

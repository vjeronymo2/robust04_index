			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Ricoh launches court battle against Samsung over patents Two Asian electronics companies are battling over the rights to the technology behind the facsimile machine record slips which enable users to keep track of pages sent and the numbers to which faxes are transmitted. Many users discard the record slips, but the use of the 'administrant data' technology has prompted Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment maker, to file a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung Electronics, charging the Korean company with patent infringement and claiming unspecified damages. Ricoh contends that Samsung has infringed two facsimile patents and has asked the ITC to prohibit Samsung from importing, marketing, demonstrating, distributing or selling in the US, fax machines that infringe the patents. Most fax machine makers pay royalties to use the Ricoh technology under licence. Ricoh said it was forced to take action against Samsung after repeated negotiations over several years had failed to result in a satisfactory agreement. The Japanese company has filed a complaint with the ITC and the New Jersey district court seeking a permanent injunction against Samsung and claiming damages. The move by Ricoh illustrates the growing friction between Japanese and Korean companies in international markets, especially in areas where the Japanese have long been market leaders. The two countries agreed last December to resume co-operation on patent processing issues, after a gap of seven years following Japanese complaints that Korean companies were infringing on patents. Japanese electronics makers have dominated the facsimile market, which last year was worth Y355bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in Japan alone, according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. The biggest seller, Ricoh, also sold 2.3m fax machines in the US last year, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, a high technology consultancy, which forecast a rise to 3.9m in 1998. However, Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers have increasingly eaten into the Japanese share, particularly at the lower end of the market for thermal paper faxes. Exports of fax machines from Japan fell 13 per cent to Y227bn in 1993 from the previous year, according to the EIAJ. The Japanese dominance is also being threatened by the impact of a high yen which has eroded the price competitiveness of fax machines made in Japan. Ms Debra Waggoner, of the American Electronics Association, said yesterday: 'For the electronics industry, protection of intellectual property rights is crucial.' Noting that Ricoh has chosen to fight the battle in US courts, she said that the US had been getting 'signals' from Japanese companies 'that they are going to be more pro-active in protecting their rights'.

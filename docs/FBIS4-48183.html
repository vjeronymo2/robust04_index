			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to our correspondent in Kibungo,  (Nyierigira Mutaburuka), refugees have been returning home all  day. [passage omitted] We have also learned that, during this  process of refugees returning from Tanzania, local authorities  in Tanzania held those persons who had taken part in massacres  in detention centers. Detentions also should be carried out in  other neighboring countries, notably in Zaire, where there are  Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development,  MRND, militia, [Interahamwe] ready to massacre those Rwandan  refugees who have settled there.    Indeed, a considerable number of Coalition for the Defense  of  the Republic militiamen have gone to Zaire via the border town  of Goma, with a plan similar to the one which was just  implemented in Rwanda: To exterminate anyone whom the puppet  Gitarama government does not want to see alive. This question  concerns Rwandan refugees, but also others living in Zaire,  notably in the Masisi, Walikale and Rutshuru zones of the Goma  subregion. [passage omitted]</p>

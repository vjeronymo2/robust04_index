			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES DECLINE IN QUIET TRADING  </P> <P> Bond prices slipped Thursday in light trading, with little economic news to  affect the direction of the market, traders said.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/32 point, or about $2.19 for every  $1,000 in face amount.  </P> <P> Its yield, which rises when the price declines, rose to 8.59% from 8.57% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Late in the day, the Resolution Trust Corp. announced plans to borrow $45.3  billion for its savings and loan bailout in the current quarter. The RTC's  oversight board, a panel led by the Treasury Department that controls the  policy and purse strings of the program, said it has authorized regulators to  borrow up to $45.3 billion in the April-June quarter. It had authorized $11  billion in the January-March period.  </P> <P> Economists caution that the heavy borrowing could unsettle debt markets and  nudge up short-term interest rates.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.125%, unchanged from late Wednesday.  </P></p>

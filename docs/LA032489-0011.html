			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine navy to halt efforts to clean up  a fuel oil spill from a ship that went aground Jan. 28 near an American  research station in the Antarctic. A statement released by the Argentine  Embassy in Washington said that five naval ships that had been participating in  contamination control work are being withdrawn "due to glacier and  meteorological conditions." The statement said that oil spilled from the  Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and  that all "potential pollutants" have been removed from the wrecked ship.  American experts, however, say that about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil are still  aboard the ship.  </P></p>

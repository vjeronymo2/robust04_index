			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SACRIFICING AIR QUALITY  </P> <P> I like the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. The facilities never seem  too crowded and it's usually a pleasant afternoon.  </P> <P> I probably hike in one of the park units, with my family, four or five times a  year.  </P> <P> However, my family and I breathe the air in the Conejo Valley. We face the  gridlock on our roads. The thought of sacrificing our air quality and quiet  lifestyle for a few more acres of parkland is frightening. What is the point of  having parkland with Stage 1 smog alerts?  </P> <P> I do not support the Bob Hope, developer-motivated, land swap.  </P> <P> LORRAINE EPSTEIN  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

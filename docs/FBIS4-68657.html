			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko, Gorbachev Fund: "Zone of </F> Mutual Interest? Russia Has Separated Itself from Integration  Processes in the Central Asian Region"]    [Text] Russian political scientists, diplomats,  strategists, and publicists speak about Central Asia as "a zone  of Russia's vital interests," about "Russia's foreign political  priorities" in the region, etc. To look at the region's economic  problems in depth, from at least two sides--both the Russian and  the Central Asian--is the intention of this article.  <H5>  Viewpoint </H5>   Economic interdependence and, correspondingly, the need for  close economic cooperation are such obvious things that it is  awkward even to recall them. Russia and Central Asia are parts  of a unified national economic complex of the former USSR. This  complex was formed as a system with elements that supplement one  another. The region is largely the source of a number of raw  material resources that are either completely lacking in Russia  or exist in insufficient quantities. The extremely large  copper-porphyry, pyrite and stratiform deposits of Central Asia  and the Transcaucasus lay beyond the borders of Russia. The  situation was no better with respect to a number of other  mineral-raw material resources. Russia has insignificant  reserves of copper, manganese, chromites, strontium ores,  germanium, potassium salts, etc. It is also necessary to mention  cotton here. Russia's main supplier of it was Central Asia (with  Russia's demand for 1,175,700 tonnes, Uzbekistan alone provided  544,000 tonnes). This list could easily be continued.    Not only Russia depends on deliveries from the post-Soviet  "South"; Central Asian countries are interested in them as well.  Coal from the Kazakhstan Ekibastuz is intended for heating and  electric power plants operating on the territory of Russia. The  Karaganda Metallurgical Combine delivers to Russia about 2  million tonnes of rolled metal a year. The problem of selling  these and other products will inevitably arise if exports to  Russia are excluded.    The existing organizational forms of economic cooperation  between Russia and states of the post-Soviet Central Asia are  developing (true, without very good results) within the  framework of the CIS: An Economic Union of CIS States has been  created, a number of interstate organs have been  instituted--Interstate Bank, Interstate Council on Questions of  Industrial Policy, etc. Cooperation is developing at the level  of enterprises and branches. There is also a future for such  forms as economic interaction at the level of border oblasts  (for example, Omsk Oblast of Russia and Pavlodar Oblast of  Kazakhstan).    But one gets the impression that the Central Asian states,  while not destroying economic ties with Russia willfully, are  trying to find an alternative to them, working within other  organizational frameworks with states of the world South. Russia  is jealous of this, but itself is exerting no active or positive  resistance to it.    In my view Russia should take a considerably more active  part  in the regional and interregional organizations in whose work  the states of the post-Soviet Central Asia have already become  involved.    One of these organizations is the Organization of Caspian  States (OPG, created in February 1992). Representatives of Iran,  Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia participated in  its creation. The degree of interest of the aforementioned  states in this organization is shown also by the level of  representation at the constituent assembly: The first three  states were represented by the president, the fourth--by a  deputy prime minister, and the fifth (Russia)--by the ambassador  to the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is no need to enumerate  the problems that could be resolved simply through joint  efforts: raising the level of the Caspian, ecology, extraction  of oil in the open sea, on the shelf, and along the coast,  fishing, etc. Russia's passiveness could quite well be regarded  as one of the reasons why nothing has come of the OPG so far and  the aforementioned states are cooperating (if they are  cooperating) in the aforementioned areas either on a bilateral  or multilateral basis or within the framework of associations  that do not include Russia.    Another example is the Organization for Economic Cooperation  (OES, sometimes designated as EKO), which initially (since  1984-1985) included Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. With the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, all the Central Asian states  and also Azerbaijan joined the OES. Russia became a kind of  initiator of maximum self-isolation from the OES. Moreover, the  Central Asian states were given an ultimatum: either economic  cooperation with Russia or participation in the OES. Not to  mention the fact that the condition for Russian-Central Asian  cooperation given above is insulting and unacceptable to the  independent states of Central Asia, the question could have been  posed differently. Why should Russia not join the OES? As far as  I can judge, the OES regulations do not preclude that.    In order to give a full picture it is necessary to mention  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone (ChZES) created in 1992,  in which both Russia and a number of states interested in  cooperation in the neighboring Central Asia region (Turkey,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia) participate. The coordination  of this regional organization, to which Russia pays considerably  more attention than to the one mentioned above, can be  facilitated by untying several knots right in Central Asia.    Integration processes in Central Asia itself is a topic unto  itself. They began "reactively," they were forced--as a  completely natural reaction to the creation of the CIS as a  quasi-Slavic association. Subsequently this separation and  intraregional consolidation were reinforced by plans for a  Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian economic alliance and zigzags in  Russian policy regarding post-Soviet Central Asia. True, the  integration processes are extremely weak. It is difficult to  imagine Russia's participation in these processes.    The plans to create new transportation communications  (railroads and highways, pipelines, etc.) are a visible sign of  future trends in economic cooperation. The building of  communications routes tells us considerably more than serious  agreements and widely announced declarations.    One Central Asian leader noted: "Previously all roads to the  East (from Europe--A.I.) passed through Moscow." Now the new  states of the region are looking for different roads, which very  frequently bypass Russia.    The program of the Commission of European Communities (CEC),  which is oriented toward the creation of a combined (rail,  ferry, and sea) transportation corridor "Europe--Caucasus--Asia"  is very attractive to the Central Asian states. The main route  would bypass Russia--along the line of  Almaty-Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi (formerly  Krasnovodsk)-Baku-Poti/Batumi.    Each Central Asian country is exerting a fair amount of  effort to create its own transportation access to communications  centers of world significance. Thus Kazakhstan, having  established rail communications long the route of  Almaty-Beijing, is intending to extend this route to the  territories of Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey, in order to reach  Western Europe. Turkmenistan is speeding up the construction of  the railroad route of Tedzhen-Serakhs-Mashkhad, which will make  it possible to link this Central Asian country to Tehran,  Ankara, and West European capitals. Iranian territory with  renewed communications in the interests of Turkmenistan will  become for the latter a kind of bridge to the Persian Gulf and  the Indian Ocean. Through Kazakhstan, which is joined by  railroad to China (Beijing), it is also possible to gain access  to the Far East--the Asia-Pacific region (APR). Turkmenistan is  also exerting efforts to create a gas line through  Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey-West Europe. Turkmenistan leaders also  dream of laying a gas line to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan.  Pakistan is prepared to open routes to the Indian Ocean for  Central Asian states.    Regional communications could be affected by the  implementation of an agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan for  the creation of a petroleum line, which will make it possible to  transport Azerbaijani petroleum to a terminal on the Turkish  coast of the Mediterranean Sea: Azerbaijan--Northern  Iran--Nakhichevan--Turkey (Erzurum--the region of the  Syrian-Turkish border--Yumurtalik).    The plan for transporting oil through a pipeline from the  oil  region of Tengiz (western Kazakhstan) to Novorossiysk is  promising and mutually advantageous for both Kazakhstan and  Russia. But there are serious obstacles to the implementation of  this plan, the main one being Turkish interests: In the first  place, since 1990 (because of UN sanctions against Iraq, which  was prohibited from trading in oil in the full volume) the  petroleum terminal of Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean Sea and  the petroleum pipeline leading up to it have been inactive and  Turkey is trying to put them to work; second, Turkey (largely  because of the preceding factor but also because of a real  concern for the ecological situation in the densely populated  regions) is trying to prohibit large tankers containing oil from  passing through the Bosphorus. If these Turkish interests (or  one of them) are honored, the significance of the petroleum  terminal in Novorossiysk will drop sharply. And oil from Tengiz  could go not to Novorossiysk but to Turkey, changing the  aforementioned route somewhat: Tengiz-Azerbaijan-Northern  Iran-Azerbaijan (Nakhichevan)-Turkey (Mediterranean Sea coast).  As far as one can judge, in this case too it is necessary to  observe Russian interests: On the one hand, the petroleum  pipeline should not extend through the recreation zone or the  productive agricultural land in the south of Russia; on the  other hand, Russia itself could hook up to this petroleum  pipeline for its own advantage. This kind of untangling of  communications problems which is convenient both for Russia and  for the Central Asian states in the newly formed geopolitical  and economic space is possible, apparently, in other cases as  well, say, with the utilization of mechanisms for regional and  interregional economic cooperation.    Thus Russia will undoubtedly be able to derive an advantage  for itself from the existence of the transportation corridor  "Europe-Caucasus-Asia." It could hook up to railroad lines  through Chelyabinsk, and then the possibilities of the  Transsiberian main line would also be taken advantage of. For  many reasons the new Astrakhan-Kizlyar-Baku railroad line would  not be superfluous either. Through the Caspian, Russia could  join transportation flows along the Astrakhan-Baku route. One  gets a sense of satisfaction that Russia is participating in the  actions for coordinating the program (as an equal with the  Transcaucasian and Central Asian states and also Iran, Turkey,  China, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the states included in the CEC).    There is a mutual interest in having Russia supply the armed  forces of the Central Asian states with various kinds of  weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. All these products  of the military-industrial complex can come only from Russia: It  supervised the formation of the infrastructure, combat  regulations, tactics--everything the armies of the newly  independent states of Central Asia have inherited; further, the  products are cheaper than in the West and of better quality than  the Chinese, which coincide with ours in terms of many  tactical-technical characteristics; regular deliveries are  guaranteed; some of the states of Central Asia in cooperation  with Russia could produce their own arms (from cartridges in  Kyrgyzstan to aircraft of the AWACS type in Uzbekistan).    As for Russia's interests, they include above all the  availability of a large and promising market for selling  products of the military-industrial complex, cooperation with a  number of enterprises of the Central Asian military-industrial  complex, the use of testing grounds (especially Baykonur), and  the acquisition of important military-strategic raw material.    Military cadres are a promising area of cooperation. At the  present time there is a critical shortage of officers  representing the "titular" population in the formation of armies  of the Central Asian states. Russians and other Slavs make up  from 70 to 90 percent of the officer corps. It will take at  least several years to create a highly professional officer  corps from local residents (again, not without help from Russian  instructors and military training institutions). The service of  Russian officers in armies of the states of Central Asia will  help Russia to relieve a fairly critical problem of returning  military servicemen to Russian territory.    In addition to the already tested forms of cooperation it  would be possible to consider the following as well: The search  for new forms of regional collective security (naturally, with  the mandatory participation of Russia and, possibly, enlisting  certain adjacent states); expansion of bilateral cooperation  (for example, in the form of legal documentation with interstate  agreements of Russia's military presence with Russian military  bases); the transformation of collective (and essentially mainly  Russia) forces into real coalition armed forces intended for  protecting all the former border of the USSR in the Central  Asian region; development of contract service for Russian  citizens in armies of Central Asian states. It is not ruled out  but rather suggested that there be military cooperation within  the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations.</p>

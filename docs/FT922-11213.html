			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Doubt over Russia's IFC entry EARLY Russian membership of the International Finance Corp (IFC), the World Bank affiliate charged with promoting private-sector investment, has been thrown into doubt by problems in the US administration, writes Peter Norman in Washington. Russia and the other 14 former Soviet republics have completed the formalities to become members of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the US has so far not given the go-ahead to a limited increase in the capital of the IFC that would allow Russia and other republics to join the affiliate. Russia and the republics will be able to join the World Bank as it had sufficient unallocated shares to give Russia a 2.92 per cent of World Bank capital and the former Soviet republics, including Russia, 5.25 per cent. The IFC, however, only had about half the number of unissued shares required to make the former Soviet states into members with the same shareholdings as in the World Bank.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICES REMAIN STEADY DURING AUGUST;  </P> <P> BEST SHOWING IN OVER 3 YEARS; DECLINE IN ENERGY SECTOR HELPS CAP INFLATION  </P> <P> The rise in consumer prices halted abruptly in August after slowing during most  of the summer, marking the nation's best performance on inflation in more than  three years, the government reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The respite -- the first month since April, 1986, that the consumer price index  remained unchanged -- mainly reflected a 4.2% plunge in gasoline prices that  helped offset increases in other prices. The decline in energy prices was the  steepest in three years.  </P> <P> It was the third month in a row that declining energy prices have kept  inflation low at the retail level. The consumer price index rose a relatively  modest 0.2% in June and July, after increases of 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively,  in April and May.  </P> <P> The August figures left the pace of inflation during the past 12 months at an  annual rate of 4.7%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicting Interpretations  </P> <P> The Bush Administration touted the new figures as further evidence that its  economic policies are working. The slowdown had been predicted by the  President's Council of Economic Advisers, which had insisted that sharp  increases posted earlier this year were transitory.  </P> <P> But analysts outside the government were sharply divided Tuesday over whether  the pause in August would prove fleeting. Some said that the recent declines in  energy prices, along with slower food price increases, were masking a further  speedup in the underlying inflation rate.  </P> <P> David D. Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services Inc., in Chicago,  forecast that the food and energy declines would come to an end soon and that  August's consumer price index report may be "the last good CPI for the year."  </P> <P> Joel A. Popkin, a Washington-based inflation watcher, said the past three  months' good behavior on the price front is likely to prove nothing more than  "a summer lull." He predicted that the overall inflation rate "will go back up  to 5%" by year-end.  </P> <P> Separately, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that housing starts in the  United States fell sharply in August to a new annual rate of 1.35 million  units, down 5% from the previous month and the largest decline since a 12.7%  plunge in February.  </P> <P> Analysts blamed the fall on continuing high interest rates. Construction starts  had fallen steadily for four straight months until rebounding in June -- the  longest string of declines since early 1987. Apartment construction fell in  August by 11.4%.  </P> <P> Even so, applications for new building permits, a harbinger of future trends in  construction activity, rose 3.5% in August after falling in July. Analysts said  construction patterns are likely to be erratic for the rest of the year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Unexpected  </P> <P> In a calculation separate from the national inflation figures, the Labor  Department reported that the consumer price index for the Los Angeles area fell  0.1% in August, after a 0.2% rise the previous month. But the indexes kept for  individual cities are erratic and are not adjusted for seasonal patterns.  </P> <P> The August freeze in consumer prices nationwide had been widely expected. Jerry  L. Jordan, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the  recent respite was "a mirror image" of the first half of 1989, when inflation  was exacerbated by a series of special factors.  </P> <P> He and other economists cited these developments:  </P> <P> * Food prices, which rose sharply during the first half of the year after the  drought in mid- and late 1988, slowed substantially in early summer and have  risen only moderately since. They rose 0.2% in August, after a 0.3% increase in  July.  </P> <P> * Energy prices, particularly for gasoline, climbed steeply earlier in the year  in the face of fears of shortages in the world oil market but have come down  steadily -- and sharply -- in the second half. In August, they plunged nearly  2%.  </P> <P> * High inventories in the auto industry have led to significant discounting of  car prices, particularly with the end of the model year this month. New car  prices have edge downward for most of the summer. In August, they fell 0.3%.  </P> <P> * The steady rise in the value of the dollar has made imported goods less  expensive for Americans, slowing that component of the consumer price index and  keeping pressure on the rest of the economy as well.  </P> <P> Most economists predict that inflation will receive another jolt this autumn,  as the "summer lull" comes to an end. New 1990 model cars to be introduced in  October are expected to be decidedly more expensive, and the dollar could  decline anew.  </P> <P> "We are going to see a spike up beginning in October," said Edward Guay,  economist for Cigna Corp. in Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> But analysts differ sharply over what the inflation rate will be once that  "spike" has ended. Guay, for one, said he believes that inflation is apt to  slow again, if only because the Federal Reserve Board has been holding the  economy in check.  </P> <P> He noted that wage increases have remained relatively modest, despite the  earlier speedups in food and energy prices. And he predicted that the gradual  slowing of the economy will help push interest rates down further early next  year.  </P> <P> But Popkin predicted that inflation has already built up too much momentum to  be cut without a serious recession. The fact that analysts are predicting a  "soft landing," in which the economy will escape a recession, means that "the  best we can do is flatten inflation," he said.  </P> <P> Other important components of the consumer price index turned in a mixed  performance during August. Medical costs jumped 0.7%, continuing the same  frenetic pace at which they have risen for the bulk of the year.  </P> <P> The cost of apparel and household upkeep declined 1.5% in August, after steady  decreases over the past three months. The Labor Department said end-of-season  price reductions, particularly for women's and children's clothes, were larger  than in previous years.  </P> <P> And entertainment costs rose 0.3% for the month, halving the 0.6% pace at which  they rose in June and July and reflecting a general slowdown in demand.  </P> <P> The August report left the overall consumer price index at 124.6% of its  1982-84 average -- meaning that it took $124.60 last month to buy the same  goods and services that cost $100 in the early part of the decade.  </P></p>

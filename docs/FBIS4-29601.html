			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling  coalition's top strategist, suggested Monday [20 June] that the  minority government may seek an alliance with the largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition  government's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, said  the coalition continues to take priority in urging the second  largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social  Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] to return to the ruling camp.    "We do not reject holding discussions simultaneously with  other parties, because we do not have much time," Ozawa said at  a news conference.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will  seek a one-shot alliance with the LDP to call for a snap poll if  realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail.    The LDP has reportedly decided to propose a no-confidence  motion against Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes, saying  the minority government does not represent the will of the  people.    The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of  Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of  Councillors during the current session ending June 29.    If Hata fails to survive a no-confidence vote, he either has  to resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the lower house.    The SDP seceded from the coalition government in April after  other ruling parties formed the parliamentary group "kaishin"  (innovation) without consulting with the SDP.</p>

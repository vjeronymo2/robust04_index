			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Pfizer to float stake in minerals business PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, yesterday announced plans to float a majority interest in its speciality mineral business on the stock market. The US drug company said it would retain a stake of around 30-40 per cent in the minerals operation - to be called Minerals Technologies. No precise timing was given for the spin-off, but a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog, is likely within a week. The transaction could then be completed by the end of 1992. Pfizer accompanied news of the partial disposal with an announcement that the board had authorised a buy-back of up to 10m shares over the next two years. Together, the two pieces of news sent the shares Dollars 1 1/8 higher, at Dollars 81 1/4 . Ahead of the SEC filing, Pfizer declined to discuss details of the new Minerals Technologies company. However, according to last year's annual report, the specialty minerals operations had sales of Dollars 359.3m last year, up from Dollars 343.9m in 1990. The drug company sold its pigments business - which used to be part of this division in 1990. Precipitated calcium carbonate satellite plants - which operate in the paper-making industry - account for about half the division's sales at present. There is also a separate subsidiary, called Quigley, which supplies monolithic refractories and specialty products to the iron, steel and glass industries. The division is a small part of Pfizer, which had aggregate sales of Dollars 6.95bn last year. The company said that decision to float a majority interest in the minerals business 'furthers Pfizer's ongoing strategy of focusing on its strengths as a research-based, diversified health-care company with global operations."</p>

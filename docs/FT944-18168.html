			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Award unlikely to prompt flood of new actions Lossmaking Names have won an apparently emphatic victory against the professional members agencies' who advised them and placed them on the ill-fated Gooda Walker syndicates. But the impact on the insurance market as a whole is likely to be limited. The verdict will encourage other aggrieved members, particularly those whose syndicates specialised in the kind of reinsurance business favoured by the Gooda agency. It is unlikely to open the floodgates for further actions, however. Most of the more than two dozen cases filed stem from the more than Pounds 7bn of losses suffered by Lloyd's between 1988 and 1991, and with it now apparently trading profitably - profits of up to Pounds 1bn for the 1993 underwriting year are expected - active Names have relatively few grievances. Nor does the award provide unqualified encouragement for every other legal action involving past losses by Names. This is for a number of reasons. By grabbing a sizeable share of the insurance funds available for compensation payments, the Gooda Names may well have left other action groups pursuing legal battles with the prospect of rapidly diminishing returns. Most of the money to fund the award will come from errors and omissions insurance policies which cover agents' legal claims for negligence. The funds available under such policies are thought to be limited to between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1.08bn, compared with overall claims of about Pounds 3bn. Beyond those limits claims will fall on the members' agents themselves. But most of these agencies are small and many are no longer trading. Success for Gooda Walker cases does not necessarily mean others will succeed. The verdict undoubtedly represents a fillip for the next case - that mounted by Names on the Feltrim syndicates. Mr Justice Phillips' criticism yesterday of the so-called excess-loss spiral - in which syndicates and companies covered each others' high-level catastrophe risks - are a helpful precedent. Other Names from spiral syndicates such as Rose Thomson Young, Devonshire and Bromley will also be encouraged. However a Lloyd's panel, chaired by Sir Michael Kerr, the former High Court judge, examined the relative strengths of 31 separate claims earlier this year as part of an out-of-court settlement offer. Although the panel found the cases of the Gooda and Feltrim Names were 'strong' it said that the legal ground for many of the smaller actions, some of which are linked to US asbestosis and pollution losses, were 'weak' or even 'hopeless'. Its view on another big liability-related loss that suffered by Names on Merrett syndicate 418/417, was mixed, with some claims viewed as having strong prospects. Merrett Names expect their case to come to court early next year. Even for the Gooda Walker Action Group members yesterday's victory could prove far from clear-cut. As well as the possibility of an appeal the most obvious caveat is that damages have yet to be agreed - lawyers acting for the members' agencies who lost yesterday described the Pounds 504m figure as 'speculative'. Yet agreement on damages is only the first stage. The Gooda Walker Action Group will also have to fight hard if the errors and omissions insurers are to fund any settlement fully. The errors and omissions cover available to the agencies sued by the Gooda Walker agencies may prove insufficient. The action group admits, for instance, that the cover on the discredited Gooda Walker members' agency has been declared void. The group also faces legal hurdles in its attempts to sue Littlejohn Frazer, the former Gooda Walker auditors. It hopes to recoup the difference between its Pounds 629m total compensation claim and the sum eventually agreed with the agencies. Meanwhile the impact on Lloyd's and its broader business is likely to be limited. Most of the errors and omissions policies have been underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates, but it is understood that reserves to pay the losses incurred as a result of the award have already been set aside. Although the award and its attendant publicity could tarnish its image, Lloyd's will point out that the market has changed radically since the late 1980s when the losses were incurred. The management of the Lloyd's corporation, which administers the market, has been overhauled since Mr Peter Middleton took over as chief executive in 1992. The marketplace - one populated by hundreds of tiny syndicates, brokers and agencies - has become less fragmented and more efficient. More than half the 401 syndicates which traded in 1990 have been forced out of business by their losses. Above all Lloyd's has succeeded - against some expectations - in attracting investment from institutions and bigger agencies. Syndicates believe their future depends on links with these corporate investors. Last year about Pounds 800m in corporate money was attracted. This year investors are expected to commit a further Pounds 125m to Pounds 250m. By tightening links with corporate investors through dedicated investment funds, some agencies are explicitly paving the way for their transformation into insurance companies. Against this background legal action, even if successful, is likely to be an irritant rather than a serious threat to the health of the market.</p>

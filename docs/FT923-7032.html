			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper 'heretic' forced out of Chilean think-tank CHILE'S RULING Christian Democratic Party has excommunicated one of its chief economists for the heresy of proposing that the state copper company Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, should be privatised. Mr Pedro Calvo was forced to resign from the Christian Democrat's economic think-tank this week after his comments to a national newspaper provoked a major earthquake in political circles. The government immediately went on the record as saying it had no plans to privatise Codelco. It argued that it was too important to the Chilean economy: it produces 13 per cent of the world's copper, close to a third of Chile's exports, a fifth of the government's income and 4.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. A tenth of Codelco's gross sales, which totalled Dollars 2.77bn last year, goes directly to the armed forces. The company's public nature is enshrined in the Chilean constitution and has been an article of faith since the copper industry was nationalised in the 1970s. Yet Mr Calvo is not alone in his unorthodox views. The private-sector Mining Chamber and leading businessmen have leapt to his defence, arguing that the government is trying to stifle genuine debate on Codelco's problems. These include a history of under-investment, ageing mines, falling production, overmanning and rising production costs. Investment is the most pressing problem. Codelco has provided more than Dollars 17bn to the state's coffers since its creation in 1976. But the government has reinvested only 0.2 per cent of its profits back into the company. 'Privatisation is the only technical solution for Codelco's problems,' says Mr Hernan Guilloff, president of the Mining Chamber. 'Only a few politicians and those who have their jobs to defend disagree.' The latter include Chile's powerful Copper Workers Union, whose 19,000 members are the most vocal defenders of Codelco's state ownership. Leading businessmen, such as Mr Fernando Leniz, who sits on the boards of several large Chilean companies and is considered the elder statesman of the country's private industry, argue that Codelco's public ownership is an anomaly in a country that pioneered privatisations in Latin America. He and others are urging the government to sell off the remaining state concerns to release resources for spending on health and education. 'If we consider Codelco, the ports, water companies and the few utilities that remain in state hands, the government could easily raise Dollars 10bn within five years,' Mr Leniz wrote in El Mercurio, Chile's leading newspaper. Although few politicians risk broaching this taboo subject in public, the idea that Codelco should be opened to some kind of private sector participation is gaining strength across the political spectrum. It also has supporters within the government and the company itself. They argue that the state can no longer meet the estimated Dollars 700m a year Codelco needs to develop new mines, modernise its smelters and clean up the industry. They concede, however, that the issue is too explosive to be tackled in the final two years of President Patricio Aylwin's government. 'It would destroy the ruling centre-left coalition,' says Mr Juan Pablo Letelier, a Socialist deputy in congress who opposes Codelco's privatisation.</p>

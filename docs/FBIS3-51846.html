			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gabriels Guevara from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro today  described the transportation strike as senseless, adding that  this is a bad time to paralyze this service.    [Begin Chamorro recording] What do they want? Do they want  to own their own vehicles or not? Would they prefer to work for  someone else, as they did in the past? Today they own their own  vehicles, which they obtained through credits that must be paid.  How long have they had those buses? For more than a year. They  were given a grace period of a year, and they are still behind  in their payments. Come on, now, they must pay. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Finance Minister Emilio Pereira said these  activities that disrupt public order prevent the country's  economic growth.    [Begin Pereira recording] Each time we carry out actions  such as these, we prevent the country's economic growth, because  they can result in a loss of more than $1 million a day. In  addition, we should not only think about how much we lose today,  but how much we will lose in the future. Tourists will stop  coming. There will be no investments or new jobs. [end  recording]    With regard to the demands from the transportation workers,  Minister Pereira said:    [Begin Pereira recording] Unfortunately, we do not produce  oil in Nicaragua. Second, the price of fuel must be in line  with the value of the dollar to maintain our reserves, to  support our production and credit plans, and to promote new  jobs, which is Nicaragua's main problem. [end recording]    Minister Pereira said the government is willing to find a  negotiated solution to the transportation problem, but it will  maintain its position.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems scent victory in Newbury contest THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS confidently predicted that they would win Newbury in tomorrow's by-election as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, led the final phases of their campaign in the once-safe Tory seat. Mr Ashdown said: 'There is a lot of work to be done, a lot of votes to be garnered. We believe that the issue is still close but we are confident that victory is well within our grasp.' The Liberal Democrats' upbeat mood yesterday, when nearly half the party's 20 MPs arrived in the constituency for a round of canvassing, suggests that their private returns show them at least slightly in the lead. Previously party officials had sounded sceptical about the weekend opinion poll which put Mr David Rendel, their candidate, decisively ahead. By contrast, Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate, said he believed the Conservatives had won the campaign conclusively. Yet again he recalled the Tory victory in the general election in spite of unfavourable opinion polls. The Conservatives' latest tactic is to distribute a leaflet with the Liberal Democrat logo on the front, apologising for 'three major misrepresentations' in the Liberal Democrat campaign. Mr Rendel and his campaign team dismissed it as 'a sign of desperation'. With just two days to go before voting, all the parties - even the fringe candidates - have stepped up their activity. The most high-profile event was a meeting last night for Mr Alan Sked - standing as an Anti-Federalist candidate - attended by more than 500 people and addressed by Mr Enoch Powell, the former Tory minister and veteran anti-Common Market campaigner. The focus for the main parties now is to make sure their supporters vote tomorrow. The Tories, defending a 12,357 majority in their 188th-safest seattalk of a 60 per cent to 65 per cent turnout overall. Both parties believe the result could depend on whether disaffected Tories protest by staying at home or by changing their vote. Labour's emphasis now is on maximising the anti-Tory vote. Mr Peter Mandelson, the Labour MP who has been the party's campaign supremo, said: 'We will be very satisfied with the defeat of the Conservatives and that is the result we confidently expect . . . we will be very disappointed if the Conservatives manage to hold the seat.' Mr Ashdown used his visit to Newbury to talk-up the importance of the county council elections in England and Wales, which also take place tomorrow. It was, he said, 'not necessarily inconceivable' that the Tories might drop into third place in terms of vote share in those elections.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hayim Hecht -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Hecht] One hour after Qol Yisra'el carried the  story on 'Arafat's address, a motion of no-confidence in the  government was filed with the Knesset secretariat. Yitzhaq  Levi, National Religious Party [NRP] secretary general, said:  If you want to know the truth, do not trust the Israeli  Government; listen to 'Arafat's remarks. The NRP faction held a  special meeting and decided to file a motion of no confidence.    Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Peled said that he exposed  the fact that the Cairo agreements include five secret addenda  three weeks ago. They said I am mad, Peled said. The five  addenda, according to Peled, refer to: the Palestinian right of  return; an expansion of the Palestinian police force; granting  the autonomy a consular status in Jerusalem; a festive ceremony  by 'Arafat and his guards in Jerusalem; and a discussion of  Jerusalem's final status.    [Peled] And Rabin never presented this to the public.  Therefore, I believe this is a total fraud.    [Hecht] Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav demands that the  government immediately present before the Knesset all the secret  documents. Moledet Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi demands that  Yitzhaq Rabin immediately announce that all the agreements  signed with 'Arafat are invalid.    The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza stated that 'Arafat's remarks prove that the Israeli  Government has taken the path of selling out even Jerusalem.  The council says it will do everything it can to stop the  deterioration.</p>

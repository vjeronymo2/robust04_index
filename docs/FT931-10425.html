			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL extended earlier gains in afternoon trading on the LME to end near the highest level for four weeks. The move was largely underpinned by technical factors once early commission house and option buying lifted three-month prices above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. The market hit a high of Dollars 6,119 before profit-taking set in, but final kerb business of Dollars 6,100 was still around Dollars 165 up from Friday. Some dealers said Western European scrap was in short supply. Background support for COPPER came from news that workers at Poland's KGHM said they were ready to strike, but both union and management said a stoppage was unlikely soon. GOLD was set at Dollars 327.95 a troy ounce on the London bullion market in the afternoon after an earlier fix at Dollars 327.60, just above its lowest fix for seven years at Dollars 327.45 in January. Professionals tried to push the price through support at Dollars 327 earlier to trigger sell-stops thought to be around that level, but physical offtake provided support. Compiled from Reuters</p>

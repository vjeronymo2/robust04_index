Opposition sources in Aden see this as a major blow to the  signs of relaxation which some thought were recently beginning  to appear as the cabinet held meetings in Aden at the invitation  of Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Informed  sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the trucks were  carrying arms from the north and were intercepted by southern  military units on the desert road linking the governorates of  Shabwah (in the south) and Ma'rib in the north. In the ensuing  exchange of fire seven soldiers were killed outright on both  sides and the southern forces seized three trucks. Three other  trucks managed to turn back, but three are still missing.    The sources emphasized that this incident, which occurred  yesterday, was quickly contained by the Military Coommittee,  which is continuing its tour of Shabwah Governorate in the  course of its plan to end military moves on both sides.    Political sources in Aden have stated that the cabinet,  which  met in Aden yesterday for the first time after a three-month  suspension, formed three committees: One to study security  matters, one to prepare constitutional amendments, and one to  study the requirements of the Dialogue Committee and help it  play its role of controlling the organs that will implement the  Pledge and Accord Document.    The sources regard the measures taken by the government at  yesterday's meeting to be a violation of the provisions of the  Pledge and Accord Document. [passage omitted]    Opposition sources in Aden said after the annoucement of the  government's formation of these committees that what had  happened was "the first clear violation of the Amman agreement"  and that it was not up to the government to form a  constitutional amendment committee because that was within the  jurisdiction of the Dialogue Committee.

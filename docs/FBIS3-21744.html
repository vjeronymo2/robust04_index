			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Celiano Fonseca including live telephone </F> interview with Roberto Leyton, former Panamanian ambassador to  the OAS, by RPC Television News Director Julio Miller; from "The  RPC Television News" newscast]    [Text] [Fonseca] Panamanian attorney Ricardo Leyton and 28  other Panamanian and U.S. citizens have been arrested in Tampa,  Florida, on charges of conspiring to launder money. News  Director Julio Miller is on the telephone with Roberto Leyton,  former Panamanian ambassador to the OAS.    Miller: Mr. Leyton, is this information from the  United States true?    Leyton: I can only tell you what I know, which is  what my brother's lawyers told me when I talked to them at noon.  They told me that the charge is indeed conspiracy to launder  money, and that my brother has reiterated his absolute  innocence. They have said that there is no specific accusation  against my brother. They themselves concede that they have  never seen anything similar to this because my brother has not  been accused of conducting any transactions with cash money,  which is what is regularly referred to as money laundering--an  attempt to convert money obtained illegally into cash.    According to what my brother has told them, he has strictly  abided by Panamanian laws; all money transfers were conducted  with the proper authorization of the people he was representing;  and those transfers never involved cash money, but were bank  transactions of money that had already been deposited in  renowned banks. According to him, he has done nothing different  from what corporate lawyers do in Panama.    Miller: Mr. Leyton, what about the involvement of  companies such as Merryl-Lynch and the existence of 45 kg of  cocaine that were going to be introduced in the United States?    Leyton: I repeat again: I have no information  regarding any drug accusations against my brother, only about  the charge of conspiring to launder money. From a newscast I  watched before, I think Merryl-Lynch is involved, but I have no  proof of this. My sole concern is my brother.    Miller: When will a decision be made?    Leyton: I have no information on that. All I know  is there will be a hearing on 4 March to determine bail. The  lawyers have already told me that it is difficult for foreigners  to obtain bail because they have no collateral. My brother does  not have enough resources to make a deposit as large as the one  they usually request, however, there will be a hearing to  discuss this matter.    I want to use this opportunity to denounce the slander and  evil intentions of people who have tried to involve me in this  matter. I have nothing to do with this situation, I do not even  work with my brother. We have not even had a single client in  common. Ricardo is my brother, I believe he is innocent, and I  will support him as his brother, but we run our offices  independently. I do not know for sure if there are political  motivations behind this, but I want to explain that my brother  and I do not even belong to the same political party or follow  the same political trends. Do you have any more questions?    Miller: Thanks, Mr. Leyton. We are very grateful  for your statement.    Fonseca: During his first statement in Tampa,  Ricardo Leyton has maintained his innocence. With regard to  this case, 28 persons have been arrested. Thus far, reports  have mentioned that Luis Sanchez, a businessman, and Ricardo  McFadden, an auditor, were arrested with Leyton in Tampa. RPC  Television learned that on 4 March, the Tampa Court will decide  whether or not Leyton and the other 28 suspects will be freed on  bail. RPC reports indicate that several covert DEA agents  infiltrated the group of presumed investors, and that they were  the ones to leak the information and provide the details to  issue an arrest warrant against Leyton and the others who are  accused.</p>

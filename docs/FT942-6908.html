			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail Pounds 4.8m in red after provisions Merchant Retail Group announced losses before tax of Pounds 4.83m in the year ended April 2, after the expected Pounds 3.5m provision for redundancy costs and stock and equipment write-downs at the Normans food subsidiary. Mr Eric Kinder, chairman of the retailing group, said the food division had been through its most difficult year ever. Sales fell by Pounds 5m to Pounds 127m. Group sales, excluding VAT, declined to Pounds 167.1m, against Pounds 169.7m when there were pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m. A valuation of group properties has, as foreshadowed, resulted in a fall by Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 32.2m. Gearing rose to 69 per cent at the year end, excluding charge card debt of Pounds 4.76m. Losses per share were 6.91p (0.84p). As distributable reserves have now been eliminated it is not possible to pay a dividend. A total of 0.95p was paid in the previous year.</p>

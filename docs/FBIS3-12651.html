In a statement distributed here today, Khalid expressed his  convictions that the Oslo negotiators no longer have ample room  for maneuvering. He added that they must halt the current  negotiations and abrogate the Oslo and Cairo agreements. They  should not return to the negotiations unless the Rabin  government pledges to honor international legitimacy's  resolutions on settlements and comply with the terms of  reference agreed upon for the negotiating process.    Khalid asserted that it it fails to take such measures, then  the Palestinian leadership must tender its resignation and call  the Palestine National Council into session to elect a new  leadership.    For his part, PLO Executive Committee member 'Abd-al-Rahim  Malluh has said: We reject Yitzhaq Rabin's perception of  international protection for our people in the occupied  territories. He indicated that Israel is attempting to absorb  the indignation elicited by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  and to cover up for this heinous crime.    Malluh asserted that the meetings held by the PLO Executive  Committee to consider its negotiating position in the aftermath  of the Hebron massacre were illegal. He added that the members  attending these meetings were a minority, and that most members  did not attend.</p>

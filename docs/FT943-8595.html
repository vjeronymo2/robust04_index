			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Hang Seng Bank interim results below expectations Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, lifted net profits by 13.2 per cent to HKDollars 3.1bn (USDollars 401m) for the first half of 1994 from HKDollars 2.7bn in the same period last year, but the result was below expectations. Operating profits were squeezed by the narrowing of the spread between the best lending rate and the savings deposit rate; the elimination of exchange gains on Hong Kong dollar notes (following the change of the settlement currency to Hong Kong dollars in January); and the reversal in the latter half of last year of an over-provision relating to the accrued liabilities of the staff retirement benefit schemes. Sir Quo-Wei Lee, chairman, said: 'Competition for deposits remained intense, in particular Hong Kong dollar wholesale deposits, and the interest margin was under pressure. In such an operating environment, Hang Seng's result for the first half of 1994 was satisfactory.' The market had been looking for growth in excess of 15 per cent, but disappointment in results from the banking sector had already been signalled by Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third biggest listed bank, which last month reported a 12 per cent improvement at the interim stage. Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank which is one of Hong Kong's three note issuing banks, added to the gloom in the colony's banking sector last week when it reported a drop in profits from Hong Kong, to Pounds 108m (USDollars 167.40m) from Pounds 122m. Hang Seng said government measures to cool property prices, announced in June but signalled in March, had already fed through to a slowdown in mortgage lending. The bank is paying an interim dividend of HKDollars 0.60, up 20 per cent on the HKDollars 0.50 paid out last year at the interim stage. However, directors were quick to warn that this should not be construed as an indication of the profit trend in the second half, but rather as a symptom of Hang Seng's strong capital base, reflected in its 27.8 per cent risk asset ratio. Earnings per share stand at HKDollars 1.61, up from HKDollars 1.42 in the first half of 1993. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were slashed to HKDollars 43.8m, compared with HKDollars 72.3m in the same period last year.</p>

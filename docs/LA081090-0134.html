			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHARGED IN $3.8-MILLION INSIDER TRADING SCHEME  </P> <P> A former Smith Barney broker, a former lawyer from a prestigious corporate law  firm and the broker's sister have been charged with participating in a  $3.8-million insider trading scheme, federal prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Eben Smith, 41, of Greenwich, Conn., a former broker in the Stamford, Conn.,  office of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., was indicted by a federal grand  jury on 10 counts relating to insider trading.  </P> <P> Steven Glauberman, 39, of Manhattan, a former associate of the Skadden, Arps,  Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom law firm, was named in a 10-count criminal  information filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office.  </P> <P> The filing of a criminal information means that a defendant has waived the  right to an indictment and often indicates that a plea agreement is being  negotiated.  </P> <P> If convicted, both men face a maximum sentence of five years in prison. They  also face a $250,000 fine on each count -- or a fine amounting to twice the  gross profits made through the alleged scheme.  </P> <P> Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington announced that  Glauberman settled related civil insider trading charges without admitting or  denying guilt.  </P> <P> His sister, Lori Glauberman, a former junior associate in the fixed-income  department at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., also settled civil insider charges  involving trading in her own account on inside tips.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, Steven Glauberman will repay $221,000 and his sister  $19,000 in illegal profit.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that Steven Glauberman, who worked in the merger and  acquisitions area, sold information to Smith about his law firm's clients who  were involved in takeover situations.  </P></p>

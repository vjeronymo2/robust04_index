			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Observer: Strong soap washed out The British public's excitement at their prime minister's use of the word 'bastards' must be incomprehensible to the Brazilians, who plainly look for stronger entertainment at the hands of their politicians. For example, they have long been breathlessly awaiting a new television soap opera called The Maharajah. Scheduled for prime-time screening, it weaves newsreel footage of the rise and fall of the impeached Fernando Collor into a plot about a woman reporter stumbling across a financial scam intended to keep a head of state in power for 30 years. Oddly enough, not only does the actor in the name role bear a remarkable likeness to the disgraced ex-president, but the actress playing the Maharajah's wife closely resembles the country's former first lady. Since the word 'Collor' never occurs in any of the episodes, however, the producers believed they would escape legal difficulties. The belief has just been rudely shattered. To the dismay of the country's TV viewers, the courts have granted an injunction banning the screening to lawyers acting for Collor, who's now awaiting criminal trial on corruption charges. Nevertheless, the producers aren't letting the banners get them down. They're confident their lawyers will soon get the injunction overturned, they say, and the publicity generated by the legal battle will set the soap-loving Brazilians positively bubbling with expectation.</p>

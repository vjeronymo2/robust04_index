			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: CU spells out its Victoire strategy Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, yesterday refused to rule out job cuts at Groupe Victoire, one of France's largest insurers which it bought this summer. Mr Tony Wyand, the new president appointed by CU to Victoire's board, said he aimed to keep administrative costs as a proportion of turnover on a continued downward trend. Mr Wyand indicated that job losses were likely to be in the order of a few percentage points, and that Victoire was already a 'well-run and efficient company'. Mr Bernard Pottier, vice-president, said: 'We will do what proves to be necessary.' He stressed that the main emphasis was to increase the connections between different parts of the group. This would include a reduction in the need for analysts and administrators, and the imposition of CU's style of monthly reporting, in contrast to the annual systems in operation at Victoire. CU revealed that the Victoire name would also become of diminishing importance, with the holding company for the French operations being retitled Commercial Union France. However, Mr Wyand stressed that the subsidiaries would continue to trade under their existing names, including Abeille Vie and L'Epargne de France. He said Victoire would probably remain the name for the group's asset management arm. The strategy for CU's operations in France would be in line with those of the group elsewhere: with profitability after tax equivalent to at least 8 per cent on capital invested above inflation. CU's broader objectives, he said, were to increase the proportion of life insurance, develop its activities in Europe and improve the quality and profitability of its casualty business. The exact price of the CU purchase of Victoire will be determined in December.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Women managers progress faster than male counterparts Women who break through into top managerial posts possess attributes enabling them to progress faster than their male counterparts, the British Psychological Society's conference heard yesterday. Mr Tuvio Melamed, a lecturer in occupational psychology at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, said women who rose above the 'glass ceiling' managerial barrier had the sort of qualities that marked them out as top executives. However the price of success could be associated with a risk to mental health. He said: 'The struggle of getting there makes them more introverted and anxious than men because the environment in which they have to work is so hostile.' Mr Melamed said career success for men was related to qualities of extrovert behaviour, dominance and confidence but this was not reflected in women high-flyers. Women needed to be 'more men than men' but also needed to fulfil additional criteria for success. 'Managerial women have to deal with extreme pressure and experience more severe degrees of tension and instability than their male colleagues,' he said.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Contract trouble CONTRACTING-OUT of services in the UK, an important part of the reform of Whitehall, appears to be threatened by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. These TUPE regulations implement the EC Acquired Rights Directive, which guarantees the employment rights of workers in mergers and acquisitions. Judgments in the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of the directive to contracting-out of public services. Where an undertaking is deemed to have been transferred in such cases, the TUPE regulations apply. The contractor is thus obliged to take over existing staff and to maintain for a period their pay and conditions. In some cases, this is proving a barrier to the rapid improvement in efficiency of contracted-out services. Even where the TUPE rules turn out not to be a problem for the new contractor, they cause damaging confusion at the bidding stage, since it is often unclear whether a contract will count as a transfer of an undertaking until after the contract is signed. A contractor who assumes TUPE does not apply could end up with a loss-making contract if it does. If the bid is framed expecting TUPE to apply, it will almost certainly be underbid by a contractor who assumes it will not. This uncertainty could undermine the government's programme for market-testing civil service work, to be explained to a business audience at a conference in London today. Ministers' response to the problem has been to ask the EC for a derogation from the directive under the procedures decided at the Edinburgh summit for enhancing subsidiarity. This is a sensible move but one without a strong chance of success, given the age of the directive and Britain's isolation on matters of social policy. In the shorter term, the government's options are not attractive. It could accept, implicitly, that TUPE does apply to public-sector contracting-out, which would remove the confusion, but tend to entrench costs. Or it could tell contractors that where a contract is unexpectedly judged to be subject to TUPE, government will carry the costs.</p>

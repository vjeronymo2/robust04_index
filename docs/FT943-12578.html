			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Sinn Fein dismisses Ulster proposals The UK government signalled last night that it would press ahead with the search for a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties after Sinn Fein dismissed the Downing Street declaration as inadequate. The rejection by a Sinn Fein national delegate conference appeared to confirm the London government's view that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, cannot persuade IRA hard-liners to call a cessation of violence. Amid anger and disappointment in London, British officials made clear that until there was a renunciation of violence there was no question of involving Sinn Fein in talks aimed at establishing a new political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hope to produce in September a framework document for such a settlement. Officials were dismissive of Sinn Fein's demand that the London and Dublin governments move further to 'clarify' the Downing Street declaration by diluting the veto of the unionists in Ulster over constitutional change. Mr Reynolds warned the response would mean continued terrorist violence. But he added: 'Some positive signals have emanated from the convention. The reservations expressed about the Downing Street declaration come as no real surprise at this stage. What is essential now is that all paramilitary organisations should stop the killing.' In its first formal response to the declaration, Sinn Fein described it as inadequate, but said that it would work to overcome the obstacles. It said the declaration was a 'step in the peace process' but did not 'deal adequately with some of the core issues and this is crucial'. Speaking last night at the delegate conference, called to approve the governing executive's response to the declaration, Mr Adams said Sinn Fein had 'recommitted itself today to constructing this foundation, by building on the positive elements of the Downing Street declaration and by seeking to overcome the difficulties'. However, Mr Adams stopped far short of calling on the IRA to end its campaign of violence, ending hopes that Sinn Fein would be able to take part in cross party talks that the UK and Irish governments hope will start this autumn. The Downing Street declaration offered a place at the negotiating table to Sinn Fein if it formally and permanently renounced violence. Ahead of the conference, held amid tight security in the border town of Letterkenny in the Republic of Ireland, there had been growing optimism that it would decide to call on the IRA to announce a summer ceasefire. But Mr Adams said yesterday the IRA would make its own decision on a ceasefire. Sinn Fein listed 10 aspects of the Downing Street declaration about which it was unhappy, including the so-called unionist veto over any changes in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Mr David Winnick, the Labour vice-chairman of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary association said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by Sinn Fein's response. Sinn Fein positive, Page 6</p>

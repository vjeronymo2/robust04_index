			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Legislator Chao Shao-kang yesterday revealed that,  over the last nearly 30 years, U.S. company RCA has dumped  organic waste harmful to human health into self-dug wells near  its factory, seriously polluting the underground water and soil  in Taoyuan's Chupei area. To prevent local residents from being  further harmed by drinking underground water, in addition to  urging the Environmental Protection Administration [EPA] to  examine how seriously local soil and underground water have been  polluted, Chao Shao-kang also hoped the Public Health  Administration [PHA] would investigate the matter. The following  is a report by Lin Sung-hua. [Begin recording]    Lin: Those living in Taoyuan's Chupei area should  be aware that the underground water you have been drinking might  have impaired your health for a long time. On 2 June,  Legislator Chao Shao-kang revealed that organic waste generated  from manufacturing electronics products by [words indistinct]  has been dumped either in the areas near the factory or into  wells the company dug near the factory, and this might have  caused harmful effects on local residents over the last nearly  30 years. Legislator Chao pointed out that the Taiwan U.S. RCA  Company, whose factory is located in Taoyuan's Chupei area, was  taken over by General Electric Company in 1986 and was again  taken over by Thompson Company two years later. When Thompson  Company purchased the factory, it was worried about pollution  problems and asked U.S. environmental protection company [name  indistinct] to take soil and underground water samples from the  areas near the factory for examination in the United States.  Results of the examination showed that the soil and underground  water contained very high concentrations of volatile organic  substances. Legislator Chao said Thompson Company planned to  hold a news briefing to explain the pollution caused by General  Electric. But it was worried that local residents might ask for  compensation, and so decided to seal off the wells and close  down the factory. Chao Shao-kang said [sentences indistinct].  He said the land where the factory is located has been sold to  China Electric Company and another company, who knew nothing  about the pollution problem. Because the land is within the  Taoyuan urban area, it might be developed into a commercial or  residential area. To prevent more people from being harmed,  Legislator Chao decided to expose the fact. He said both  Thompson and General Electric are well-known companies  throughout the world and they did pollute Chinese soil. After  making pollution money for nearly 30 years, they sold the land  at a profit -- their behavior is quite contemptible. In  addition to asking the government to sue the two companies at  the International Court, Legislator Chao also hoped the EPA will  immediately look into how serious the pollution is. He also  hoped the PHA will conduct epidemic diseases examination among  local residents so the government can assist them in demanding  compensation from the two companies. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Investing in News Corporation has always been an act of faith in Mr Rupert Murdoch's strategic vision. Yesterday's mildly disappointing third-quarter figures underline the point. Price cuts in UK newspapers and an unexpected write-off in US book publishing were the main reasons for the fall in operating profits from the wholly-owned parts of the empire. Without a timely gain in feature films - Mrs Doubtfire providing a box-office hit - only television would have shown progress over last year. Against that background, News's status as a growth stock looks a little odd. Even television may suffer next year as Fox Network's investment in American football rights adds to overheads. The main earnings momentum will probably continue to come from associated companies, notably BSkyB and Ansett. It is a credit to News's robust management style that these two have been turned around. But earnings from partially-owned operations might deserve a lower rating. A low tax charge - running at 11 per cent so far this financial year  -also argues for caution in valuing the shares. So long as the main planks in Mr Murdoch's strategy are secure, these factors are unlikely to unsettle the market. Investors will reason that a year or two of modest earnings growth is a price worth paying. If News suffers a set-back in its long term ambitions, though, shareholders may start to hunger for jam today.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Grim outlook from William Bedford Shares of William Bedford, the USM-traded antique restorer and dealer, yesterday fell 3p to 15p after Mr John Bedford, chairman, issued a strong warning on future trading. If the government's deflationary policies continued unchanged and sterling remained substantially overvalued against the dollar, then the outlook was 'grim', he said in his interim statement to June 30. In the opening six months sales rose 12 per cent to Pounds 914,000 and losses before tax were reduced from Pounds 76,000 to Pounds 22,000, after overheads were cut by nearly 15 per cent. The figures last time included Pounds 113,000 gain on sale of assets, less Pounds 85,000 compensation for loss of office. Losses per share came to 0.5p (1.07p).</p>

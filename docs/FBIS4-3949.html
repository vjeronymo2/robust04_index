			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang  began a special meeting of its Central Committee on Saturday [23  April] to consider constitutional-amendment proposals prepared  by a party task force.    The proposals are expected to be endorsed by the committee,  thus paving the way for some key changes in Taiwan's political  operations. Associate members of the committee and ranking  party officials are also attending the meeting to air their  views.    The meeting, which will conclude Sunday, is being held at  the  Chungshan Building in Yangmingshan, a Taipei suburb.    Speaking at the opening ceremony in his capacity as KMT  chairman, Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui  reiterated his idea of a country run by the people. "This is a  meeting to tell the people of the nation the ruling party's  determination to push ahead with constitutional reforms so as to  realize the idea of, 'the power belongs to the whole of the  people.'"    He urged the committee members to build consensus during the  meeting so as to help accomplish the mission of constitutional  reform.    If endorsed by the meeting, the proposals will be formally  submitted to the National Assembly, which is scheduled to  convene later this month.    In the draft proposals, the KMT will recommend several key  changes, including election of the president and vice president  by popular vote, rather than by members of the National  Assembly, as has been done in the past; installment of a speaker  and vice speaker in the National Assembly; and a restriction on  the premier's right to co-sign the laws promulgated and mandates  issued by the president.    The ruling party will also seek to extend the legislative  term from three years to four, [words indistinct] limit  legislator, right of immunity from prosecution for speeches  delivered during legislative sessions, and to change the  official name of the "Shanpao (mountain) people" to "aborigines."</p>

			<p>Industry   <F P=102>   94CE0487A Beijing COMPILATION OF DOCUMENTS ON MANAGING THE  OPENING UP AND OPERATION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY in </F>  Chinese Oct 93 pp 1-17  <F P=103> 94CE0487A </F> <F P=104>  Beijing COMPILATION OF DOCUMENTS ON MANAGING THE  OPENING UP AND OPERATION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY </F>  <F P=105>  Chinese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Documents compiled by the Ministry of Posts and </F> Telecommunications' Policy and Law Department; published by the  China Legal Publishing House in October 1993: "Compilation of  Documents on Managing the Opening up and Operation of the  Telecommunications Industry"]    [Text] State Council Circular Approving the Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications' Ideas on Better Improving  Telecommunications Service Market Management (3 August 1993)    The State Council has approved the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications' [MPT] "Ideas on Better Improving  Telecommunications Service Market Management," and is now  transmitting them to you, asking that they be implemented  conscientiously.  <H5>  Ideas on Better Improving Telecommunications Service Market </H5> Management    To adapt to the needs of reform, opening, and socialist  modernization, by better conforming to and serving our economic  development focus, the posts and telecommunications sector,  while striving to build a uniform, complete, and advanced  national communications network, needs to fully tap all specific  communications network potentials, by arousing the initiative of  all parties, to speed up communications industry development.    In recent years, China has opened up to the public some  telecommunications service operations. The telecommunications  services that are now open to public operation are: wireless  call-finder services; 800 MHz (megahertz) colony phone services;  450 MHz (megahertz) wireless mobile communications services;  domestic VSAT (very small antenna terminal) communications  services; telephone information service business; computer  information service business; electronic mailbox services;  electronic data exchange services; video chart and document  services; other telecommunications services approved or  permitted by the State Council or MPT.    To preserve normal communications order, ensure state and  user communications safety and communications service quality,  and create a climate of fair competition, we need to improve our  management of telecommunications service markets that have been  opened to operation. So we are setting forth the following ideas:    1. For open-operating [deregulated-operation]  telecommunications services, we should practice declaration and  operating license systems. For all operations at the  provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal level, local posts  and telecommunications management departments should take  declarations, be responsible for examining, approving, and  issuing operating licenses, and report to MPT for the record.  For trans-provincial (-autonomous regional, -municipal)  operations, MPT should take declarations, and be responsible for  examining, approving, and issuing operating licenses [permits].  Without examination and approval, no unit or individual should  be allowed to operate the abovementioned telecommunications  services without authorization. As to specific application  regulations for declaration and operating permit systems, MPT  will draw up and publish them according to the abovementioned  ideas. Units already operating the abovementioned  telecommunications services should make up the pertinent  formalities per provision.    2. Units applying to operate wireless communications  services must apply for operating permits to the MPT or their  local posts and telecommunications management departments  according to the stipulated examination and approval  jurisdiction, and can operate only after obtaining operating  frequencies approved by the wireless management sector based on  operating permits.    3. Departments and individuals that obtain approval to  operate the abovementioned telecommunications services may not  set up regional barriers, and must observe the pertinent  national communications policies, laws, and regulations, submit  to trade management, oversight, and inspection by the  responsible state communications department, guarantee  telecommunications service quality, strictly execute state  expense policy and pertinent fee-collection [charge] standards,  pay taxes according to law, and protect the legitimate rights  and interests of users. Service operations may not obstruct  the normal operation of the national public telecommunications  network or communications development, or impede the regular  operations of other specific communications networks.    4. The responsible state communications departments must  create a climate of fair competition for posts and  telecommunications enterprises and other enterprises that  operate communications services. Posts and telecommunictions  enterprises at all levels should act according to the principles  of compensated use and reciprocity and the state of supply and  demand, and cooperate with each other. Units approved by the  responsible state communications departments and holding  telecommunications service operating permits must provide items,  such as the basic relay equipment and lines necessary for  service, to ensure that they provide good telecommunications  service to the public.    5. Foreign firms may not operate or participate in the  operation of communications services in China. No cable or  wireless communications services of the public and specific  communications networks in China may by operated or participated  in by any outside group, enterprise or individual, or by the  wholly foreign-owned enterprises or Sino-foreign joint or  contractual joint ventures already in operation in China, nor  may they attract foreign investment in any form for shareholding  operation.    6. MPT and all provincial, autonomous regional, and  municipal  posts and telecommunications management departments must oversee  and inspect the execution of the abovementioned provisions.  Posts and telecommunications enterprises and other units  operating telecommunications services that violate the  abovementioned provisions will be respectively warned,  criticized by circular, given deadlines by which to put things  right, ordered to stop operating, have their illegal operating  income confiscated, and be subjected to administrative fines,  all the way to penalties, such as revocation of operating  permits. Posts and telecommunications departments at all levels  are absolutely forbidden to exploit license-issuance  opportunities for personal gain, or to secure advantages through  pull or influence, and once discovered doing so will be punished  severely.  <H5>  Intermim Regulations on Managing the Examination and </H5> Approval of Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services  (published by MPT on 11 September 1993)    Article 1.

MPT has acted in line with  this State Council circular, by drawing up the "Interim  Regulations on Examination and Approval Management of  Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services"  (abbreviated hereafter as "Management Regulations"), which will  be issued and put into effect. In order to better implement  the State Council circular and MPT's management regulations, we  are specially setting forth the following requirements:    1. All posts and telecommunications management departments  will organize their concerned cadres to conscientiously study  and master the spirit of these documents, ensuring that  cadres' ideological understanding and views conform to the  spirit of these documents. To ensure the smooth progress of  the tasks of examination and approval, making up and undergoing  operating-permit formalities, and taking declarations, all posts  and telecommunications management departments will apropriately  replenish their trade management staffs and, after receiving  MPT's management regulations, will investigate, study, and  present specific ideas on implementing these documents, promptly  reporting them to provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal  people's governments. We will publish in the press the State  Council circular and MPT's management regulations, as well as  publishing an announcement clarifying the pertinent policies,  and publicizing the names, contacts, and contact phone numbers  of the posts and telecommunications management departments  handling these tasks, for the convenience of units applying or  undergoing make-up formalities for operating telecommunications  services.    2. All posts and telecommunications management departments  will provide stronger leadership to communications enterprises  at all levels and ideological indoctrination to the concerned  employees, to create good public terms for fair competition by  the clearly deregulated-operation telecommunications services.    Communications enterprises will do all they can to promptly  provide the relay lines needed to start service to units that  have received permission to operate telecommunications services,  and are prohibited from setting up obstacles or creating  difficulties on any grounds, or engaging in unhealthy tendencies  in any form.    All posts and telecommunications management departments will  certainly stand with the state, conscientiously performing  examination and approval management for deregulated-operation  telecommunications services. Examination and approval  employees will act impartially, being absolutely forbidden to  abuse their authority for private gain or secure advantage  through pull or influence. They will publicize oversight phone  numbers, conscientiously subjecting themselves to public  oversight.    3. As the policy on examination and approval management of  deregulated-operation telecommunications services is very  strong, all posts and telecommunications management departments  will strictly enforce MPT provisions and, in coordination with  actual local realities, conscientiously perform their trade  management functions, by carrying out their examination and  approval management justly and rationally. Pertinent policies  and actual problems encountered in this work will be promptly  reported to MPT.  <H5>  MPT Circular on Taking Applications and Make-Up Applications </H5> for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services (11  October 1993)    As required by State Council circular, MPT published on 11  September 1993 the "Interim Regulations on Examination and  Approval Management for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications  Services" (abbreviated hereafter as "Examination and Approval  Management Regulations"), deciding to begin taking applications  for deregulated-operation telecommunications services on 1  November 1993. Units already providing deregulated-operation  telecommunications services must act in line with the provisions  of the "Examination and Approval Management Regulations," by  making up the operating-permit or declaration formalities before  31 December 1993; those that pass the deadline for making up  formalities or are determined through examination to be  unqualified to operate may not continue to operate, and will be  penalized according to the pertinent provisions in the  "Examination and Approval Management Regulations."    All applications for deregulated-operation  telecommunications  services on the provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal  level will be subject to examination and approval by the posts  and telecommunications management departments in the  provinces (autonomus regions, municipalities) in which they are  located; applications for trans-provincial, -autonomous  regional, and -municipal deregulated-operation  telecommunications services will be subject to MPT examination  and approval.  <H5>  MPT and State Administration for Industry and Commerce </H5> Circular on Pertinent Examination and Approval Management Issues  for Deregulated-Operation Telecommunications Services (14  October 1993)    To implement the "State Council Circular Approving the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Ideas on Better  Improving Telecommunications Service Market Management"  (National Document #55 [1993]), by preserving a normal  communications order and meeting public communications needs, we  are here presenting a circular on pertinent issues involved in  the management of examination and approval of  deregulated-operation telecommunications services:    1.

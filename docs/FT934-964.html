			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Licence-term boost for Lottery The National Lottery licence has been extended by six months to a full seven years to give the operator a better chance of recovering the money invested. The change was made by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the lottery, in the formal application documents published yesterday. In November Mr Davis said the licence would expire on March 31 2001, which meant the licence would run for no more than 6 1/2 years because the winner will probably not be chosen until next May and is unlikely to launch before late 1994. The licence will now run until September 30 2001, making it at least possible that the licence will cover seven years. Mr Davis also confirmed yesterday that he was giving applications the right to publish as much or as little about their applications as they wanted to. However, he is providing guidelines on what should be made public and suggests he would 'prefer applicants to restrict their publication to those guidelines'. 'The level of interest in and enthusiasm for the National Lottery, demonstrated by potential applicants and other interested parties has been very encouraging,' Mr Davis said. Those interested in applying to run the lottery must submit a letter of intent by January 14 and full bids by February 14. At least eight applications are expected from groups ranging from The Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada, Carlton Communications and Associated Newspapers, to Camelot, a consortium including Cadbury Schweppes, The Rank Organisation and Mr Richard Branson's UK Lottery Foundation. Meanwhile, The Great British Lottery Company yesterday announced that Lord Kingsdown, the former governor of the Bank of England, and Sir Kenneth Newman, former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, have been appointed non-executive directors.</p>

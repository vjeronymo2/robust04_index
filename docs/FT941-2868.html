			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Davis Service advances to Pounds 21.8m Davis Service Group, the business services company formerly known as Godfrey Davis, saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 21.8m in 1993 though underlying trading profits were flat. The figures were boosted by the Pounds 52m acquisition of the HSS tool hire business from John Mowlem in May, which made a Pounds 2.9m contribution after financing costs. The deal was funded largely by a Pounds 34.7m share placing. Mr John Ivey, chief executive, said that HSS had performed slightly better than expected with demand showing some recovery in the fourth quarter. 'We were lucky to buy it at the right time.' Operating profits from continuing operations slipped from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 19m due to problems in the textile maintenance division where profits fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 12.2m. The workwear manufacturing business, which broke even in 1992, fell into the red on sales of around Pounds 20m due to stiff competition from both UK and overseas suppliers. Mr Ivey said the company was undertaking 'a detailed review' of its manufacturing operation and declined to say whether it formed part of the group's long-term plans. Profits from portable building rental rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.8m and support services, which supplies cleaning and catering services, saw profits jump 20 per cent to Pounds 3.7m. However this growth stemmed largely from new contracts won at the end of 1992. Little new work was taken on last year due to the confusion over whether the Tupe regulations protecting employees' rights when their employer changes hands apply to contracting out of services. The group's policy is not to take on new public sector contracts until the position is clarified. Mr Ivey said that HSS's profits for the year as a whole were 20 per cent up on 1992 on turnover 13 per cent higher. The company is looking to add 20 new branches to the HSS network this year. Reported earnings per share rose from 14.36p to 15.49p, but adjusting for gains and losses on disposals earnings edged up from 15p to 15.1p. Dividends are held at 7.98p with a final of 5.25p. COMMENT But for the HSS acquisition, Davis's prospects would be looking distinctly dull. There is scope for recovery in textile rental, though its markets will not pick up in a hurry, and workwear manufacturing should be back in the black this year but support services have been snared in the legislative tangle over contracting out. Luckily Davis picked up HSS at just the right time and, unlike Mowlem, can afford to invest in it. Supplying small builders and the DIY market it has already seen demand pick up nicely and its full year contribution could take profits to over Pounds 25m putting the shares at 261p on a multiple of little over 15. One for the more conservative investor.</p>

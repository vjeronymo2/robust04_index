			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Spanish recipe for recession-proof success - A restaurateur from humble beginnings A BOTTLE of Taittinger costs just Pounds 19.95 in a most stylish restaurant in Wales' capital city. The list of over 120 Riojas, vintage Vega Sicilia and vintage ports shows the Iberian connection. The wine cellar contains over 25,000 bottles, and there are 200 cases of en primeur claret in Bordeaux. This is a very serious business. The menu offers a wide choice of fish which regularly includes sea bass, oysters, lobster, turbot, parrot fish, baramundi and cod. Prices start at Pounds 3 for a simple meal of a burger and jacket potato and rise to about Pounds 15 for baked sea bass. Here shoppers may sit alongside the local tycoons, and enjoy the food and atmosphere. Le Monde, in St Mary's Street Cardiff, owned and run by Benigo Martinez, is a smooth, sophisticated and highly successful operation. Martinez, who has just turned 50, is the son of a fisherman from the village of Carino in Galicia in north west Spain. His little empire includes a three-restaurant complex in Cardiff, with Champers and La Brasserie below Le Monde, La Braseria, 40 miles away in Swansea and the recently revamped Caesar's Arms at Creigiau, north of Cardiff. Last year turnover was around Pounds 4m, a far cry from the Pounds 150-a-week the Blue Anchor pub took before Martinez turned it into Casa Martinez in 1974. He employs over 100 and is looking for just one thing in the recession - expansion. In 1964 Benigo Martinez (known to all as Martin), came to Cardiff to work in the Model Inn, a pub-steak house. His first venture in 1970 was a late night drinks bar, the Club Incognito, which catered to late night revellers for over a decade. He started expanding in 1974 when he converted the old Blue Anchor into a wine bar, Casa Martinez. A little later he revamped the adjacent pub, the Royal Oak, into a similar theme bar called Matisse. Both were late night disco drinkeries, financed by a bank loan of a little over Pounds 20,000, and takings approached Pounds 400,000 after two years. As other cheaper dives entered the late-drinks trade, Martinez identified a market niche left open when the sherry-and-steak Berni Inns fell from fashion. In 1981 Casa Martinez was inexpensively transformed into a Spanish style bodega called Champers. Champers is crammed with paraphernalia from Spanish villages and has the warm atmosphere of a Mediterranean taverna, filled with the aroma of food cooked on an open grill. Steaks are served sizzling on an iron slab, with relish and jacket potato. The Spanish wines are plentiful and cheap. Martinez piles the many bargains on the bar, including champagne, at prices below the retail in nearby wine shops. It took almost a year to popularise the steak theme, and two years to reach again the turnover the clubs had enjoyed. By 1983 the style was established and popular and Matisse became La Brasserie, with French decor and wines. In the 1980s Martinez noticed a growing demand for fish. The success of Harry Ramsden's fish and chip empire, inspired a calculated gamble to introduce the dish to a stylish 'all black' restaurant with a nightclub atmosphere, Le Monde, which cost more than Pounds 100,000. The success led to a wider range of fish and cooking styles: seafoods grilled on a large parilla became familiar large fish baked entirely buried in sea salt, a speciality of his home village. These dishes brought a theatrical style of presentation. In spite of the surge in the number of customers, Martinez has held prices at a modest level. A fat sirloin sells for under a Pounds 10, most fish costs Pounds 6-Pounds 8 and house wine, from Maufoux, is only Pounds 6.95 a bottle. Over 100 dozen are sold weekly, and 350 cases of champagne are slurped annually. Although turnover soared mark-ups remained modest, particularly on wine, averaging 48 per cent. Few restaurants would survive on such slim margins - most aim for 60-65 per cent. The prices and efficient service means seats are turned over two and a half times in an evening. This rises to almost four on a busy weekend. At an average of Pounds 20-Pounds 25 a head the seat yield is healthy. The high turnover means that the relative level of fixed costs is low. The highly professional level of service, brings a wage bill of over Pounds 20,000 a week but this amounts to only 25 per cent of turnover. Fixed overheads are 12 per cent, leaving a healthy bottom line of around 10 per cent. The level of profits has encouraged the group to expand while so many others are winding down. In 1986, Martinez snapped up a run-down pub in a prime spot on the main approach route to Swansea, the second-largest city in Wales and turned it into La Braseria following the same formula. Three years ago the group redeveloped Le Monde at a cost of more than Pounds 500,000. The all black decor seems to hold some strange attraction for the capital city of the rugby fraternity. It is rarely other than packed. The latest venture is Caesar's Arms in the tiny and remote village of Creigiau. The previous owners struggled on takings of around Pounds 1,500 a week. Martinez rebuilt the pub at a cost of Pounds 100,000 adding a heated terrace. The rural formula, with al fresco dining is drawing a clientele from the wealthiest outposts of Cardiff and the villages around it. Martinez says he has provided what the market has dictated. Perhaps he never believed he would be as up-market as Le Monde. and Caesar's where weekly he sells several hundred oysters, over 100 lobsters and over ten stone of sea bass and dover sole. Martinez runs a tight ship with regular stock controls. He could step into any of the jobs at any of the restaurants and believes that personally overseeing the operation is a vital ingredient to its success. His working week is rarely less than 80 hours.

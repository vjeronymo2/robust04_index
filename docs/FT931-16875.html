			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: The Polish dealer feeding the EC market - Chris Bobinski meets a businessman whose gaze stretches from the Atlantic to the Urals THE revolution which swept communism out of eastern Europe helped make Jan Kulczyk rich. The single market is likely to make him richer. This 42-year-old Polish millionaire, clad soberly in grey slacks and a blue blazer, has moved with apparent ease from the old world of communist rule to the new one where capitalism holds sway - and where the whole of Europe now appears a place to make money. Controlling 36 companies with sales approaching 3,000bn zloty (Pounds 124m), Mr Kulczyk's interests include banking, Volkswagen vehicle distribution in Poland and, above all, agribusiness. A mild-mannered cosmopolitan - he pays taxes in Germany and has homes in Berlin, Lugano, Poznan and Warsaw - he uses his spare cash to sponsor classical music festivals. Mr Kulczyk made his fortune selling fruit, vegetables and meat to the EC. Now, in addition, he buys western food processing machinery to sell in the east. He says the single market will act as a powerful spur to this form of two-way trade with the Community - a process which should eventually benefit east and west. Frontier-free trading will give Poland particular benefits by easing access to western technology, he believes. But some of his preoccupations are more mundane. Musing on the new opportunities for cross-border trading of livestock as a result of the ending of EC customs controls, he enthuses: 'I will no longer have to send sheep specifically to one country.' Prospects for increased EC commerce depend crucially on improving transport links. Mr Kulczyk and other businessmen want to build a 270km toll motorway linking Berlin to his native Poznan and beyond. A feasibility study on the project is to be ready next month and Mr Kulczyk says western road building consortia have promised Dollars 800m (Pounds 526.3m) of credits once the plan gets the green light from the authorities. A further landmark in 1993 is another sign of Poland's changing business times. He is on the board of the state owned bank, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which is to be privatised in 1993. The bank, like the PZU state insurance company, is a shareholder in the motorway development company. Mr Kulczyk, whose corporate career started in 1975, believes Polish businessmen will link the new capitalist markets in the east and the extended free trade area of the west. Business associates say the gift of getting quickly to the point is just one of his talents. 'He combines a romantic Slav nature with Germanic ability to organise,' says one admiring colleague. His family business, started by his father in 1956, has had plenty of practice at building economic bridges. Mr Kulczyk senior set up a West Berlin-based food trading company which entered co-operation with several Polish state agricultural exporters. Some of these have now been privatised  -and are now controlled by Mr Kulczyk. The original Berlin company has now been transformed into Kulczyk Aussenhandel, importing food processing plant into Poland and the former Soviet republics. In another example of his activities, Mr Kulczyk has teamed up with Krupp to help build near Poznan a Dollars 100m 150,000 tonnes per year processing plant, a venture which will increase Poland's rapeseed processing capacity by a quarter. Such deals have brought Mr Kulczyk profits - and a distaste for publicity. 'Too much exposure at home tends to bring trouble,' he says. As for the future, Mr Kulczyk says Poland should live in 'symbiosis' with its more highly industrialised neighbours to the west. 'Workers in the European Community shouldn't feel that low wage employees in Poland are a threat to their jobs,' he declares, displaying what appears to be somewhat exaggerated belief in EC workers' espousal of the vision of international capitalism. 'Rather, this offers a chance to expand their companies' business.' Mr Kulczyk's European horizons stretch east as well as west. Last year he helped set up Euro Agro Centrum, a company which aims to sell food processing equipment from western Europe to countries like Ukraine. 'There, the possibilities are boundless,' he says. Mr Kulczyk clearly believes the single market has a lot further to go; and the direction will be predominantly eastwards. 'Ukraine,' he adds, 'is the future.' Poland, Mr Kulczyk says, should make the best of its natural advantages, here and now, and that does not mean high tech products but simpler things - such as roads for transit traffic and food production.</p>

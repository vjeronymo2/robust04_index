			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Appointments: Hanson man for Hadleigh HADLEIGH INDUSTRIES, the troubled USM-quoted mini-conglomerate which had substantially to restate the size of its interim losses last month, has hired a man from Hanson to help put its finances in order. Nigel Davis, 38, who has spent 11 years with various Hanson subsidiaries, has been appointed finance director in place of David Maddison who resigned after the company was forced to restate its first half pre-tax losses from Pounds 283,000 to Pounds 535,000. The company, whose shares have fallen from a peak of 228p to 52p, has also added an independent outsider to a board of directors which has seen an unusually heavy turnover since the company came to the market three years ago. John Pickard, 62, a former chief executive of Serck Group and F H Lloyd and currently deputy chairman of Bimec Industries, has joined the company as a non-executive director. Hadleigh plans to add an additional non-executive director in May but the company has made no progress in replacing Brian Lowery, the chief executive of its engineering division, who resigned earlier this year.</p>

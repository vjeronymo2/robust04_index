Molirena, Morena, and the Civic Renewal Party have formed an  alliance to promote the candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles for  president of the Republic. Julia Elena Alvear interviewed a top  Molirena leader:    [Begin recording] [Molirena President Alfredo Ramirez]  Molirena's Political Committee decided unanimously to recommend  to the party's convention the candidacy of Professor Ruben Dario  Carles for president of the Republic.    [Alvear] What happened in the past few hours? Apparently no  agreement was reached with the Arnulfist Party?    [Ramirez] We failed to reach an agreement with other groups,  but we did reach an agreement with the person who is now our  presidential candidate, Professor Carles.    [Alvear] Mr. Ramirez, do you think you will win with  Professor Carles?    [Ramirez] Yes, or we would not have chosen him. If we did  not consider him a trump card, we would not have chosen him.    [Alvear] What about the alliances?    [Ramirez] We will be allied with the parties that are  already supporting Carles and other parties that I am sure will  also support his candidacy.    [Alvear] What about Mr. Guillermo Ford?    [Ramirez] He is among the greatest men of Molirena. He has  been applauded and supported by the entire party for his  unselfish attitude. [applause] Guillermo Ford is among the  greatest figures in Panamanian politics and among the most  prominent figures of Molirena. [applause] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IMF PRODS EAST BLOC ON REFORM  </P> <P> The head of the International Monetary Fund today urged East European countries  to move quickly toward market economies.  </P> <P> Warning against half-measures in Eastern Europe, IMF Managing Director Michel  Camdessus stressed that market reform programs must be introduced as rapidly as  possible and must be as general as possible for them to succeed.  </P> <P> "You can't take a little liberalization of prices, a little autonomy of  enterprises . . . a little less state regulation, because that doesn't work,"  he said.  </P> <P> He also emphasized the need for a "social safety net" to cushion the impact of  the reforms on vulnerable sectors of the population.  </P> <P> "The passage to a market economy does not create poverty, but it reveals it,"  he said. "The characteristics of a centralized economy are unemployment and  inflation in waiting. When you liberalize prices . . . these increase."  </P></p>

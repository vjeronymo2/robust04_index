			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Progress on EC steel capacity THE RESTRUCTURING of the recession-torn European steel industry took a step forward yesterday when the European Commission agreed a loan scheme to help producers make capacity cuts. The scheme is a key element in the European Community's efforts to enable the industry to shed 30m tonnes in excess crude steel capacity. But steel industry observers warned last night that the much-needed restructuring of the industry - most of which is losing money heavily in spite of recent price increases - still faces big obstacles before it can be implemented. The Commission said it would provide loans to companies, grouped along three product lines, which agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts made by the end of next year. The loans would be paid back by the companies which did not cut capacity. Officials said the fund would earmark about Ecu1bn (Dollars 1.17bn) to cover capacity cuts of 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip, 2m tonnes of plates and 2.5m tonnes of heavy section. In February, the Commission gave steelmakers until September 30 to present closure programmes to qualify for its rescue plan. However, the original timetable has slipped because of the deadlock in the summer in the Commission's negotiations over state subsidies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Constantine Maximov in Moscow] </F>   [Text] Many changes have taken place in the core of Russian  military philosophy as a result of changes in the international  community, the restriction of Russian arms sales because of  internal political and economic crises, and the departure of  Russian scientists--as is reported--to escape deteriorating  living conditions.    AL-SAFIR met with Mikhail Mali, head of the Russian National  Security Council Committee, who is participating in the  supervision of military production. It asked him about the  future of military production, which he showed some optimism  about. We had the following dialogue.    [AL-SAFIR] What is the condition of the Russian military  industry institution? Is it still capable of exporting modern  military equipment and arms abroad?    [Mali] I posed such questions in a meeting with President  Boris Yeltsin recently. The president then read a statement  from our ambassador in Bangladesh in which the latter says that,  for no reason whatsoever, we are allowing tenders, one after the  other, to be awarded to other countries. In this way, we are  opening up markets in which we previously had a strong position  to competitors who are defeating us with our own weapons.    Of course, the Middle East has its own special character.  Regarding Bangladesh, we could have made millions of dollars  there. We need this money so that the mechanisms for production  will be set up at the Aviastart installation in Ulyanovsk, which  we opened to manufacture Tu-204 planes.    We exhibited the most modern samples of Russian military  weapons and equipment in Abu Dhabi and China. Military  industry, despite the setbacks it has had, is capable of  exporting competitive equipment. We have decided that from now  on we will not attempt to sell old models. While previously the  Soviet Union did not hesitate to sell old weapons, we sell new  weapons as much as possible without affecting our defense  capabilities. We have displayed the newest weapons, beginning  with modern projectiles and ending with airplanes, missiles,  electronics, and modern optical equipment.    In Abu Dhabi, we proposed to the Americans staging a battle  between the Russian T-80 tank and the American Abrams. The  members of our tank team volunteered to stage the battle because  they were convinced they would win. The Americans rejected the  offer. Their rejection was an indication that they accept the  fact that the Russian tank is superior in combat.    We could export new weapons to the amount of 10-12 billion  [currency not specified] a year despite the fact that our  weapons exports in 1992 dropped to $3.5 billion. We can also  flood the market with spare parts for our weapons and military  equipment. It is no coincidence that the prime minister decided  to supervise the exports of weapons because of his  dissatisfaction with what has been happening so far.    [AL-SAFIR] How is Russia doing in the arms markets,  especially in the Middle East?    [Mali] With the dissolution of the contract between the  Soviet republics and turning the page on the Soviet regime, the  internal political problems overshadowed all others. Russia, at  that time, according to the opinion of many Russian politicians,  directed its energies toward coping with these problems that  were much more important. The production of the most modern  models of military equipment and the export of weapons was not a  priority. It was only natural for us to lose a part of our  trade market immediately.    The arms trade is more difficult than the trade in gold or  diamonds due to the force of habit that controls it. We have no  existence in a number of markets now after we stopped exporting  spare parts and ammunition. We failed to meet the schedules for  exports and have not taken into consideration the situation in  Syria, for example, or Jordan, Tunisia, Libya, or Algeria. I  regret that Algeria, according to information I have, bought  non-Russian military equipment, as did India. Yes, we do not  have a presence in some markets anymore. However, we hope to  return to these markets. As of 1994, we will resume our regular  activities. I hope we will regain our positions in the arms  markets and acquire a better position than we had before.    The president has signed a decree stipulating raising the  minimum salaries of workers in the military industry by eight  times more than the salaries in the rest of the sectors. The  military industry will be granted 20 percent of the price of  products the state orders from it before delivery of the  products. Such a step will give confidence to those who work in  the field and they will become more creative in new equipment.  As for the approval of the military philosophy, it has enabled  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to develop a plan for  arming the military until the year 2000.    [AL-SAFIR] What kind of weapons can Russia sell to the Arab  countries?    [Mali] I believe we can sell the weapons that we exhibited  there this year, particularly air defense missiles. These  missiles can be used to destroy targets on the ground, at sea,  and in the air. It has been shown in practice that the  S-300,000 missiles are capable of destroying aerial targets and  ships 180 kms off shore. They can also be launched from ships  to destroy a whole regiment of tanks on shore after specially  equipped planes locate their position. We have models of such  planes. In short, these sea-ground, sea-air, and  surface-to-surface missiles are unique and multi-purpose weapons.    [AL-SAFIR] Can Russia produce weapons and equipment fit for  use in the Middle East climate?    [Mali] We benefited a great deal from the Abu Dhabi military  fair. The Russian delegation included all senior weapons  designers to see for themselves soldiers who are unlike Russian  soldiers, who do not complain of severe winter cold nor of hot  summer weather. The soldiers of many countries are used to  comfortable conditions. Thus the military industry sector, which  will be requested to promote exports, is required to produce  weapons and equipment fit for use in tropical and desert  regions. These weapons and equipment must be fit for use in the  areas where they will be exported and ensure comfort for  personnel using them, meet certain technical specifications, and  are easily guided and aimed.    [AL-SAFIR] Are the various products of the Russian military  industry establishment going to change in light of the new  military philosophy?    [Mali] We will introduce numerous changes. It has been  decided to limit production of assault submarines to two  submarines a year. Production of Diesel-powered submarines will  be considerably reduced. I think that we will stop building  large ships as we no longer needs them because they are  vulnerable and their operation is very costly. According to our  new philosophy and, given the current developments in Russia,  tactical weapons have become strategic ones. We will go ahead in  producing the winged Cruise missiles and the (Plazma) weapon in  which we are far ahead of Western countries. This is a  defensive weapon that can be used for destruction of attacking  missiles as well as ground targets. We will continue to develop  light weapons that are easy to move by land, sea, and air;  computerized weapons; and combat communications systems. Since  the ideological confrontation worldwide that previously  exhausted us is over, we may focus on producing and advancing  modern weapons such as the Mig aircraft by using foreign-made  electronic equipment to increase the effectiveness of our  weapons by 30 to 40 percent. We can also meet the interests of  our Western partners to some extent. It is highly likely that we  will cooperate with other countries in the manufacture of  military weapons and equipment.    [AL-SAFIR] Would you like to say anything to the Arabs who  may seek to purchase Russian weapons?    [Mali] We are ready to receive Arab military delegations to  teach them how to use new models of weapons while testing them  to facilitate their introduction into their armies as quickly as  possible. We have also established, with President Yeltsin's  approval, a bank for the Military industry establishment in  which Greece shares in its capital. We do not know yet if the  Arabs desire to share in funding weapons production. The door  is open to them and we invite them to participate in this bank  activity and in joint weapons production. We invite the Arabs  to inspect the weapons system at the Nizhniy Novgorod Fair. We  are preparing to exhibit new models of weapons at this fair and  in Moscow. We will exhibit new types of military equipment and  provide ample information on them. We do not have any intention  of exploiting them and all that we want is for our exhibits to  attract buyers. We will prove the effectiveness of our products  in a competition with rivals. As for me, I support returning  approximately 60 percent of the revenue of our weapons exports  to the Arabs for investment in their economic sectors. This  policy is in our interest for several reasons, primarily because  this cooperation will enable us to retain the work sites of the  important industrial sector. We can also safeguard the security  of regions by our own weapons and ensure revenue from our  exports. Such deals are in the interests of both sides.</p>

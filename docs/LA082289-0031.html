			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER PATROL VEHICLE KILLS BOY, 14  </P> <P> A 14-year-old boy was killed early Sunday when he was run over by a U.S. Border  Patrol vehicle along the Mexican border less than a mile west of the port of  entry at San Ysidro.  </P> <P> Luis Eduardo Hernandez Hernandez, a native of the Mexican state of Jalisco,  died about 2:10 a.m. Sunday, according to Deputy Coroner Penne Hammerstead.  </P> <P> Michael D. Gregg, a Border Patrol supervisor in San Diego, called the incident  a "regrettable and unfortunate accident."  </P> <P> Roberto Martinez, a San Diego-based rights activist and prominent critic of the  Border Patrol's tactics, called it an example of the agency's "total disregard  for human life." In the past four years, Martinez said, patrol vehicles have  injured at least seven migrants in the California border area, several of whom  have died. He said the agents drive in a reckless fashion.  </P> <P> "This has to stop," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Gregg dismissed those comments as ill-informed.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, the agents simply cannot see these people," said Gregg, who added  that San Diego police are investigating the latest accident. "It's very  unfortunate, but things like this do happen."  </P> <P> He declined to identify the agent who was driving the four-wheel-drive vehicle.  The agent was experienced and accompanied by a partner, Gregg said.  </P> <P> The incident occurred in the early-morning darkness along the southern flank of  the Tijuana River's southern levee, a flood-control structure that has become  perhaps the most-frequented illicit crossing spot along the almost  2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> Almost nightly, hundreds of undocumented migrants line the porous border fence  along the base of the elevated levee, waiting for a letup in the guard of  agents posted in vans and assorted all-terrain vehicles.  </P> <P> Gregg and the coroner's office provided the following account of Sunday's  incident:  </P> <P> The boy was with a group of about 100 people, including his 15-year-old brother  Angel, who were crossing into the United States about three-quarters of a mile  west of the legal entry point at San Ysidro. The group had gathered atop the  levee, which is perhaps 20 yards inside U.S. territory at that point.  </P> <P> About 2 a.m, an agent descended from his post atop the levee and began to drive  westward along the levee's base, with the intention of deterring the group's  move into the United States. The vehicle, whose headlights were on, was  traveling at 10 to 15 m.p.h. Gregg emphasized that the agent was not chasing  anyone at the time.  </P> <P> Spotting the vehicle, most of the group decided to head back to the tattered  fence that signals the beginning of Mexican territory. The boy, however,  arrived late and stumbled into the way at a spot just a few feet north of the  border.  </P> <P> "He literally fell into the path of the Blazer," Gregg said. "The agent had no  time to react."  </P> <P> First aid was administered, he said, but the boy died at the scene.  </P> <P> Gregg said the boy and his brother were being smuggled to the Los Angeles area,  where their father was waiting for them.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Anthony Millican contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Observer: Off the record It is hardly surprising that by the time Sir Bernard Ingham left 10 Downing Street, Maggie's craggy mouthpiece was not on good terms with Sir Geoffrey Howe, who helped to jemmy the iron lady out of power. The surprising thing is that relations between the two men did not suffer a good while earlier, given an incident in 1981. Oddly enough, it is not recalled in the much publicised memoirs in which Ingham, bulky and indispensable like the great lady's handbag, has given a compelling if not entirely unbiased account of his days and nights in Number 10. Puffed-up media lobby correspondents with mischievous motives, and ministers who wilfully spoke out of turn come in for considerable stick. What happened in 1981 was that Ingham himself quickly learned, at both his and Sir Geoffrey's expense, about the danger of making unguarded, albeit unattributable, remarks to the 'reptiles' - to borrow Denis Thatcher's epithet - of the parliamentary lobby. With Britain struggling to escape recession, Ingham found himself late at night in a Copenhagen hotel room with assorted lobby reporters topping up tumblers and bemoaning a boring EC summit meeting bogged down by quotas on Japanese car and video-recorder imports. Surely, they goaded the chief press secretary, Margaret Thatcher's free market philosophy could not embrace artificial restraints on trading? Ingham agreed, conceding that the only reason such measures were necessary at the time was to protect a British economy in a 'bloody awful' state. The tabloids sobered up and splashed their front pages with the quotation, attributed to a 'top Thatcher aide'. As if that would not have been bad enough in itself, Sir Geoffrey who was then chancellor had just stretched the nation's credibility by pronouncing 'we have come to the end of the recession'. Howe was highly unamused; Ingham a little bit wiser.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Vision goes mega 'ANNUAL reports of British companies vary widely in their ability to communicate information, according to an analysis by Meridian Design Associates, a consultancy firm. It says the typical report is 56 pages long, contains a vacuous 'vision statement', and has five sub-standard photographs.' - FT news report. It is surprising how thoroughly the vision thing is sweeping world affairs. George Bush started it off, of course, but now the vision thing is seeping into every nook and cranny of relatively unsophisticated countries, like Britain. Yesterday morning my agent, Harriet Halfeshare, rang. 'Hi, bambino,' she said. 'Sorry I missed lunch last week. I had to dash to the Coast. There are some very big deals going down, film stuff, residuals, merchandising. And Martin was there. He's snaky, Martin, don't you tend to think?' 'If you say so, Harriet. But how is my novel doing?' For the past five months, Harriet has been in possession of a private-eye thriller I completed last year. It is mould-breaking stuff, Chandler updated but with a female private eye who knows how to handle herself but is actually middle class. I mean, she actually owns a Dalmatian. Her sitting room is green. The novel is set in Notting Hill. Also Bond Street, Fes and Beverly Hills. A painting gets stolen, which is thought to be a fake but is actually perfectly genuine. There is a sort of fascist sub-plot. My private eye is sexy. I mean, she's actually post-feminist and is an expert at taekwondo. 'Bambino,' said Harriet. 'Everyone loves your book. They love it in New York, they love it on the Coast. I've even shown it to Martin, who says it's post-punk. But we've got to get the timing right. New York has pencilled you in for 1996. They say you might go nova.' 'So why are you calling, Harriet?' 'It's the vision thing, bambino. Vision's going mega. How would you like to earn Pounds 7,500 writing 1,000 words on vision for one of my clients, the Incorporated Society of London Cinema Owners?' Naturally, I agreed. Last night I faxed them my piece. This is how it started: 'In common with Arthur C Clarke, the noted futurologist, we at the Incorporated Society of London Cinema Owners share a vision of how our industry will look in the year 2019. 'There will be a plethora of new technologies at work in cinemas of the early 21st century. High-speed, large-screen film processes offering a more realistic viewing experience will be commonplace. Audiences will be engulfed by holographic images in a nerve-tingling experience that will leave them drained and gasping. 'Computer-graphic techniques will enable producers to recreate electronically the voices and physical appearances of great stars of yesteryear, so that new movies featuring Greta Garbo, John Wayne, John Travolta, Maggie Smith and other hall-of-famers will be shot in 'Live-Synchro.' 'And movie screens of the early 21st century will see the debut of animatronic actors - humanoids, robots, call them what we will  - who will play any role, from buffoon to sex siren, at a millifraction of the fee currently charged by the likes of Warren Beatty. 'At present, things are not like that. At present, cinema-goers in London have not latched on to the exciting futureworld that lies in store. 'They love poky little cinemas disguised as fast-food restaurants. They want the stench of popcorn and hot dogs. They demand specially-designed candy wrappers that are impossible to penetrate without making an excruciating noise. They oblige us to hire staff who don't know what year it is, let alone what time a movie starts. Today's audiences want tiny screens and sub-standard soundtracks. And they expect - demand  - to wait many, many months before films on show in America are brought across the Atlantic. Popcorn and squalor. That is what they want. That is what we give them. 'But we at the Incorporated Society of London Cinema Owners have a vision . . .' So well was my first venture into vision received that Harriet phoned again last night, to commission 1,000 words for John Major linking his aspirations for the Tory party with scientists' discovery of giant ripples of matter, the Holy Grail of cosmology, at the outer limits of the universe. I sprang to my screen at once.</p>

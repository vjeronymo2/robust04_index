			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Dutch insider trading move Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen, chairman of the Dutch engineering group Begemann, said yesterday that he was stepping down temporarily while he pursued an appeal against his conviction for insider trading. Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen, the first person in the Netherlands to be found guilty of insider trading, said he was vacating the top job in favour of Mr Andre Deleye. On Monday, Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen was sentenced to six months in jail, with three months suspended, and fined Fl 100,000 (Pounds 36,900) for insider trading in the shares of HCS, a now bankrupt computer company. He is free pending his appeal. In 1991, Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen, one of HCS's main shareholders, sold 4.1m shares in the company the morning after he attended a meeting with bankers and other big shareholders to discuss a rescue plan. He had acknowledged 'share orchestration' but denied insider trading. His appeal to the supreme court could take a year or a longer. Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen's conviction on Monday reversed his acquittal by a lower court in April.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: The art of the big steel block - William Packer on an American minimalist in London Each autumn lately the Tate has given over the great spaces of the Duveen sculpture halls, which form the central axis of the gallery, to a single sculptor. Now the American minimalist, Richard Serra, follows Richard Long and Anthony Caro as the first foreign artist to be so distinguished. The sculptors are asked to fit their work to the shape of the halls and even to embrace them implicitly within the work itself. Serra is the first to take this brief literally. He has done so in the simplest and most emphatic way possible, introducing a monstrous steel block apiece into each of the two principal spaces, apparently rough and ready from their forging yet sized and placed to mark precisely the proportions of the place, the distances, gaps and spaces that together offer the sensation of architecture. And the architecture returns the compliment, for in the interplay between agent and effect, always the viewer is brought back to the physical presence, indeed to the palpable, sheer weight and mass of these simple, extraordinary objects, all 35 and 39 tons of them. Weight &amp; Measure is best seen with the galleries as empty as possible. There they sit, each block alone in its discrete, softly echoing, vast space, yet, through the intervening columns of the central rotunda, each visible to the other, each balance and counter to the other's physical and visual weight. At a distance they seem identical, their width exactly continuing the perspective established through the bases of the central colonnade. Their essential difference declares itself only on approaching the first, the nearer block to the entrance hall, which rises to more or less average shoulder height. On taking a siting through to the other, slowly it begins to dawn on the visitor that the further block must be in fact higher by about a head. And what one had thought would be a confirming horizontal proves to be a subtly rising plane, which takes the eye gently upwards as the heads of other passing visitors sink slowly beneath it, as they walk away. The eye runs down the full length of the galleries and rises, as it were, on stepping stones of our dead selves to higher things. Serra's drawings, shown at the Serpentine, are similarly quite as much installation as autonomous statement or object. Large rectangular sheets of canvas are pinned to the wall to be covered with a dense coat of black pigment painstakingly laid on with paint-stick. Each of the two side galleries is thus informed by a low block in the centre of the far wall, like the ghost of a fireplace, and clearly related to the Tate's two elements. The smaller central gallery has a long low work that occupies the common corner and the better part of two walls. The work in the main gallery consists of two immense sheets, each teased into opposite corners of the room. All these surfaces are as black and heavy as sin. The effect is manifestly theatrical, the furnishing and celebration of each particular space. Such is the purpose of the furniture and proper decoration of any room, only here so reduced and positive is the exercise, so undistracted, that we think of nothing else. We see the room exactly as it is, the more so for being not quite empty. This is not art to take away, to buy off the wall, for though its principle is infinitely re-adjustable, elsewhere it would be, in this manifestation at least, meaningless. It is, as the jargon tells us, site specific. Of the work at the Tate, Serra says that he wanted 'to make sculpture out of the entire volume' of the Duveen galleries, 'to make the volume of the space tangible, so that it is understood immediately, physically, by your body . . . that the volume, through the placement of two sculptural elements, becomes manifest in a way that allows you to experience it as a whole'. It is easy to mock minimalism for being, well, minimal. Any fool, we say, can put one brick on another, or stick a sheet of metal on its end, and call it art. Most fools, of course, do no such thing, not caring to take the trouble. On the other hand, I can only admit that too much of the higher nonsense is offered by artists and critics in self-justification. Such blather should be disregarded and we should recognise that the real problem lies as much in what we persuade ourselves a work of art should be, and what we expect of it. For despite the lengths in time and trouble to which a Richard Serra, for example, will go to forge a massive block of steel, or cover a wall with black oil paint-stick, the real engagement of the minimalist, as with the conceptualist to whom he is so closely related, is not with the made, personal and unique object, but rather with the idea and the effect. The attention is focused closely upon even a single quality of the experience that art might offer, to be gleaned from even the barest, most mundane of objects. How little does the imagination and aesthetic sensibility need to feed on? Do we need art at all, in the modern conventional sense, when an ancient, anonymous, purposeless - for all we know - standing stone affords an experience that is clearly aesthetic and imaginative? The minimalist artist contrives a situation, a particular sensation, in short a performance to which we are invited to commit ourselves - and that has always seemed to me to be an interesting thing to do, and quite legitimate.

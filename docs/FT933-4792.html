			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Fairey 26% to Pounds 10.2m FAIREY, the specialist electronics and engineering group, reported a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the half year ended June 26, reflecting a strong performance in all its main operating divisions. Profits were Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 8.1m) on the back of a 32 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 48.2m to Pounds 63.8m. Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said the results showed 'the abilities of the group's businesses - both long established and recently acquired - to prosper in the uneven world trading environment.' He described the performance of the core electronics and electrical power sector as 'gratifying,' reflecting both organic growth and contributions from acquisitions made in the second half of last year. There was slight disappointment with sales in France and Germany; but operating profits of the division rose to Pounds 7.19m (Pounds 5.08m) on turnover up to Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 25.7m). This month the group completed the acquisition of Luxtron, a Californian maker of temperature measuring and semi-conductor process control equipment, for Dollars 12.7m (Pounds 8.4m). Fairey said it had concentrated on acquiring specialised electronics companies with a niche market rather than commodity electronics companies. Operating profits in the aerospace and defence division, which only a few years ago accounted for nearly half group turnover, rose to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 778,000) on turnover of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 10.06m). Mr Poulter said the 1992 figures had been distorted by the consolidation of the division on one site. Nevertheless, margins in the latest period had held up well, costs were under control and new business had been attracted. The Saudi order for Tornadoes would generate useful profits in 1995 and 1996. Filtration and ceramics was the one sector where companies experienced 'a somewhat tougher time in the recession', Mr Poulter said. Operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.54m) on turnover of Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 12.4m). Net cash was Pounds 6.1m at June 26, up almost Pounds 4m since the end of last year. Net interest receivable fell, however, from Pounds 718,000 to Pounds 146,000. Earnings per share were 18.3p (15.4p) and the interim dividend is raised to 3.8p (3.3p).</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Right time for dressing up / A look at the growing market for wound healing treatments, in a series on drug discoveries Wound healing is one area of medicine that the pharmaceutical industry has hardly touched. Although healthcare companies are producing an increasingly sophisticated range of protective dressings which enable the natural healing process to take place under good clean conditions, there are few drugs designed actively to heal wounds. The position will be very different 10 years from now, if current research comes up to expectation. Scientists are developing healing combinations of 'growth factors' - natural proteins that regulate cell growth - and creating new skin by 'tissue engineering' to cover wounds. The two main types of wound present quite different medical problems. Chronic wounds are caused by inadequate blood flow in people whose overall health is generally poor. Examples are diabetic ulcers and pressure sores in long-stay hospital patients. These may be prevented, to some extent, by avoiding sustained pressure in any one place, but once formed they are extremely hard to cure. Acute wounds are caused by sudden trauma - for example, accident or surgery  -in otherwise healthy people. The challenge here is not to get them to heal but to improve the quality of healing by reducing the amount of permanent scarring. Scar tissue not only looks ugly; it can also cause medical problems, especially in children, because it is much less flexible than normal skin. The outlook for improved treatment seems to be brighter for acute than for chronic wounds. 'We may understand within five years how to achieve our ultimate goal - scar-free healing,' says Greg Schultz, a scientist at the University of Florida Wound Research Institute in the US. The starting point for research in several laboratories is the observation that an embryo or foetus heals without any scarring. 'The challenge is to understand the biochemical differences between adult and foetal healing, and then recreate foetal conditions in the adult wound,' Shultz says. Some molecules - notably transforming growth factors beta-1 and beta-2  - are present in far larger quantities in the adult than in the foetus. Mark Ferguson, a biology professor at Manchester University in the UK, has developed a technique to 'neutralise these growth factors so as to restore the balance to that present in the embryo'. The Manchester team has achieved scar-free healing in laboratory rats by blocking TGFB-1 and TGFB-2 and plans to start human trials later this year with patients undergoing minor surgery. Mannose-6-phosphate, a sugar that inhibits growth factors, will be used first, followed by neutralising antibodies. Ferguson believes the healing process has evolved to close wounds as quickly as possible under dirty conditions - and scarring is the natural consequence. 'For our ancestors, it was better to be scarred than dead from septicaemia (blood poisoning),' he says. 'With contemporary hygiene and care, the growth factors are in overdrive and they can be reduced to eliminate scarring without adversely affecting healing.' The greatest success of scar prevention so far is in patients undergoing eye surgery - for whom the amount of scar tissue can make the difference between blindness and sight. Specialists at the University of Florida and Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, have found that a single touch of 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer drug that inhibits cell proliferation, greatly reduces scarring after surgery for glaucoma (excessive pressure inside the eye). Another drug with potential for reducing scarring in the eye after surgery and chemical burns is Galardin, an enzyme inhibitor. It is in clinical trials with Glycomed, a Californian biotechnology company. Attempts to speed up the healing of chronic wounds, which plague an estimated 3m Americans and a similar number of Europeans, have been less successful. Several growth factors are undergoing clinical trials but results so far are generally disappointing. 'One problem is that growth factors work together in combination,' Ferguson says. 'It may be that we need to add more than one growth factor at a time.' Curative Technologies, a biotechnology company in East Setauket, New York, is attempting to get round that problem by extracting a combination of growth factors from blood platelets. Its first product, Procuren, is derived from the patient's own blood at the company's chain of 50 wound care centres; the platelets are isolated by centrifuging a pint of blood and then treated with an enzyme, thrombin, to stimulate the release of growth factors. Curative has gone on to organise clinical trials of a similar product, CT102  -growth factors extracted from pooled blood donations rather than each individual patient. Early results showed that the therapy healed 80 per cent of diabetic foot ulcers, while 29 per cent healed with a placebo dressing. Acknowledging today's cost conscious environment, Curative commissioned a study by Arthur D Little, which showed that CT102 reduced the total cost of treatment per patient by Dollars 13,500 (Pounds 9,000). Wounds are a significant burden on the world's healthcare systems, costing several billion dollars a year to treat. In the UK alone, pressure sores and leg ulcers cost the National Health Service an estimated Pounds 500m a year. However, even a combination of growth factors may have trouble curing a deep ulcer, because non-healing wounds contain high levels of enzymes (proteases) which break down the growth factors before they can do their work. Schultz says chronic wounds may contain 500 times more protease than healing wounds. Instead of applying drugs such as growth factors to the wound, an alternative approach is to cover it with living cells which then make their own healing chemicals in the correct balance on the spot. Howard Green of Harvard Medical School discovered in the 1970s how to grow human skin cells in culture. His technique has been developed by several tissue engineering companies in the US, including Advanced Tissue Sciences, BioSurface Technologies and Marrow-Tech. They use a variety of cell sources, including cadavers and the foreskins of new-born babies who have just been circumcised, to produce sheets of artificial skin. These are available as an immediate cover for large acute wounds and burns. But they are eventually rejected as foreign material by the patient's immune system. The ideal wound dressing would be a sheet of skin grown from the patient's own cells - a process that unfortunately takes a couple of weeks. To speed things up, Smith &amp; Nephew, the UK healthcare company, is developing a 'living bandage' as a compromise between skin grafting and more conventional dressings. It consists of a synthetic polymer film seeded with the patient's skin cells. Within three days these have spread sufficiently for the living bandage to be applied to the wound, where the skin cells grow down into the underlying tissues. Eventually, when the regrown skin firmly covers the wound, the polymer film falls away. Alan Suggett, Smith &amp; Nephew's R&amp;D director, says the living bandage is giving encouraging results in preliminary trials on burns patients but he is cautious about the timing of its commercial release. Meanwhile Smith &amp; Nephew and other manufacturers of wound dressings are introducing new polymers to improve the performance of their more traditional products. For example, Wilshire Medical Products, based in Dallas, Texas, recently introduced HydroDerm dressings, made from a transparent polyurethane film; they transmit moisture at a variable rate so as to keep the wound moist without allowing fluid to build up. The wound care market is currently worth about Dollars 2bn a year worldwide. That could double if healing pharmaceuticals make a significant contribution over the next decade. And millions of patients who now suffer permanent scarring or chronic ulcers would be immeasurably happier. The series will continue next month with an article on prostate problems.

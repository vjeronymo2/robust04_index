			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND YELTSIN CONFER  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and rival Boris N. Yeltsin, head of the  Russian Federation, met for several hours at the Kremlin.  </P> <P> One report said they discussed emergency measures to feed the Soviet people and  reform the crumbling economy. It was their first substantive meeting since an  attempt at reconciliation over economic reform broke down in late summer. The  federation has instituted its own 500-day plan for converting to a market  economy, conflicting with a more cautious plan adopted by Gorbachev.  </P></p>

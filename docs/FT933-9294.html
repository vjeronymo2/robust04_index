			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SUBDUED trading again dominated the day's events in the futures market, although the volume in traded options returned to more lively levels, writes Christopher Price. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened brightly above the 3,000-level before a medium-sized seller appeared and the lack of buying interest immediately sent the future into reverse. Subdued investor interest appeared soon afterwards and September began a slow climb back, although trading activity continued poor. But with a firm gilts market and further talk of Europe-wide interest rate cuts, September persevered and reached a new intra-day high of 3,006 in late morning trading. From there, however, it started a slow decline as sellers appeared with hints in some dealing quarters that the market is looking overbought and could be due for a correction. September closed at 2,983, a nine-point premium to its fair value of around 3. Turnover was a lowly 5,348 contracts. Traded options returned to more active levels, with nearly 29,000 contracts traded, which was 10,000 better than Monday's total. The FT-SE option traded 5,648 contracts. Hanson was easily the top traded stock option, reaching 4,657 contracts by the end of the session. Glaxo recorded 2,011 and P&amp;O 1,750.</p>

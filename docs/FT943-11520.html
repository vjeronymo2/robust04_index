			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mercedes launches bid for family bus group Mercedes-Benz yesterday announced its expected take-over bid for the debt-laden Kassbohrer bus business from its family owners. Talks opened on Wednesday with banks owed between DM600m (Dollars 250m) and DM800m by the Ulm-based company, and with advisers Goldman Sachs after preliminary talks with the Kassbohrer management which started in April. No details of the proposed terms were released. Sweden's Volvo group has also registered interest, but since the management and workforce favour Mercedes ownership, it appears likely that it will win. This is provided the cartel authorities agree to a deal that will give the German bidder a 57 per cent share of the domestic bus market. There have been no public objections by local competitors MAN, which has a 24 per cent market share, or Neoplan with 13.5 per cent. Analysts have welcomed the move as essential for the rationalisation of the bus industry, and reacted encouragingly to Mercedes' recently-announced plan to hive off its own European bus business into a separate company. Mr Georg Sturzer of Bayerische Vereinsbank said this week that a takeover of Kassbohrer's Setra marque would generate unit cost advantages. Although Mercedes would have to spend millions on restructuring, he said it would gain improved stakes in the French, Danish, Dutch and Austrian markets. The negotiations mark the closing stages in the 100-year life of one of Germany's few remaining family automotive concerns. The six warring Kassbohrer family members surrendered their stakes to the care of trustees earlier this year. The break-up of the company, which lost around DM70m on sales of DM1.7bn in 1992, started that year with the sale of its trailers division to Kogel Fahrzeuge.</p>

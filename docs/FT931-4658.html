			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: Wrong assumptions about investment flows in Europe Sir, There is a dangerous notion about that there are winners and losers from foreign direct investment ('Footloose across Europe's frontiers', March 9). If Britain attracts more investment than the rest of Europe, then it must be a ringing endorsement of British policies, particularly towards labour. The erroneous assumption is that companies are looking for the best place to locate within the single market. While that may be true in some cases, recent research at Chatham House suggests that the vast bulk of investment flows in and out of the same set of countries. The UK is the largest recipient in Europe but it is also the largest investor. How are we to explain that on the basis of relocation decisions? Like trade, direct investment is often used as a form of market access by companies. Also like trade, investment is a positive sum game.

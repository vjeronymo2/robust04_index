			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / I'm sorry - the volcano is closed: FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are now in Chile. Smoke still billowed from the crater of the Llaima volcano, which erupted spectacularly a few weeks ago, as we arrived to ski on its slopes. The Llaima ski resort was closed - something we have grown depressingly used to of late - but we were offered a lift in a rickety 25-year-old snowcat from Utah which just about made it to the top. Having now moved to the heart of Chile's lake district, we find there is another huge, beautiful, smouldering volcano sitting almost in our back garden. It is Villarica, on whose slopes we have been trying to ski for the last few days. But in spite of cloudless blue skies, the wind has been lashing the slopes with venom and the resort has remained shut. Every day we drive to the ski area through a forest of huge eucalyptus and fronds of quilas (bamboo) growing from 20ft-high banks of red earth and black lava beds: it is the kind of landscape used to depict Venus in the Eagle comic of the 1950s. Every day we buy a ticket from a park warden who tells us the ski area is closed. Hours later we return guiltily from our improvised run wondering whether he has noticed the fresh snow on our skis. The rugged four-wheel-drive Lada vehicle we have borrowed from Robert and Killy Stanton of the Passage to South America tour company can tackle the barely-passable roads to the ski areas. But red tape threatened our plans to take it into Argentina. Luckily, Stanton is a pilot and flew from his village of General Lopez to Pucon with a document allowing us to cross the border to ski in Bariloche.</p>

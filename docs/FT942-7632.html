			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Sale of Ina likely to raise at least L4,500bn The Italian state should raise at least L4,500bn (Pounds 1.9bn) through the sale of up to 51 per cent of Ina, the state-owned insurer, at the end of next month. It will be the largest privatisation yet attempted in Italy, and the first under the new government. The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, announced yesterday the offer would begin on June 27, and shares would be priced at between L2,200 and L2,700 each, valuing the whole company at L8,800bn-L10,800bn. The terms of the sell-off include safeguards for small shareholders, following criticism that ordinary investors' interests were neglected in previous privatisations. The same tactic may now be adopted for future privatisations, such as that of Stet, the telecommunications group, and Enel, the electricity company, which are due over the next 18 months. Single institutional shareholders in Ina will be unable to buy more than 2 per cent in the issue itself. That stake can be increased to 5 per cent with subsequent purchases on the market. But the shares of investors already linked through the shareholder voting syndicates of other Italian companies will be treated as a single holding. The measure should prevent close allies from building up effective control, circumventing the ceiling on share stakes. That happened earlier this year following the sale of the state-controlled banks, Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI). The treasury has also approved a special system for electing the first directors after privatisation. Under the scheme, a certain number of seats on the board will be reserved for directors nominated by small shareholders. The double system of protection was agreed by Mr Lamberto Dini, the new treasury minister and former central banker, and his colleagues Mr Vito Gnutti at the industry ministry and Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister. This same trio would guide the Stet and Enel sales. Both Mr Gnutti and Mr Pagliarini are members of the Northern League, which has been sharply critical of the dominance achieved by allies of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, on the boards of Credito Italiano and BCI. Imi of Italy and Goldman Sachs are acting as global co-ordinators of the issue, which will be launched in Italy and internationally. A certain proportion of the issue will be reserved for former shareholders in Ina's subsidiary Assitalia, the group's employees, agents, and policyholders.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Berio's progress - Music The current South Bank celebration of Luciano Berio's music, 'Renderings', gave us a long concert on Thursday ' worth every minute ' devoted to his eleven Sequenze for virtuoso soloists. The Park Lane Group, who were responsible for it, must have been proud to field three former 'PLG Young Artists' whose virtuosity yielded nothing to their international colleagues, among those the dedicatees of Sequenza VIII (violinist Carlo Chiarappa) and Sequenza XI (American guitarist Eliot Fisk). Time takes its toll; Berio turns 70 next year, and the performers who inspired his earlier Sequenze have mostly retired or died. There is no modern parallel for his sequence of Sequenze, which stretches from 1958 to (so far) 1988. Intense, fantastical monologues or monodramas, they try the possibilities of their solo instruments ' including the unique persona and mezzo of Cathy Berberian, Berio's first wife and creative partner (Sequenza III) ' to the limits, and then explore unheard-of new ones. Yet they aren't primarily virtuoso trials; rather, they find the composer seeking to create rich, expressive mini-worlds, within the economy of means that using only one performer must entail. Few of his famous fellow-serialists of the 1950s and '60s ever seemed to share Berio's passion for individual human sounds, articulations, gestures. The Sequenze take loving account of their live performers, though they set them extravagant challenges. Personalities are forced into the open at full stretch. After eighty-odd years in which self-effacing service to the score was the idealised Western standard, that is exciting to hear. Here there was no weak link in the chain; every soloist drew us into his or her particular manner and climate, and made Berio's points tell with personal force. It was a rewarding experience. A fascinating extra dimension of the sequence was nevertheless obscured: namely, the continuous development that it traces. In this concert it was chronologically jumbled ' indeed, the Sequenze were listed without numbers or years, identified only by artist and instrument. On programming grounds, probably the fractured order offered better contrasts; perhaps also Berio wanted us to find our feet with each piece on its own terms. Still, this is a unique diary of a high-'60s composer's progress: from arcane musical calculations plus Dadaist theatrical effects (Sequenze I'V) through cooller developments, more open to the unaided ear and more steadily dramatised (VI'IX), to the newest virtuoso explosions for scorching trumpet and luxuriant guitar (X and XI), which trail a lot of knowing history behind them. Though each can be heard as a brilliant one-off study, they deserve the deeper perspective of way-stations along a thoughtful path. We don't, after all, listen to Haydn's or Beethoven's series of quartets as if it made no difference when they were composed. This concert was prettily rounded off by Consequents, commissioned from Paul Roberts, a clever, shapely collage of excerpts from all the Sequenze soloists together. Saturday's concert offered something analogous but tighter: the latest (number V) of Berio's own Chemins expansions of some Sequenza, this time upon Fisk's breathtaking guitar epic. Mixed impressions: the new orchestral tendrils, mostly harmonic and exuberantly scored, often swallowed up the central guitar that should focus them. Franker amplification for him should set it all in better order. The triumph of that concert was Berio's 1984 Voci, with the honeyed-but-acrid folk-lines of Aldo Bennici's viola cushioned, titivated and twisted (Chinese whispers]) by Berio's opulent band.</p>

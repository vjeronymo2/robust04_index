			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Manufacturing productivity outstrips pay Productivity continues to rise sharply in manufacturing while pay awards remain steady, damping inflationary fears which led to Monday's rise in interest rates, the Confederation of British Industry says today. However, the CBI's pay and productivity figures suggest that the prospects for an increase in full-time employment continue to look poor. Most City analysts expect today's unemployment figures to show a further fall of between 10,000 and 15,000. But Mr Adrian Cooper, of the stockbroker James Capel, said the annual 4.2 per cent rise in manufacturing productivity in the second quarter, up from 4 per cent in the first quarter, showed that companies might be shedding labour faster than before. In the first quarter of this year the workforce shrank by 73,000, the Department of Employment said. The second-quarter figures, released today, could show some employment growth, however. The department's Labour Force Survey for March to May, published last month, showed an increase in part-time employment of 86,000 while full-time employment fell by 8,000. The Employment Policy Institute, the independent think-tank, says in a report today that the annual cost of unemployment is about Pounds 34bn - equivalent to more than 5 per cent of GDP, or 10 pence on the basic rate of income tax. The CBI figures on pay and productivity were generally welcomed. The annualised productivity rise of 4.2 per cent is nearly back to the peak of early 1993, when employment was still falling sharply but output was starting to rise. Manufacturing pay rises remained unchanged at 2.7 per cent in the three months to the end of June. Settlements in the service sector rose to 3.3 per cent to the end of June, up from 3.2 per cent in the three months to the end of May. Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, said: 'British employers have done well in controlling costs during the recovery. But standing still will not be good enough.' Fewer than half of redundant miners in a survey have found jobs and those now outside the industry have taken an average pay cut of more than Pounds 70 a week, Michael Smith writes. The survey by Coalfield Communities Campaign, an association of coalfield local authorities, found that 89 per cent of former miners were worse off. Of 878 former miners at five pits closed since October 1992, about 56 per cent had not found new work. Of those in work most were in factory or warehouse jobs.</p>

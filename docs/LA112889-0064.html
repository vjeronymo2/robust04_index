			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENVER IS FOE, NOT SHANAHAN;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: SHELL, PLAYERS AVOID BULLETIN-BOARD FODDER CONCERNING THEIR DEPOSED  COACH, NOW EMPLOYED BY BRONCOS.  </P> <P> Here are some things the Raiders did not do Monday as they prepared to meet the  Denver Broncos and their old coach, Mike Shanahan:  </P> <P>  -- Hang a pinata shaped like Shanahan and have everyone bash it with that  helmet he once couldn't sit on.  </P> <P>  -- Spit once-forbidden-in-the-locker room sunflower seeds at it.  </P> <P>  -- Give the pinata an assigned seat at a team meeting, like the ones they used  to have to sit in.  </P> <P> "We're going to play the Denver Broncos," said Art Shell, promoted eight weeks  ago when Shanahan was fired. "The football players are going to play the game  on the football field.  </P> <P> "We're not playing Dan Reeves, we're not playing Mike Shanahan, we're not  playing Earl Leggett (Raider defensive line coach who went to Denver this  season). We're just playing the football players."  </P> <P> And his players?  </P> <P> "I want to show my old coach, all right," Howie Long said. "His name's Earl  Leggett."  </P> <P> Two weeks after his firing by the Raiders, Shanahan went back to his old job as  Bronco quarterback coach. No Raider has ripped him personally since he left,  although many have said they were glad to return to the traditional customs of  the old regime. In Shanahan's few public comments, he has been gracious,  thanking Al Davis, congratulating Shell, saying only that the situation hadn't  been right for him.  </P> <P> Of course, the Raiders don't need to cast around for motivation. They're still  up to their neck in alligators in the wild-card race. They have two home games  before their final two on the road, and they need at least three victories, so  what does that make this game?  </P> <P> M-U-S-T.  </P> <P> Wouldn't it be ducky for them if the Broncos (10-2), having just clinched the  AFC West, and leaders by two games in the race to stay home throughout the  playoffs, showed up fat and happy?  </P> <P> Shell doesn't feel like banking on it or thinking about it.  </P> <P> "I don't care," he said, stonily. "I really don't care.  </P> <P> "Understand where I'm coming from. I only care about the Raiders, not the  Broncos. I don't care whether the Broncos are ready. Whether they're ready or  not, we're going to be ready to play football."  </P> <P> A week ago, the Raiders trailed four wild-card contenders: Miami by two games;  Houston by two games with the Oilers owning a head-on victory; Cincinnati by a  game; and Indianapolis, which is tied in the standings with them, but which has  a better conference record.  </P> <P> Last week, the Dolphins, Oilers and Bengals all lost.  </P> <P> The Raiders are still fighting uphill, needing to catch and pass three of the  four.  </P> <P> They're a game behind Miami, which was buried at home by the Steelers. Next for  the Dolphins: at Kansas City. Could Sunday have been Miami's version of that  14-12 Raider loss to the Chargers a week ago?  </P> <P> The Raiders are one behind the Oilers. Next for Houston: at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The Raiders are tied with Cincinnati in the standings, but have two potential  tiebreaks over them. Next for the Bengals: at Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Raiders are tied with Indianapolis, but trail in conference record (5-4 to  5-5). Next for the Colts: at New England. A key game for the Raiders, who need  the Colts to lose.  </P> <P> The Raiders are tied with Pittsburgh, but lead in conference records (5-5 to  4-5). Next: Oilers.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Dan Reeves said that making his 8-2 Broncos underdogs to the 5-5 Redskins  showed a lack of respect. Wait 'til he sees that his 10-2 Broncos are an early  two-point underdog to the 6-6 Raiders. . . . Marcus Allen returned to practice  last week, but only worked lightly. Art Shell says he may try some contact work  this week. . . . Safety Vann McElroy says he's ready, but the Raiders have been  moving slowly with him, happy with the play of Eddie Anderson, an Al Davis  favorite. . . . Shell, on the hit on Bo Jackson by New England defensive back  Fred Marion, who blind-sided him just as Jackson caught a pass: "It shook him  up a little. It shook me up, too, I mean to tell you. I think it surprised  Marion more than it surprised Bo." Afterward, however, Jackson got only 43  yards in 15 carries. . . . Shell was less than his usual effusive self, terming  the Raider performance "not bad," saying the running game "might not have gone  like we wanted it to," but adding it was "a good win for us and I'm proud of  this football team."  </P></p>

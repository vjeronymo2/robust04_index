			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks return to their roots - Some regional banks look stronger than their city counterparts At a time when Japan's leading commercial banks are suffering from mounting bad loans and weak demand for loans, the country's regional banks are finding business growth in their local provinces. The Bank of Fukuoka, based in the southern island of Kyushu, is one of the many regional banks going back to the basics of regional banking. It is increasing lending to local medium-sized and small companies, while increasing procurement from deposits from retail clients. As of last August, the bank's loans to companies based in Fukuoka prefecture rose 4.8 per cent, while lending to corporations in Tokyo and Osaka declined 6.4 per cent. Large lot deposits from companies at money market rates fell by 5.3 per cent, while ordinary deposits from retail customers gained 5.8 per cent. Bank of Fukuoka's return to its provincial roots reflects a sharp contrast in strategy from the 'bubble' period of the late 1980s, when regional banks strived to become more like the city banks, their larger counterparts which lead the industry. The traditionally conservative regional banks, which long relied on deposits from the retail level, shifted fund procurement from deposits to the money market, and also increased lending to larger companies based in Tokyo and Osaka. In an effort to ride the wave of internationalisation, the regionals also expanded their overseas operations, setting up branches in New York and London. However, the rise in interest rates squeezed profit margins and, like the larger banks, regional financial institutions were hurt by the subsequent fall in asset prices. 'Most of the regional banks were burned by market risk, then by credit risk,' says Mr Masahiko Tsuchiya, in charge of business planning at the Bank of Fukuoka. To tackle the bad loan problem, Bank of Fukuoka wrote off Y25.2bn (Dollars 251m) last year. It has also shifted Y20bn of its 'high risk' loans from branches to its head office to allow the branches to focus on nurturing new lending, rather than having to deal with problem loans made in the past. But while some of the smaller regional banks have been severely hurt by the increase in bad loans, the overall exposure among most banks based in the provinces to asset speculation, including real estate projects, has been lower than that of the large commercial banks. 'Non-performing loans for some regional banks are the result of the weakness of local industries rather than asset speculation. At these banks, problem loans should decline quickly as the economy recovers,' says Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. Thanks to the provincial business, some of the more larger regional banks are proving to be stronger than the leading 21 commercial, long-term credit, and trust banks, which hold 45 per cent of the private loan market. As with the the Bank of Fukuoka, profit margins on lending to local small businesses and consumers are higher relative to loans to large Tokyo- and Osaka-based companies. Moreover, with long-term deposits which were contracted to retail customers two to three years ago, when interest rates reached their peak, starting to mature, regional banks are expected to see a sharp fall in funding costs over the next few years. Bank of Fukuoka, for instance, estimates that Y300bn worth of fixed-term deposits, with an average cost is 5.9 per cent, will expire during the current business year. Meanwhile, a firm regional economy is also helping its business. Banks based in provinces where the regional economy was relatively unaffected by the 'bubble economy', unlike Tokyo and Osaka, have seen sustained loan demand. Public spending on infrastructure development has remained strong in the regions, especially in the northern part of Japan, while private businesses have moved into the provinces to benefit from lower costs. Although lending growth by the leading city banks has fallen this year for the first time on record, loan demand at regional banks remains relatively firm. For example, Bank of Fukuoka's outstanding loans in August rose 2.9 per cent to Y3,988bn from a year earlier. The island of Kyushu, which accounts for around 8 per cent of Japan's GNP, has seen investment from the car and electronics industries over recent years. Consumption has remained firm, due to the resultant population increase. Fukuoka is trying to position itself as a city linking Japan and south-east Asia, and infrastructure projects to create its appeal as a international hub have sustained construction activity. But with more than 5,700 regional institutions fighting for 55 per cent of the private-sector loan market, and the leading 21 banks also trying to expand in the provinces, the regional banks face mounting competition. Mr Brian Waterhouse, banking analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, says regional banks operating in the stronger local economies are likely to see high loan growth and core earnings. However, those whose operations are concentrated on the major urban centres such as Tokyo and Osaka, with a larger percentage of problem real estate loans on their books, are unlikely to see strong profits growth over the next two to three years. Mr Tsuchiya at the Bank of Fukuoka says strong ties to local companies is the key to competitiveness. City banks moving into Fukuoka lack the network and information to expand business aggressively, while smaller regional banks do not have the status which the Bank of Fukuoka still maintains within the region. 'We're thankful that dealing with the Bank of Fukuoka still means something for many small and medium companies,' he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              REGIONAL BANKS' FORECASTS FOR FISCAL 1994 (Y BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Operating   Change on   Recurring Bank                         revenues   year (%)     profits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fukuoka                         250      -11.5        19.0 Chiba                           325       -9.7        23.0 Yokohama                        500      -11.4        15.0 Joyo                            288      -10.9        22.0 Ashikaga                        293       -8.9         8.6 Hokkaido                        162       -9.2         2.6 Shizuoka                        342       -8.7        45.0 Hokuriku                        340       -8.7        14.0 Hachijuni                       215      -10.3        25.8 Hiroshima                       229      -15.3        12.5 Totals                        2,944      -10.4       187.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Change on       Net    Change on Bank                         year (%)   profits     year (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fukuoka                       +31.3        5.5        -5.7 Chiba                         +43.0       10.0        +1.5 Yokohama                       +5.1        8.0       -10.1 Joyo                          +10.5       10.0        -2.3 Ashikaga                       +4.9        3.6        +1.5 Hokkaido                       -1.8        1.5        -0.1 Shizuoka                       +4.5       22.5        +1.6 Hokuriku                       +2.1        7.0        +4.7 Hachijuni                     +29.9       12.5       +19.5 Hiroshima                     +27.6        5.0        -2.6 Totals                        +15.7       85.6        +1.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             CITY BANKS' FORECASTS FOR FISCAL 1994 (Y BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                 Operating     Change on    Recurring                       revenues      year (%)      profits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dai-ichi Kangyo         2,500         -3.1         40.0 Hokkaido Tak              440        -18.7          5.5 Bank of Tokyo           1,550         -2.6         75.0 Sakura                  2,500         -6.5         80.0 Mitsubishi              2,900         +1.7         65.0 Fuji                    2,330         -9.7         50.0 Sumitomo                2,650         +0.1         75.0 Daiwa                   1,000         +6.8         22.0 Sanwa                   2,700         +3.4         80.0 Tokai                   1,400        -23.6         35.0 Asahi                   1,190        -14.4         30.0 Totals                 21,160         -4.8        557.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                 Change on         Net      Change on                       year (%)     profits       Year (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dai-ichi Kangyo          +6.2         32.0         -1.3 Hokkaido Tak             -4.6          5.5        +31.5 Bank of Tokyo            +2.1         51.0         +1.0 Sakura                  +27.1         36.0         +3.2 Mitsubishi               +3.0         30.0         +1.8 Fuji                     -5.0         30.0        +12.2 Sumitomo                 +3.3         35.0         +5.0 Daiwa                   -44.3         13.0         -0.4 Sanwa                   -10.7         45.0        -14.0 Tokai                    -0.7         20.0         -3.6 Asahi                    -1.8         20.0         -3.6 Totals                   -1.0        317.5         -0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

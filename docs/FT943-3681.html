			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / People: Santacroce's pow wow with Aquascutum George Santacroce, president and chief executive of the US and Canadian operations of Aquascutum, the upmarket UK-based clothing retailer, has left the company after a restructuring of management. The North American businesses are now being run directly from London by James Pow, managing director of Aquascutum group since last November. Pow becomes group chief executive, the new title reflecting his wider responsibilities. Pow, formerly with the upmarket men's clothing retailer Hackett, part of Dunhill group, has made it a priority to regain control of the Aquascutum brand name. He felt it was being applied to many unsuitable products around the world. His first task was to centralise management, bringing the international divisions in the US, Canada, Europe and east Asia under direct control of London. Many functions were centralised, ending the 'spider's web of overlapping functions' that existed when Pow arrived. The passing of control over the northern American operations to London last month effectively left Santacroce without a role, but his departure was described by the company as amicable.</p>

Several Cambodian and foreign newspapers have become very  worried and disappointed with what they call the desire of our  Cambodian Royal Government [RCG] and National Assembly to issue  a law to restrict the rights and freedom of the press,  particularly the foreign press.    2. I do hope that the beloved RCG and National Assembly of  Cambodia will continue allowing all Cambodian and foreign  newspapers to enjoy full rights and freedoms and provide all  facilities for those journalists to carry out their work  conveniently.    I believe that we need not arrange any regulations nor draft  any laws for the Cambodian and foreign press.    During the 1991-92 period, in my capacity as the chairman of  the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, I promised, on behalf  of the new Cambodia, to all journalists that Cambodia, which  desired to pursue a modern liberal democratic system, would  allow all newspapers to enjoy every right and freedom this  system permits. In the event that a newspaper article presents  groundless information that affects our interests, we should  have the right and duty to ask that newspaper to issue a  responsible correction.    3. I do understand that the king reigns but does not control  state power. Therefore, I would like the beloved RCG and  National Assembly to freely make their own decision on this  matter as well as on other issues.    I have said this only in view of the interests of our  Kingdom  of Cambodia which desires to gain prestige as a champion of  press freedom. Nevertheless, we do not have to strive to  overcome any journalists who oppose us. I have gained quite a  lot of experience concerning this matter from my numerous  struggles in the past vis-a- vis journalists and researchers.  Although my cause was right, I was all along the big loser  while they remained the everlasting winners.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

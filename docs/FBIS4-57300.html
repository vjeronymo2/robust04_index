			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth Dacorte from the "Union Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] According to Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz, the  transportation strike set for Wednesday, 18 May, was called off  because of meetings the Single Union of Independent Vehicles has  held with the neighborhood committees to reach an agreement on  an increase in the minimum fare.    [Begin Isturiz recording] Whenever fares are discussed, a  strike is always announced as a pressure tactic. On Thursday, I  met with this union, and I think the strike was suspended. The  union accepted a timetable to hold bilateral discussions between  the bus companies and the neighborhood associations and the  community boards, but not between the bus companies and the  neighborhood assemblies. [sentence as heard] An agreement has  been reached with some bus companies, while the discussions  continue with the others. [end recording]    Isturiz added that the increase in the minimal fare will be  based on the service the bus line companies provide, the  conditions of each bus, and the routes covered. For that reason,  the minimual bus fare will range from 12 bolivares to 15  bolivares.</p>

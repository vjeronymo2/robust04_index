			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Transocean secures fleet loan refinancing Transocean, the Norwegian drilling rig owner, has secured refinancing of its fleet loans with an international syndicate of banks led by Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, Norway's two largest banks, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The Dollars 176m agreement is based on a five-year loan with an eight-year repayment schedule and secures long-term financing for rig operations. Transocean said the new repayment schedule had improved considerably, reducing the group's average annual repayments to Dollars 21m a year from Dollars 41m in 1995 and Dollars 82m in 1996. In April, Transocean acquired Ross Offshore, a competitor - the refinancing has allowed the two group's previous three loans to be incorporated into one.</p>

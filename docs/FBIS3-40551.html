It has been a long time since it was first said that Japan's  space industry was experiencing a turning point. The end of the  Cold War has resulted in a drastic decline in the international  demand for weapons. This has made it necessary for us to review  the significance of promoting space development for military  purposes. In Japan, with the major change in the demand  situation following the so-called Super 301 Article trade  friction between Japan and the United States, the environment  surrounding the space industry has become more complex.  Meanwhile, we are currently living in the "space age." Last year  we observed International Space Year. Under the slogan "the  observation of earth from space," the designation of such a year  was intended to promote space development.    In parallel with this effort, experts investigated and  discussed the prospects of the space industry in Japan at the  meetings of the Aerospace Industry Committee. Since the work of  compiling a report on the results of the investigation and  discussion has been completed, I would like to hear from the  gentlemen attending today's meeting who were central members of  the committee about the focus of the report. At the same time, I  would like to hear your expectations with respect to Japan's  efforts to promote the space industry.    I would like to have Professor Tsuchiya, who chaired the  committee meetings, make the opening remarks.  <H5>  Characteristics of Space Industry and Japan's Role </H5>   Tsuchiya: The space industry is a major industry  which involves a number of technologically-related industries.  However, in space technology, Japan must step up her efforts to  catch up with the front-running countries in the field. Japan  has a comparatively long history of involvement in the space  industry. However, progress during the postwar years has been  deterred by the restrictions imposed by the war-renouncing  Constitution. In these front-running countries, space-related  industries have made great progress, encouraged by the need to  produce increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons. In Japan,  the lack of the military incentive has caused the industry to  lag behind these major space-related industrial nations.    However, the policy of sticking to the peace-oriented  Constitution has a good side as well. That is, during the  postwar years, efforts have been made to develop space  technology for peaceful applications. The space industry is not  the only industry which has experienced relatively slow progress  in Japan. Among these slow-developing industries, what  distinguishes the space industry is the fact that the industry  has a longer history. I think that this long history reflects  Japan's intention to maintain balanced industrial development.  At the same time, the Japanese government may have felt a sense  of obligation to contribute to the progress of international  scientific technology through the promotion of space  development. This has made it necessary for Japan to maintain a  reasonably high technological level. In addition, this has made  it necessary for Japan to maintain the right to participate in  international scientific research meetings and the right to make  announcements of research results. These necessities may have  been behind the interdisciplinary cooperation among governmental  organizations, academic institutes and private companies in the  development of the space industry.    A long time has passed since Japan's space industry was said  to be experiencing a turning point. Now Japan must earnestly  consider the role it will be able to play. Japan must also  consider how to overcome the disadvantages it faces in promoting  space industry development. These are the questions we must  tackle seriously in our efforts to develop Japan's space  industry.    Moderator: The turning point issue has two  meanings: a turning point in the efforts directed toward space  development, and a turning point in the effort to develop the  space industry. In fact, we are experiencing a turning point  with respect to space development. In this sense, as Professor  Tsuchiya has pointed out, the space industry must step up its  efforts so that it can pursue its objectives on its own without  governmental protection. Now is the time for us to step up our  efforts so that we will be capable of coping with the problems  Japan's space industry is facing.    I agree with Professor Tsuchiya in that we must make an  effort to ensure a balanced development of the space industry  vis-a-vis other domestic industries and to have the balanced  development realized.    In space development, the development of rockets is  experiencing particular difficulty. I would like to have Mr.  Harada, as a central figure representing the space industry in  an investigative committee, give his opinion of the current  situation of space development in Japan.    Harada: This is a difficult question to answer. As  has been pointed out, not only Japan, but also the United States  and European countries are currently experiencing very hard  economic times. In this sense, it is a global phenomenon that  progress in space development is decelerating as a result of  economic hardship. In Japan, the space industry is a minor  industry and, accordingly, the budget for space research and  development is small. This was pointed out repeatedly in the  latest report. However, in terms of annual growth, the space  industry has maintained growth close to 10 percent, a growth  rate which is high compared to the growth rates of other  industries. In this sense, I think the future of the space  industry is promising.    As referred to a while ago, rockets constitute an essential  part of space development efforts. As the vehicle providing the  means for accessing space, the rocket actually constitutes the  most important part of space development. Rocket development in  Japan has progressed from the development of the N-I rocket to  the H-I rocket. We are currently developing the H-II version  which is scheduled to be launched next year. For those who have  been involved in the development of rockets, launching the H-II  rocket is the major goal for the time being. We are confident  that the rocket will be launched successfully. The development  of H-II rocket derivatives will be followed by the development  of rockets which, having different capabilities, can be used in  various launching tasks. This is the most important part of  rocket development. In compiling the latest report, I glanced  through the last report which was worked out in 1988. This  report emphasized the "commercialization" of the rocket  development business.    The latest report, on the other hand, places priority on  improvements in the economy in rocket development and rocket  business management. For Japan, it is impossible to develop  commercial-grade rockets which can be launched at low cost by  competing with those countries which have established advanced  rocket technologies. Even if we cannot develop such rockets, the  development of rockets which can be launched at reasonable cost  will make Japan capable of playing a role in the international  effort to develop rocket systems--a role which is as significant  as the roles being played by these countries which hold advanced  rocket technologies. This way of thinking characterizes the  latest report. The current effort toward space development is  two-pronged. One involves the development of the derivatives of  the H-II rocket and the development of commercially-usable  rockets of different capabilities based on the designs of the  derivative models. The other is the HOPE project--a project  involving the development of a space shuttle-type space vehicle.  We wish to embark on this project in the near future. It will  lead to manned space flight by sending HOPE shuttles to space  using reusable rockets. HOPE will probably be launched with the  H-II rocket or with a rocket to be developed based on a  derivative of the H-II rocket. Considering the current high cost  of the H-II rocket, the rockets must be greatly improved to  allow reuse. The above description is the most plausible  scenario to be followed in our space development efforts. The  rocket, as a space transport vehicle, is a field in which new  targets that must be met are appearing one after the other.  Before moving on to tackle the next target, we must clear the  hurdle of the successful launching of the H-II rocket.    Moderator: What about the launching of artificial  satellites?    Koshisaka: As Professor Tsuchiya has pointed out,  the international situation with respect to artificial  satellites has changed with the end of the Cold War between the  United States and the former Soviet Union. In the past, they  competed with each other in space development as national  projects. As opposed to these superpowers, Japan has been  promoting space development not for military purposes, but for  the peaceful use of space. When considering this change and the  fact that Japan has restricted space development to peaceful  uses, I wonder if the end of the Cold War has really caused the  country to experience a turning point in space development. It  is undeniable that the international situation with respect to  space development has changed. However, my observation is that  this change has not affected Japan much because space  development in Japan has been restricted to that for peaceful  uses. Japan's space development has no elements which are  affected by the change in the international situation.    The definition of the term "space industry" is quite  ambiguous. For example, the automobile industry has grown to the  point that it is engaged in the production of cars without  requiring government assistance. A business which has developed  to such a degree could be regarded as an industry.    In this sense, space business in Japan is still too small to  be regarded as an industry. In the case of the automobile,  camera and electric appliance production industries, the  international competitiveness they have today has been nurtured  on the strength of a strong domestic demand. Similarly, in the  case of the space industry, the development of a domestic demand  will be a prerequisite for the industry's further development.  In terms of business scale, Japan's endeavors in the space field  have been too small to be regarded as an industry. The "Super  301" clause has served to apply a brake to the development of  the space industry.    The clause imposes very tough requirements on the domestic  space industry, particularly on satellite manufacturers. Under  these circumstances, manufacturers must step up their efforts to  outlast the problems. The fact that Japan's space industry is  still in the process of development may alleviate the adverse  impact of the trade clause somewhat. More than 30 years have  passed since I began working in the field of space development.  From my experiences in such development, it seems to have taken  a longer time for space endeavors to develop into a full-fledged  industry than has happened in other industries. However, the  degree of the setback caused by the Super 301 clause could be  low enough to be overcome without much difficulty. By viewing  the setback like this, we can entertain hopes for the future. To  aid us in coping with this setback, we hope the government will  take the initiative in fostering a domestic space industry.    The Super 301 trade clause calls for Japan to introduce an  open bidding system for commercial satellites. This will require  domestic satellite manufacturers to become more competitive in  the international market. On the other hand, the clause calls  for excluding from the open bidding system satellites to be  launched to conduct advanced research and development. The  communications industry in Japan has yet to improve its  infrastructure, thereby realizing a speedier exchange of  information over a wider geographical region, by launching more  communications satellites. For the time being, it is important  for us to strive to realize this.  <H5>  Effort To Develop Space Industry </H5>   Moderator: How the significant development of the  space industry will be realized represents a difficult task. The  continued expansion of space development will be the key to  this. In addition, it will be important for us to promote  cooperation among domestic companies, as well as between  Japanese and foreign companies.    When taking these things into consideration, the system for  developing space transport systems is expected to undergo  drastic changes in the future. So far, a number of countries,  including Japan, the former Soviet Union, the United States and  EC countries, have been conducting space development  independently. However, with the end of the Cold War, as the  scale of the systems grows larger, the trend is toward securing  compatibility among the systems being developed by the different  countries. This trend represents a "turning point" in the  development of space transport systems. Compatibility must be  secured not for the sake of national prestige, but for the  benefit of mankind.    Professor Nakayama, as a man who has been involved with  space  development in Japan from the time it was started, what is your  opinion regarding this point?    Nakayama: My belief is that the development of  space will bring benefits to mankind. Development plans include  the exploration of the moon and Mars. As evidenced by today's  weather forecasting satellites and transcontinental  communications systems, the utilization of space has now become  part of our daily activities. It is certain that the use of  space will continue and expand. The question is whether or not  the space industry can develop into a self-sustaining entity  within Japan's economic system without government assistance.  This question must be considered from a global perspective.  Taking into consideration the fact that the development of space  technology will benefit mankind, the ways in which each country  has been pursuing space development must be modified. Now that  the Cold War is over, I think that international efforts toward  the development of space will take a form in which the  cooperation and exchange of information and services will  increase among the countries.    When such an environment prevails, Japan must be offered  rights and opportunities equivalent to those accorded other  countries. If Japan has something which is technologically  superior, it can offer them to other countries. And, if Japan  does not have the technology to produce something, it can  request it from another country which has the right technology.  This kind of flexibility will contribute to easing the trade  friction.    A new perspective may arise when we become accustomed to  this  flexible thinking. The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry has a number of departments devoted to fostering  domestic industry. Today, there is a mounting urgency for some  of these departments to create new sections to handle trade  friction with foreign countries. These departments' practices of  sticking to the tradition of protecting domestic industry is  becoming increasingly out of date under the mounting  international trade friction. In addition, when there are  industries which are prone to causing major problems by  disrupting the domestic economy, the government must deal with  these problems by creating a new section. On the other hand, in  those existing sections which oversee the industries which cause  little trouble, assigning no more than one official to each  section would be sufficient to take care of the industry. I  think there is no need for the government to endeavor to foster  a specific domestic industry by allocating unproportionally  large resources simply because the government has departments  dedicated to the promotion of the space industry.    It is important for us to maintain continued progress in  space development. Accordingly, research and development must be  promoted. Even if it does not produce profits, we must continue  the development of space technology as long as the government  continues allocating funds for the effort. We should take  advantage of this government assistance. When a technology which  can be put to practical application has been developed, or when  the need for such a technology arises, then we can think of  establishing a joint venture with foreign companies to put the  technology into commercial applications. We can also think of  selling the [resulting] parts, or of buying similar parts from  foreign countries when the need arises. What is most important  is that we continue our efforts toward developing space  technology.    After we have successfully launched the H-II rocket, we can  proceed with the HOPE project, and after achieving success with  this project, we can proceed to another task. This is what is  needed for us in space development. We do not know for certain  what will happen in the years ahead. Those European countries  which have been promoting the HERMES project recently began to  hint that the project will be called off due to a lack of money.  A thing like this can happen in any country. Even the United  States is uncertain whether the country will launch a new space  project after the current space shuttle program ends. Under  these circumstances, it is possible that these countries will  turn to Japan for help. Considering this possibility, it is  important that Japan continue the development of space  technology. We must promote this effort not as a business for  producing profits, but to accumulate technological heritage for  the future and to make a contribution providing international  benefits by mobilizing the technological and economic resources  which Japan can currently afford.    It is difficult to foresee the future of international space  development. However, in recent years, it has become  increasingly clear that a country's progress in the space  industry is dictated by that country's economy. A deterioration  of the economic situation in a country can lead to a decrease in  reliability and flexibility and an increase in accidents. It is  possible that the day when Japan will play a leading role in the  international space development effort it will arrive earlier  than expected.    Moderator: Professor Nakayama's observation of  Japan's capabilities in space development seems to be contrary  to that made by Professor Tsuchiya...    Tsuchiya: I suggested that Japan has been  disadvantaged in space development based on the fact that  Japan's efforts have concentrated on nonmilitary purposes and  that these efforts have been hampered by many limitations,  including the lack of proper rocket firing ranges. In actuality,  however, Japan has achieved high technological standards on the  international level with the development of the H-II rocket and  satellites. As stated before, the space industry in Japan is  still very young, and has the possibility of making great  progress in the future. I think that the space technology which  will be developed in the coming years will be used in many  applications. Although not all of the technologies developed  will be used in commercial applications as soon as they are  developed, it is still important to continue the efforts to  develop new technologies. Of course, in the development of space  technology, the cost factor must also be taken into  consideration. Efforts to reduce development costs will  continue, and costs will go down as the reliability of the  technology improves.    As Mr. Harada said, the developer seems to have great  confidence in the performance of the H-II rocket. If there is  much demand for rockets in the future, the production costs will  be substantially reduced, and this, in turn, will generate  additional demand. Here, the question is whether the lower costs  will lead to an increase in demand or to the promotion of actual  space applications.    Take the space technology which enables us to determine our  current location using a satellite, for example. Currently,  there is relatively great demand for satellite-assisted location  finding equipment, even though the cost is high. If the cost  were to decrease further, there would be many more car owners  able to afford the equipment. If it is proven that yachts and  ships equipped with such equipment have very low disaster rates,  the demand for the equipment will increase greatly. If the  equipment proves very useful, car owners driving cars equipped  with it will save gas and travel time by avoiding getting lost  while driving. This will make the introduction of such equipment  pay off economically. The equipment would prove useful for me  because I have gotten lost many times when driving alone and  when driving through unfamiliar places. Other similar instances  may exist in which the usefulness of the equipment has been  proven.    Considering this, I think there is a strong possibility that  current efforts in the development of space technology will lead  to the generation of space industry.    At the same time, it is very important to continue the  development of space technology in order to accumulate the  technology as a common asset of mankind. The importance of this  effort must be recognized by all people living in today's world.  In order to promote this effort, I agree with Mr. Yamazaki who  pointed out the importance of creating an environment in which  such an effort can be promoted through international  cooperation. Japan must participate in the international space  endeavor even if she is forced to take charge of only a small  portion of the endeavor. It is possible that space technology  will be used in a wide variety of consumer appliances in the  future. Taking this into consideration, it is important that  businesses continue to invest in space development efforts, even  if they do not produce profits soon. In order to make the  investments pay in the long run, we must make efforts to foster  the space industry.  <H5>  Costly Space Development Effort </H5>   Moderator: So far, two important things have been  pointed out. As Mr. Harada said, the satellite-assisted location  finder is a good example of applying space technology to  commercial use. The satellites used for this purpose were not  originally launched to develop the market for location-finding  equipment. At first, the equipment cost about &yen;40 million.  The demand for the equipment increased to the level of thousands  of units per month shortly after the price was reduced to the  &yen;150,000 level. This indicates that an industry can spring  up in a very short time once the production cost of a product is  greatly reduced.    The other important thing which has been pointed out is that  space is an infrastructure which must be shared by all  countries. In this connection, the market for mobile  communications systems has a promising future. If the cost were  cut substantially, the mobile communications service would  become accessible to more people more easily. This would then  make it possible for the market to expand further.    Space development has been criticized for the huge costs it  requires. The hardware used in space development is very  expensive. The current mobile satellite communications program  was launched by taking the need to cut costs into account  through the introduction of cost-cutting measures, which were  worked out by introducing ideas drawn from Motorola's Iridium  program. This program was developed by the private sector.    Koshisaka: Concerning satellite communications  using geostationary satellites, until recently satellite  communications have been performed mostly between these  satellites and fixed ground stations. In general, satellite  communications are superior to optical fiber communications,  although the latter has a number of advantages, including a  smaller time lag in signal propagation. Satellite communications  makes it possible for communications to be conducted "any time,  anywhere, with anyone," the ultimate goal of the communications  industry. With the number of customers using it increasing in  recent years, the mobile communications service operated using  satellites will grow into a major means of communications by  taking advantage of the superiority of space communications.  This concept is backed by the fact that, in recent years, the  industry producing automobile radiotelephones has witnessed a  sharp increase in demand for the equipment used in  communications via ground stations.    Whether mobile satellite communications systems are  expensive  or not will be dictated by the production costs. Considering the  possibility that a satellite communications system will offer us  the ultimate means of communication, our current efforts have a  very promising future irrespective of the current high costs. At  the same time, taking into consideration the fact that a  satellite communications system will benefit people around the  world, the development of such communications systems must be  financed not only by a limited number of private domestic  companies, but also by other establishments, including foreign  companies.    Moderator: In recent years, with the availability  of advanced communications networks, including gigabit-speed  networks, it has become possible to transmit increasingly large  volumes of information at faster speeds. When the technology  behind these networks matches that of the satellite  communications technology, it will become possible for the  satellite communications market to expand greatly.    Koshisaka: I agree.    Moderator: Regarding research on WEDOS, in which  you played a role, don't you think it is important to make an  effort to increase the number of WEDOS service customers,  particularly in the field of earth environment observation, in  the sense pointed out by Mr. Koshisaka a while ago? I think we  must make an effort to increase the number of customers who will  use WEDOS services for various purposes, including disaster  prevention.    Nakayama: World history since the Industrial  Revolution shows that countries the world over have made efforts  to overcome poverty. In today's industrially-developed  countries, poverty has almost been overcome. The next task these  countries must tackle will be the prevention of environmental  destruction and natural disasters. Localized problems can be  dealt with by local governments or individual countries.  However, many of the problems arising in the world today are  more than a single country can handle. With the recent progress  in research on the natural phenomena occurring on the earth,  including typhoons and abnormally high temperatures, we are now  able to forecast droughts and floods. We must now launch a  global effort to tackle these natural disasters as a problem  common to all mankind. The introduction of space technology will  help us greatly in our fight against these disasters. In this  sense, we must promote space development, and WEDOS will prove  to be very useful in these efforts. Japan must promote the  international utilization of WEDOS.    I hear that the Red Cross has a very strong interest in  WEDOS. The Red Cross has stockpiled medical and other emergency  supplies at sites across the world in preparation for disasters.  When a major disaster takes place somewhere in the world, the  Red Cross first tries to grasp the number of people who have  been hit by the disaster and must be helped. The Red Cross may  have previously obtained statistical data which will enable the  organization to fathom the extent of the disaster once such a  natural calamity occurs. The availability of satellite  observation data on the disaster would greatly help the Red  Cross take action against the disaster. By combining the  observation satellites with conventional natural disaster relief  systems, it would become possible to create a more effective  international relief system. I think politics is partially  responsible for these advanced earth observation technologies  not having been put to practical use more efficiently.    Many people have the misconception that space technology is  very expensive to use. In actuality, a satellite launch costs  about &yen;20 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the price  of a single jumbo aircraft.    Moderator: Not so expensive in terms of a  comparable price.    Nakayama: I wonder if a large oil tanker or a  skyscraper like the ones you see in central Shinjuku in Tokyo,  where such buildings are concentrated, can be bought at prices  of about &yen;70 to &yen;100 billion. There are many other  things with prices in this range which are being dealt with  within today's economic system. When compared with these prices,  the cost of launching a satellite is not extraordinarily high.  Then why is satellite usage not more common? I think that the  reason is that, at present, there is no established system to  collect the fees from customers for their use of satellite  services.    At one time, we thought it would not be very difficult to  collect fees if we asked Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp  (NTT) or the Japan Broadcasting Corp (NHK) to launch satellites.  These two corporations have well-established, efficient systems  of collecting fees for the services they offer across Japan.  However, this thinking proved not to work in the satellite  business because we failed to recognize the fact that their  services are confined to the domestic market. Therefore, we must  find other methods for collecting fees.    We were correct in thinking that fees should be collected  for  the services offered which employ satellites. Paying a fee for  using a satellite-assisted disaster prevention system would be  like paying a premium for a disaster insurance policy. If an  international system to collect fees for the disaster prevention  service were established, it would become possible to launch  satellites.    As for the GPS [global positioning satellite] service which  makes it possible to find one's present location, we have been  using satellites launched by the United States. So far, our  interest has been confined to the ground-use equipment, which  runs about &yen;150,000, to use the service. If a system for  collecting fees from all those using the service were created,  it would become easier to launch a new satellite. There are  other similar instances, including meteorological satellites.  Many countries are benefiting from satellite service. However,  these beneficiary countries have no intention of paying for the  service, nor is there currently a system for collecting fees for  the service. This is a major task we must tackle in the coming  years.    We have been offering free information services using  satellites to expand the use of space technology. It seems that  the United States has been taking this strategy. The same can be  said of the GPS and the remote sensing services in that they  have been offered free of charge. However, it is possible that  the time will come when customers who have been using these  services free of charge will be required to pay fees if they  want to continue to use the services. In order for Japan to keep  in step with the United States in this respect, Japan must keep  a close watch on the United States to read its real intentions  in offering free space technology services. One way to avoid  being taken aback by a sudden change in strategy by the United  States is for Japan to actively participate in international  space development projects, such as the Iridium program.    At present, I don't know which direction the free service  system will be moving. However, the important thing is that it  is time for us to earnestly consider this free service system  from an international point of view by taking various factors  into account, including the insurance system. In order to ensure  the continued development of space technology, it is imperative  that a system be established under which the customers must pay  fees for the services they receive. To ensure continued  development, the Japanese way of subsidizing R&amp;D programs  using  the taxpayers' money is not the best one.    Koshisaka: I listened to Professor Nakayama's  remarks with great interest. So far, I have thought that the  space development efforts had an aspect in which the effort to  establish a fee-collection system was being ignored by offering,  among other services, satellite services free of charge for  earth observation and location finding. The same can be said of  the services offered using LANDSAT, Noah and GPS. The United  States has played a leadership role in offering satellite  services free of charge. By establishing the fee collection  system, it will become possible for people around the world to  use satellite services without fearing the sudden suspension of  services due to the lack of funds to operate them.    One more important thing is that the technology which has  been developed as the fruit of space development efforts must  bring benefits not only to the people living in today's world,  but also to the people of future generations. Considering the  fact that many people today are worried about the deterioration  of the earth's environment, securing the money to continue the  operation of the WEDOS service on an international scale by  encouraging investment in the service will be important. By  making the effort to secure the funds for continuous operation,  we can avoid being criticized by those of future generations for  our negligence in establishing a fee collection system.    Harada: In connection with Professor Nakayama's  reference to the price of launching a satellite, the cost of  producing a satellite may range from about &yen;10 billion to  &yen;30 billion. But these figures do not include the cost of  the rockets used to launch the satellite. In the case of Ariane  rockets, the cost is &yen;10 billion, while with the space  shuttle, the rockets used to launch the shuttle to a  comparatively low altitude may cost between &yen;70 and &yen;80  billion. This makes the total cost at least &yen;80 billion.  This means that launching a space shuttle to a relatively low  altitude two or three times costs the same as constructing a  large-scale nuclear power plant. Taking this into consideration,  a satellite launch requires vast amounts of money.    However, this does not mean that the high cost situation  will  continue forever. Humans have always been able to think of a way  to solve the problems facing them. For example, when the United  States participated in World War I, although I am not completely  sure about this, the U.S. president ordered the production of  25,000 aircraft. However, the number of aircraft actually  produced stood at around 14,000. When the war ended, they were  at a loss about what to do with the many planes left intact.  Ultimately, they used the planes for air mail service. By going  through this experience, they developed jet aircraft years  later, followed by the development of jumbo aircraft in the  1970s. Since the Wright brothers' feat occurred in 1903, jumbo  aircraft were developed in a comparatively short time. During  those years, production costs have been reduced to about  one-hundredth. Taking this into consideration, the production  cost of rockets may be reduced at a faster pace than we can  imagine. A number of designs that differ drastically from the  conventional ones have been proposed, for example, a transport  system without Delta Clipper-type wings that rises vertically.  The first flight test of an experimental model of this transport  system is likely to take place in a month or two. Considering  the speed with which new technologies are being developed, the  reduction in production costs of space hardware may be realized  at an unexpectedly fast pace. I think the space industry differs  slightly from the automotive industry in that, in the former, it  takes more time for the fruits of R&amp;D to be made available to  benefit the people. If the production costs of space transport  systems are drastically reduced, it will become possible for us  to take space trips in the future. For example, people would  experience great excitement when observing planets moving in  their orbits through a telescope. Even such an experience as  seeing the planets through the narrow visual field of a  telescope would give people great excitement. People will feel a  completely different level of excitement when it becomes  possible to observe the earth or space from a spaceship flying  in a comparatively low orbit. Currently, it costs about &yen;1  million to lift a 1 kg load into orbit. If a man weighing 100 kg  is to be sent, the cost will come roughly to &yen;100 million.  This figure is unrealistic. However, if the cost were reduced to  one-hundredth, it would become possible for us to take trips  into space. This will be realized in the not so distant future.    In actuality, our continued efforts to develop the space  industry have resulted in fostering other related industries.  These include the broadcasting, communications and earth  observation industries using satellites. These are a few  examples for which the future is promising with respect to our  efforts to develop space technology. The most important aspect  of space development is for the development effort to be  continued. Our avid interest in space will provide the driving  force needed to promote the development effort.    When President Kennedy of the United States announced the  Apollo program in 1960, he questioned himself regarding the  significance of launching the program. He then answered the  question by saying that they believed that space was the key  that would determine the future of mankind. When this  announcement came, the Cold War was continuing. President  Kennedy also said that, concerning the significance the control  of space would ultimately hold, no one could forecast it with  confidence. Today, with the Cold War over, the phrase "control  of space" should be changed to "development of space." Through  his remarks, President Kennedy seemed to have wanted to say that  space development has a charm that encourages people to  challenge space. It was 30 years ago that he made those remarks.  However, even today, it seems that space holds such a charm for  mankind. This may serve as the driving force for our sustained  efforts to develop space. It is the responsibility of such  countries as Japan, the United States and European nations,  which can afford to invest money in space development, to play  leadership roles in promoting the development.    Tsuchiya: The question of space travel aside, the  demand for space technology may increase in the future. As Mr.  Harada said, we know from past experience that the production  costs of industrial products continue to decline as the  development progresses. The time will come when satellites can  be launched for one-hundredth the current costs. With these  possibilities expected to be realized in the not so distant  future, what is important for us now is to promote space  development by having a clear vision. The question is how to  formulate the vision. If we can formulate the vision, it will  become easier to develop various types of rockets--not confined  to the development of derivatives of the H-II rocket--that will  be appropriate for diversified launching tasks. The effort to  cut production costs will become easier by having a clear vision  of what purpose a specific hardware item serves.    I am not against the idea of collecting fees for the  services  from which customers benefit. However, I also think it is  necessary to subsidize the development efforts until such  efforts progress to a certain stage. For example, it was  reported that the California state government was subsidizing  transportation fees between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I  don't know if the state has continued to shoulder part of the  fees. Anyway, by following suit with California, the Japanese  government should consider introducing a similar system to lower  the air travel fees between Tokyo and Okinawa. Whatever form the  system may take, it will be considered a government subsidy.  Likewise, the government should allocate more funds to  subsidizing the efforts to develop the demand for space  technology.    We benefit from television weather forecasts. However, we  would not easily accept it if the television viewing fees were  to be increased, for example, by &yen;100, just because we  benefit from the forecasts. Such an increase must be covered by  a government subsidy. As for the subsidy to space development  efforts, the government must review its policy on subsidies to  promote the development of the space technology infrastructure  for the benefit not only of Japan, but also of the world. For  the time being, the space industry cannot help but depend on  governmental assistance to nurture the industry.    However, I cannot accept the thinking that we should press  the government to increase the space development budget  substantially by covering the increase 100 percent with  taxpayers' money. Many people in the industry share this view.  But I would say that, before they make such a demand, they  should make efforts to create a market for space technology.  <H5>  Space Development--Common Goal of Mankind </H5>   Moderator: Mr. Harada pointed out the importance  of the space industry's playing a leadership role in promoting  development in the communications and broadcasting industries as  some of those space-related industries. On the other hand,  Professor Nakayama stressed the importance of the Japanese  government's playing a leadership role in promoting cooperation  among countries of the world in tackling global problems, such  as the deteriorating environment. These efforts, representing  the need pointed out by Professor Tsuchiya, will be allowed to  receive the "forward-looking" government subsidies. I share  Professor Tsuchiya's opinion on promoting these endeavors.    As for the necessity of clear vision, as Mr. Koshisaka said  a  while ago, we must switch our space development from a  military-oriented effort to a nonmilitary effort--that is, in  terms of protecting the earth's environment, to switch from the  development of planet earth to the preservation of a good global  environment. In order to promote the tackling of global  problems, including environmental ones, cooperation must be  promoted among the people involved in space development the  world over.    Nakayama: Concerning space travel, it may be  possible to reduce the production costs of rockets. However, it  is unlikely that the cost of the fuel required to launch rockets  will be reduced to one-tenth or one-hundredth the current costs.  At one time, it was said in the United States that it would be  possible to reduce the fuel costs substantially. I have recently  begun to think that such a substantial reduction would be  impossible. The U.S. view failed to pay due consideration to the  costs of producing rocket fuel.    Moderator: There are some people who do not care  about the costs of space travel--those newlyweds who are taking  honeymoon trips. (Laughter)    Nakayama: There may be some people who are willing  to pay &yen;10 million to take a trip to space. However, if the  cost for space travel is expected to be greatly reduced in the  not too distant future, [few people may pay such huge sums].    We should continue our efforts to reduce the production  costs  of rockets and the launching costs of satellites. However, we  should not expect these costs to be reduced progressively when  the production volume increases, as has been the case with  automobile and household electric appliance manufacturing. This  is because we will not need as many as a million rockets. And,  it is unlikely that the production costs would decline to  one-tenth if the production volume were to increase 10 times. Of  course, the effort to cut production costs as much as possible  must be continued. At the same time, it is important to devise a  scheme which will require the customers of satellite services to  participate, facilitating the launching of satellites. It will  not be easy to collect money from every customer. Under the  circumstances, we must think of other methods. For example, you  may have noticed that commercial television stations have  greatly improved their weather forecast presentations by  introducing illustrations that are easier for viewers to  understand. The reason that these stations have used extra money  in their effort to improve their presentations has something to  do with the effort to attract more viewers to their programs.  For example, even if a news program does not amuse the viewers,  they may be attracted to the news program, broadcast by  commercial television stations, because they want to see the  beautifully-rendered weather forecast which traditionally  follows a news program. The increased number of viewers will  contribute to these commercial television stations' making more  money.    The method of collecting money does not matter. The  important  thing is that there is a way to ensure the continued  availability of sufficient funds to finance space development  endeavors and to nurture the environment in which space  technology will be used actively.    As for the GPS, for the time being, Japan can concentrate on  developing the receivers necessary for using the GPS for  position or location finding, as well as on making money by  selling the receivers. However, Japan must be prepared to  shoulder half the cost of the continued operation of GPS service  by launching satellites.    In recent years, the United States has been cutting its  shares in financing space development programs from the original  100 percent to a half or even a third, depending on the type of  program, and has been pressing other countries to increase their  shares. Under the circumstances, it is expected that, in the  next 10 to 15 years, these countries will be required to accept  their share of the responsibility in terms of money or tasks  involved in promoting space development.    Before jumbo aircraft came into service, probably when DC-8s  were still in service, every passenger was required to pay the  regular fare. However, with the introduction of jumbo planes and  with the availability of many more seats, the concept of a  "bulk" fare system, or a much-discounted fare system, was  introduced. Thanks to this, group tours of foreign countries by  Japanese citizens became very popular. In the case of space  development, a similar strategy could be adopted. In conducting  an experiment to create a material aboard a space ship, if the  experiment were conducted by a single researcher, he would have  difficulty convincing his boss that he had achieved the results  he expected. By establishing a system under which researchers  from a number of countries will be able to conduct experiments  jointly aboard a space lab, and by establishing a system in  which the results of the experiment are shared by the  participating countries, such an experiment will become easier  to conduct.    As a way of convincing people that &yen;10 or &yen;20  billion  is not extraordinarily high, I have cited the costs involved in  constructing the great Seto Bridge, which reached &yen;1  trillion. The authorities are reportedly in favor of  constructing more such bridges at other sites in Japan in the  future. In the meantime, the local governments use a total of  &yen;1.3 trillion of the taxpayers' money for garbage disposal  every year. If efforts were made to reduce the volume of the  garbage to half, &yen;600 billion could be saved, which could be  used to subsidize the space industry. My opinion is that the  central government must continue to shoulder the costs required  to promote efforts that will eventually benefit people.    Koshisaka: It will be important to form a national  consensus on that question.    Nakayama: The problem is that many members of the  general public, who have little understanding of the meaning of  space development, insist that the space issue must be excluded  when discussing government subsidies. In addition, there are  others who have been publicizing the merits of space development  that, in actuality, will be almost impossible to realize. This  is very embarrassing for us involved in space development.    Tsuchiya: Indeed, it is unlikely that even a brisk  demand for satellites and the rockets to launch them will  approach 1 million satellite or rocket units in the future.  However, I think that the production cost of the H-II rocket can  be reduced to half by the time the total number of rockets  produced approaches 16.    Koshisaka: Here, the rule of thumb comes into  play. There is a big difference in fuel and production costs  between producing one rocket and several rockets.    Tsuchiya: I agree. The cost can be substantially  reduced. Some may say that paying a high cost for space  development is not a problem considering the fact that we pay  such a high cost for garbage disposal. Nevertheless, we must  continue our efforts to reduce space development costs by  increasing the demand for space technology. Many more customers  could be obtained by improving the reliability of space  technology and by lowering the insurance costs. It is expected  that international cooperation will be promoted further not only  in sharing the cost of launching satellites, but also in  developing fields for utilizing space technology. In addition,  international cooperation must be promoted in sharing satellite  launching facilities. For Japan, this will alleviate the burden  of constructing new satellite launching centers within the  country which would have poor functional flexibility.    Nakayama: Incidentally, in connection with the  price of Boeing 767 engines, I hear that the engine  manufacturers are being asked by customer airline companies to  lower prices. These companies claim that, considering the fact  that the prices of commercial airplanes have been decreasing in  recent years, engine prices should be lowered. Lowering engine  prices will contribute to further decreases in plane prices. In  negotiations for purchasing aircraft, these airline companies  present the prices they can afford. This forces the plane  manufacturers to step up efforts to cut production costs by  reviewing the efficiency of the production line and the  suitability of the production technology being used. On the  other hand, in the space industry, nothing like this  cost-cutting process has taken place. There has been no  discussion on how much production costs can be cut to  manufacture a rocket which will be priced at, for example,  &yen;10 billion.    Discussions or negotiations will lead to taking a further  constructive step. One possibility would be to go ahead with the  rocket fabrication by cutting the price, sacrificing profits, to  meet the customer's request. Another possibility is negotiating  with the customer to create several rockets, thereby making the  production pay. It is essential that we introduce a cost-cutting  process, as is being practiced in the airline industry, into the  space industry.    Tsuchiya: That means we can still visualize a rosy  future for the space development effort, can we not?    Nakayama: Yes, we can.    Koshisaka: In space development, too, we must  consider the factor of "design to cost." The development of  space hardware and space technology service must be promoted by  taking the cost factor into consideration.    The effort to meet the requirements as much as possible  under  a given cost is very important in pursuing R&amp;D in the field  of  system engineering involving advanced technologies. To my  regret, however, the importance of this effort is not  necessarily understood by all those involved in space  development.    Nakayama: The lack of a sufficient number of  customers is partly responsible for the poor understanding.    Koshisaka: If those involved in R&amp;D were to  understand the importance of the concept of design to cost, they  could find some alternatives in their development efforts--for  example, by opting for the use of less-expensive conventional  technology instead of the costly most advanced technology. The  people currently involved in space development lack this  flexibility.    Tsuchiya: They must make an effort to use  well-established conventional technology as much as possible.    Koshisaka: What is required is for them to make  the proper judgment regarding which technology is to be used in  the system being developed, and which technology is not to be  used. At present, they are not good at making such judgments.    Nakayama: We still have many problems that must be  tackled.    Tsuchiya: All in all, it is important for us to  continue the efforts to achieve a balance between technology and  cost, and to promote international cooperation in space  development. Space issues must be tackled from the viewpoint of  promoting mankind's utilization of space by avoiding a situation  in which the development efforts are hindered by conflicts over  the possibility of the monopolization of space by a limited  number of countries. To promote such development, I hope the  government will promote international cooperation, for example,  by increasing the official development assistance (ODA) funding.    Moderator: With Mr. Tsuchiya's remarks having  summed up the topic of today's meeting, I would like to close  this discussion. Thank you for joining me in meeting today.</p>

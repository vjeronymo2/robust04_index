			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PANEL PREFERS LAW TO PROTECT FLAG  </P> <P> The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday in favor of a proposed new law to  prohibit desecration of the American flag and recommended that the full Senate  reject a rival effort backed by the White House to protect the flag by amending  the Constitution.  </P> <P> The Democratic-controlled committee voted 9 to 5 in favor of a statutory change  proposed by its chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). The measure would  make flag burning a federal crime, punishable by maximum penalties of one year  in prison and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> The panel also voted 8 to 6 to send the proposed constitutional amendment  sought by President Bush to the full Senate with a negative recommendation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot Political Issue  </P> <P> Lawmakers are sharply divided over the two approaches to prohibiting flag  desecration, which became a hot political issue in the wake of a Supreme Court  decision last summer overturning a Texas law that banned flag burning.  </P> <P> By prior agreement, the Senate committee was obliged to submit both  flag-burning measures to the Senate floor, where they will be debated next  month. The House already has passed a flag-burning bill, and Speaker Thomas S.  Foley has promised to schedule a vote on a constitutional amendment later this  year.  </P> <P> Proponents of a constitutional change argued that the Judiciary Committee's  negative recommendation would not seriously affect its support on the floor.  </P> <P> "We were not surprised by the unfavorable vote because the chairman (Biden) was  against it," said an aide to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). "It will be on the  Senate floor, where the proponents of a constitutional amendment will come out  in force."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Alternatives  </P> <P> The flag debate has split Congress three ways. One faction favors simple  legislation to protect the flag, another backs the President's call for a  constitutional amendment, and a third contends that democracy is better served  by taking no action at all.  </P> <P> The debate in the Judiciary Committee reflected those divergent views. Most  Democrats argued against any attempt to tinker with the Constitution, while  Republicans countered that the Supreme Court's decision on the  constitutionality of flag burning probably could not be overturned by a mere  statute.  </P> <P> "A constitutional amendment is absolutely necessary to ensure with certainty  the validity of any statute banning flag desecration," said Hatch, adding that  the Biden bill would be "unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) argued the minority view. No matter how  objectionable flag burning may be to most people, Kennedy said, restricting any  form of political dissent by statute or amendment would be a violation of the  free speech principles enshrined in the Constitution.  </P> <P> "It is wrong to try to prevent desecration of the flag by desecrating the  Constitution," Kennedy said. "If freedom of expression means anything, it means  tolerance not just for views we approve, but for views that we hate as well."  </P> <P> While flag-protection legislation has strong bipartisan support in Congress,  proponents of an amendment concede they probably do not have enough support to  change the Constitution -- a process that requires a two-thirds majority vote  in the House and the Senate as well as ratification by three-fourths of the  states. A statute, in contrast, would require only a simple majority in the  House and Senate to pass.  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Mexican farm laws face radical reform: Millions of farmers will win right to own private property MEXICO'S Congress is to go into an extraordinary session tomorrow to vote on radical changes to the nation's agricultural laws and pension fund system. The overhaul of the antiquated agricultural sector is considered one of the key reforms proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari since he came to office in December 1988, and is likely to have far-reaching political and economic consequences. The new laws will give Mexico's 3m ejidatarios (communal farmers) the right to become private property owners, if two-thirds of the ejido votes in favour; to form joint ventures with private businessmen; and to use their land as collateral for loans. Private property owners will be able to form joint stock companies, thereby partly skirting the constitutional limits on the size of farms and helping them raise money in the capital markets. The ejidos, set up after the country's revolution of 1910-20, now occupy about half Mexico's agricultural land. All Mexicans have the theoretical right under the constitution to farm the land under the ejido system and many would-be farmers are already protesting at the changes. The government has also proposed sweeping changes to the pension fund system which will have a substantial impact on Mexico's capital markets. Employers will have to put 2 per cent of the salary of each worker into a personal pension fund, and another 5 per cent into a personal housing fund. Workers can draw down their fund when retired, unemployed or buying a house. The fund managers, selected by employers, will be banks, and the money will be invested in government bonds. These will offer a real return of between 2 and 6 per cent a year. The fund will run alongside the existing system. Mexico's monthly inflation reached 1.8 per cent in January, against 2.4 per cent a month earlier. The January figure, although the lowest in 17 years, is steeper than expected and too high if the government is to reach its year-end target of 9.7 per cent.</p>

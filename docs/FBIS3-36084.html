Does Ukraine Need It?"]    [Text] We drew similar castles in our childhood --  graceful and inaccessible, hoisting tower spires tipped with  cast iron flags and weathervanes into the sky over Brussels.  There are not many trees in the city, but those we saw were  decoratively trimmed. Their leafless limbs would have finally  convinced us of the fabulousness of the city if their gothic  crowns had not been ornamented with neon lights by Cartier,  Gucci, or Citroen... During our four-day visit in Brussels, we  did not have the opportunity to see Brussels in daylight. A  Ukrainian delegation headed by Supreme Council Deputy Chairman  Vasyl Durdynets would leave its hotel early in the morning, and  when it was returning after a strenuous day filled with  negotiations, briefings, and consultations, it would already be  dark. Although it was an unofficial visit, the delegation  included presidential advisers, an aide to the defense minister,  and top officials from the Foreign Ministry. The visit had been  organized and prepared by the Ukrainian Center for Studying  Issues of International Security. The main goal of the visit  was to obtain as much information as possible about the  "Partnership for Peace" -- the latest NATO initiative -- which,  in the opinion of NATO politicians, generals of the NATO Allied  Forces Command in Europe, representatives of the North Atlantic  Assembly, and all the people with whom the Ukrainian delegation  met, "should build not barriers but bridges."    "Let us get involved in combat, and later we will see," used  to say an outstanding commander. Ukraine did this by announcing  its support for the "Partnership for Peace" immediately after a  NATO summit, at which leaders of 16 members of the bloc had  decided what to do with Eastern and Central European countries  knocking on NATO's doors. As is known, it had been decided at  the summit not to open the doors but to let them look from  behind the fence. Certain countries have received the NATO (or  rather U.S.) initiative as a nice surprise, other states such as  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have seen it  as a big disappointment. Why? First of all, because they wanted  to receive security guaranties from NATO, to outdistance  unstable, bordering Russia, to ensure themselves against  possible adventures from internal opposition, and to quiet the  issue of redrawing borders, which has recently been voiced more  and more often. However, the status of countries that are to  join the "Partnership for Peace" is much more different than the  one of the 16 permanent NATO members. Whereas the main goal of  NATO has always been to protect its members from outside  aggression, the "Partnership for Peace" does not mention any  protection. This is the first point. Additionally, while  soberly assessing reality, it becomes obvious that countries of  the former Warsaw Pact are not in conflict with the West but  with one another. Presuming that membership in NATO would  prevent these conflicts from becoming more radical, they wanted  to merge with NATO. However, many NATO officials with whom we  met in Brussels emphasized that the Allied Forces defend the  bloc members from external attack, not interfering in internal  conflicts among themselves. Usually, they would cite the  example of Turkey and Greece in this regard. This way, even if  small countries of the former Warsaw Pact became NATO members,  this would not have any influence on, for example, relations  between Romania and Hungary. It is not even worth recalling  that the "Partnership for Peace" does not provide such  guarantees.    One should not hope that this initiative can prevent  possible  aggression from Russia (in case the ideas of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia prevail). Moreover, the "Partnership  for Peace" is a compromise between two superpowers; one of them  dominates in the West, the other -- in the East. Undoubtedly,  the United States, which plays first fiddle in NATO, was not  against extending its sphere of influence to countries of  Eastern and Central Europe. However, officials in Washington and  Brussels take into account, first of all, the unstable situation  in those countries, which may crack the monolith of the bloc,  and second, the danger of isolating Russia. After all, I,  personally, do not have any doubts that NATO does not want to  infuriate Russia. Unfortunately, countries of the former USSR,  except for the Baltics and Ukraine, unconditionally approve  Russia's sphere of influence. Brussels is far more interested  in the above-mentioned republics and countries which border with  NATO countries. When the talks touched upon using NATO's  peacekeeping forces under the aegis of UN or CSCE, a NATO  official stated that the Western troops will never crisscross  borders of the former USSR. In general, in his opinion,  peacekeeping operations in this region should be conducted by a  state which has direct interests there, and NATO apparently does  not have any interests in our region, and the more so in the  Asian part of the CIS. "We did not even know how to spell  Tajikistan," admitted another NATO official. Yet, for the sake  of justice, it must be admitted that there are also differing  opinions in Brussels. For instance, one of the officials of the  International Secretariat said that, in case a conflict erupts  in the Crimea, NATO will not stand by indifferently.  Nevertheless, the "Partnership for Peace" does not downgrade  Russia's interests on "its territory." Hence, the following  question arises: What are the real provisions of this idea?    The Ukrainian delegation could not obtain an exhaustive  answer, since NATO officials also do not have an idea with what  the framework of "Partnership for Peace" will be filled. The  idea was formulated not long ago, and it became officially  presented on the occasion of the visit by comrade Clinton to  Europe. It is expected that countries that will participate in  the initiative will conduct military training and form  peacekeeping forces in cooperation with NATO. The process of  joint activities should lead to rapprochement of military  authorities, strategic plans, and technical equipment. Only  after this preparatory period, which, in the opinion of NATO  generals, will take eight or 10 years, admission of new NATO  members may be addressed. During the next several months, a  structure for encouraging friendly relations among countries  that have applied for membership in the "Partnership for Peace"  and NATO will be established. Officers-representatives of  "Partnership for Peace" members and 16 NATO countries will work  out this structure. As of today, this all the information that  is available, and it is followed by an array of unanswered  questions. Among them are, for example, the following ones:  What effect will the participation of CIS countries in the  "Partnership for Peace" have on the CIS collective security  system? In which countries and how often will training be  conducted? (This is not an inappropriate question, since, for  example, Poland would not like to host German troops on its  territory during joint military training. There is also  suspicion that many countries, particularly former socialist  states, will not be delighted by the presence of Russian units  on their territories.) What expenditures are needed to reach  comparable standards of technical equipment? What will the  procedures be for admitting new countries to NATO, following the  "preparatory period?": Will they be admitted all at once or  separately? (According to Western politicians, the "Partnership  for Peace" was not been meant as an affront to anyone.)    A great many things depend on the answer to the last  question. After all, as of today, NATO is not in the best years  of its existence. Not the Warsaw Pact but the common taxpayer  has become its worst enemy by refusing to finance defense  expenditures since the collapse of the totalitarian system. By  the year 1995, the number of NATO Allied Forces will have been  reduced by 25 percent, and certain units -- even by 45 percent.    The lack of a common enemy may boil down NATO to a UN  military unit designed to protect or reestablish peace in  troubled points. It has not been ruled out that, having expanded  itself to the entire northern hemisphere, NATO will catch a  second breath while facing a potential South-North conflict.  Still, NATO is the only guarantee for stability in Western  Europe, and this alone is sufficient justification for its  existence in today's unstable times.    Nonetheless, the concept of global security is as follows:  The times of blocs have gone. For many, it is hard to realize  that. Not taking into account the fact that the "Partnership for  Peace" was meant to calm Russia's fury but considering it as a  bridge unifying the entire northern hemisphere from Vancouver to  Vladivostok, it becomes clear that Ukraine should participate in  it. After all, the system of global security is to last dozens  of years, and we should participate in digging its foundation.  It is particularly important to realize this today, when the  "Partnership for Peace" is merely an insurance policy without  any guarantees for Ukraine, and we do not have money to pay for  it. Ukraine itself will have to finance military training and  the modernization of equipment, since NATO is not interested in  our outdated defense industry complex or TU-160 airplanes.  Therefore, the decision concerning Ukraine's participation in  the "Partnership for Peace" is a political decision aimed at a  long perspective rather than the present moment. Today, it is  necessary to concentrate our attention on the economy, conduct  reforms, and make all possible efforts to include the entire  potential of the state in this process. This is the only way we  can receive security guarantees. Only having revived our  economy, we will be reckoned with. Only this way, we will be  able to withhold our decisions and integrate into a civilized  Europe.    For the time being however... For the time being however, at  the NATO headquarters in Brussels, at the conference room where  the Ukrainian delegation met with top officials of the NATO  International Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretariat, two maps of  the world hang on the wall: One depicts 15 states, the other  displays four black letters painted against a pink background --  USSR. The sooner we will convince the whole world and NATO  members that the second map is obsolete the better...</p>

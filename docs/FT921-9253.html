			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The stakes in Algeria TOMORROW MARKS a crunch point for Algeria in two respects. At home, it is the first Friday since the High Council of State, the country's supreme authority since President Chadli Bendjedid was deposed on January 11, decreed a state of emergency and banned the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The biggest disturbances in recent weeks have always followed Friday prayers, and the FIS, before being banned, had called a protest march for tomorrow. Abroad, eight international banks are meeting in Paris to decide whether to proceed with a Dollars 1.5bn loan, intended to refinance Algeria's commercial bank debt. The country owes roughly Dollars 5bn to commercial banks (two-thirds of it to the Japanese), but its total foreign debt amounts to Dollars 23.9bn, of which well over half is owed to foreign governments. France, the largest single creditor, believes a rescheduling package would be more realistic than refinancing, given Algeria's already heavy 70-75 per cent debt service ratio. The Japanese banks, by contrast, firmly reject the idea of rescheduling. On a technical level, the solution could be simple in principle even if complex in detail: an agreement to refinance the commercial debt, while rescheduling the government loans. But the French are quite right to see a connection between the debt and Algeria's political problems. Restricted growth By swallowing up such a large proportion of the country's export earnings, the debt has severely restricted growth, causing very high unemployment, especially in the 16-24-year-old age group which constitutes a vast reservoir of demonstrators and rioters for the FIS. In turn, instability deters foreign investment. Governments are unsure whether to provide more financial support to a state trying desperately to contain Islamic fundamentalism or, on the contrary, to withhold it from a state which has ignored the popular will expressed through the ballot box, and has now suspended many freedoms. High stakes The stakes are high, especially for Europe. It is all too easy to imagine Algerian boat people, fleeing across the Mediterranean from civil war or from a militant Islamic regime. Since no political solution is imaginable without some room for economic manoeuvre, Algeria's creditors should be generous in the short term. But they should also make it clear to Algeria's rulers that they do not see the restoration of order and state authority, however necessary, as a solution in itself. Indeed it may not even be possible without some kind of political dialogue - for which the FIS at present, with its leaders either in prison or on the run, is no more prepared than the government. Algeria's record in foreign policy is almost as good as its record in domestic policy is bad. It brokered, for example, the solution of the US-Iranian hostage crisis in 1980-81, and its present foreign minister, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, was the architect of the Taif agreement which has brought civil peace to Lebanon. The time may soon come for the Algerian government to accept some help from others that it has helped in the past - notably Saudi Arabia and Iran - in seeking a way out of its own domestic troubles.</p>

They epically delineated the undying leadership exploits of  the great leader President Kim Il-song, who unfolded a great  programme of socialist rural construction and set a brilliant  example in the solution of the rural question, and the happy  life of farmers.    The display of gymnastic exercises, dances and acrobatics  against magic lantern style background was highly acclaimed by  the spectators for its high ideological and artistic level and  refined skill of performers and well-harmonized ensemble.    The display leading the spectators to ecstasies was produced  by the creative group of the mass gymnastic display.    It was formed in November 1971. It is now playing a big role  in the development of the chuche-based gymnastic art of Korea.    The group consisting of the creation and production,  gymnastic exercise, background, music and other specialized  creative sections, has hundreds of competent creators including  more than 40 people's and merited sportsmen and sportswomen.    It produced scores of monumental works in the past.    The mass gymnastic displays "Chollima Korea", "Song of  Korea", "People Sing of the Leader", "Singlehearted Unity" and  other works won the people's prize and are widely known to the  world as comprehensive sports art consisting of courageous,  powerful and lively gymnastic movements, beautiful rhythms,  plastic etude combining collective harmony well with individual  skills and organic harmonisation of gymnastic ground, background  and music.    The group produces and disseminates gymnastic works to be  performed in all parts of the country. And it organises  training courses and provincial contests of mass gymnastic  display every year, thus playing a big role in improving the  physical conditions of children and students and working people.    In the past, it sent experts to more than 40 Asian, African  and Latin American countries on over 90 occasions and helped in  the creation of mass gymnastic displays.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Development Bank of Singapore climbs 14% as loan base grows Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the island republic's largest bank, has announced pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June of SDollars 311m (USDollars 206m), a 14 per cent rise on the corresponding period last year. DBS said that group net interest income was SDollars 332m, a rise of 22 per cent. The bank said the increase was due to improved net interest margins and an expansion of the bank loan base. DBS reported a 47 per cent increase in income on fees and commissions to SDollars 124m, mainly due to higher income from merchant banking and investment banking. However, the bank reported a sharp drop in other income, including that from securities trading, from SDollars 85m in the first six months of last year to SDollars 46m in the period to June. Activity on the Singapore stock market has declined significantly over the last five months. DBS made provisions against bad loans of SDollars 58m compared with SDollars 54m in the previous equivalent period. Per share earnings rose from 61 Singapore cents to 71 cents over the period while the dividend was unchanged at 8 cents. Overseas Union Bank (OUB), another of Singapore's main banking groups, has reported pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 of SDollars 144m, a rise of more than 50 per cent. Tat Lee Bank, a smaller Singapore institution, reported pre-tax profits for the same period up 69 per cent to SDollars 46m. DBS, OUB, the United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) are Singapore's four main banks. Last week UOB and OCBC reported pre-tax profits up 34 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. In spite of the healthy earnings picture, analysts say that profit margins are unlikely to continue at the present high level. In particular, they say higher interest rates are likely to curtail demand for housing loans, one of the most profitable areas of Singapore banking activity.</p>

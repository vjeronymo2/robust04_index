			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / US moves towards trade sanctions against Japan The US yesterday moved towards trade sanctions against Japan by announcing its conclusion that Japan had violated previous agreements to open its domestic cellular phone market. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would publish for public comment within 30 days a list of proposed trade measures, not necessarily to be limited to higher tariffs or other curbs on Japanese cellular phone products sold in the US. 'This is a clear-cut and serious case of a failure by Japan to live up to three agreements,' he said. The agreements were negotiated in 1985-87, 1989 and finally, by letter, in 1992. He said that new barriers had been raised after each fresh commit-ment. Brandishing a cellular phone manufactured in the US by Motorola, he said it was 'false and disingenuous' of the Japanese to accuse the company of not trying hard enough. Motorola had only achieved 4 per cent of the Japanese domestic market, not the 33 to 50 per cent promise held out. Mr Christopher Galvin, chief operating officer of Motorola, said yesterday that his company had lost an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 169m) and Dollars 300m in annual sales because of the barriers which Japan appears to have erected around the greater Tokyo cellular market. However, he hoped the US would not have to impose sanctions against Japan. A trade war with Japan would be counterproductive, he said. The grace period of up to 30 days gives the US and Japanese governments time to cobble together another agreement in this field. But should that fail, other US actions now seem more likely. President Bill Clinton may announce later this week his intention to revive the Super 301 trade law which, by setting up deadlines for sanctions against 'unfair traders', would allow a wide attack on Japan's perceived trade barriers. The Motorola complaint has been long on the books and the timing of the US finding is technically coincidental with the failure of last week's summit to agree on specific ways of opening the Japanese market. Nevertheless, US officials had warned it could well be the first indication of the extent of the US displeasure with Japan. US officials say the Motorola case illustrates the problems US companies face in penetrating Japan's markets. Motorola is the world's largest manufacturer of cellular telephones. Michiyo Nakamoto adds from Tokyo: Japanese officials, ahead of the announcement, appeared to regard the prospect of sanctions with equanimity. One indicated that neither the possibility of sanctions nor the sharp appreciation of the yen were cause for Japan to go back on its refusal to accept the numerical targets sought by the US for a foreign share of its markets. 'We made a decision at this point and that is where we stand,' another official said. The Bank of Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets to support the dollar after the yen strengthened in Tokyo this morning to Y103.52. In New York, the yen closed at Y103.815, slightly down on its London close of Y103.1.

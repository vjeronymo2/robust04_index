			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov and </F> ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksey Agureyev]    [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Relations between Ukraine and  the United States are strategically important, U.S. Defence  Secretary William Perry said after talks with Ukrainian Defence  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy.    The two ministers discussed relations between the Ukrainian  and American armed forces, the implementation of the Partnership  for Peace programme and conversion plans, including housing  construction for the demobilised military.    They also signed an agreement under which Ukraine will be  granted 50 million dollars in addition to 135 million it is to  receive under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The means  will be used to finance the dismantlement of SS-24 missiles.    Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement  signed in Moscow as a "historic move and a way-out of the  nuclear deadlock." "This step and the ratification by Ukraine of  the START-1 treaty and the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free  state virtually removes all juridical and other barriers for  Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty," he  said.    At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of  obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process."  He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out  disarmament and solving social problems facing the military.    "We have also reached full understanding on issues  concerning  the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that  Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures,"  Radetskyy said.</p>

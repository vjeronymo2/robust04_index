			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK coal Leaks and threats of legislation are doubtless the stock in trade of Whitehall negotiations. Still, a large gap clearly remains between the amount of coal the electricity generators want to take and what the government is trying to unload. The basic deal, which gives British Coal a contract for 40m tonnes this year, has been agreed: it will give a significant boost to the generators' earnings. National Power and PowerGen are willing to burn an additional 8m tonnes of subsidised coal a year by not running stocks down rapidly and by displacing imported coal. That total might be increased somewhat but it is still well short of the 13m tonnes which Mr Heseltine thinks he needs to head off a government defeat. The difficulty arises because the government is unwilling to curb gas or nuclear output, or to sever its electrical French connection. At the same time the generators are reluctant to stockpile coal which might be in their yards for 10 years, even if the government were to cover the carrying cost. By running the generators shares up to all-time highs the market is betting that a deal will be stitched up behind the scenes. Yet if the government cannot ease a little extra room for coal in the electricity market it faces a choice between trying to sell parliament a smaller coal industry and an increasingly public squabble with National Power and PowerGen. As the government still wants to sell its 40 per cent stakes in both companies, it has an obvious incentive to find an acceptable solution before the market's insouciance fades.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Power costs anger large users: Electricity prices in wholesale pool reach near-record levels Large energy users reacted angrily yesterday as wholesale electricity prices in England and Wales reached near-record levels. The price rises contrasted sharply with last month, when they were at their lowest since privatisation three years ago. The changes have a direct impact on the more than 1,000 large industrial companies which buy their power on prices related directly to that of the pool. Yesterday's level of 3.4p per kilowatt hour was the third highest daily average since the electricity pool, the wholesale trading market, was set up in 1990. Pool prices are determined a day in advance with generating plant managers saying how much they are seeking to run their stations. Today's average price is slightly lower at 3.2p than yesterday's, but still more than twice the average daily price of 1.5p last month. The sharp change coincided with the end of a financial year in which there was a fierce battle for market share. Although the present high levels are unsustainable, following a recent deal between the industry regulator and National Power and PowerGen, the two largest generators, they will be cited by large power users who want the generators' ability to influence prices reduced. National Power and PowerGen both lost market share in the last financial year to other producers, including Nuclear Electric. But the level they charge remains the biggest factor in determining pool prices. Both companies say that last month's prices are well below what would be needed to earn an adequate return on their assets or to enable them to build new power stations. Mr John Stoney, energy purchasing manager for Imperial Chemical Industries, said the changes of the last few days meant that 'we have shifted from competitive prices to manipulated prices once again. 'The levels we had in March are what you would expect to see in a competitive market where there is overcapacity and high stocks of coal,' said Mr Stoney. 'The rises show how much power the major generators have over pool prices.' The large energy users can comfort themselves with the knowledge that pool prices will have to drop if the generators are to keep their pledge to Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator, that they price their power in such a way that average annual prices do not exceed 2.4p per kwh. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Association, said price rises this month were very disruptive to his members with pool-related contracts. They highlighted why Prof Littlechild was justified in limiting pool prices during the next two years in his deal with the generators.</p>

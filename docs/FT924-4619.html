			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Mexico's long road to recovery MEXICO, THE REMAKING OF AN ECONOMY by Nora Lustig Brookings Institution, Dollars 28.9 5 hardback, Dollars 11.95 p/back, 186 pages AT A TIME when optimism about economic prospects for the former Soviet Union and east Europe have sunk to an all time low, it is consoling to read Nora Lustig's account of the remaking of Mexico's economy. One thing her book tells us is that rebuilding a broken economy, particularly when world economic conditions are adverse, cannot be done overnight. After only three years, many observers appear to be losing faith in the ability of the former eastern bloc to cope with its economic waste-land. But as Lustig shows, it has taken Mexico ten years to emerge from the dark days of 1982, when the government declared a moratorium on its debt, to the present day when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is forecasting single-digit annual inflation and growth of 5 to 6 per cent throughout the mid-1990s. There are big differences between Mexico and the former eastern bloc countries but there is one important parallel. Poor external conditions stymied Mexico's economic progress in the 1980s, just as slow world growth is now hindering the development of the bloc. In a down-to-earth analysis of Mexico's economic rejuvenation, Lustig argues that the main explanation for Mexico's slow economic recovery lies in the adverse world economic conditions - scarce external credit, unfavourable terms of trade and high real world interest rates - that prevailed since 1982. She argues that these factors prevented a 'bounce back' of the Mexican economy after what should have been a two-year rather than an eight-year adjustment period. Falling oil prices and high world interest rates meant that the debt burden worsened rather than eased as the decade wore on. This discouraged private sector investment because of fears that the government would have to raise taxes or resort to inflationary financing by printing money to keep up payments. Whenever the government tried to deter capital flight by raising domestic interest rates, private investment and growth were further affected. Second, lower oil prices, higher real interest rates and external credit rationing hindered recovery by triggering a much larger relative cut in public investment than in current government expenditures because the Mexican government had to act quickly and found it easier to cut investment. Last, with a heavy debt burden and poor external conditions, Mexico had to devalue the peso in order to help generate a balance of payments surplus. But this fueled inflation and further impeded recovery. It took successive Mexican governments three attempts to defeat inflation, restore business confidence, and encourage the return of domestic and foreign capital. Once conditions were in place two crucial boosts to confidence in 1990 - reprivatisation of the banks and the announcement that the government would be seeking a free trade agreement with the US - gave the spur to inward investment and economic growth. Lustig devotes an entire chapter to the social costs of readjustment and concludes that the economic strategy left a hard core of poverty that economic growth alone may not be able to eliminate. Also relevant to east European-watchers is the chapter dealing with public sector reforms. 'The crisis and adjustment process provided an opportunity to streamline the bureaucracy, improve the public sector's revenue collection and expenditure mechanisms and redefine the nature and extent of state participation in the economy,' writes Lustig. Her conclusions on the success of the reforms are somewhat indecisive, mainly because it is too early to judge the long-term results. However, she believes that the reforms were successful in encouraging private investment, and capital repatriation. An account of the Mexican readjustment process is bound to throw up interesting parallels with countries facing similar problems. Lustig's thoughts on the Mexican experience are that while it teaches important lessons its case is probably difficult to replicate: Mexico has an acquiescent labour force and a uniquely cohesive and controlled state. Nonetheless, the book's publication is timely. With the signing of a free trade agreement with Canada and the US in August, there is evidence to suggest that Mexico could be one of the fastest growing economies of the 1990s.</p>

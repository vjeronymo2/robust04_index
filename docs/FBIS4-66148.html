			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- European foreign  ministers agreed Friday [27 May] on measures aimed at preventing  border conflicts in East Europe and solving problems over ethnic  minorities. [passage omitted]    Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, addressing fellow  ministers, welcomed the planned pact, but warned it might  conflict with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    Accords reached at the roundtables will be enshrined in a  Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and  registered with the CSCE. [passage omitted]    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied at a press  conference that the stability conference was duplicating  existing organisations such as the CSCE.    The stability conference was "filling a vacuum" and was "not  a CSCE mark-2, nor another Council of Europe nor a Western  European Union," Juppe said.    The foreign minister said that the CSCE had not undertaken  any action on behalf of the Hungarian minorities, for example,  and that it was the special interest of the EU to sponsor  efforts to solve the problems of future members.    Juppe hailed the conference as "a great success," but  insisted that "the essential remains to be done" in preparing  accords to be slotted into the Stability Pact.    He said the conference would disappear "within a year" when  the pact was inaugurated.    One of 10 countries listed as a potential new member --  Slovenia -- was dropped in the final draft of potential new  members, leaving Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,  Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.    The move illustrated that some existing EU members also have  minority problems. Officially Slovenia was removed because it  has no association agreement with the EU, but Slovenian  conference sources said the new Italian government had applied  pressure on behalf of the 3,0O0-strong Slovenian minority in  Italy agitating to recover their property in Slovenia.    The conference turned down a plea by Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszensky for direct participation by 1.6 million  Hungarian-speakers in Romania and 600,000 in Slovakia in its  regional roundtable. Budapest is anxious to protect their  rights to autonomy, notably in the cultural field, while the  Romanian and Slovakian Governments are seeking Hungarian  acceptance of the inviolability of existing borders.    Kozyrev insisted the focus should be "to concentrate on  specific steps to improve interethnic relations and to ensure  the rights of national minorities. This is especially necessary  for the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,"  he added.    He said discussion of border and minority issues "should  take  place exclusively in the framework established by CSCE  documents."    But the tone of the conference was set on Thursday by  Balladur and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In a joint opinion  column in the daily LE MONDE, the two leaders proposed that the  would-be EU members be invited to attend Union summit meetings.</p>

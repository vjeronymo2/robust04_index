			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Sarajevo airlift resumes THE United Nations will today resume the humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo, suspended exactly a month ago after an Italian relief aircraft was shot down. The resumption of the airlift comes amid mounting international concern for the fate of hundreds of thousands of people in Bosnia who may not survive the winter. Two US aircraft are due to fly food and medical supplies to Sarajevo from Germany. They will return to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and fly in more humanitarian aid from there to some 380,000 people trapped in the Bosnian capital, said Mr Michael Keats, a spokesman for Zagreb office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), yesterday. France has also announced it will rejoin the international airlift, sending two aircraft to Sarajevo from Split, the Croatian port city. UNHCR officials said the combined effort could bring as much as 60 tonnes to the battered city besieged for nearly six months by Serb forces. The mission will be the first since September 3, when aid flights were suspended after an Italian aircraft was shot down south-west of Sarajevo over mountains controlled by Croat and Moslem forces. Both Britain and Germany said that they would not participate in the resumed humanitarian airlift for the moment. A Ministry of Defence official in London said that the safety of British aircrews was involved and that it was up to Britain to take its own decision on whether to participate in the flights. Such a decision would be taken on the basis of information on the risks of the operation given by British military personnel in Bosnia and after talks with other nations involved in the airlift. In Bonn, a German Ministry of Defence official said Germany was unlikely to restart its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo until mid-October. 'We are still in the process of fitting electronic (weapon detection) devices into our aircraft,' he said. George Graham adds from Washington: President Bush announced last night that the US would accept a 'no fly' zone in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Pentagon however remains very reluctant to do much to enforce it. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US acting secretary of state, acknowledged earlier in the week that there was a split within the administration over the question.</p>

"I don't want to speculate on it," a STAR TV spokesman said  when questioned on the report in the latest issue of the Far  Eastern Economic Review.    The newsmagazine said STAR TV -- which Murdoch's News Corp.  Ltd. acquired last year for 525 million U.S. dollars -- would  cease relaying the BBC to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in May in  favor of the new movie service. The BBC would still be  available to STAR TV viewers in other parts of Asia and in the  Middle East, according to the report.    Media analysts believe Murdoch is keen to drop the BBC --  which enjoys editorial autonomy -- in favor of his Sky News  channel, now seen in Europe. China strongly criticized the BBC  last year for a critical documentary on late chairman Mao Zedong  that was aired in Britain, although it has yet to be repeated on  the BBC's Asian service.</p>

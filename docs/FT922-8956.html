			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (10): The office in the sky - Airborne services are expanding FOR MANY business travellers the cabin of a long-haul aircraft is a haven from the clattering machinery and constant telephone calls of their offices. There is fine wine and fine cuisine to enjoy; and on most flights there are six hours or so of comfortable travel 30,000ft above the daily grind. But all this is about to change. Aware that flying time is working time for executives, the world's leading airlines are putting office equipment in the sky. Travellers who in the past had only to concern themselves about whether the steak would be rare or the Pouilly-Fuisse chilled, now worry about making long-distance calls and sending faxes from up in the stratosphere. What, for some, was the ultimate bus to work has now become an extension of the office. New technology has enabled carriers to offer faxes and - at one's seat - on-screen share price information and mobile phones for direct-dialling to any number on the globe. Leading the pack among office-minded airlines is probably MGM Grand Air, a subsidiary of the entertainment group. The US carrier's fleet of refurbished DC-8 aircraft boasts a computer and telephone at each leather-bound seat. An all-executive configuration has created space for conference rooms, sleeping quarters and even marble bathrooms. MGM Grand Air, however, is not regarded as serious competition by larger rivals such as American Airlines and United. It is essentially a one-route operation: Los Angeles to New York, although it has applied to fly to London. Among the so-called mega-carriers, Japan Air Lines is one of the leading innovators in changing the image of business class travel from 'room to be bored' to boardroom. In addition to its traditional in-flight mail-service and more recent introduction of personal video screens, JAL has been the first airline to experiment with satellite communications to offer telephone and fax services. Later this year the carrier will be one of the first to introduce CD players on flights. But as in other areas of technology, where Japan leads, the US soon follows. American companies such as GTE Airfone and Hughes Avicom are developing new systems to beam business information into aircraft cabins. GTE Airfone, which has just won an order to install equipment on 78 aircraft operated by Continental Airlines, has launched Genstar. This is a new information service using digital technology to broadcast stock market news via ground stations and satellites to business travellers. It can also transmit faxes, computer data and other information. GTE claims it will even allow travellers to contact people on other flights. If the idea of a mid-flight call from your boss puts you off your canapes, then you might opt for an airline using the alternative Hughes Avicom system. The California-based avionics company has developed technology feeding information to mini-computers mounted in seat armrests. Hughes' computers work on a touch-screen basis to offer live television events and continually updated share prices. American Airlines has Hughes Avicom technology on 60 aircraft, as has Emirates, the UAE carrier which is spending Dollars 1.4m on personal videos in each aircraft. Emirates expects to install telephones next year and Mr Mike Simon, the airlines external relations general manager, says faxes will follow soon after. All this gadgetry, from faxes to phone calls, does not come cheap. MGM's luxuriously appointed fleet cost Dollars 55.5m or Dollars 162,500 for each seat equipped with the desktop basics: telephone and computer. There is no cheap rate period for air to ground telephone calls. JAL's system, which relays calls to Kokusai Denshin Denwas - the equivalent of BT  -via the Inmarsat pacific satellite, costs about Pounds 6 a minute. Travellers pay for their calls with credit cards inserted in a groove in the telephone handset. Once payment is cleared, the Japanese operator on the ground connects the airborne caller to the normal international telephone network. Northwest Airlines, meanwhile, is spending Dollars 70m on Hughes-Avicom equipment for their first and business class cabins as part of a Dollars 450m upgrade. The system, called Worldlink, is to be installed in the back of each economy seat and in the armrests of forward section seats. Mr Richard Bertagna, president of Hughes-Avicom, says: 'We hope to provide Northwest with on-board telephones, aircraft satellite antennas and direct satellite links.' Few European carriers are matching the schemes planned by their US and Japanese rivals. Moves to install passenger telephones have been hampered because there are no pan-European air-to-ground links or Terrestrial Telecom Systems, as they are known in the US. The high cost of satellite communications, meanwhile, has dissuaded carriers such as British Airways from adopting JAL's system. BA is experimenting with new technology but a decision on large-scale investment will not be taken until a system exists which can be used throughout its route network. Mr Ken Codrington, the airline's project manager on cabin avionics, says BA is working closely with telecom companies to develop an airborne public telephone system. The proposed European system will offer voice links initially and data services at a later date. BA is, however, installing new video screens in its business and first-class cabins which can be upgraded to use interactive technology. Business travellers can, therefore, expect an increasing array of office equipment at their fingertips before the end of the century. From take-off to landing, executives will no longer be out of touch and flying-time could soon become part of the ordinary working day. 'It's the next generation of in-flight service,' says Mr Simon at Emirates. 'Airlines will do whatever is necessary to keep businessmen in contact with their office.'</p>

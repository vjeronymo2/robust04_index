			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Willis rumours Takeover talk in the insurance broking sector refuses to go away and yesterday saw Willis Corroon, one of the sector leaders, move ahead 8 to 146p in spite of a sharp slide in interim profits. Once again, the word among the dealers was that HSBC, the Hong Kong bank which until earlier this year had a 6 per cent stake in Hogg Group, was interested. Speculation has been fuelled by the recent takeover of unlisted Jenner Fenton Slade. However, there was also a boost from a Willis statement that it would reduce costs by Pounds 30m without hitting earnings. The group is expected to sell property and make staff cuts. HSBC shares fell 7 to 755p. Elsewhere in the sector, bid talk also surrounded CE Heath, 8 higher at 248p. Electricity generator National Power was one of the day's strong market features after the group surprised the market with news of a share buy-back scheme. The shares closed 7 ahead at 511p as the market celebrated the announcement that National Power intends to buy back between 6.5 and 8 per cent of its share capital when the government sells its remaining 40 per cent stake early next year. The news, which came with publication of better than expected interim profits, had not been expected until after the government sale. However, there were reports of concern among several institutions about the tax implications of the move. Sentiment was also dampened in some quarters by the 16 per cent rise in the dividend, which paled alongside the 26 per cent increase offered by PowerGen earlier this week. Powergen put on 3 at 564p in trade of 4.3m shares. High street bank Barclays fell 12 to 604p after Morgan Stanley moved to 'hold' from 'buy'. The US house left its current profits forecasts unchanged but argued that the recent outperformance prompted by heavy switching within the sector had left the shares fairly valued. News that pharmaceuticals group Glaxo is to strengthen the warning on the US packaging for its new Asthma drug Serevent affected the shares, which shed 10 to 615p. However, most of the weakness reflected profit-taking on a slight dip in the dollar, and rivals Zeneca and Wellcome retreated 14 to 851p and 12 to 660p respectively. A large block of Fisons shares traded at well below the underlying market price caused some nervousness, but it was seen to be nothing more than a tax-related deal and the shares recovered to close a penny ahead at 127p. The buy-back spotlight moved to retailer Argos. The shares advanced 3 to 357p, with volume just short of a million shares, as whispers that the company will announce such a scheme began to circulate. The stock was also said to have been favoured by institutions looking for a home for cash received from the sale of Boots stock earlier this week. Marks and Spencer, 2 ahead at 412p, was also said to be a safe haven for such proceeds. Profit-taking in Boots saw the shares slip 2 1/2 to 514 1/2 p. J. Sainsbury was said to have benefited from recommendations from UBS and James Capel. The shares appreciated 4 to 424p. BTR remained active, turning over 9.7m shares as a major securities house attempted to offload a large line of stock. The stock ended 8 cheaper at 306p. Hardware and car components maker FKI was number two in the day's active stocks list. Turnover soared to 8.9m as the shares first fell then recovered smartly on confusion with the exceptional items within the interim results. They closed 5 higher at 167p, with the market finally settling for a positive view, centred around FKI's claim to dollar-play status with 70 per cent of turnover arising in the US. Turnover in leisure group Ladbroke rose to 10m (including a single block of 8m) as the other side of a tax-related deal was executed. The shares moved against the market trend to finish 4 up at 161p. Better than expected interims from Whitbread prompted a number of forecast upgrades - NatWest Securities raised its forecast by 5 per cent to Pounds 260m. However, expectations that the brewer will soon announce a corporate deal, perhaps the acquisition of Courage from Australian group Foster's, overshadowed the stock, which ended 3 lighter at 551p. Smith New Court was the day's main seller of Allied Domecq. Smith downgraded earnings expectations by 2 per cent for the current year and next year, and moved to a 'hold' from a 'buy' stance. The shares fell 11 to 600p. Disappointing figures from Hardy Oil &amp; Gas saw the stock drop 9 to 141p. Other statistics, Page 41</p>

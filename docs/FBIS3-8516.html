The town has been under attack from  surface-to-surface missiles of horrendous destructive power  since 1800. Seven such missiles have been fired exclusively at  residential and civilian buildings so far. The destruction of  Maglaj in this fashion continues even as we are sending this  dispatch, and it is 1850 hours now. A horrible evening in  Maglaj!</p>

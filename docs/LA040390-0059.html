			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SIMI VALLEY TO NAME QUINA AS FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> Stan Quina will be named Simi Valley High's football coach in a news conference  at the school today.  </P> <P> Quina, an assistant at Moorpark High the past two seasons, will fill a spot  vacated in November by Dave Murphy. Murphy resigned after posting a 21-40-1  record in six seasons -- including a 1-19 mark the past two seasons.  </P> <P> Quina, 34, graduated from Royal and was an assistant coach there from 1980-84.  He was chosen from a group of candidates that included Bob Misko, Roger McCamy  and Joe Howell.  </P> <P> Valley College's Andre Harrell has made an oral commitment to Cal Poly Pomona  and center Cliff Barnes has committed to Cal Lutheran, Valley Coach Jim  Stephens said Monday.  </P> <P> Harrell, a 6-foot-2 sophomore shooting guard who was Western State Conference  Player of the Year, averaged 15.4 points a game and led Valley to the WSC  title.  </P> <P> Barnes (6-6), who began his college career at Cal State Northridge, averaged  11.2 points and seven rebounds a game and will join a Cal Lutheran team that  loses senior center Mike Demeter.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen have also received a commitment from Kent Purser, a 5-11 guard  from Verdugo Hills High.  </P> <P> Purser averaged 21.4 points last season and was an All-Northeastern League  pick.  </P> <P> Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall High, the 1988 and 89 state champion in the  girls' high jump, said she has made an oral commitment to attend USC on a track  and field scholarship.  </P> <P> Mills, who has a personal best of 6 feet, also considered Arizona State. "I  just really like the school and the coaching staff," Mills said. "And I really  got along well with the girls on the team."  </P> <P> Mills was favored to win a third consecutive state high jump title, but will  miss the season after tearing ligaments in her left knee during a volleyball  match in September.  </P></p>

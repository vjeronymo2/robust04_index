The Travelers is a financial services holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries and certain affiliates, principally in four business segments; investment services, consumer finance services, life insurance services, and property and casualty services. The Travelers and its subsidiaries are referred to as The Travelers Group. One of The Travelers' principal indirect subsidiaries, Smith Barney Inc., which is a subsidiary of Smith Barney Holdings, Inc., is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``1934 Act'') and an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Travelers proposes to establish the Partnerships to provide investment opportunities for highly compensated key employees of The Travelers Group (``Eligible Employees''). The Partnerships will allow the Eligible Employees to diversify their investments, to pool their investment resources and to receive the benefit of certain investment opportunities that come to the attention of The Travelers Group. Each Partnership will be an ``employees' securities company'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(13) of the Act, and will operate as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. Each Partnership will have a general partner, the executive officers and directors of which will be Eligible Employees. The affairs of each Partnership will be governed by a limited partnership agreement to be executed by the general partner and each limited partner who will invest in the Partnership. The Travelers Group will bear all expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Partnerships. Units will be sold without a sales load. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Eligible Employees, in addition to being employees, officers or directors of The Travelers Group, will be engaged in various aspects of the financial services business. They also will be sophisticated investors who are highly compensated and otherwise able to fend for themselves without benefit of regulatory safeguards, and will be required to meet the standards for ``accredited investors'' in rule 501(a)(6) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Units in the Partnerships will not be transferable by a limited partner except with the express consent of the general partner and then only to parties that fall within the class of persons referred to in section 2(a)(13) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  has predicted that North Korea's nuclear issue will be solved in  one way or another within this year to provide a turning point  for inter-Korean relations.    When the nuclear issue is solved, the government will  promote  active cooperation and exchange programs with North Korea under  the three-stage unification policy which calls for  reconciliation and cooperation, the formation of commonwealth  and reunification.    The chief executive made the prediction after he was briefed  by Secretary General Yu Kyong-hyon of the Advisory Council on  Democratic and Peaceful Unification on the council's programs  for 1994 at Chongwadae [presidential offices] on Monday morning.    He stressed the need for national preparations for  unification, saying unification is not only a hopeful future of  the nation but also a challenge testing the nation's economic  and social power.    The council must take its root in the people as a trusted  unification organization and seek to achieve national consensus  on unification.    Kim called on the council to increase the use of some 1,000  members in 46 countries for stepped-up overseas programs, saying  an approach to North Korea's closed society through overseas  Koreans may be effective in creating a unification environment  in the North.    In his briefing, Secretary General Yu said the council would  focus its overseas programs on Korean communities of more than  10,000 in Japan, the United States, Germany, Canada and other  countries and increase exchange programs with ethnic Koreans in  China in a bid to win their support for Korean reunification.    The council will prepare several unification scenarios and  increase both direct and indirect programs designed to help  North Korea open its doors to the world.    To provide students and housewives with an opportunity to  discuss their views of unification and thus to achieve national  consensus, the council will provide unification forums and  classes for them.    Yu said the council would name some 300 specialists as  monitors of the developments of North Korean and international  situations related to Korean unification to make trustworthy  unification policy recommendations to the government.</p>

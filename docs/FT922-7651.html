			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Anti-strike law planned by Madrid THE Spanish government is to press ahead with tough new anti-strike legislation after failing to reach agreement with trades unions in negotiations last week, Peter Bruce writes from Madrid. Just two weeks before a general strike planned for May 28, the government has decided to abandon negotiations on the law with the unions. The law, certain to be passed in the next few months, seeks to regulate the way strikes are run. It would allow the state to impose minimum services during strikes, fine or sack strike leaders, withdraw state subsidies to unions, and give judges the power to decide whether a strike was political and therefore illegal.</p>

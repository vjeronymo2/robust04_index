The requested amendment also would permit ML &amp; Co. or its affiliates to participate in co-investments with a Partnership and an Affiliated Co-investor may make additional investment opportunities available to its security holders, which would include ML &amp; Co. or an affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Kecalp Order approves certain transactions in accordance with rule 17d&hyph;1. Specifically, the Partnerships may invest in (a) any other partnerships or investment vehicles which are sponsored or managed by ML &amp; Co. or its affiliates or (b) investments in which a partnership described in clause (a) is a participant or plans to become a participant and which would not be prohibited investments except that ML &amp; Co. or any of its subsidiaries, or one or more officers, directors, or employees of the General Partner, have a partnership interest in or compensation arrangement with such partnership. Since the Affiliated Co-investors are not, by definition, sponsored or managed by ML &amp; Co. or its affiliates, co-investments by the Partnerships with the Affiliated Co-investors are not permitted under the terms of the Kecalp Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Employees of ML &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries must meet the suitability standards of a Partnership in order to be eligible to purchase units in a Partnership. In addition, the Partnerships' prospectuses have stated prominently that the units are speculative and are not a suitable investment for all qualified investors. Partnership interests in Partnerships formed after 1991 will not be offered to employees who earned, or whose annualized salary was, less than $75,000 with respect to the calendar year preceding the offering of such Partnership. In addition, no employee meeting the salary requirement will be permitted to invest more than 15% of his or her cash compensation from ML &amp; Co. or its subsidiaries in any Partnership unless such employee is an ``accredited investor,'' as defined in rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an order under sections 6(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder to permit the Partnerships to co-invest with the Affiliated Co-investors. Section 6(b) provides that the SEC shall, upon application, exempt any employees' securities company from the provisions of the Act if and to the extent that the exemption is consistent with the protection of investors. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder prohibit an affiliated person of an investment company, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. ML &amp; Co. and its affiliates (as such term is defined in the Act) may be deemed to be affiliated persons of the General Partner under the Act. The General Partner is an affiliated person of the Partnerships within the meaning of the Act. As a result, joint investments by any Partnership with ML &amp; Co. or an affiliate of ML &amp; Co. may be subject to section 17(d). In addition, a co-investment by a Partnership with an Affiliated Co-investor may be subject to section 17(d) to the extent the Affiliated Co-investors is an affiliated person of ML &amp; Co.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Rule 17d&hyph;1 permits the SEC to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section 17(d). Applicants represent that the General Partner and its affiliates are concerned with the relationship among themselves and the key employees and directors who invest in the Partnerships and that the Partnerships were organized by ML &amp; Co. to generate and maintain goodwill. In addition, the limited partners of the Partnerships have been informed of the possible Partnerships' dealing with ML &amp; Co. and its affiliates and as professionals employed in financial services businesses, the limited partners are able to evaluate the risks associated with those dealings. Applicants submit that the composition and operation of the board of directors of the General Partner also will mitigate any potential for disadvantageous treatment of the Partnerships. The board is comprised principally of individuals representing senior management of a diverse group of subsidiaries of ML &amp; Co. who are selected on the basis of their substantive area of expertise. Accordingly, applicants believe that the terms of the relief requested are consistent with the standards in section 6(b) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

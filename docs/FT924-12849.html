			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (1): Politics and open markets - In the face of recession, activity has held up relatively well, with the restructuring of European industry and the efforts of US companies to gain a foothold in the EC the main forces at work behind cross-border acquisitions GIVEN the depth of economic despondency on both sides of the Atlantic, the mergers and acquisitions business is not doing as badly as might be expected. It is true, of course, that activity is nothing like as high as during the takeover binge of the 1980s. Those days are unlikely to return for a generation, if at all. 'I tell my younger people that, if you're lucky, you'll get three really good bull markets during your career,' confides the chairman of one London merchant bank. 'They'll be very lucky indeed to see another like the one that's just been.' There is also a lot less debt finance around to back big takeovers. The greater risk-aversion of banks and the lack of interest among bond market investors for anything but top-grade deals makes it harder to raise the money for large acquisitions. On the other hand, the potential M&amp;A market has grown enormously in scale as mergers and acquisitions have become more widely accepted as tools of corporate restructuring. Previously a pastime largely of US and UK companies, takeovers are fast becoming standard currency in the European Community, while Japanese resistance to the idea is also eroding. As a result, international merger and acquisition activity has held up relatively well in the face of recession in the two biggest domestic takeover markets, the US and UK. In Europe, the shift is particularly pronounced. Five years ago, 70 per cent of big takeovers happened in Britain, with only 30 per cent involving a continental European company. Those proportions have since reversed. The restructuring of European industry - and the efforts of US companies in particular to gain a foothold in the EC - remain the main forces at work driving cross-border acquisitions. Eastern Europe remains an area of great potential but little activity so far. According to Baring Securities, UK and continental European companies were the targets in around two-thirds of all cross-border M&amp;A transactions by value in the first half of this year. Back in 1988, North American companies could claim that distinction, as Europeans invested heavily in the US. The turnabout has come despite the weakness of the US dollar and the historically low level of US interest rates, which should in theory make this a golden age for foreign acquisitions of US companies. Even in Europe, though, takeover activity is not what it was. With hindsight, 1990 looks like having been the peak year for European acquisitions, as single-market fever (and fears that the EC was building a fortress Europe) reached a high pitch. It was also a time when US and UK companies still had the cash to make foreign acquisitions, before their earnings came under severe pressure. That year, reports Barings, no less than Dollars 68bn was spent on acquisitions in Europe, compared with Dollars 41bn in 1991 and Dollars 21bn in the first half of this year. Despite this slowdown, the EC is likely to remain the most active takeover market in the foreseeable future. As the target date for the creation of the internal market draws near, much of the industrial restructuring predicted at the time that the EC's Single Market Act was passed in 1985 has yet to be completed. In the mid-1980s, it was generally thought that cross-border acquisitions would lead to the advent of a dominant handful of companies in each of the main industries. With experience, this has proved over-simplistic. A larger proportion of corporate takeover activity has been directed at domestic deals, as companies - sometimes with the active backing of their governments  -have sought first to strengthen themselves against the threat from other EC states before looking at developing abroad. An increasing number of these strong domestic groups could now be ready to form cross-border links. The publishers Reed of the UK and Elsevier of the Netherlands, for instance, recently agreed a merger which could solve for both the problem of developing into a broad-based international business. This could be a timely moment for such friendly mergers, says one leading M&amp;A adviser in London. With few companies looking for big international acquisitions, such cosy deals have a better chance of passing unchallenged by unwanted predators. In some industries - banking, automobiles and airlines, for instance - companies have taken only the first tentative steps towards co-operation beyond their own borders. Typically, these arrangements have taken the form of joint venture agreements on new projects, or small cross-shareholdings. The first wave of tentative joint ventures in the banking industry has brought little result: the next step could be outright merger, as Europe's banks come under pressure to take a more forthright approach to their problems. The likely result is that politics will play a bigger role in the international takeover market in the years ahead. Few countries mind too much if their leading biscuit manufacturer is taken over, but they take a rather dimmer view of the loss of domestic control over a bank or car maker. A period of covert protectionism could be in store. The political dimension could also take on greater significance after Europe's currency market instability of recent months. The UK, for instance, has been the most open market in Europe for foreign acquisition. Last year, foreigners spent Dollars 11.6bn buying British companies, compared with the Dollars 3.3bn that UK companies spent on foreign acquisitions. If the semblance of political harmony across the continent has been disturbed, will the UK remain as wide open to foreign takeovers as it has been in the past? Against this background, the M&amp;A business has itself become an interesting case study for M&amp;A advisers. It reads like this: a domestic business, once limited largely to the Anglo-Saxon world, has gone international. This has left many of the experts in the industry looking too small or domestic, lacking the capital and the distribution network to capitalise on their expertise. At the same time, a downturn in the business has intensified the pressure for consolidation. The answer, most M&amp;A advisers would agree, is for more mergers or acquisitions. Yet investment banks generally guard their independence as jealously as the companies they advise. The path to a super-league of international M&amp;A advisers is likely to be a tortuous one. The experience of the UK's investment (or merchant) banks is a case in point. Five years ago, a handful of powerful houses were riding the crest of a particularly strong domestic takeover wave. The wave has since passed, leaving several either washed up on the shore or looking increasingly adrift. First to go was Morgan Grenfell, which opted for a takeover by Deutsche Bank to escape an aggressive approach from the French Suez group. Despite trepidation inside the bank at the time about the potential culture clash with Deutsche, Morgan has remained one of the success stories in M&amp;A, adding an increasing involvement in Germany to its domestic UK base. However, that does not mean Morgan's future is assured. It has failed to provide Deutsche with a decent return on its investment so far. As securities houses which sold themselves to commercial banks have found out in recent years, bank parents eventually lose patience and move to take a more direct involvement in their precious offspring. Others have tried joint ventures of varying types. Kleinwort Benson, for instance, sold 4.5 per cent of its shares to Banque Nationale de Paris and has talked about greater co-operation with both BNP and Dresdner. Barings, on the other hand, took a 40 per cent stake a year ago in Dillon Read, the US investment bank, in an attempt to do what no UK-based merchant bank has so far achieved, with the possible exception of Lazard: establish a strong transatlantic business. In recent weeks Samuel Montagu has taken a more modest approach to the same problem, concluding an agreement with PaineWebber to span the Atlantic. As corporate financiers are the first to admit, joint ventures frequently fail to achieve their desired results, often representing untidy compromises when an all-out takeover would work better. It seems a fair bet to assume that at least some of these relationships will harden into outright mergers or break up altogether in due course. Meanwhile, two other UK merchant banks - S G Warburg and Schroder Wagg  - have pressed ahead with independent strategies and built on their international reputations, while a third, Lazard Brothers, has succeeded in strengthening its filial ties with Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Yet these houses are competing with a growing band of international M&amp;A advisers, led by banks such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston, whose skills and contacts in Europe's M&amp;A business are already well-developed. Too many domestic brand names, and a growing number of international ones: the M&amp;A industry could do with a spot of sorting out itself.</p>

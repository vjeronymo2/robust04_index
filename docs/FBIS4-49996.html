			<p>BFN     [Text] While marked results have been achieved in the  extensive implementation of the shareholding system over the  last two years, a number of problems have cropped up, as well.  Yi Zhenqiu, chairman of the provincial commission for  restructuring economy, pointed out: If these problems are not  solved promptly, not only will they hamper the development of  shareholding companies, but they also will affect the healthy  development of the securities market. It has been learned that  there are four main problems currently facing our province's  experiments with the shareholding system:    1. People have a one-sided understanding of the shareholding  system. So far, some people still regard the establishment of  shareholding companies exclusively as a way of raising funds.  After funds are raised, investment projects frequently are  altered at will.    2. Some companies' asset assessments are inflated and some  individual companies juggle the figures on their financial  reports and make false reports on profits in order to lure  residents to buy their shares.    3. The government and relevant management departments have  not managed companies in accordance with the rules and  regulations by which limited-liability shareholding companies  should abide.    4. The first- and second-class markets are not converged  properly.    Yi Zhenqiu pointed out that the ultimate goal of the  shareholding system is to establish the independent status of  enterprises so they will become the main players on the market  and will change the way they operate. Shareholding companies  should be responsible to all the shareholders, and on no account  should they do anything harmful to the shareholders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata reconfirmed  Friday that the international community should take a firm  stance against North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development  while keeping doors open for dialogue, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    Perry and Hata also agreed in a meeting at the Foreign  Ministry on the importance of a diplomatic solution to the  problem and close cooperation among Japan, the United States and  South Korea, the officials said.    Hata told Perry if North Korea does not change its position,  it is inevitable that the UN Security Council will have to  discuss stricter measures, such as economic sanctions, against  Pyongyang.    "In such a case, Japan intends to take a responsible stance  within the framework of the constitution," Hata was quoted as  saying, adding that close consultation with the U.S. is  important in such circumstances.    He also pointed out that it is important for the Security  Council to proceed with the discussions "gradually and  step-by-step" so as to leave the doors open for dialogue with  Pyongyang.    Perry and Hata also agreed on the importance of China's role  in persuading North Korea to change its position, the officials  said.    They agreed to closely watch developments between North  Korea  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the  unofficial meetings with Washington, they said.    The officials declined to disclose the details of the  75-minute meeting because of the sensitivity of the issue.    "I don't feel free to say (the contents of the meeting),"  Perry told reporters after the talks.    Perry, who flew to Tokyo from Seoul Thursday night, was  quoted as telling Hata that he does not think a military clash  is likely on the Korean peninsula at the moment.    Perry said in Seoul Thursday that North Korea may be ready  within weeks to remove enough plutonium from a nuclear reactor  to build four or five nuclear bombs.    The IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea last month  to check its nuclear facilities but were unable to determine if  radioactive materials had been diverted to military purposes  because Pyongyang blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory.    Pyongyang in March of last year announced its intention to  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    On the bilateral front, Hata told Perry that relations with  the U.S. will be an important "axis" for Japan's new government  and that the country wants to deepen cooperation with  Washington, the officials said.    Hata is the most likely candidate to succeed outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Perry told Hata that the security arrangement between the  U.S. and Japan is the pivot of security in East Asia, they said.    Hata told Perry Japan is studying whether the Theater  Missile  Defense (TMD) system is effective for Japan's security.    He said he wants continued talks with the U.S. on the  matter.    The TMD system, an advanced version of the Patriot missile,  would destroy incoming missiles while they are flying above or  through the atmosphere.</p>

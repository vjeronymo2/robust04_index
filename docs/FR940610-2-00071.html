			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This joint CDC/HUD grant program will provide financial assistance and support to State and local government agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive neighborhood-based, holistic approach to ensure lead hazard control in a small, well defined neighborhood with a high percentage of high risk housing. These ``Primary Prevention'' demonstration projects are intended to bring together representatives from public health, the medical community, housing and rehabilitation, Community-based/Neighborhood-based Organizations (CBOs), business and labor interests, and other organizations interested in developing or expanding neighborhood-based lead poisoning primary prevention projects in targeted communities. The goal of these projects will be to develop or enhance neighborhood-based efforts to prevent and eliminate lead exposure for children living in high-risk neighborhoods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Essential Components of the Primary Prevention Project Include <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Identifying a high-risk neighborhood. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Establishing, expanding, or improving environmental investigations to identify sources of lead for children in the selected neighborhood. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Characterizing and prioritizing lead hazards in neighborhoods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Ensuring/providing effective rapid reduction, control, and abatement of lead hazards throughout the neighborhood. Priority for activities should be given to reducing and controlling lead hazards posing an immediate threat to children. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Planning hazard reduction, control, and abatement activities to take advantage of economies of scale for labor and materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Utilizing ``opportunity points'' when environmental intervention is especially convenient and/or timely (e.g., unit turnover, planned weatherization, remodeling, or renovation). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Ensuring/providing interim lead-safe housing for families during hazard reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Enhancing primary prevention knowledge and skills for residents, owners, landlords, etc., in high-risk neighborhoods through training and other methods. This includes planning and implementing a neighborhood education campaign. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Building coalitions and ensuring neighborhood participation in all components of this project, including the planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Training of staff and neighborhood residents to plan, implement, maintain, and evaluate all aspects of the primary prevention strategy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are requirements for the Primary Prevention Projects: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. A full-time director/coordinator with authority and responsibility to carry out the requirements of this primary prevention program. There must be sufficient grantee capability to plan, implement, coordinate, and maintain all aspects of the primary prevention strategy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. A plan to identify lead hazards in the neighborhood in a systematic manner and to oversee the safe and effective lead hazard reduction and control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. A plan to ensure that primary prevention activities are also directed at neighborhood properties not specifically eligible under the definition of ``priority housing''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. A plan to identify and ensure participation of neighborhood groups that have an interest in providing lead-safe housing, and a lead-safe neighborhood. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Assurances of compliance with HUD/EPA or other appropriate certification and training requirements, as well as other regulations relating to hazard reduction and worker safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. Information which describes why a certain neighborhood was selected for this primary prevention activity, including information on housing conditions, income, other socioeconomic factors, and previous surveys or screening activities for childhood lead poisoning prevention. The selected neighborhood must be a defined geographic area of contiguous blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Assurances and documentation that activities, services, and educational materials provided by the program are endorsed by neighborhood leaders or representatives of the intended target neighborhood. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. A comprehensive plan for program evaluation. Applicants should develop plans for evaluating program activities in two ways: Process Evaluations should be included for each component of the Program Plan. Process Evaluations should determine whether program activities were actually carried out as planned. An overall Outcome Evaluation for the program should be described separately. The Outcome Evaluation should be designed to measure, to the extent feasible, the impact of the program on the neighborhood environment and health status of children. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CDC will use the following evaluation criteria to rate and rank applications received in response to this Program Announcement. The review of applications will be conducted by an objective review committee who will review the quality of the application based on the strength and completeness of the plan submitted. The budget justification will be used to assess how well the technical plan is likely to be carried out using the available resources. The total number possible for the rating factors is 100 points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy and Technical Approach  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (25 total points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The quality of the technical approach in carrying out the proposed activities. The Strategy and Technical Approach should include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Description of the proposed neighborhood and the need for program activities. (10 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Plan for including neighborhood residents in planning, developing and implementing program activities. In addition, there should be: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Plan for conducting a neighborhood-wide assessment to identify and control lead hazards. (5 points) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

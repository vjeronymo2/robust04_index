			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Financing a green future in a planet without borders: A review of the World Bank and United Nations' Global Environment Facility CONCERN about environmental threats seems to mount almost daily. But industrial and developing countries have so far made little progress in creating an institutional framework for tackling these shared problems. In Geneva, today, representatives from 24 countries will discuss the future of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) - a pilot project that could eventually form the foundation for effective global action. The GEF was established in November 1990 for a three-year experimental period. It is jointly managed by the World Bank and the United Nations Development and Environment Programmes and, in principle, can commit up to SDR1bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in grants and technical assistance to help developing countries tackle environmental problems. It focuses on four areas: global warming; pollution of international waters; destruction of biological diversity through degradation of natural habitats; and depletion of the ozone layer. GEF funding is reserved for countries with a per capita income of less than Dollars 4,000 a year. To qualify for funding projects must be deemed to benefit the global environment, not just the country in question. The aim, therefore, is to give developing countries a financial incentive to pay attention to externalities - costs that are borne by the world as a whole. For example, the World Bank might provide a loan for a coal-fired power station. For an additional sum - say an extra 20 per cent - the energy could be provided by natural gas. But the country is not prepared to pay the extra for what is seen as a global benefit - lower carbon emissions. The GEF's role is to cover the difference between what the country will pay and the cost of a globally benign technology. The GEF has Dollars 450m of projects under consideration. Projects already approved include investments to limit greenhouse emissions in China and to encourage biodiversity in Polish forests. Most of the impetus behind the GEF has been supplied by European countries, particularly France and Germany where environmental movements are strong. But its strength today lies in the breadth of international support: 24 countries (nine from the developing world) have already pledged a total of Dollars 800m to its core fund. A further 11 have expressed interest in joining. Additional cash has been pledged through co-financing arrangements. The US, however, is conspicuous for failing to support the core fund. In Geneva, participants will review ways of developing the GEF beyond the initial three-year pilot phase which expires in 1994. Three options have been proposed: Prolongation of the facility along existing lines with no increase in funding. Incremental development of functions with enhanced funding. Creation of a permanent, independent institution to manage global environment policies. Most participating governments agree that a mere extension of present arrangements would not be a sufficient response to environmental challenges. Negotiations on international conventions governing climate change and biodiversity are well advanced. There is near unanimity that the GEF would provide an ideal umbrella organisation for disbursing funds agreed under different conventions. It already serves as a conduit for the Dollars 200m provided by the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting emissions. A proliferation of funding mechanisms for different aspects of the environmental challenge is widely regarded as undesirable. Participants are reluctant to talk about future funding levels for an expanded GEF. But some observers believe that funding levels could profitably be doubled or tripled once the pilot phase is completed. Much depends on the remit of an expanded GEF: whether it should intervene only to prevent national policies having adverse spill-over effects on other countries, or whether it should seek to influence the development of coherent domestic policies on the environment. In practice, say experts, it is often difficult to draw a clear dividing line between policies that do, and policies that do not, have international ramifications. The third option - the creation of a free-standing global agency - is widely regarded as premature and will receive scant attention in Geneva. In the long run, the GEF - or a successor body - will not be able to operate effectively submerged within the bureaucracy of three separate agencies. Ironically, the environment is one of relatively few areas where global co-operation is genuinely unavoidable: there is only the one planet. The case for a free standing agency capable of providing global leadership - an IMF of the environment - is thus quite strong. Developing countries will need as much as Dollars 125bn a year to introduce the measures likely to be approved at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, according to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary-general of the summit, writes David Lascelles. Some of this would come from existing aid programmes, but new money of Dollars 75bn a year would also be required. Mr Strong said in London yesterday these figures assumed that all aid programmes would start at once, which was unlikely. The figures were likely to be confirmed by the World Bank's forthcoming World Development Report, he said, and could be achieved if industrial countries merely fulfilled their proclaimed aid targets.</p>

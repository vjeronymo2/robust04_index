Replying to a question during question hour the minister  said  out of the total amount Pakistan Ordnance Factories, Wah, earned  US75,785,800 dollars, while Pakistan Aeronautical Complex,  Kamar, earned 9,163,621.63 dollars.    The parliamentary secretary for petroleum and natural  resources, replying to a supplementary question from Chaudhry  Nisar ali, said the plan approved during 1992-93 for providing  natural gas to 120 odd towns would continue without any change.    To another supplementary from the PML(N) [Pakistan Muslim  League (Nawaz)] leader, Iftikhar Hussain Gilani, the secretary  said Kohat was included in the list of towns to be provided gas  in the near future.    The defence minister, answering another question, said at  present PLA [People's Liberation Army] was operating weekly  Boeing 737 service on Karachi-Rahimyar Khan-Multan- Karachi  route. He said PLA had no plans to introduce any other Boeing  737 flight to Rahimyar Khan.    Answering a question from Raja Afzal, the minister in charge  of communications, said the government had abolished the  Islamabad- Peshawar motorway project.    He said the decision was taken due to lack of effective  traffic demand for such a motorway, noninclusion of project in  the master plan for road transportation and the 7th five year  plan's lack of resources and existence of highways in the same  traffic corridor, which were sufficient to cater traffic needs  till the year 2005. He said it was thus a bad project which had  created distortions in the economy and was therefore abandoned.    In another written reply the communication minister said  according to the contract agreement work on Lahore-Islamabad  motorway would be completed by July 30, 1955 and up to date  progress on the motorway was 20 percent.    The minister in charge for education, answering a question  from Yasin Wattoo, said it was decided by the government in 1989  that English be taught as an additional language from class one  in schools, where medium of instruction was Urdu or an approved  provincial language.    To another question, he said 123 students were sent abroad  during the tenure of the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad]  government.</p>

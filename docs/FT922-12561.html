			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Lloyd's Names step up action A GROUP of the hardest-hit Names at the Lloyd's insurance market is attempting to join forces with an existing action group representing those on other syndicates managed by the same agency. Members of Gooda Walker 387, a syndicate projected to face one of the largest losses in Lloyd's recent history, resolved yesterday to try to establish links with the Gooda Walker Action Group, headed by Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg. The Names also called on Mr Peter Nutting - a member of 387 and of the Council of Lloyd's, the market's governing body - to press for an immediate review of the syndicate's losses. Names are individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Members of 387 face losses of more than Pounds 35m - seven times the amount they committed - for the 1989 underwriting year. Mr Nutting came to prominence earlier this year when he led a successful legal campaign by Names on the Outhwaite syndicate. Nearly 1,000 Outhwaite Names recovered Pounds 116m of losses in an out-of-court settlement. Loss reviews are normally triggered when losses exceed 100 per cent of a syndicate's capacity - its capital base. A number of reviews are under way but the 1989 underwriting year has not yet been closed. Previous efforts for Names on 387 to combine forces with those on other Gooda Walker syndicates have met resistance from Mr Doll-Steinberg. He argues that 387 did not specialise in spiral reinsurance business, by which syndicates and London market companies reinsure each other's exposure to catastrophe losses. By contrast, syndicate 387 specialised in personal stop-loss insurance, providing reinsurance to individual Names to cover against excessive losses within the market. Yesterday's action coincides with evidence of an increasing rift between the Gooda Walker Action group, its chairman, Mr Doll-Steinberg, and other Names' associations. A number of different Names' groups agreed last week to support a new grouping backed by both the Association of Lloyd's Names and the Society of Names, which is seeking a negotiated settlement of grievances with the Lloyd's authorities. But Mr Doll-Steinberg refused to back the new grouping, which is also chaired by Mr Nutting.</p>

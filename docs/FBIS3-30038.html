			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan has decided to cooperate with China in its  project for building a new international airport in Shanghai as  "a key airport in East Asia in the 21st century." A  fact-finding mission has already been sent to Shanghai early  this year to arrange for the start of a full-scale research to  be conducted by the two countries. Chinese Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, who will visit Japan on 23 February, will confirm the  promotion of the bilateral cooperation at his talks with Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata. China intends to turn this project into  one of the major projects for obtaining the next yen-based loan  (scheduled to last from fiscal 1996 till fiscal 1998) just as in  the case of the project for building a bullet line between  Beijing and Shanghai.    Hongqiao Airport, which is located about 15 kms west of the  old downtown section, currently serves the Shanghai area.  However, due to a rapid increase in the number of flights, this  airport has become overcrowded. The new airport will be built  in the Pudong district, where drastic measures have been taken  to introduce foreign capital, and which is expected become the  forefront district for promoting the reform and open-door  policy. The new airport will be built on the bank of the Chang  Jiang River in the Pudong district, located about 30 kms east of  the old downtown section. It has been reported that the new  airport will be built not only as a replacement for Hongqiao  Airport, but also as a major gateway to the Pudong district in  Shanghai, where efforts are being made to turn the district into  an area for promoting the development of finance, business, and  advanced technology.    The government plans to organize a study team mainly  composed  of officials from the Transport Ministry and other agencies and  ministries; start a full-scale study in May; and work out a  report as early as September. China has already worked out on  its own a first-phase project for completing one of the runways,  hopefully, by 1996. By promoting the upcoming cooperative  plans, the two countries intend to work out both the  second-phase project, which will be completed by 2005, and a  long-term comprehensive improvement program which covers the  period up to 2020. The total cost for the project is estimated  at approximately 20 billion yuan (equal to 260 billion yen). It  is expected that while promoting the study of the project, the  two countries will hold discussions on concrete measures for  promoting financial cooperation.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / A 'stealth' adviser refines his targets: Tony Lake's confidence in US policies towards Europe An enormous painting of a bull dominates Tony Lake's office in the White House. If the president's national security adviser were in the habit of rolling his eyes in despair, as he might have been tempted to at times over the last year, he could not miss it. Although Mr Lake owns a farm, the agricultural analogy should stop there. A better label for him came recently from the Washington Post, which called him the 'stealth' adviser, unseen but not lacking in firepower. As befits the better academics, he speaks precisely, with humour and preferably off-the-record, though he has begun to give more public speeches. Like other members of the Clinton foreign policy team, he will concede 'bumps' have occurred in the relationship between the US and western Europe, not only because of well-publicised disagreements over Bosnia and trade but because of the evolution, for the first time in many years, of a coherent US policy towards Asia. This led to the 'perception' in Europe that it was being neglected in favour of Asia. Yet, in the Lake view, little has changed, since Europe, with Japan, remains at 'the core' of US foreign policy. What has moved on are the challenges all three are facing. Economic difficulties and new uncertainties, specifically on the state of Russia, produce both the desire for change and fear of it. 'This can translate,' he says, speaking for the record, 'into a lack of political will to come to grips with the newness of the (post-Cold War) world.' Except that he does not think this has happened. A veteran of the Carter state department, Mr Lake sees no comparisons today with the sour relationship between the former US president and the then-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. Mr Clinton may not have been to Europe this year but his appointments diary shows he met about as many European leaders in Washington in his first year as President George Bush did in 1989. He considers his own contacts with his foreign policy counterparts across the Atlantic to be optimal. Three presidential trips to Europe in the first seven months of the coming year ought to assuage European doubts, but, more than that, they are designed to give even greater substance to the relationship. Mr Lake gives economic security a high priority in US foreign policy but, perhaps tacitly acknowledging fears of a resurgent US economic nationalism, does not put it on quite the same pedestal as other members of the administration have. He rates it alongside conventional security problems and the promotion of democracy. The cornerstone of the US approach to European security lies in the Partnership for Peace, criticised in some quarters as too gradualist a programme to bring the countries of eastern Europe into the Nato net. When he was in Washington earlier this month, Mr Andrej Olechowsky, Polish foreign minister, did not conceal his disappointment with the co-operation on offer, especially in the light of the new menace of Russian nationalism evident in its elections. The US view is that western and eastern Europe, including Russia, face 'huge' choices and that Partnership for Peace, an evolutionary process, is deliberately designed to make those choices easier and less dependent on what happens in Russia. The 'habits of co-operation' explicit in the new approach may have no time-frame but, in stressing longer-term practicalities, also close no doors. This is the message Mr Clinton will give to the leaders of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in Prague next month after the Nato summit. The national security adviser does not believe Russian nationalism will get out of hand, but is convinced that the US must do nothing to contribute to its growth by pursuing policies that might be construed as threatening in Moscow. Equally, US economic assistance to Russia, while not neglecting longer-term reform goals, must also be geared to help meet shorter-term practical needs. US policy generally is committed to ensuring the continued viability of Nato, while reshaping it to meet new problems. Encouragement is taken from the fact that the Nato enforcement of the 'no fly zone' over Bosnia constitutes an important 'out of area' precedent for the organisation. If the US commits troops to enforce any peace settlement, it will only do so as part of a Nato operation. Mr Lake's worst moments this year have been over Somalia, as they were for Mr Les Aspin, the departing defence secretary, and he is reported to have offered to resign after 18 US servicemen were killed in Mogadishu. He seems now far more optimistic, even on getting North Korea to drop its nuclear ambitions, but not because he wants or even sees the emergence of some rigid new world order. To him, disorderliness opens the door for creative diplomacy, especially in harness with western Europe and Japan.</p>

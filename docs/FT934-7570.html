			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Councils and water to be reformed - Scotland THE GOVERNMENT is to reform Scotland's local government and restructure its water industry. It will not be transferring water industry ownership to the private sector. Council reform involves moving from the present two-tier system to a single-tier system. In a white paper in July the government proposed that the nine regional and 53 district councils be replaced by 25 unitary authorities. The three island councils - Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - would remain largely unchanged. The white paper proposed scrapping the Strathclyde region, centred on Glasgow, which would be broken up into 10 councils. It also proposed the break up of Lothian region, centred on Edinburgh. Highland region, however, would remain intact while the eight district councils within it would disappear. Responsibility for water and sewerage would pass from the nine regional and three island councils to three publicly owned water authorities, likely to cover the east, west and north of the country. The authorities will be expected to involve the private sector in the Pounds 5bn capital programme, thought to be needed over the next 15 years to bring the system up to date and to meet higher European Union standards. The new water and sewerage plants are likely to be provided by private sector companies on a build, own and operate basis, which has the advantage to the Treasury of not adding to the public sector borrowing requirement.</p>

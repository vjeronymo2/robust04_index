			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fiat To Report Losses, Hopes For </F> Recovery in 1994"]    [Text] Turin, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- The Fiat group, Italy's  largest private company, for the first time will show pre-tax  losses of 1.5 trillion lire (882 million dollars) in its 1993  financial report, Chairman Gianni Agnelli told the board of  directors on Monday [31 January]. In his letter to the board  containing provisional yearly results, Agnelli said after-tax  losses may reach 1.75 trillion lire, more than 1 billion  dollars, although the parent holding company, Fiat SpA, will  show profits of between 50 and 100 billion lire (between 29 and  58 million dollars), far less than the 507 billion lire of  profits reported the previous year.    The global slump in car sales, which saw 24 percent fewer  vehicles sold in Italy in 1993, has brought the Fiat group its  first negative results since it began publishing consolidated  reports in 1979.    The group in 1993 launched the largest rights issue ever  made  in Italy and almost doubled its capital, from 2.424 trillion to  4.096 trillion lire, giving the parent company financial  resources of some 5.1 trillion lire (3 billion dollars) at the  end of last year.    Other items of the yearly report, according to Agnelli's  letter, will not be so bad: revenues are expected to amount to  53.7 trillion lire (31.5 billion dollars), a 1.7 percent drop  roughly equal to the revenues brought in by the ailing  Rinascente department store chain. While revenues of the two  leading vehicle production units, Fiat Auto and Iveco, dropped  about 11 percent, revenues by New Holland rose 23.8 percent,  Teksid 6.1 percent, Prodotti e Sistemi Ferroviari (railways) 9.9  percent, SNIA Bpd 9.7 percent and Toro Assicurazioni 12.5  percent.    Indebtedness remained very high but, said Agnelli, mostly  because of investments in research and development. Debts at  the end of 1993 amounted to 5.5 trillion lire (3.2 billion  dollars) but thanks to the rights issue the ratio between debt  and net assets has remained balanced, Agnelli said. Investments  reached nine trillion lire (5.2 billion dollars), a record 16.8  percent of revenue (compared to 14.8 percent in 1992) and 1994  is expected to show improvements thanks to restructuring plans  and to the launching on the market of a series of new models,  spearheaded by the Punto compact model, which is apparently  selling well.    Restructuring plans, which include massive layoffs, are at a  standstill because talks with the trade unions have broken down.  Meanwhile in 1993 the total number of group employees fell from  270,876 (of whom 9,531 on long-term redundancy pay) to 261,500  (9,106 long-term redundancies).    The board that today received Agnelli's preliminary report  was the first since the family's two holding companies, IFI and  IFIL, formed pacts with major institutions such as Alcatel,  Deutsche Bank, Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali. It was  also the first time that Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, son of  Gianni's brother, Umberto, sat on the board as representative of  the fourth generation of the family dynasty.    Prospects for 1994 remain "critical" but the accounts are  expected to end up even at the end of the year, Agnelli said.  It is not clear when economic recovery will come but when it  does, he continued, it will be "very gradual" and with "long  pauses."    In other words, the car market probably will not see real  recovery before 1996, when sales may top the 13 million vehicles  of 1992. But this year the market slump should bottom out,  although investments will continue to be reduced because of  political instability and a more general "climate of mistrust,"  Agnelli predicted.    The chairman then turned to the layoffs which caused a  deadlock in talks with trade unions, saying that "the adoption  of painful measures" was necessary to adapt the number of  workers to falling production levels. These measures, he added,  "will reduce permanently some structural costs that are no  longer sustainable and will obtain a more effective plant  production make-up." Investments will allow eight new models to  be placed on the market this year, Agnelli announced. Two new  Alfa Romeo models will be unveiled at the April auto show in  Turin, a coupe and a spider will be ready after the summer, and  in autumn it will be the turn of a Ducato transporter, a Fiat  mini-van, a top-of-the-line luxury Lancia and the Lancia Dedra  station wagon.    Separately, the Fiat textile unit, SNIA Fibre, said it  expects to end 1993 in the black, after posting losses of 33.8  billion lire in 1992, and that it will launch a rights issue of  up to 152.4 billion lire (89.64 million dollars). The capital  increase would include a convertible bond issue for a maximum of  34.05 billion lire (20 million dollars) at a nominal value of  1,000 lire per share, a communique from the SNIA board said.    The Fiat board approved a fixed-rate bond issue of one  trillion lire (588 million dollars) at 1,000 lire per share  linked to a lottery for 100 Fiat Coupe and 100 Fiat Punto  models. Rates for the 10-year bonds will be tied to yearly  yields of the latest 10-year Treasury bonds and will be issued  by a consortium of guarantors coordinated by the merchant bank,  Mediobanca, "as soon as improved market conditions appear," the  Fiat board announced.</p>

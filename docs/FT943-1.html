			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa shares to be offered at DM182 New German and foreign investors are to be offered the opportunity to buy shares in Lufthansa, the German national airline, at DM182 (Dollars 118), a small discount to the last traded price. About 3.9m shares are being offered to private investors outside the US as part of the privatisation of Lufthansa, with the government reducing its stake from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. Dresdner Bank is co-ordinating a syndicate of international banks involved in the issue. Bankers hope the lessons learned in the sale could help them in the sale of Deutsche Telekom, one of Europe's biggest privatisations. A decision on which foreign banks will play leading roles in the privatisation, the first tranche of which is expected to raise at least DM10bn, is expected to emerge after discussions in Bonn this week. About 20 foreign banks have put in submissions and their presentations have been studied by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Bonn government and Deutsche Telekom. That this is taking place before a global co-ordinator has been appointed for the issue, expected in 1996, has been criticised by some German banks. Both Deutsche and Dresdner are keen to win the mandate. There is speculation that Bonn might appoint both as joint global co-ordinators to avoid any criticism from Deutsche Bank's own interests in the German telecommunications industry. It is understood that among the banks which have sent submissions to Bonn for the Telekom issue are: Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers, SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, National Westminster, NM Rothschild, Robert Fleming, the three main Swiss banks and several French banks, including Banque Paribas, Societe Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Leyland DAF may cut output PRODUCTION at Leyland DAF's Birmingham van manufacturing plant is expected to be halted for up to two weeks because of a continuing slump in the UK's light commercial vehicles market. Some 2,000 workers building DAF 200/400 vans, once known as Freight Rover Sherpas, will be told later this week whether they will be joining market leader Ford in production cuts. Ford's Southampton plant, which makes Transit vans, is at a standstill this week because of the sales decline. Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's managing director, marketing and sales, emphasised at the Birmingham motor show yesterday that a final decision had yet to be taken. It is expected that, if production cuts do go ahead, assembly line workers will be redeployed to other tasks in the plant rather than sent home. Leyland DAF exports about 40 per cent of its van output, but that no longer appears sufficient for the company to maintain full-time single-shift production. An annual review of the UK motor industry to be presented at the show today by Albert E. Sharp, Birmingham stockbrokers, takes an optimistic view of export prospects as a result of sterling's devaluation. The review expects a Pounds 10bn trade surplus on motor products.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: For richer, for poorer - Two cases of great significance to family borrowing Next week the House of Lords is expected to give judgment in two related cases which could change the face of bank lending practice. Barclays Bank v O'Brien and CIBC Mortgages v Pitt will decide whether wives who act as surety for their husbands' borrowings should be treated as members of a specially protected class to whom banks owe a duty of care. Whichever way the decisions go, they will have significant implications for borrowers and lenders. In the O'Brien case, Barclays is challenging the Court of Appeal's rejection of its claim for repossession of the home of Mrs Bridget O'Brien, a mother of six, who signed documents for a second mortgage on the matrimonial home as security for her husband's business debts. The extent of the guarantee liability was Pounds 135,000, although Mr O'Brien had told his wife it was only Pounds 60,000. Mrs O'Brien signed the charge without reading it. When his business overdraft exceeded Pounds 154,000, the bank sought foreclosure. The order for possession was upheld by a county court judge but overturned by the Appeal Court. The court said wives who provide security for their husbands' debts belong to a special protected class, in which equity would hold the security given by the surety to be unenforceable where the surety had not adequately understood the nature and effect of the transaction and her consent to the transaction was not a true and informed one. The court said that, on the facts, Mrs O'Brien had not understood the transaction. The bank had instructed the sub-branch manager to have the transaction and extent of the guarantee liability explained to her, but this had not happened. The court also said that, because of her husband's misrepresentation, she had not appreciated that the charge was for more than Pounds 60,000. Consequently the charge was enforceable only to that amount. Barclays appealed to the Lords. The CIBC case is similar but different in one respect - Mr and Mrs Pitt were joint borrowers. The matrimonial home was jointly owned. Mr Pitt, who was dominating both domestically and financially, told his wife he wanted to borrow some money against the house to buy shares on the stock market. He arranged a remortgage with CIBC for Pounds 150,000 on the basis that it was for a second home. Mrs Pitt signed the application without reading it. Later she signed the charge without reading it and any idea of the amount being borrowed. Mr Pitt invested the money in the stock market and, at one point, was a paper millionaire. But he lost everything in the October 1987 market crash. When CIBC began mortgage repossession proceedings, Mrs Pitt claimed she had signed the charge by reason of her husband's undue influence and that, as CIBC had not made her aware of what she was signing, the charge was unenforceable. Mrs Pitt has lost at every stage of her action. In the Appeal Court the judges said no liability could attach to CIBC as it had been a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. As far as CIBC was concerned, it was a perfectly normal remortgage by joint borrowers for joint purposes. There was nothing in the transaction to put them on notice. The court also overturned an earlier finding of undue influence, because it said the transaction had not been 'manifestly disadvantageous' to her as required in law. Mrs Pitt appealed to the Lords. Barclays' lawyer, Mr Anthony Pugh-Thomas, a partner of City solicitors Lovell White Durrant, says a great deal is riding on the outcome. The Court of Appeal appears to have decided wives should be placed in a special category regardless of whether or not they were subjected to undue influence, he says. If the Law Lords uphold that decision, it would oblige banks and other lenders always to insist that wives are separately advised. It could also open the floodgates to claims by thousands of wives who, although not subject to undue influence, signed charges without receiving separate advice. Mr Pugh-Thomas points out that borrowing for small businesses could also be badly affected, as a great many loans to small businesses are secured against the matrimonial home. The risk to the banks if the case goes against Barclays has not been quantified. Barclays has done its own internal calculations of the level of borrowings at risk, but says it is hard to put a precise figure on it. If there is a rush of claims by borrowers attempting to escape their obligations, it says, each case would be fought hard on its facts. But could Barclays accept a situation where each party has to be separately advised? Mr Pugh-Thomas says it could, because it is already regarded as good banking practice with husbands and wives. The British Bankers' Association code says banks should advise individuals asked to guarantee a loan for someone else to seek independent advice. Those safeguards may now have to be tightened. From a legal point of view, Mr Pugh-Thomas says the real difficulty for banks will be knowing who is entitled to this special protection. The crucial issue is how far the class extends. CIBC's lawyer, Mr Paul Brimelow, a partner of Manchester solicitors Fox Brooks Marshall, agrees. If the Law Lords rule that the special class afforded protection extends as far as Mrs Pitt, it will mean effectively that the mere relationship of husband and wife will be enough to raise a presumption invalidating the transaction. It will oblige lenders to ensure that, even where a couple take on a liability in their joint names, the wife not only understands the transaction but also, possibly, that she obtains independent financial advice. The implications of such a decision are horrendous, he says. It could mean that every time a couple arranges a building society mortgage, the woman will be required to seek separate financial advice. That could double the cost of conveyancing and could put back recovery in the housing market. The number of mortgage repossessions is down from its height in 1991, but there is still a large amount of mortgage arrears. If Mrs Pitt wins, there is a danger couples will see it as a convenient way to escape mortgage debts. Mr Brimelow hopes this would not be the response, but his firm has received a steady flow of inquiries about the case, which is an indication of the head of steam building up. Mrs O'Brien's solicitor, Mr Brian Hadcroft of Talbots in Birmingham, confirms he has been contacted by more than 40 firms of solicitors handling similar cases. Mr Brimelow says there is a positive side to the case, however, in that it gives the Law Lords the opportunity to reconsider the law on undue influence. Following National Westminster Bank v Morgan, for a transaction to be set aside for undue influence the plaintiff has to show that it was 'manifestly disadvantageous'. He thinks Pitt will become the leading case on undue influence. The Law Lords may be considering abandoning the requirement for manifest disadvantage, he says. This would mean protection for the old lady who was forced to sell her home against her wishes, even if she suffered no clear disadvantage as she got its full market value. The O'Brien case is thought to be evenly balanced. But Mr Brimelow believes Mrs Pitt ought not to win. Whatever the outcome, the two cases together will lay down the criteria banks will have to follow when lending in the future.</p>

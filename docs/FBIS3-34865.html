The official says this information was behind an alert the  United States issued to its citizens concerning the possibility  of attacks against them. The Egyptian prime minister told the  U.S. ambassador that Egypt's competent authorities have no  information or evidence in this regard. The prime minister  asked the ambassador to provide the Egyptian Government with any  information that Washington has on this so that the two  countries might cooperate in facing any possible threat to  tourists. Washington and Cairo are holding consultations on  this issue.</p>

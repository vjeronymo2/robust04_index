			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: London Fiduciary Pounds 6m gold deal London Fiduciary Trust, which former England cricketer Mr Phil Edmonds aims to build into a substantial gold producer, has acquired a heap-leach gold project in the Philippines from Runruno Mining Corporation for Pounds 6m. The purchase is to be satisfied by the issue of LFT shares at 5p each, compared with yesterday's market price of 2 1/2 p-3 1/2 p. The vendors have agreed to retain these shares for at least a year from the date of issue. LFT said an independent appraisal of the Runruno project suggests it has reserves for annual production of 50,000 troy ounces of gold for eight years at an estimated production cost of less than USDollars 200 an ounce. The independent consultants, London Mining and Metal Consultants, placed a net present value of Dollars 25.46m on the project.</p>

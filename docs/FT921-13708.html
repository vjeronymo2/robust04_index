			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Israel's hardline coalition collapses ISRAEL'S hardline coalition collapsed yesterday, buckling under the strain of its competing aims of entrenching Jewish control over the occupied territories and pursuing peace talks with the Arabs. The 20-month government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister, will formally lose its parliamentary majority tomorrow when yesterday's resignations by two extreme rightwing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, take legal effect. Intense parliamentary manoeuvring, which began last week when the coalition's impending demise became clear, is under way to determine when the government's official end will happen. A general election is widely predicted in May or June, before the scheduled date in November, following a no-confidence vote or an agreement between the main parties on the dissolution of the Knesset. The fall of the government would inevitably slow the halting progress of the US-brokered peace process, launched at last October's Madrid peace conference, still further. The coalition of right-wing and religious parties, led by Mr Shamir's Likud party, took office in mid-1990 following the fall of a previous coalition between Likud and the Labour party. As in 1990, the coalition collapsed because of deep divisions over Middle East peace policy. Then, Likud refused to proceed with US proposals for negotiations with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yesterday, Tehiya and Moledet quit because they objected to Likud's willingness to offer a limited form of self-government to the Palestinians in the US-backed talks. Tehiya and Moledet - the latter espouses the 'transfer' of Palestinians out of the occupied territories to render the lands completely Jewish - oppose any form of self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an irreversible step towards Palestinian statehood. They advocate the annexation of the territories. Likud believes it can achieve Jewish sovereignty and Arab acceptance of limited, non-sovereign Palestinian self-rule. It entered the peace talks on that basis. Mr Shamir is already casting Likud, for years a party of the hard right, as the party of the moderate centre, committed to peace negotiations. Yesterday, Mr Shimon Peres, the Labour leader, said the peace talks should be suspended while elections were in the air. But Mr Shamir is anxious not to jeopardise US economic assistance and has promised to continue the talks. However, the issue of Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in US loan guarantees, which Washington insists on tying to a freeze on Jewish settlement building, took an embarrassing twist for Jerusalem yesterday. Mr Avraham Burg, a Labour MP, released a copy of a letter from the Israeli embassy in Washington to all Israeli consulates in the US suggesting that the recent fall in President George Bush's popularity offered the chance for the US Jewish community to press Congress - especially Republican members - with renewed vigour to approve the assistance.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Britain's minister of overseas development, Baroness  Chalker, is off to Malawi tonight after her last visit for some  time, and things have changed. Under international pressure,  President Banda has allowed multipartyism. Elections are coming  up, and Malawi will be looking for moral and material  encouragement from Britain. But her visit also coincides with  skeletons jangling in Malawi's cupboards. There is a chorus of  demands for an independent inquiry into the death of three  ministers and an MP 10 years ago. The government insisted it  was a car accident. Now, there are allegations of  assassination. Ajoa Yeboa Afari asked Baroness Chalker what  message she would be taking to Malawi.    [Begin recording] [Chalker] Well, I should be asking  questions about their process of change, because I want to be  sure that they are following the path of good government,  respect for human rights, and the rule of law and that they are  continuing with their economic reform program. And we shall  actually talk about the elections, which we hope will be free  and fair. If those things are going in the right direction,  then I should be able to discuss further aid with the Government  of Malawi. But such aid will only take place, of course, after  the election.    [Afari] Since this is your first visit since 1987, does this  indicate a change in the British attitude toward Malawi?    [Chalker] I think that what has happened is that with the  referendum in Malawi, we have seen a change for the better by  their government. I have wanted to go back to Malawi, but it  was not yet given the right signal to go before that change had  taken place. I am extremely happy that a change has taken place  and that I can now go and have what I know will be fruitful  discussions, not only with the president and his ministers, but  also with members of the opposition.    [Afari] Talking about the right signals, I believe you are  aware that just recently a policeman is alleged to have  confessed to having taken part in the murder of some politicians  a decade ago, apparently on government instructions. What would  you say to people who would see your visit as a kind of boost  for the government at this very controversial time?    [Chalker] Well, first of all, I think you will understand, I  cannot comment on an internal Malawian matter. There is recent  progress on human rights in Malawi, but I shall be urging the  Government of Malawi that that progress on human rights and the  proper policing of the country should be continued. But I  cannot comment on individual matters.    [Afari] Baroness, I appreciate that. But I think since you  are also insisting on good governance, perhaps your support  otherwise might send some signals to other countries.    [Chalker] Well, I am consistent to the last on this, and I  will not allow our aid program to be used where government is  not in the best interests of the people.    [Afari] Baroness, would you then lend your support to a call  for a campaign in Malawi for an independent inquiry into the  atrocities?    [Chalker] I cannot comment on that publicly. I do not have  the details. Certainly, the people of Malawi deserve open,  honest government, and I should do all I can to encourage the  Government of Malawi to make sure they do have open, honest  government.

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Telecom sales match Sip expectations SIP, Italy's main telephone operating utility, reported sales of L9,451bn (Dollars 6m) in the first five months of this year. The company failed to produce comparable figures for the corresponding period in 1992, but claimed its results were in line with expectations. The company said sales for the first half, due to be released in September, would be similar to the L10,601bn reported in the first six months of 1992. The figures came as the Italian government gave its approval to the restructuring plan for the telecommunications sector, dominated by Stet, Sip's parent company, which is in turn controlled by the IRI state holding group. The plan envisages the streamlining of the complex telecoms sector, which currently includes seven leading public sector groups, and the creation of a single entity, tentatively called Telecom Italia. In a first move, Sip is expected to merge with Italcable, the long-distance international carrier, early next year. Mr Ernesto Pascale, Sip's chairman, said the company would not be seeking across-the-board tariff increases next year, but said it would try to restructure charges within existing ceilings. The number of telephone subscribers rose to 23.9m by end-May, while subscribers to Sip's highly-profitable mobile telephone service climbed to 864,000. Sogefi, the Italian auto components group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company, is setting up a joint venture with Arvin Industries of the US to rationalise their car exhaust systems businesses. The new company, which will have sales of about L300m and 1,600 employees, will be Europe's biggest producer of silencers. It will have four factories in Italy, France and the UK. The joint venture, combining Arvin's US exhaust technology with Sogefi's European sales and commercial know-how, will be geared exclusively to the replacement market.</p>

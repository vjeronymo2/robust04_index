			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Scapa rises despite setbacks in UK and North America SCAPA GROUP, the manufacturer of specialist products for the printing and paper industries, yesterday announced a 5.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 44.7m, in the year to March 31. Mr David Dunn, finance director, said the increase came despite recession in its main markets of the UK and North America. But Scapa was helped by favourable exchange rate movements and contributions from new acquisitions. Turnover increased 3.2 per cent to Pounds 300.2m (Pounds 290.9). Sales and operating profits held firm in North America. But in the UK, where the company is more exposed to the recession-hit automotive and chemical industries, operating profits fell to Pounds 9.39m (Pounds 14.6m). At the interim stage, Scapa increased pre-tax profits 2.5 per cent to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.8m). Net interest costs were Pounds 1.8m, down from Pounds 6.1m, helped by the proceeds of last year's Pounds 55.6m rights issue. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 57m) and gearing dropped to 22 per cent (31 per cent). There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 112,000 (profit Pounds 10.5m), mainly due to business closures. Earnings per share fell to 13.2p (15.2p), reflecting the higher number of shares in issue after the rights issue. The company is recommending a final dividend of 3.84p (3.65p) to make a total of 5.36p (5.1p), a 5 per cent increase. Mr Dunn said turnover in Europe should grow strongly this year following the acquisition of Scandiafelt in Sweden, which was only completed in January. In a full year, this company should add about Pounds 35m to sales, he said.</p>

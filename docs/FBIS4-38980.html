			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Russian military who want  to enter Estonia must present alongside with visa application  the timetable for the withdrawal of the unit they serve in.  Also, a Russian serviceman headed for Estonia must inform  Estonian authorities about his concrete task in the withdrawal  process.    Anatoly Chizhikov, the military attache at the Russian  embassy in Tallinn, told BNS the embassy received May 12 from  the Estonian Foreign Ministry a description of the procedure  established to control the entrance of Russian military into  Estonia, which contains the stipulation concerning the  withdrawal timetable. Chizhikov said it is "absolutely  unacceptable" to the Russian side, especially with regard to the  higher command of the Baltic Fleet or the Northwest Army Group.    "It would mean that the commander in chief of the Baltic  Fleet or the Northwest Army Group would upon entering Estonia  have to present a schedule for the pullout of all fleet or army  units, respectively. The government delegations have for two  years been unable to reach agreement on the timetables, and now  it is demanded from servicemen," the Russian officer said.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that the  ministry indeed sent May 10 a note to the Russian Embassy to  regulate the order of entrance into Estonia of Russian military.  Arusoo said the reason behind the note was that "trips by the  military became too frequent, so (we wanted) to make sure they  wouldn't be to-ing and fro-ing for no reason." Arusoo explained  the demand to present the timetable only applies to "military  men of a certain level."    "Of course exceptions can be made to every rule and the  higher command are not required to present upon entrance to  Estonia the schedule for the withdrawal of all units under  them," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GUN BILLS MERIT S.D. SUPPORT  </P> <P> The idiocy of civilian ownership of military-type assault rifles became so  tragically obvious when five children were killed and 29 were injured at a  Stockton elementary school that it's hard to believe that most of the San Diego  County legislative delegation could be lukewarm toward proposals to ban the  weapons.  </P> <P> At a time when these 11 members of the state Assembly and Senate should be  vigorously working to outlaw the weapons, only four favor a ban.  </P> <P> The strongest support comes from Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside). The former  Marine has supported gun owners in the past, but he understands that there is  no legitimate place outside of the military for the type of weapons that  increasingly are being used in drive-by shootings and against law enforcement  officers.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) is co-sponsor of an Assembly bill banning  sale of the weapons. In addition, Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) and  Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) say they favor some form of ban.  </P> <P> The Times found that San Diego's other legislators were either vague about what  they would support or that they favor prohibiting only violent criminals or the  mentally ill from owning the weapons.  </P> <P> Restricting gun ownership for violent criminals and the mentally ill makes  sense for handguns and rifles. But military assault weapons, designed to kill  human beings with rapid efficiency, call for more than half-measures.  </P> <P> The bills sponsored by Senate Majority Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles)  and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), which would ban the manufacture and  sale of military-type assault rifles in California, are more than  half-measures, and they deserve the full support of San Diego's delegation.  </P> <P> Such support could be crucial this week when the Assembly Public Safety  Committee votes on the Roos bill. The committee vote is expected to be  particularly tight, and support from newly elected Assemblywoman Carol Bentley  (R-El Cajon) could be the difference that makes a difference.  </P> <P> Bentley, who represents a district with 5,200 National Rifle Assn. members,  says she does not support the Roos/Roberti bills because she fears they might  outlaw some hunting and sportsman rifles.  </P> <P> The bills make a good-faith effort to protect sportsmen's guns, and we would  encourage Bentley and other members of the delegation to look beyond those  concerns.  </P> <P> Rather than basing a decision on the wishes of target shooters, we would urge  the legislators to listen to the advice of law enforcement officials around the  state, and to the cries of those whose friends and family have been gunned down  by these combat weapons.  </P> <P> At the same time, San Diego's legislators should close their ears to the  twisted logic of Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), who argues that banning  assault weapons would hurt poor people and minorities who need the weapons to  protect themselves. They should also shut out the hysteria of the NRA, which  contorts the Constitution and argues that civilians need to be familiar with  assault weapons in case of war.  </P> <P> Roberti and Roos, both from gang-plagued Los Angeles, know all too well about  drive-by shootings with semiautomatic weapons. San Diego's gang problem is  minor by comparison. By supporting Roberti's and Roos' bills, San Diego's  delegation can help ensure that it doesn't get worse.  </P></p>

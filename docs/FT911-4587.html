			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): A clean slate for adding up teachers' pay - Review of a government volte-face THE decision to establish a pay review body for teachers in England and Wales announced yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, marks the culmination of years of bitter conflict in education between unions and the government. Teachers, deeply troubled since their 1985 strike and the collapse of the Burnham negotiating machinery, join six other public-sector professions - doctors, dentists, nurses, paramedics, senior civil servants and those in the armed forces - covered by pay review bodies. The new structure is the first to be set up since that for nurses, midwives and health visitors was established in 1983 and adds 400,000 employees to the 900,000 at present covered by review bodies. The decision also represents a volte-face by the government, which until yesterday was committed to restoring pay negotiations between teachers and education authorities. No two review bodies are quite alike. Some have broader terms of reference than others - the nurses' board, for instance, is markedly more constrained in its remit than those for the armed forces and for doctors and dentists. The review body for teachers will be the only one to cover conditions as well as pay. Yet the similarities are more marked than the differences. All the bodies have the same function: to recommend annual pay increases based on comparisons with the private sector and assessments of recruitment and retention. Most of their members are drawn from professionals in the sectors they cover, with a few academics. The secretariats come from the Office of Manpower Economics, which safeguards autonomy and ensures some uniformity of output. They also share a weakness. They are bound by Treasury inflation forecasts, which have been notoriously optimistic in recent years. Moreover, the government reserves a veto where it believes 'wider economic considerations' should override review body recommendations. More often than not, recommendations are watered down, usually by ministers staging payment of awards across the year, which reduces their value in real terms. The government has staged payment of all 1991 awards except for the armed forces (because of the Gulf war). Only once in the past eight years have all the boards' recommendations been paid in full. A pay review body for teachers may help to ease the acrimony of the past five years, but any gains beyond that are far from assured. The recommendations of this year's Interim Advisory Committee (9.5 per cent for teachers, 12.75 per cent for heads) were on a par with those of the review boards, as was the government's decision to pay the increase in stages. 'Pay review boards are not a panacea by any means,' says Mr Chris Trinder, senior research fellow at the Public Finance Foundation. Differentials between public and private-sector pay have barely narrowed and pay review boards have fought shy of performance pay. Mr Trinder points out that under four years of Lord Chilver's interim advisory committee, teachers in England and Wales saw their pay fall below levels in Scotland, where teachers have retained direct negotiating rights. Much will hinge on the government's readiness to honour pay review board recommendations. 'The review bodies are there to protect the pay and conditions of public-sector employees, but who is there to protect the review bodies themselves?' asks the Income Data Services research group in a recent report. Teachers may soon be asking the same question.</p>

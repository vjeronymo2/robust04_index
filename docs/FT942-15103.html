			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Property: Half the price of London and no gazumping, either  -The joys of home-buying in Scotland's capital To buy a home in Edinburgh, follow the custom in Scotland's capital. Most people go to 85 George Street in the New Town to search the notices in the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre (ESPC), preferably after first visiting one who can 'hold their hands.' Few use an estate agent, except at the very top of the market. Instead, solicitors sell properties as well as conveying them, and run the ESPC as their own co-operative property shop. It is a cheap and efficient service where it is easy to compare homes on offer in any part of town and in any price range. Last year, 13,000 Edinburgh properties costing Pounds 768m passed through the ESPC. That was 86 per cent of city sales of second-hand homes - the ESPC also displays new homes as a secondary line - and leaves little for the estate agents or the word-of-mouth 'invisible' market in which properties never for sale formally are traded. If you want one of those, ask a solicitor who offers a finding service, or an agent. A grand Georgian town house can cost less than half its equivalent in London. A few may reach Pounds 600,000 but most go for less, around Pounds 450,000 for a whole house in a good street. Some people live in Edinburgh and commute to London for half the week; it takes less than 4 1/2 hours. The central city's setting - on slopes either side of Princes Street gardens  -is superb. The railway runs along the bottom, mostly in a tunnel. Ruling the middle of the gardens are the classical Royal Scottish Academy and the National Gallery, now restored to its Victorian glory inside. On the south slope, the castle side, is the Old Town where tenements were built 15 storeys high in the 16th century. Opposite is the rational Georgian calm - and greater hygiene - of the New Town. Its broad, paved streets, circuses, crescents, squares and sandstone houses with white woodwork and black railings make this one of the most satisfying cities in Europe. New Town houses often have flagstone floors in the hall; an oval lantern over the stair well; and smart apsidal (curve-ended) rooms with doors also made on the curve. Offices and flats are returning to being whole houses again, but the big conundrum is what will happen to Charlotte Square, the traditional birthplace of investment trusts. Two sides of it sit vacant where the lawyers and fund managers have moved to modern offices. The best addresses in the New Town are Moray Place, Heriot Row and Ann Street. Unlike London, there are no big estates. Houses are freehold or, to be more correct, feudal holdings. Edinburgh so liked the Georgian style that it survived into the early 20th century, giving the city a rare visual unity. Its other joys include soft water from the tap, a small river called the Water of Leith, tartan rugs on taxi seats, and the country and sea close by. From the north side, you look south to the castle or north over the Firth of Forth to the hills of Fife. Murrayfield, the famous rugby ground, is close to the heart of the city and the old Empire music hall will soon re-open as the opera house. To sell through the ESPC, first discuss price, title and arrangements with a solicitor. (It is not for nothing that Scots used to talk of him as 'my man of affairs'). He will prepare rather plain particulars (by English standards) and send a small notice, with photograph, to join the other 4,500 in the ESPC. For Pounds 130, the property will be displayed in the centre and appear in the weekly list until a sale is agreed. Buyers go to the ESPC to look at the cards displayed and numbered, like vacancies in a job centre, and starting with properties below Pounds 30,000. When you have found something, you take the number to a counter and receive the particulars. The ESPC can refer you to a solicitor for a free preliminary consultation (if you do not have one) and has a computerised matching service to identify what suits your needs. The solicitor will make the bid for you. In Scotland, this is run together with exchange of contracts, which is known as conclusion of missives. You do not make an offer subject to contract and survey, as in England. Instead, you do the survey - which means you are serious - and then decide what to bid. (Here, an architect like Lorn Macneal can help. Expert in restoring New Town houses, he can assess the property - for just Pounds 75 plus VAT - and produce a preliminary schedule of works, with their likely costs and possible sources of grants. These include the district council and the Edinburgh New Town Conservation Committee, which also has a list of good craftsmen). The solicitor then sends a missive, mentioning a price and various legal matters, and the vendor's solicitor replies. Once there is a written acceptance, there is a contract. To accept more from somebody else (gazumping) is a breach of contract under Scottish law, and the original buyer can obtain redress. The final stage is settlement (completion in England). Conveyancing fees tend to be higher in Scotland than England, where solicitors compete for business. But the marketing fee will be less - probably 1 to 1.5 per cent. A solicitors' finding service will cost 1 to 2 per cent. For those who prefer an agent, Rettie &amp; Co. is a new firm that specialises in New Town houses. One on offer is 17 Drummond Place, six storeys high and restored beautifully, for around Pounds 550,000. Prices in the New Town turned in September, Simon Rettie says, and may now be up to Pounds 50,000 more than then. Meanwhile, a smart, two-bedroom flat at 8 Northumberland Street in the New Town is on offer from Simpson &amp; Marwick for over Pounds 97,000. Apart from the New Town, there are good flats for the young in such areas as Marchmont, Comely Bank and Bruntsfield. 'Parents would feel relaxed if their children were there,' says Richard Loudon, of Simpson &amp; Marwick. And good parts of town for the family are Murrayfield, Newington, Grange and Trinity. A 1900 terrace house in Murrayfield costs around Pounds 250,000 and a semi Pounds 300,000. Good value in a glorious city.

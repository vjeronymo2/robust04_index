			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Man in the News: The coarse Mr Clean - Umberto Bossi Only one politician seems to be enjoying himself these days in Italy - Umberto Bossi, the gravel-voiced leader of the Lombard League. While Italy's traditional parties, overwhelmed by corruption scandals, are searching for ways of reforming themselves, Mr Bossi has found a winning formula. Mining the rich seam of anti-Rome sentiment in northern Italy, and mixing this with populism and moralism, he has converted the League into the most remarkable political phenomenon in Europe. The results of this week's partial municipal elections have confirmed that he now heads the biggest party in the north of the country and can muster the second largest number of votes nationwide. Although Mr Bossi founded the League in 1984, it has only burst on to the political scene in the past year. 'We are the great iceberg floating amid absurd little groupings,' he said this week with a flourish of customary hyperbole. 'The Socialists have become as significant as a mere telephone prefix and the Christian Democrats have been saved only by the Church.' Part of the League's good showing, as well as its earlier success in the April general elections, has been due to a protest vote against Italy's unworkable political system and to the discredit of the traditional parties such as the Christian Democrats and Socialists. The League is untainted by corruption because it has not experienced power at either local or national level. Nonetheless, Mr Bossi's success in achieving a third of the northern vote is a striking achievement in such a short time. All the more so, since Mr Bossi is politically inexperienced, his movement has very little money, and it has been treated with hostility by the political establishment and the bulk of the media. The enmity towards Mr Bossi is understandable. In his wilder statements, he advocates a dangerous northern separatism, which sends shivers down the spines of leading editorialists. His party offices are full of posters boldly stating 'Republic of the North'. At gatherings, the League sells its own currency as provocative souvenirs, and Mr Bossi has on one occasion called on his supporters to boycott purchase of the Treasury bills that finance Italy's huge debt. He has nothing but contempt for the Rome politicians, whom he dismisses as 'all robbers'. Once asked about his wealth, he said he gave half his senator's pay to the League, adding: 'As for my bank account, it is as empty as a Rome politician's head.' In appearance and behaviour he is the antithesis of the smooth Rome politicians. His suits are always rumpled and his hair unkempt. Even by Italian standards, he is unpunctual. He says what he thinks in crude language peppered with dialect from his native Varese - his advisers have told him to tone down his coarser comments. Yet in the north he speaks to a genuine constituency - the artisans, the factory workers, the small businessmen and shopkeepers who work hard, care little about ideology and are incensed by the poor deal the wealth-earning north gets from the state and by the corrupt political class. He is one of the first generation of northerners to enjoy higher education. His father was a textile worker, his mother of peasant stock who became a concierge when the family moved to Milan. By all accounts he was an indifferent student, failing to complete his medical studies. Folklore has it that, to impress his first wife, he claimed to have a medical degree and pretended to visit imaginary patients. After separating from his wife, in 1982 he met his present companion, Manuela Marrone, while both were attending a night-school course on Varese dialect. They have two children. His political activism began at this time, stirred by a mixture of ambition and a desire to dig into the past for 'Lombard' roots - the League's symbol is a 12th-century warrior with raised sword, who rallied the Lombard communes against the invading army of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Having become the League's first senator in the 1987 general elections, his vision of the north fending off the predatory demands of central government was not taken seriously by his opponents until less than two years ago. His message remains simple: Rome and southern Italy cannot live off the earnings of the north, and the political system must become more federal. The north, he believes, has no alternative but to press for separatism, moving 'closer to Europe and further from Rome'. He talks of three federal units with wide autonomy existing within one state, Italy. Part of Mr Bossi's philosophy is akin to the spirit of Scottish nationalism; part contains elements of the extreme right of the Le Pen type in France. But much is simply protest against the system, which broadens his appeal because it places him and the movement outside an easy ideological classification. Mr Bossi's main challenge now is to demonstrate he can convert the League into a party that will last. He must also decide whether the League is to remain a northern phenomenon or become a national party, either through a countrywide organisation or via alliances with other groupings. Although he likes to play the peasant who has taken over the farm, Mr Bossi has begun to acquire some sophistication and awareness of his responsibilities. This week he surprised opponents by coming out against early elections, saying the Amato government should continue in office. To force a government crisis now would merely bring down the whole political edifice, he said. His threat of separatism has to be taken with a pinch of salt. The League constituency comprises pragmatic, solid citizens who vote with their hands on their wallets and feet on the ground. Breaking away from the rest of Italy would be a leap into the unknown, which few countenance at heart. Mr Bossi himself uses the threat of separatism like a nuclear deterrent to bolster his bargaining power with Rome. And no one has yet called his bluff.</p>

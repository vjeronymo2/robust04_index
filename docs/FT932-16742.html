			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Motoring: How to beat the Budget rises MOTORING in Britain will cost more: that, in the short term, is the main effect of last month's Budget. Ten per cent more excise duty on unleaded petrol and diesel has inflated pump prices by 12p a gallon. The 25 per cent of car-owners who from choice - or, more rarely, necessity - use leaded premium are 15p a gallon worse off. And, of course, what some still think of as the road fund tax also went up by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125. It could have been worse. Most of the petrol price rise can be clawed back by more temperate driving habits, such as avoiding high speeds and sharp acceleration. Bear in mind that a typical family car such as a Rover 214 or Peugeot 405 uses nearly 20 per cent more fuel at 75 mph (120 kmh) than it does at 56 mph (90 kmh). A road sign I saw some years ago in Virginia, US, summed it up neatly: 'Those in favor of saving gasoline, raise their right foot.' Petrol in Britain - incidentally, still among Europe's cheapest - will continue to go up in price by at least 3 per cent a year more than the rate of inflation. The idea is not simply to raise money. It is all part of a government strategy to ensure carbon dioxide ('greenhouse gas') levels in the year 2000 are no worse than they were in 1990. An immediate and predictable effect will be to boost sales of diesel cars. Glass's Guide, the car trade's bible, estimates they will climb to 230,000 this year from 200,000 in 1992 (although a gut feeling tells me the figure could be nearer 250,000). The once-hefty price premium on diesels, which use up to 30 per cent less fuel than petrol-engined equivalents, has been narrowed. Surging sales of diesels have helped. But another reason is that all petrol cars registered since January 1 have had to have expensive catalytic converters and fuel injection systems. Curiously, many cars, including some new ones, still have unnecessarily low gearing. A 1.8- or two-litre engine spinning at nearly 4,000 rpm at 75 mph (120 kph) does nothing for motorway fuel economy. Gearing that is too high can be counter-productive because it leads to excessive use of the lower ratios. But 25 mph (40 kph) per 1,000 rpm for family cars under under two litres, and 30 mph (48 kph) for larger-engined ones, is about right. We ought to be seeing more sensibly-geared cars soon. Tyres with lower rolling resistance also will help to trim fuel consumption at moderate speeds. So will improved aerodynamics, althugh there are limits to what can be done to cut a car's drag if people are still to fit easily inside. The eventual casualties of the Budget will be the artificially small-engined, tax-band beating cars. Some, like the BMW 518i, go surprisingly well but are not much more economical than larger-engined - although less income tax-efficient - versions. At 75 mph (120 kph), a BMW 525i uses less petrol than a 518i. Apart from removing the Inland Revenue's manacles from moderately-priced diesel cars over two litres cars, the Budget also will make large-engined but relatively cheap petrol cars more attractive to business users. While the old tax band rule covering cars under Pounds 19,250 and two litres, those such as the quick, refined and utterly relaxed 2.8-litre, V6-engined VW Golf and Vento VR6s made no financial sense. Under the new rules, they will. So will the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra in mainland Europe), which has just gone on sale with a new, British-made, 2.5-litre, multi-valve V6. Cars such as these make a simple point; plenty of cylinder capacity in a fairly small, high-geared vehicle provides big-car performance and driving pleasure. Light-footed drivers find them moderate drinkers, too. Will there be a stampede by business drivers to have a pay rise instead of a company car? The motor trade thinks not. Many drivers might be better off driving their own cars on a mileage allowance instead of paying income tax on the benefit of a company Mondeo or Cavalier. But, in spite of the 8 per cent increase in tax scale charges, a 20 per cent rise in the tax cost of free fuel for private use, and abolition of the over-18,000 miles a year fuel discount, a company car has three benefits. You do not have to borrow thousands of pounds (or lose interest on your own capital) to buy it. Nor do you need to worry about depreciation, which can swallow two-thirds of a car's purchase price in three years. Insurance or maintenance costs are the company's problem, too, not yours. Some business users have been limiting their tax liability by going for good second-hand cars instead of new ones. My accountant, a prudent man, has done so for several years. The trend will develop. There is plenty of life left in a properly-serviced executive car of quality. Bought from a franchised dealership under one of many manufacturer-approved used car schemes, it can be a better bet financially than a new one. Saab GB even offers models of its own make up to seven years old, and with 100,000 miles (162,000km) on the clock, in its approved used car programme, with free 12-month mechanical breakdown insurance thrown in.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HOPE PARENTS' ARREST SENDS MESSAGE;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: PROSECUTING THE MOTHER AND FATHER OF A BABY WHO ALMOST DROWNED  WHILE LEFT UNATTENDED IN A TUB MAY PROMPT OTHERS TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE,  AUTHORITIES SAY.  </P> <P> Faced with a rash of child drownings in Orange County this year, police said  that they hoped prosecution of the parents of an 18-month-old girl who was  hospitalized after nearly drowning in a tub while left unattended would send a  message to others.  </P> <P> "There is obvious neglect if children do not know how to swim and take care of  themselves" in water, La Habra Police Lt. Joseph Milazzo said. "If they are  left alone, then it's a serious crime."  </P> <P> Jimmy DeArmond, 26, and his wife, Diana, 22, of La Habra were scheduled to be  arraigned today in Municipal Court in Fullerton on charges that they acted  criminally when they allowed their two young daughters to take a bath without  adult supervision, Milazzo said.  </P> <P> The injured daughter, Elizabeth, was in fair condition Thursday at Children's  Hospital of Orange County, hospital spokeswoman Agnes Gibson said. She is not  expected to suffer any long-term effects.  </P> <P> "She is conscious," Gibson said, "and is improving."  </P> <P> Elizabeth's parents found her Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. floating face-down in a  bathtub, Milazzo said. She was taking a bath with her 2 1/2-year-old sister,  Heather.  </P> <P> After Elizabeth was admitted to the hospital, the parents were taken into  custody and booked La Habra Jail, Milazzo said. They were transferred to Orange  County Central Jail in Santa Ana overnight and initially held on $10,000 bail  each, he said.  </P> <P> The parents were released Thursday morning on their own recognizance, sheriff's  officials said. They were unavailable for comment on Thursday.  </P> <P> The parents "indicated to officers that they commonly leave their children  unattended in the bathtub," Milazzo said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said that the decision to press charges against  the DeArmonds was not unusual. She said that the district attorney's office  prosecutes dozens of child endangerment cases each year, including drownings,  shootings and other accidental, life-threatening situations.  </P> <P> Shade said that prosecutors normally base their cases on the severity of the  incident or on evidence that there is a pattern of negligence or endangerment.  </P> <P> "We always look at each on a case-by-case basis," Shade said. "If there is some  evidence that the parents do something routinely, then it is something we could  take into consideration."  </P> <P> The parents, who live in a small, two-story apartment located in a low-income  neighborhood of north La Habra, found Elizabeth after Heather started yelling  for help from the bathtub, police said.  </P> <P> The parents, who were home at the time, had left the girls alone for at least  10 minutes, Milazzo said.  </P> <P> He said that Jimmy DeArmond loudly protested his arrest Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "The father was extremely upset and indicated that the arrest was unlawful,"  Milazzo said. The mother, however, "went along quietly," he noted.  </P> <P> The accident was the latest in a string of drownings and near drownings in the  county. This year alone, at least seven children have drowned, most of them in  swimming pools.  </P> <P> Milazzo said that he hoped the threat of prosecution would prompt parents to be  more attentive to their children when they are around water.  </P></p>

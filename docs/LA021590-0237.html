			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SPIKE LEE LAMENTS RACISM RISE  </P> <P> Spike Lee says the strides made during the civil rights movement are being  eroded and that it's his job as a filmmaker to portray "the present state of  racism today."  </P> <P> Lee, who addressed more than 1,200 people at the University of Iowa on Tuesday,  said racial violence in the Howard Beach section of New York City compelled him  to make his 1989 film "Do The Right Thing," about racial tension and violence  during a hot city summer.  </P> <P> "In a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of forward, especially  with all the whole . . . affirmative action and all that stuff that people were  dying for in the civil rights movement," the black filmmaker said.  </P> <P> "I wanted to film about the present state of racism today. I knew I don't have  the answers, but that wasn't my job," Lee said. "My job was to hold the mirror  up and let people know that this is the way it is and unless we all make an  effort to do something about it, it's going to get worse."  </P></p>

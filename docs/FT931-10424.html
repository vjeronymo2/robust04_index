			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Time running short for coffee pact renegotiation - Lack of political will on the part of consumers is frustrating producers COFFEE PRODUCING countries plan to meet in Mexico at the end of this month to try to salvage something from the latest round of negotiations on a new international pact. Brazil, the world's biggest producer, obliquely blamed the US, the biggest consumer, for the deadlock at the end of last week's talks at the International Coffee Organisation's London headquarters. It issued a statement accusing 'some important consumer countries' of 'no longer showing the political will to reach an understanding' and thus 'threatening to undermine the very basis of negotiation'. The statement - from Mr Rubens Barbosa, head of the delegation - expressed 'disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in what was to be the decisive phase in the negotiation of a new international coffee agreement. This sense of frustration is shared by millions of people in Latin America, Africa and Asia who are dependent on coffee exports for their livelihood and see in the agreement an important factor in stabilising the market'. The US is now likely to come under intense lobbying pressure from coffee producing countries, who are estimated to have lost about Dollars 10bn in revenues since July 1989, when the ICO's export quota system collapsed. Arabica coffee prices in New York fell from around 120 cents a lb to below 50 cents a lb in September last year - the lowest level for more than 20 years. Some coffee producers believed that Mr Myles Frechette, the head of the US delegation, was operating with his hands tied because of the change-over in the US between the Bush to the Clinton administrations. But Mr Frechette strongly denied that he lacked a mandate to negotiate. 'I've had a mandate from the beginning,' he said last week. 'No new mandate is needed.' Both sides have already agreed that any new agreement should be based on a universal quota system. This would cover all coffee exported, regardless of destination, so avoiding the development of a second, cheaper, market in coffee exports to consumers not party to the agreement. The so-called second tier-market was one of the main reasons for the breakdown of the quota system. However, last week's talks foundered on the twin rocks of 'selectivity' and 'automaticity'. Selectivity is the term used for dividing the coffee market into different areas ranging from robusta coffees, mainly grown in Africa and used for soluble coffee, and the top quality arabicas, grown in Latin America and favoured by Western consumers. The system would allow consumers to buy the coffee they wanted; under the previous system quota increases applied to both robustas and arabicas. However, producers proposed four types - a proposal which Mr Frechette said had convinced the US 'more than ever that three is the way to go'. Automaticity would involve the rolling over of individual countries' export quotas at the end of each year, depending on the previous year's export performance. Producers argued that it was unlikely such a complex system could be set up perfectly from year one, and proposed a review after one year of operation. But the US argued that it was not beyond the wit of delegates to design a system that worked. The ICO's self-imposed goal of concluding negotiations by March 31 now looks almost impossible to reach. Delegates return on March 22 for a further week of talks when they will have to agree not only on automaticity and selectivity, but also on the size of the universal quota, its distribution, and the price ranges to be defended. If they manage all that and sign a new agreement, it could just about be ratified by the end of September when the current, purely administrative agreement ends.</p>

Reynolds Tobacco Co. has mailed smokers videotapes to get its message on  TV screens despite the two-decade-long ban on cigarette commercials.  </P> <P> The nation's second-largest cigarette maker says the 78-second videotape  commercial about its low-tar Now cigarette is targeted at smokers of Carlton,  made by American Brands.  </P> <P> Reynolds says the videotapes do not violate Congress' intent when it banned  cigarette commercials.  </P> <P> "We're not forcing anyone to watch it. If someone is not interested, they could  simply throw it away," said Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Payne.  </P> <P> Payne would not say how many tapes were involved in the August mailing or how  much the effort cost.  </P></p>

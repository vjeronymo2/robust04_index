			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Andean common market fails to deliver - The region has 90m people but governments look elsewhere AFTER TWO frustrating meetings convened to decide on external tariffs for the Andean common market, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela still have not reached final agreement. Although the heads of state defined four main tariff levels (between 5 and 20 per cent) last December and stipulated that these would come into effect on January 1, 1992, Ecuador still insists on a long list of exceptions. The December presidential summit accelerated the Andean Pact timetable, largely in recognition of the fact that most members were already opening up their economies at a fast pace. In concentrating on trade liberalisation, the presidents virtually buried a broader range of policies designed to promote regional industrialisation and development. But most experts believe that the original programmes - drawn up soon after the pact's foundation in 1969 - dated so quickly that if it had not been for the change of plan the pact would have slipped into obscurity. The integration process was supposed to boost the regional market, promote technology and research, and develop key industrial sectors, according to Mr Germanico Salgado, former head of Ecuador's central bank. 'Now there's none of this, no genuine substance or coherence. The common external tariffs are very low, giving no margin of preference,' he said. Trade between Andean Pact members has only represented between 3 and 15 per cent of the pact's total foreign trade. It reached Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 660m) in 1981, with Colombia as the biggest exporter, then the crises of the 1980s deepened and intra-regional trade dropped back until 1991, when it rose to Dollars 1.7bn. Colombia's was the only economy to expand significantly during the past decade, and its relatively low birth rate ensured a steady increase in per capita income. Although there are more than 90m people in the region, business and governments are most interested in North American and European markets. The geography of the Andean countries - two seaboards connected by the Panama Canal and a forbidding chain of mountains slap through the middle of the region - has also made communications difficult. The private sector, which had little say in the Andean Pact's early programme, attributes slow progress on integration to government instability and changing policies. But as the pact changes character, the private sector is beginning to take a more active role. 'Integration is useful, for all the classic trade advantages - lower prices, competition and so on. We should not be too sorry about the companies that disappear because they are inefficient,' said Mr Fernando Navarro, president of Ecuador's National Federation of Chambers of Commerce in Quito. 'At least by legalising frontier contraband we shall be leaving an absurd fiction behind us.' Other regional blocs have proved more dynamic than the pact itself, causing friction among members. Impatient with the delay caused by Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela plan to forge ahead with Mexico in consolidating the Group of Three. Ecuador's plea for special treatment rests on two main arguments - that it is a relatively small and under-developed economy. Negotiations are to continue in two to three weeks' time.</p>

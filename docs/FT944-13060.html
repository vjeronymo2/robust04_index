			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Westminster leader sets out innocence Mr Miles Young, Westminster City Council leader, yesterday sought to prove his innocence at the public hearings into gerrymandering allegations. The council's district auditor, Mr John Magill, ruled in his provisional report that Mr Young was not 'actively involved' in gerrymandering. But this finding has been challenged by objectors whose initial complaints prompted the district auditor's investigation. Mr Bernard Livesey, QC for Mr Young, said there was no new evidence to make the district auditor change his mind.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Daf breaks down Doubtless the Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities are hopping mad at the British banks which have effectively pulled the plug on Daf. Smaller lenders have an irritating habit of getting in the way of rescue proposals that appear socially and politically sensible, but then those without an axe to grind can see the financial traps more easily. The Dutch banks are so deeply involved they would prefer not to leave room for second thoughts about the medium term rescue plan. On any objective measure, Daf's position was precarious enough to warrant doubts. An operating loss last year of Fl 200m with provisions for restructuring on top would have cut deeply into capital and reserves which stood at Fl 810m at the end of 1991. Lenders clearly faced a transformation of debt into equity. The activities of the group's financing subsidiary made it all the more legitimate to worry that the same might have happened to any new loans extended. Daf Finance was responsible for a large part of the Fl 3.5bn of short term debt on the group's last balance sheet. But the quality of its loan book must have deteriorated with the recession in the UK and the downturn in continental Europe. That problem only made rescuing the industrial activities more difficult. Nor was Daf a natural survivor in the commercial vehicle market. It is too small and too dependent on the UK. The logical answer might have been an alliance, but a partner's first job would have been to pay to take out capacity. The rest of the European industry must be sighing with relief now that this cost looks like falling squarely on the shoulders of Daf's own lenders and shareholders.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Coal contraction prompts Pounds 6.2m cuts at Senior Eng SENIOR ENGINEERING is withdrawing from the mining equipment business and large turnkey power generation projects due to the contraction of the UK coal industry and the associated reduction in coal-fired power generation. The tubing, boilers and ductwork group said yesterday that discontinuing these operations, along with closure and disposal provisions, would cost Pounds 6.2m net of tax, excluding the impact of any original goodwill previously written off. The decision will cause the loss of 90 jobs in Senior Thermal Engineering's power division, which is being closed, and could affect 350 jobs in the mining equipment businesses, which are being offered up for sale. But Mr John Bell, group chief executive, said the move was more a 'strategic refocusing' than a job-cutting exercise. 'The rest of the group is performing well. We are getting rid of things we can't do anything with, and which could cause us problems in the future.' Senior has made no secret of its wish to quit the mining equipment industry, and at the end of last year had changed the business sector's name to control engineering to emphasise its intention to reduce dependence on coal mining. The mining equipment businesses up for sale have annual turnover of Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m and are currently breaking even, said Mr Bell. They are Senior Davis Derby, which makes electronic equipment used in mining and other hazardous environments; and Senior Conflow, which - along with Senior Conflow USA, makes equipment to control water at very high pressure. Mr Bell said Senior was already talking to potential purchasers, and envisaged two separate deals. Senior will retain the one remaining part of its control engineering business, Senior Entex, which makes springs. The power division, meanwhile, is being closed because of the increasing dominance of the big turnkey contracting business by sizeable companies such as Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri. Senior has had some success in this business, with large projects such as the Pounds 25m power station it built for Slough Estates. But turnover this year of Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m will be lower than in recent years, and a modest loss is expected. Mr Bell said Senior was actively looking for expansion in its core businesses, and singled out the recently acquired Flexonics of the US as a business with significant growth opportunities. On present accounting standards, the Pounds 6.2m would be an extraordinary below-the-line item, but Senior plans to present its 1992 accounts in line with the new standards for discontinuing businesses and acquisitions which are being introduced next June.

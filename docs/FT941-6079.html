			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Book Review: Unfinished recipes of Russia's reformers ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA Edited by Anders Aslund Pinter Publishers, London, Pounds 11.99 paperback, Pounds 37.50 hardback It is fitting that the book which may be the first history of radical market reform in Russia has been edited by Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who set out the challenge of reforming the old Soviet-command economy in Gorbachev's Struggle for Economic Reform, published in 1989. But Economic Transformation in Russia, a collection of essays by radical Russian reformers and their western advisers, was not intended as a history book. It was meant to be a progress report on reforms that were, at the time of writing, being implemented. Although most of its authors are no longer in power, it still provides pertinent answers to two questions being asked by western policymakers and some Russian voters. First, was the comprehensive but painful package of spending cuts, industrial restructuring and free market disciplines sought by the reformers before their election defeat in December the right policy for Russia? Second, what can the west do to help Russia persevere along a path to a market economy? The only senior radical left in office, Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister, gives one important answer to the latter question: he warns that his programme for the mass privatisation of state-owned enterprises could fail unless the Group of Seven industrial nations pushes ahead with a promise to invest up to Dollars 4bn in newly privatised companies. In an essay with his wife and fellow-economist, Maria Vishnevskaya, he writes: 'The lack of actual capital inflow in 1994 may spell the failure of privatisation in Russia, because mass bankruptcy of privatised enterprises could undermine the hard-won confidence in privatisation for decades.' As to the first question, the theme that emerges from the book is that the policy was basically right but serious mistakes were made. In the event, the mistakes contributed to the downfall of the reformers. But Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the former Russian adviser and proponent of western financial support for reforms, argues strongly - and in the event presciently - against a gradualist approach such as that being embraced by Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister. Prof Sachs describes 'confusions which are widely held among political elites' - including the notion, discredited by Romania's experience, that gradual reform can stop industrial decline. If the radicals get a second chance to push for a western-backed package to stabilise inflation and the rouble, they could learn from the book's account of the mistakes made the first time round. Despite supporting shock therapy, which would have shut down enterprises around the country, Andrei Illarionov, Chernomyrdin's former chief economist, and Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, admit in a joint article that no preparations were made to prepare for a consequent rise in unemployment. 'The effects of this . . . rise could be extremely serious unless major training programmes are implemented, especially in market-orientated skills,' they write. Elsewhere in the book, Boris Fyodorov, former finance minister, recognises that his target of bringing monthly inflation down to less than 10 per cent by the end of last year was 'over-optimistic'. The reasons he cites include underestimating the need for subsidies to the northern territories, which comprise 56 of the Russian Federation's 89 provinces. But his recognition of the need to find a new mechanism for subsidising the north is an example of the vision of a reformer who achieved much in just one year in office. Other Russian contributors dwell on the psychological obstacles to reform. Irina Boeva and Tatiana Dolgopiatova, who studied 10 plants, found only one manager who defined the survival of his enterprise as 'having a solid, stable financial position, enabling it to avoid bankruptcy and to develop further'. More typical was a manager, who still expects to be bailed out by the state, quoted as saying: 'It's not that we have no money, it's just that we have no money in our bank account.' It is clear, however, that a start has been made in pushing managers into more market-oriented behaviour. 'Practically all directors have understood the necessity of price competition' and 'the importance of sales activities', say Boeva and Dolgopiatova. It is typically Russian obstacles to reform - such as excessive bureaucracy and corruption - which lead Pyotr Aven, an ex-foreign trade minister, to conclude in his essay that the Russian economy 'has to be more liberal than any other'. A similar conclusion is reached by Vitaly Naishul, the arch-liberal Russian economist, who goes as far as to argue that the Russian state is so weak and incompetent that it must confine itself to the bare mini-mum of functions: law and order. Aslund himself dwells on perhaps the most serious weakness which caused the Russian radicals to squander the opportunity to introduce stabilisation policies: inadequate political skills. He says poor political judgment allowed them to persist under the illusion, widely held by economists, that elections are 'time-consuming complications'. In Russia's case, parliamentary elections were 'a necessary precondition for breaking the power of the old elite and the industrial lobbies in Russia', he writes. Optimists, like Fyodorov, have said it is only a matter of months before the radicals' policies are recognised as the only option for Russia. But Aslund predicts in the book that, in the event of an election backlash, 'this indeterminate period could look as bad as Weimar Germany'. Such a backlash occurred on December 12. Without a return to political influence by the book's authors, it is difficult to see how the detailed recipes for financial stabilisation it contains can avoid a long spell on the history bookshelves.</p>

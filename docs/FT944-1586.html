			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Blackouts in Algiers after saboteurs hit power supply Algiers has suffered serious electrical power difficulties for three days because of sabotage to the Algerian capital's power supply, according to Algerian officials, Agencies report. A 'serious incident' cut power last Wednesday night and remaining power was being rationed among city districts, Sonelgaz, the state-run electricity supplier, said at the weekend. The problem could continue for some time, it added. Government officials, who refused to be named, said five towers carrying electricity lines had been blown up in Zemmouri, east of Algiers. There was no claim of responsibility by last night. Algerian television reported that a big food warehouse supplying Algiers, Boumerdes to the east and Tipasa to the west was destroyed by armed men who planted bombs and set it on fire. According to the television, monitored by the BBC, an unidentified group of some 40 attackers planted the bombs throughout the building, which contained huge stocks of dried milk, medicines and domestic electrical appliances. Algeria says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the civil strife since January 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election that fundamentalists were poised to win. Sabotage has accounted for Dollars 2bn in damage between February 1992 and December 1993, according to the government.</p>

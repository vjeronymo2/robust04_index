			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage and public fund buying helps Nikkei rally Arbitrage buying and purchases by public funds pushed share prices higher, and the Nikkei 225 average snapped out of weakness following five consecutive sessions of declines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 144.43 firmer at the day's best of 18,811.36 after opening at a low of 18,727.75. Activity, however, was slow and volume totalled 184m shares, against 260m. A higher futures market pushed up stock prices, while public funds absorbed selling by overseas investors. But most investors remained absent due to continued worries over share price movements on Wall Street. Traders fear that a fall in US shares will prompt profit-taking in the Tokyo market by US pension fund managers, who have been active buyers since the start of the year. A further weakening of the yen could also prompt selling by overseas investors eager to lock in foreign exchange profits on their Japanese stock investments. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.40 to 1,491.42, while the Nikkei 300 put on 1.43 at 274.16. Rises led falls by 656 to 332, with 189 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.13 at 1,226.99. In spite of the rise in the indices, 63 issues hit lows for the year. The lack of fresh news on the main market triggered some buying of small-capitalisation stocks on the second section, the latter's index advancing 14.76 to 2,069.10. Nippon Soda added Y17 at Y587 on reports that it was seeking to market a high-tech glass that cleans itself using ultraviolet sun rays. Speculators sold Ashimori Industry, which fell Y30 to Y649. Japan Airlines lost Y29 at Y681 on reports disclosing its huge unrealised foreign exchange losses. The company said it had around Y176bn in exchange losses stemming from 10-year forward rate contracts made in 1985 to 1986. Brokers, which have been weak on fears of poor earnings, rallied. Nikko Securities rose Y20 to Y1,020 and New Japan Securities Y15 to Y645. High-technology shares were higher, Oki Electric gaining Y14 at Y693 and NEC Y10 at Y1,150, but Sony slipped Y20 to Y5,140. Privatisation issues were firmer. Japan Tobacco improved Y1,000 to Y961,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y5,000 to Y834,000. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 64.39 to 20,810.72 in volume of 16.8m shares. Roundup A lethargic mood afflicted much of the region. SEOUL extended early losses on aggressive selling by institutions moving into cash, and the composite index receded 11.97 to 1,069.48. Volume, however, was a light 31m shares, compared with a recent daily average of 50m. Dealers said concern about a liquidity squeeze also cast gloom on the market, adding that some institutions had been forced to buy corporate bonds to limit recent yield rises as a result of tight liquidity. HONG KONG finished little changed, with sharp early gains falling victim to caution about the future direction of US financial markets. The Hang Seng index ended 3.54 up at 8,662.37 after touching 8,751.18. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.2bn from Friday's HKDollars 2.7bn. HSBC topped the actives list and held steady at HKDollars 86, followed by Hongkong Telecom, which gained 30 cents at HKDollars 15.35, and Hutchison, unchanged at HKDollars 31.30. Players noted that index futures had stayed at a discount to the spot index until very late in the day, adding further to market wariness. SINGAPORE followed the same course, closing flat after trimming most of its early gains in a trendless market. The Straits Times Industrial index gained only 0.22 at 2,237.97, after dropping from the day's peak of 2,254.83. Singapore Telecommunication, which reported a 13.8 per cent rise in net earnings, shed 3 cents to SDollars 2.97. Analysts said funds were only likely to become interested in the stock when it fell more in line with market val-uations. KUALA LUMPUR drifted for much of the day before ending weaker as investors liquidated holdings near the close to trim losses. The composite index slipped 6.29 to 1,005.23 in estimated volume of 79.8m shares. Country Heights, the property developement group, rose 90 cents to MDollars 6.90 on good corporate results. TAIPEI drifted down amid late profit-taking after rises in the previous two trading days. Brokers said they expected further consolidation before the December 3 elections. The weighted index lost 55.45 at 6,384.20 after an intraday high of 6,475.22. Turnover was TDollars 34.2bn. Profit-taking focused on textiles and steels, which had gained most in previous sessions: Shinkong Fibres retreated TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 30.80 and steel group Kao Hsing Chang TDollars 1.30 to TDollars 29.30. Low-priced fund shares which are expected to issue high dividends in early 1995 attracted some buying from institutional investors, with Core Pacific moving up TDollars 0.10 to TDollars 11.35. President Enterprises rose TDollars 0.50 to TDollars 55 on news that five foreign companies planned to invest TDollars 1.9bn to buy 12 per cent of its unlisted affiliate President Chain Store. Farmers Bank climbed by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 48.10 on its debut. MANILA fell sharply at the close as investors sold holdings in major issues, including Petron. The composite index lost 1.6 per cent. Petron was hardest hit during the market's retreat, falling 4.6 per cent to 20.50 pesos. Property shares, which in early trade showed resilience, also fell: Filinvest Land declined 2.12 per cent to 9.20 pesos and Megaworld Properties dipped 1.5 per cent to 16.25 pesos. SYDNEY was firmer but sentiment remained cautious as investors looked to the start of trading in New York. The All Ordinaries index closed 1.6 up at 1,918.0 in turnover estimated at ADollars 312m. The December futures contract was 7 ahead at 1,900. Among banks, ANZ lost 6 cents at ADollars 3.98 following recent gains on better than expected results last week. Other banks were also weak, NAB losing 2 cents at ADollars 10.72. BANGKOK fell on a lack of incentives after gaining almost 10 points in the morning. The SET index closed 7.26 lower at 1,342.13, after fluctuating between 1,331.87 and 1,358.86, in thin turnover of Bt3.52bn. Profit-taking, particularly in finance counters, surfaced after the index moved closed to the 1,359 resistance level, according to brokers. Buying interest emerged in bank and building materials stocks before the close. The building materials sector, led by Siam Cement which jumped Bt24 to Bt1,360 on a 34 per cent rise in net profits, was the biggest gainer.</p>

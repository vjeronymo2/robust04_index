			<p>BFN     [Text] LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy has ended a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin by raising the question of the party's involvement  in government management.    In an interview with Interfax, Zhirinovskiy spoke of  offering  three possible options to the Prime Minister. Under the first  option, the LDP wants three ministerial posts in the so-called  power structures -- defence, police and counter-intelligence.    If not, the party is ready to settle for the posts of  justice  minister and prosecutor general.    The final option provides for the posts of economics  minister  and chairman of the state property committee.    Zhirinovskiy said the prime minister would now contemplate  the proposals while "we will also think of what position to take  towards the government in future".</p>

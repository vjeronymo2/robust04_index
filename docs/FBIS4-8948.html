			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prelude to a Clash With Domestic </F> Journalists"]    [Text] Belgrade -- "The statement by Milorad Vucelic,  prominent socialist and director general of the Serbian Radio  and Television, to Novi Sad DNEVNIK that the purge of foreign  journalists is fully justified, sheds considerably more light on  the real essence of the latest democratic initiative by the  Serbian authorities." This was stated in a communique issued by  the UGS [Association of City Trade Unions] "Independence". "We  thought that this was only interference in the editorial policy  of other papers, but thanks to the aforementioned statement, it  is now becoming clear that this move has far reaching  consequences in the internal political arena.    The pogrom of foreign journalists is only warming up, a  prelude to the final showdown with those who do not share the  same views at home. By throwing foreigners out, Serbia is only  making sure that there will be no easing or lifting of the  sanctions so that, in the total darkness and without witnesses,  it can finish off the independent media and independent  journalists devoted to their profession, "Independence" claims.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 18 June (PANA) -- Rwanda's interim  president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, said Friday [17 June] in  Kinshasa that the current "activism" of the Rwandan militia is a  "resistance movement by the youth and the whole population  against foreign aggression".    Sindikubwabo, who was the guest of the Press Club of the  Zairian section of the International Union of French-Speaking  Journalists (UIJPLF), however, acknowledged "the possibility of  extortion and murders" by the youth, adding that his government  has taken all precautions to "control the resistance and avoid  aggression".    Explaining the reason that led "the Rwandan youth to defend  themselves", the Rwandan president alluded to a secret document  by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) calling for "the  demolition of broad-based institutions to install the RPF, and  the elimination of all republicans".    For the Rwandan president, back from the 30th OAU summit in  Tunis, the government he leads came in to fill the vacuum left  by the death of President Habyarimana.    The government, he added, is working for an end to the war.  He said this would allow for a dialogue on the basis of the  Arusha political compromise, humanitarian assistance and the  setting up of institutions.    Speaking about the situation on the ground, he expressed  reservations about reports that the RPF had taken the town of  Gitarama. Intense fighting is taking place in the area but  there is no proof that the town has fallen to the rebels. He  blamed the multiple violations of Rwanda's cease-fire on RPF  elements whom, he said, are "massively supported by Uganda. The  truth cannot be otherwise," he said, "given that the Tutsi are a  minority and can only fight on foreign support".    To questions on his relations with President Yoweri Museveni  of Uganda, he replied that he "just shook hands with the Ugandan  head of state in Tunis". "The only time we spoke was when I  asked the Ugandan president for his guarantees to the  effectiveness of the cease-fire at the meeting of the committee  of the 11 states of the sub-region. He replied that the  cease-fire should not be subject to conditions"    On a new foreign intervention to try and end the crisis in  Rwanda, the president [words indistinct] "give priority to  dialogue", and called for "moral and diplomatic aid".    "Any intervention is welcome if it allows a cease-fire and  does not punish some (Hutu) and save the Tutsi (minority)," he  added.</p>

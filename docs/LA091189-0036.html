			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLEMP'S REMARKS ON AUSCHWITZ  </P> <P> I am a Jew. My parents died at Auschwitz. The remainder of the two sides of  both large families died there too. They weren't special, just your usual  middle-class Jews. A few among millions. But it is our duty to remember their  suffering; it was the most important thing they ever did.  </P> <P> Thanks to the risks and sacrifices of certain Catholics who took the message of  Jesus personally, I remain the one survivor of this vast clan. Catholics --  laypersons, priests, nuns -- saved the lives of many Jews. Thereby risking  their own imprisonment and death. Many suffered such a fate. It is just as  necessary to remember them.  </P> <P> What can be wrong about the presence of the silent nuns at Auschwitz? The  Jewish presence is represented by our dead; that of the Catholics by the  praying living who constantly praise God, which can only help to heal this  Jewish wound.  </P> <P> We both worship the same God. Divisions are created by human ignorance, but God  loves us all equally.  </P> <P> The objections of some Jews to the presence of the nuns at Auschwitz are but  one more manifestation of the human capacity for divisiveness and hatred.  </P> <P> Let us try to honor those who suffered and sacrificed by loving one another  rather than by our pettiness.  </P> <P> MARK HONNET  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

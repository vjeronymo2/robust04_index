			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Sweden admits defeat in battle for krona: Sudden central bank move takes premier by surprise THE sudden decision to float the Swedish krona yesterday afternoon by the central bank took even the government by surprise. Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, was given just 10 minutes' notice by central bank governor Mr Bengt Dennis of what had to be done to stem the huge outflow of capital from the country. A shaken and bewildered Mr Bildt said the krona would have to float 'for some time' but he asserted: 'You cannot run an economic policy with a floating exchange rate. European countries cannot be floating against each other. It won't work. I don't believe in this policy.' Ever the good European who still wants to see Sweden as an obedient member of a future economic and monetary union, Mr Bildt insisted that his medium- and longer-term strategy had not been blown off course to take his country into an economically integrated EC. The prime minister said it was too early to discuss what his coalition government would do in the short run. This would have to wait for January's budget for 1993-1994. More problematically, the previous bipartisan support for tough measures was missing yesterday. In September the main opposition joined forces with the government in hammering out two crisis packages to eliminate the burgeoning budget deficit and improve internal cost competitiveness. There was an impressive display of national unity and not a serious voice raised in support of devaluation. 'Against all the odds we succeeded,' said Mr Bildt. 'But we (Sweden) were always alone in our defence of the fixed exchange rate policy.' It meant draconian interest rates, with a symbolic 500 per cent for a few days imposed by the central bank on its overnight lending to the banks. Since Tuesday Mr Bildt and others have tried to win over the Social Democrats for a further crisis package to impress the markets. Only early yesterday afternoon came the answer. The Social Democratic leadership said it no longer 'believed in the policy' that the government was proposing. 'They threw in the towel,' complained one government adviser. 'When it came to the crunch they could accept no more cuts in public spending.' There is no immediate threat to the four-party coalition. But without Social Democratic support, Mr Bildt's latest SKr30bn (Pounds 3.3bn) package announced yesterday morning to try to avert the crisis already lacked political credibility, especially as the other main opposition party,the right-wing New Democracy came out for floating the krona. But it is hard to believe this would have been enough to calm the markets. The central bank admitted Sweden's financial position was far graver than in September. Since last Thursday SKr158bn had flowed out of the country, compared with SKr80bn over the three weeks of the earlier crisis. The trouble started on November 12, when market interest rates began to rise sharply on hearing of the poor results of the Swedish National Debt Office's issue of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) bonds as part of its emergency borrowing programme to replenish the country's reserves and help fund the budget deficit. As the central bank admitted yesterday this pointed to 'rising difficulties' in financing the budget deficit of Skr160bn for the current financial year. For the first time since September capital began to flow out of the country. The central bank acted last Friday to dampen interest rates by buying SKr45bn of Treasury bills, but this made little difference. At the start of this week foreign as well as domestic players began to sell Swedish krona in increasing volume. The arrival of large US banks on the scene on Tuesday escalated the crisis. Unlike Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr Bildt sees no advantages for his country in a floating currency. He does not believe in a 'national' solution to Sweden's economic troubles. He also insists the longer-term structural reforms designed to make Sweden more competitive and prosperous are in place and more will come next year.</p>

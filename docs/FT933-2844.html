			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson food arm 11% ahead DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday announced higher first-half profits and an increased dividend. Net profits rose to USDollars 66.2m for the six months ended June, an 11 per cent increase over the USDollars 59.9m of 1992. The interim dividend is going up to USDollars 1.55 a share from USDollars 1.48. Profits growth was primarily attributable to a halving of losses from Spanish retailer Simago and an improved performance from group operations in Taiwan, which have returned to profit. Turnover increased by only 2 per cent to USDollars 2.38bn, due to losses in translation from currency movements and the impact of the sale of the group's food manufacturing operations to a joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss foods group. Operating losses from Simago fell to USDollars 8.3m from USDollars 16.5m as Dairy Farm continued to cut staffing levels and close unprofitable shops. However, the performance was also aided by the weakness of the peseta. Simago was purchased for HKDollars 983m (USDollars 127m) in 1990 but is not expected to return to profit until 1995. In Australasia, Franklins increased its market share but continued to suffer from the tough economic conditions and strong competition. In New Zealand, however, the group's two retail operations put in strong performances. The Hong Kong retail operations are under pressure from staff and rental costs, but contributed a profit increase. The company says the colony offers limited scope for further expansion and it is now looking to Taiwan to provide growth for its Asian business. Describing the six-month performance as satisfactory, it said full-year profits were expected to exceed 1992 levels. The ice-cream making joint venture with Nestle in Hong Kong and China was making progress.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Yeun buys stake in Seapower MR FRANCIS YEUN, who recently resigned as chief executive of Hang Chong Investments, the company acquired by Citic Pacific, has re-emerged on the colony's corporate scene as a substantial shareholder and managing director of Seapower International. Mr Yeun, who resigned as chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year to run Hang Chong, has joined members of the consortium participating in that company's takeover - most notably Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's leading financier, Mr Larry Yung, managing director of the Beijing-controlled Citic Pacific, and Peregrine, the Hong Kong brokerage. Seapower operates in financial services and the cold storage business. Since the early 1980s it has been controlled by Mr Choi Sai Leung. He has been described as a friend of Mr Yeun's and this reason was given as to why the deal was done at Dollars HK1.60 a share - a 9 per cent discount to the company's prevailing share price of Dollars HK1.76. Mr Choi raised HKDollars 140.8m from the sale of 82m shares to Mr Yeun and others, and immediately subscribed to 48m new shares in Seapower for a cost of Dollars 77m. Taking the enlarged capital base into account, a company owned 51 per cent by Mr Yeun and 49 per cent by Peregrine has acquired a 20 per cent stake in Seapower. Mr Li will end up with 9.67 per cent and Citic's Mr Yung, 3.6 per cent. Mr Choi will retain a 25 per cent stake in the company.</p>

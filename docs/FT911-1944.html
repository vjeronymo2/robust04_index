			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / MPs call on trust hospitals to reveal business plans THE ALL-PARTY Commons health committee yesterday entered the controversy over the government's health service reforms with a decision to ask managers of the Guy's and Bradford trust hospitals to produce financial information which the government has refused to publish. The move came as the British Medical Association called for an urgent meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, to raise concerns about the 'continued underfunding' of the National Health Service. Both steps will sustain the political controversy which has raged for nearly a week since Guy's Hospital, London, and the Bradford Hospitals Trust announced up to 1,000 job cuts within a month of the health reforms taking effect. Opposition parties have sought to exploit the issue and hope the rekindling of concern over the health reforms will work to their advantage in today's local government elections. The Commons health committee decided in a private session to begin an investigation later this month into NHS trusts, which are managed outside direct health authority control. Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, Mr Peter Griffiths, general manager of Guy's, and managers from Bradford will be among those asked to give evidence. The committee will call on the trusts to produce the application documents and business plans on which the government reached its decision to grant them self-governing status. Members want as much information as other parliamentary committees have when investigating nationalised industries. Ministers have maintained that the information was for internal working purposes and never intended or prepared for publication. This position was defended at a public meeting of the health committee yesterday by both Sir Christopher France, permanent secretary at the department of health, and Mr Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive. All organisations, said Sir Christopher, needed to produce internal documents and he rejected the description of the documents as secret. This suggested that 'everybody goes into a corner and sorts things out in a huddle, and does so for nefarious reasons.' This was not the case with the trust hospital plans. Mr Nichol, who told the committee that he did not know in advance of the 600 jobs losses planned at Guy's said that publication of the business plans could affect the effectiveness of the internal market on which the health reforms are based. The BMA council yesterday adopted a resolution rejecting Mr Major's view that the NHS's problems were merely organisational ones, declaring that 'continued underfunding and the effects of the NHS reforms are the principle cause of the deteriorating service and deteriorating morale'.</p>

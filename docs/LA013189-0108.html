			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> SmithKline Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckmann,  has canceled a licensing and research and development contract with San  Diego-based Synbiotics, the companies said Monday.  </P> <P> The cancellation did not affect "activities in anti-idiotypic antibodies, the  core technology of the company," Synbiotics President Edward Maggio said  Monday. "Our animal health programs are similarly unaffected by this  development."  </P> <P> The SmithKline Diagnostics contract was "our vehicle for entry into the  physicians' office diagnostic market," Maggio said. "This was a spinoff or  outgrowth of what we mainly do in our labs. . . . . It was not a major thrust  of our research and development."  </P> <P> SmithKline had made license payments to Synbiotics of $850,000, Maggio said.  Synbiotics used the initial funding to expand its manufacturing space and hire  new employees, Maggio said.  </P> <P> "I don't see an enormous impact on the company," Maggio said. "We have to  examine implications internally and make some changes in how projects are  staffed. There will be some reassignments."  </P> <P> Maggio said the cancellation might be linked to top-level management changes at  SmithKline Diagnostics, where the president recently resigned, and at  SmithKline Beckmann, the parent company, where the chief operating officer  recently left.  </P> <P> The two companies will meet next month to discuss additional payments required  by the agreement, Maggio said.

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> STATE PROVIDES HELP IN PHYSICAL THERAPY  </P> <P> Question: As a physical therapist, I was interested in your recent column about  the lady who wrote regarding the need for physical therapy for her infant son.  If you can contact her, she should know that her child would be eligible for  free physical therapy services, either in-home or center-based, through state  regional centers. She probably is in the boundaries of the one on the west side  of town if she has been using Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. If not, they could  refer her to the correct one.  </P> <P> Also, when her child turns 3 years, services could be provided through  California Children Services (CCS), which is located in many therapy units  within the Los Angeles city and county schools.  </P> <P> It's a real shame what Blue Cross and other insurance companies are doing.  There's no way 12 sessions a year at $25 per session could begin to fill that  child's needs. Even Medi-Cal rates are $31.91 per visit for in-home physical  therapy, and that's the lowest rate around. (That's what regional centers pay  us therapists who contract with them).  </P> <P> I recently had my own battle with an insurer to get paid for therapy services I  provided to a patient. It took lots of documentation on my part to justify the  need for my services, many aggravating phone calls and then continued review by  everyone imaginable to finally get paid -- six months later, I might add. It  hardly seems worth the effort to provide services to insurance patients anymore  when you have to fight to get paid. I hope you can get this information to the  lady with the developmentally delayed son. -- G.S.  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, I'm indebted to you for passing the information along. Both of the  sources you suggest are potential suppliers of physical therapy for Mrs. Z.  A.'s son, who was born prematurely two years ago and needs therapy in learning  to walk. (Blue Cross had provided 80% of the two- or three-times-a-week  treatment at $125 per visit but, last year, cut physical therapy reimbursements  on all of its Prudent Buyer policies to a maximum of 12 sessions per year with  a $25 cap on each such treatment.)  </P> <P> Of the two options you mention, California Children Services and the state  regional centers, CCS may be the better bet because the eligibility standards  are somewhat broader than they are at the regional centers.  </P> <P> According to Frank Rico, director of the L.A. County Department of Health  Service's Children Services program, the agency maintains 43 medical therapy  units -- many of them small, consisting of two or three therapists engaged in  both physical and occupational therapy. Because this is considered part of the  child's education, Rico adds, the service is provided without charge through  the primarily state-funded agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More specifics  </P> <P> "However, we have to know more specifics about the child's needs to determine  his eligibility, and, of course, it has to be prescribed by a physician who has  been paneled by the state," Rico says. Some treatments "like medical  intervention, do contain some financial-eligibility yardsticks before the  mother can qualify, financially.  </P> <P> "And so, a medical determination first has to be made and then, based on the  child's needs, we can either provide the service ourselves or farm it out."  </P> <P> He isn't clear, however, what you mean when you say "when he (the child) turns  3 years of age" because CCS has no minimum-age eligibility.  </P> <P> Rico suggests that parents call his office in Marengo for directions to the  medical therapy unit nearest their home: (213) 226-2469.  </P> <P> And, as you suggest, another source of possible help is through the state  regional centers, private, nonprofit organizations that contract with the  state. There are 21 regional centers state-wide, seven of them in the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> But here, according to Mary Rollins, director of client services for the state  regional centers, the agency offers no direct services. Instead, the centers  provide diagnostic assessment, case coordination and individual planning,  Rollins adds. "And then, if the patient is eligible, we broker them out to  facilities that are available in the community."  </P> <P> And physical therapy, as such, isn't the key goal with the regional centers.  "We work with people having mental retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and  autism, and physical therapy is just one of the services.  </P> <P> "The child you mention," Rollins said, "might potentially qualify for physical  therapy if our diagnostic assessment establishes that either mental  retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy or autism has created a substantial  physical handicap requiring therapy."  </P> <P> The primary eligibility is that the child isn't already receiving treatment  either through the schools or through CCS, and the only age stipulation is that  the condition mandating the therapy must have occurred before the age of 18.  </P> <P> Rollins suggests that you contact the regional center at Culver City, and ask  for the intake department: (213) 337-1155.  </P> <P> Again, Mrs. Z.A. and I thank you for the tip.  </P> <P> Question: I retired from full-time employment on my 64th birthday and started  to collect Social Security. After one year of complete retirement, I decided to  take a part-time job, working only two days a week for a total of 16 hours per  week.  </P> <P> In view of this employment, my employer deducts all the necessary deductions  from my earnings (FICA, state and federal withholding and state disability). In  view of the fact that my Social Security checks were originally calculated on  my highest earnings, I would have no way of increasing my Social Security  monthly payments, based on the additional income I am presently earning. In no  way would a part-time job add anything to my "highest" period of earnings  because I did formerly work full time.  </P> <P> Therefore, you can see that any monies that are presently deducted from my  earnings are not helping me to increase my future Social Security earning and  are merely going into the Social Security fund for future beneficiaries. Please  advise if this assumption is correct and/or if there is anyway that I can avoid  these deductions. -- S.R.  </P> <P> Answer: Your assumptions, alas, are correct and there's nothing you/I/they  (Social Security) can do about it. Once you re-enter the work force, part time  or full time, the old withholding gambit that you retired to get away from is  securely back in place. And yes, those Social Security withholdings from your  check are, sure enough, going right back into the same giant pot from which  your own monthly benefits are coming. A very peculiar game of round-robin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Comfort  </P> <P> I know you can't take a lot of comfort in it, but because -- in retirement --  your income tax liability has probably dropped off sharply, you'll very likely  have most, if not all, of that tax withholding returned to you.  </P> <P> And, of course, there's no way in the world that the part-time earnings can  ever lower your monthly Social Security check. It's firmly in place and will  increase as cost-of-living adjustments are made to it.  </P> <P> No, I was afraid that this wasn't the answer you were hoping for.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campbell cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  consumer questions of general interest.

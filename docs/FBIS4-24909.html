			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not concluded that the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has nuclear  weapons, IAEA chief Han Blix said here today.    The IAEA has "not concluded that the DPRK has one or more  nuclear weapons, and we have not even concluded that their  nuclear program is used for non-peaceful purposes," Blix said.    After briefing the Security Council and meeting with the  U.N.  secretary-general on the nuclear issue in the DPRK, the IAEA  director-general told reporters that the IAEA is not "saying  that material is diverted, material has been used for plutonium  production or indeed for bomb making."    On the disputed issue of nuclear rods discharge at the  DPRK's  five-megawatt reactor, the IAEA chief said that his agency is  able to monitor the present situation, but is running into  obstacles in determining whether the material had been diverted  in the past as the DPRK has discharged most of the fuel in the  reactor.    According to a press release issued here today by the DPRK  permanent mission to the U.N., a spokesman for DPRK's General  Department of Atomic Energy said in a statement on June 2, "We  are doing the core refueling operations in such a manner that we  fully preserve technical possibility for later measurement of  such fuel rods as requested by the Agency (IAEA) in a token of  good faith."</p>

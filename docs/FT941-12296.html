			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Merger terms put Pounds 15m tag on Europa Minerals Terms for the three-way merger involving Europa Minerals value the UK-quoted mining finance house at 62.6p a share or Pounds 15.4m, according to Samuel Montagu, adviser to Burmine, the Australian gold company making the offer. Europa's share price touched 57p at one stage on Friday after the news and ended the day at 54p, up 12p. Burmine is offering one of its shares for every two Europa ordinary and at the same time, is making a 1-for-12 offer for Austmin Gold, an Australian exploration company, valuing it at ADollars 15.5m (Pounds 7.4m). Europa shareholders owning 52.5 per cent of the company said it was their present intention to accept the Burmine bid. Europa's independent directors, owning 2 per cent, recommend the offer and have irrevocably undertaken to accept. However, the three-way merger is challenged by an offer for Burmine by Mount Edon, another Australian gold producer. Hearings by the Australian authorities into technical challenges made by the companies are due to be heard on February 7 and 8 and Burmine cannot move ahead with the three-way deal until then. The situation is made more complex because Mount Edon owns 22.6 per cent of Burmine and 19.9 per cent of Europa. Europa owns 38.5 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Austin Reed down 48% as white-collar recession bites AUSTIN REED, the upmarket clothing retailer and manufacturer, blamed a dearth of tourists and a 'white-collar recession' for a decline of nearly 48 per cent in pre-tax profit for the year to January 31. The taxable figure fell from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 3.6m, the lowest since 1983. Turnover declined by nearly 8 per cent to Pounds 78.4m (Pounds 85m) and trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (9.9m). Interest charges were little changed at Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 3m). Mr Barry Reed, chairman and grandson of the founder, said the start to the current year had been the worst he could remember. He has been on the board for 33 years. The final dividend is held at 6.5p, making an unchanged total of 9.5p. This was only just matched by earnings per share of 9.5p (17.3p). An extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.3m on the closure of Cashmeres of Scotland led to a retained loss. Cashmeres, which was built up to 11 small US branches, had entailed an investment of Dollars 2.2m (Pounds 1.3m) over the past 3 1/2 years, said Mr Reed. Over the past two years it had lost Pounds 1.1m. On UK trading, he said: 'The Gulf situation caused tourism to dry up which affected retailing in London. 'While womenswear stayed level with the previous year, men's tailored clothing was difficult. This recession has been atypical because it has been a white collar one in London and the south-east.' The group had closed two branches leaving a total of 40. About 10 per cent of the 2,000 jobs in retailing and manufacturing had been shed. In manufacturing, exports were up, sales to other retailers were 25 per cent down and inter-company sales were static. Borrowings (including credit finance) peaked at Pounds 20m but finished the year at Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13.7m), compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 54m (Pounds 55.8m). COMMENT It is possible to defend these figures as 'no worse than expected,' bearing in mind the company's dependence on the highly elastic, south-eastern end of the men's suit market. But there is still plenty of scope to quibble. Some of the customers, for instance, must be in the less-squeezed, mortgage-free bracket; the Cashmere venture was a failure; and the figures would have been even worse but for a Pounds 500,000 property profit and a sharp cut in capital spending. This year started with a 17 per cent sales fall in February, since when some ground has been made up. Progress will come from eliminating Cashmere's losses and lower interest payments; tight cost control is promised. A forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 4m, but a higher tax rate, gives a prospective p/e of nearly 18 on the A share price of 170p. Japanese takeovers of Daks-Simpson and Aquascutum have stirred up some speculative interest, but with 60 per cent of the stock held by family, directors and friends, it looks as though it will be up to the present management to make better use of the prime sites and prestigious brand names. They should be helped considerably by economic recovery.</p>

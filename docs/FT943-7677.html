			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): John Palmer: weighing up competition and protection No one will have more questions to answer about the collapse of Canada's Confederation Life than John Palmer, writes Bernard Simon. Although he has been nowhere near the insurance industry in recent years, Palmer was named Ottawa's superintendent of financial institutions less than 24 hours after the regulator seized control of the beleaguered insurance group on August 11. Palmer, aged 50, is currently senior partner in the Toronto office of auditors KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne. He has overseen audits at some of Canada's big banks and trust companies, but his main job over the past year has been to reorganise the firm's public-sector practice. One former Peat Marwick colleague describes him as 'very energetic, and very concerned to do the right thing. He's a little bit on the introverted side, but not badly so'. Despite his limited experience in financial services, Palmer ascribes his appointment to his management experience, a 'good working knowledge' of the financial industry and a 'good reputation' in the financial community. His predecessor was also plucked from the auditing profession. One of the main issues in the Confed debacle is whether the superintendent's office acted firmly or early enough to prevent Canada's fourth-biggest insurer from sinking under the weight of sour property loans. Palmer describes regulatory intervention as an elusive question: 'How do you intervene early enough to protect policy-holders and depositors, but still maintain a competitive industry?' he asks. Confed's failure comes on the heels of the virtual annihilation of Canada's trust industry, which was also dragged down largely by ill-advised forays into risky commercial property. These events are bound to increase pressure for tighter supervision of financial institutions. Palmer indicates however, that he will take 'a balanced approach'. Over-regulation, he says, could starve financial institutions of outside capital. 'I'm not panicking about the insurance industry. Everything I've seen suggests that the Confederation situation was quite isolated.' Such caution suggests that the new superintendent will avoid radical changes. 'I have some prejudices, but they're largely based on anecdotal evidence,' Palmer says. His first job, he insists, will be to expand his knowledge of the industry by talking to the main players.</p>

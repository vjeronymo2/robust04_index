			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / PM moves closer to accepting EU poll may be held Mr John Major yesterday moved the government substantially closer to accepting a referendum could be held on further integration of the European Union. Mr Major told the Commons in a statement on the EU summit in Essen: 'I have indicated that the circumstances might be appropriate to have a referendum, and if they are, we will.' Officials said the prime minister's statement was in line with previous Commons comments recognising that a referendum might be appropriate in some circumstances. It was unclear whether Mr Major was referring to the possibility of UK participation in a single European currency, or the outcome of the 1996 inter-governmental conference. However, Mr Major's comments amount to his clearest endorsement yet of the increasingly widespread view on the Conservative backbenches that a referendum before further constitutional change has become inevitable. His statement followed strong support for the principle of a referendum on the outcome of the inter-governmental conference from Mr John Prescott, the deputy Labour leader. Mr Prescott told BBC radio that Labour would 'definitely' support a referendum if the conference resulted in significant constitutional changes. He stopped short of committing the party to a referendum in any circumstances, pointing out that the decision on whether to go ahead would have to await the outcome of the talks. But in Labour's warmest declaration of support so far, he said: 'An issue we think is of constitutional significance should be put fairly to the people - have the debate and a referendum.' The cabinet remains split on the issue, with pro-Europeans such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in a rare alliance against a referendum with Mr Michael Portillo, the Eurosceptic employment secretary. However, there were indications that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is preparing the ground for a formal shift of policy. Officials said he was not thinking 'beyond Christmas'. Backbench divisions on the issue re-emerged at a meeting of the rightwing 92 group at which several MPs opposed a referendum unless the government first committed itself to a firmly Eurosceptic approach to the intergovernmental conference. 'I favour a referendum, but not in a policy vacuum,' said Mr Edward Leigh, a former minister. Eurosceptics said a referendum would ignite tensions over Europe by suggesting that Mr Major was trying to stifle debate. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, said Mr Major should rule out a referendum. He told ITN: 'The only way forward is for him to show he is in command.'</p>

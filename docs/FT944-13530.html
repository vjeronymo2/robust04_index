			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Mixed-up Risen People - Theatre Jim Sheridan, the award-winning writer/director of such films as In The Name of the Father and My Left Foot, has returned to his theatrical roots with The Risen People, the story of the 1913 Irish labour lockout which he has co-adapted and co-directed with his brother Peter at Dublin's Gaiety Theatre. Sheridan has said that he took on the project, his first play in nearly a decade, as an experiment to incorporate the grand gestures of opera into theatre. And indeed there is much that is operatic about The Risen People: from the size of the cast - 15 principals, four singers and 21 supernumeraries - to the look and scale of the production. On a massive, elegant set of receding angled frames, a state-of-the-art lighting system projects scenes from Dublin life while live sung scenes from Aida mingle with the action on stage. But the medium The Risen People most brings to mind is film, not opera: it is Sheridan's attempt to bring cinematic storytelling techniques to the stage. Scenes overlap in a series of montages, plots and subplots mingle and accumulate, character is revealed less through dialogue or symbolic action than through behaviour. The crucial element the Sheridans fail to provide is the camera, or its stage equivalent. There is no dramatic focus to the action, no cues are given to the viewer on where to look or how to absorb the goings-on, and there is no gradation between the intimate and grand-scale. The effect is (I imagine) like watching the filming of a Cecil B. DeMille epic: at once visually overwhelming and stultifying. The Risen People tells the true story of the first organised labour uprising in Ireland, in which 400 employers, led by William Martin Murphy, banded together against a nascent union movement headed by the Englishman 'Big' Jim Larkin. Starvation and violence plagued the striking workers and their families, and they were on the verge of admitting defeat when the conflict was overshadowed by the outbreak of the first world war. The Sheridan brothers first directed The Risen People, based on James Plunkett's 1958 play of the same name on which he also based his best-selling novel Strumpet City, in 1977 during their stint as artistic directors of Dublin's Project Arts Centre. This production features some of the leading talents in Irish theatre - Donal Donnelly and Johnny Murphy are in wizened good form, though Tom Hickey looks to be marking time - as well as less seasoned performers. David Herlihy makes a strong showing as Fitz, the young labour organiser, but Lorraine Pilkington is out of her depth as his wife, Annie. It is her Aida-like struggle between her love for Fitz and her allegiance to her privileged father which is the ostensible reason for the distracting and faintly ridiculous inclusion of portions of that opera in the show. The Risen People is the most expensive production in Irish theatre history, with a budget estimated at IPounds 300,000 (Pounds 297,000)-IPounds 500,000. Jim Sheridan is listed as producer as well as adaptor/director, so we can assume that he has provided at least part of the funds from his film-making profits. Such reinvestment of film money back into theatre is an enlightened idea that has taken hold in the US. It would be churlish not to applaud the establishment of such a precedent in Ireland, but lax to do anything but chide an artistic effort as sloppy as The Risen People. At the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, through November.</p>

Mr Cassim confirmed on Monday [28 February] that he had  tabled surprise proposals to a parliamentary committee last  week, but added they had not yet been officially adopted by the  IFP, but "this can become the IFP's line".    The African National Congress [ANC] in Natal immediately  rejected the postponement of elections -- "April 27 is  non-negotiable," said provincial spokesman Dumisani Makhaye.  "If you tamper with that date you'll be unleashing forces that  will destroy everything in this country," he said.    Mr Cassim said the proposals would be discussed at an IFP  Central Committee meeting in Ulundi on Monday night.    In terms of the suggestions, the April elections should be  postponed in Natal/kwaZulu while they go ahead in the rest of  the country.    An interim administration, of which kwaZulu would be one  component, should be put in place in Natal. The other  components could be nominated by the state president or whoever  is in authority, said Mr Cassim. "The people of Natal should  then be allowed to develop a provincial constitution and then  put this to a referendum."    The IFP would, however, draw up this constitution which  would  have to be accepted by a 60 percent majority, he explained.  "Then within 90 days, an election would take place and we would  then join the rest of the country on the basis of a constitution  that has the support of the people of this, the second most  populous region in the country."    The IFP believed it would win a "clear majority" in a  referendum of this sort, he added. Mr Cassim said the proposals  were important as time was running out. "If you can't stop  time, the best thing is to take part of the process out of time  constraints. The ANC says it will bend over backwards and the  fact is that we must find a negotiated settlement. It would be  wrong for us to stop the rest of the country if they're ready.  Equally, it would be wrong to force an equally important  province to hurry along to something it has been opposed to all  along. Rather than adding towards conflict, it might be  necessary to have an alternative approach... and prevent a  total deadlock and impasse."    Mr Makhaye, meanwhile, charged that the IFP was trying to  buy  time after having isolated itself from the country's negotiation  process. "The patience of our people is not endless. But what  has held them back from venting their anger is precisely because  people are focusing on the April 27 democratic elections. I  personally think the time has now come to move forward to  democracy with or without the IFP or those wanting a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland]. We can't bend over until we break our  spines."</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Lib Dems gain 19 seats by targeting THE Liberal Democrats have made a net gain of 19 seats in the 183 local authority by-elections that have been held since the county council elections at the beginning of May. According to the Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre at the University of Plymouth this is the result of successful targeting of resources at promising seats by the Liberal Democrats, and could be translated into future gains of parliamentary seats. Mr Collin Rallings and Mr Michael Thrasher, from the university, pointed out that the Liberal Democrats had gained four seats in the south-west in last year's general election, even though their share of the national vote fell by 4.5 per cent. Writing in Local Government Chronicle, they concluded: 'Unless the Tories manage to increase their vote at the next election, they are likely to lose at least a handful of seats to the Liberal Democrats in southern England.' Thirteen of the 19 gains were from the Conservatives, with four from Labour and two from others.</p>

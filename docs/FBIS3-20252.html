Haavisto pointed out that the Eduskunta's targets, when it  discussed the application for membership, were that agricultural  production should continue at almost its present level and that,  for instance, milk production would grow. The negotiators were  to try to get the largest sum possible from the European Union  [EU] and the rest was to be funded by Finland in the form of  national subsidies: "The negotiations were conducted precisely  according to this plan."    The EU did not take into account Finland's special position,  but treated the country on the same basis as Germany, even  though that country's crop yield is twice as high as Finland's,  so there is a greater need for national subsidies: "This  solution implies that, without an agreement on national  subsidies, Finland may be left with just a few farms producing  milk for consumption," Haavisto added sharply. Haavisto's  personal position regarding the EU is also based on national  subsidies: "I cannot recommend that people vote `yes' to a  solution that would destroy Finland's rural areas. National  subsidies are a crucial issue."    The timetable of the EU referendum is open. Without signed  approval of the agreement by the European Parliament, no  referendum can be organized. The situation is exacerbated by  the recent hardening of Britain's standpoint on the minority  vote issue, Haavisto said. There are also many open issues and  questions of interpretation over and above those concerning  national subsidies. The EU Commission interprets agricultural  questions in a different manner than was agreed at the  ministerial level.    Haavisto also emphasized that running down the rural areas  would be terribly expensive for Finland. He points to the  enormous investments in infrastructure made over the decades,  including roads, schools, telecommunications, and health  centers. If the countryside becomes a desert, these will be  wasted and new infrastructures will have to be created for the  people who move south in search of work. "The benefits of EU  membership have been exaggerated. For instance, membership will  not bring investments to Finland. It would increase Finland's  attractiveness, but the prerequisites for foreign investment are  high-quality manpower and favorable raw-material, energy, and  capital costs."    Something has, however, become clear to the farmers. Grain  growers within the EU receive CAP [Common Agricultural Policy]  support for the difference when the price per kg drops from 1.10  markkas to 80 pennia. This subsidy rate, however -- much to the  displeasure of Haavisto and the farmers -- is linked to the  average crop per hectare of the last half of the 1980's, a  period with two exceptionally severe years of crop failure in  Finland. The average crop per hectare was 2,900 kg, and you  cannot survive on that, Haavisto said.    There will be subsidies for unprofitable regions, from which  some 300,000 hectares south of a line from Rauma to Loviisa will  be excluded, offering Finnish farmers compensation of 900  markkas per hectare or unit of livestock. According to  Haavisto, half of France and almost all of Luxembourg benefits  from this support. There is also a promise of annual  environmental protection subsidies worth 850 million markkas.  The environmental support is linked, among other things, to  reducing fertilizers and the number of livestock per hectare:  "A farm cannot survive on that kind of money. Without national  support they will not even get back their operating costs, never  mind making a profit. This is a vital issue for the nation.  Industry will benefit from the agreement anyway. But there is  some price to be paid in view of the risk that Finland's  food-production industry may loose nearly 300,000 jobs."    The European Union, before the Maastricht treaty, was 70  percent an agricultural community, Haavisto pointed out. Its  basic objective is to keep European grain production  competitive. Pork, eggs, and broiler hens are treated like  secondary cereal products in Europe [as published]. According  to this principle, the production of milk, lamb, and beef would  be left over for fringe areas like Finland, since they are  secondary-grazing-area products. In spite of the gloomy  prospects for producers in the latter three categories, Haavisto  thinks that the future looks brighter for lamb and beef  producers than for the cereal farmers.    Some of the member countries are not very interested in  Finnish membership or that of the other Nordic countries, while  other countries, like Germany, want Finland to join. Without  the efforts of the Deputy Chairmanship -- countries like Germany  and Belgium -- negotiations would have broken down, Haavisto  said: "The process was confusing. It was not managed properly  by the EU. Quarrels between member countries caused confusion  and everybody tried to wrest some form of benefit for himself.  I am sure that the internal order of the EU will improve if the  Nordic countries become members."</p>

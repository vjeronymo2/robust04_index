			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Josef Prokes by Vladimir </F> Marek; place and date not given: "Putting on a Beret Is Not  Enough"]    [Text] The Chrudim mechanized airborne battalion  should become one of the main pillars of the readiness brigade.  This was the reason we asked its commanding officer, Lieutenant  Colonel Josef Prokes, for an interview.    [Marek] Only recently you were the commander of the 71th  airborne battalion. Without having to change places, you became  practically overnight the commander of the 43d mechanized  airborne brigade. What is the difference between these two units?    [Prokes] I would rather begin with what the two brigades  have  in common. They are located in Chrudim and they are airborne  units. But they differ in their character and mission. The new  brigade will be, as is, after all, indicated by its name, an  airborne unit. It will therefore be possible to deploy it by  parachute drop. But at the same time it also will be mechanized,  which indicates its other possible insertion into combat--on  personnel carriers.    [Marek] Will there be some difference in the training of the  unit presently being formed compared to the former airborne  battalion?    [Prokes] There will be no substantive difference in  training.  In certain areas the content will be changed. But these will be  relatively small changes.    [Marek] Speaking about the names--isn't it a pity that the  71st battalion, which already has its own tradition, its image,  is being renamed the 43d?    [Prokes] I agree with you, it is a pity. Number 71 has its  own history, which goes back to World War II. We were interested  in having it at least appear under its historic name. But in  view of the reorganization and renumbering of the entire army it  was impossible for our wish to be granted.    [Marek] You mentioned that the brigade is mechanized. What  kind of equipment will it have?    [Prokes] Primarily wheeled, unarmored vehicles.    [Marek] What would these be at present?    [Prokes] For the time being, mainly UAZ all-terrain  vehicles.  Before long, however, we should be getting new equipment.  Mentioned are Mercedes and other latest generation all-terrain  vehicles.    [Marek] At the present time the battalion is being  transformed and provided with additional troops. Will you be  able to start training by 1 July 1994?    [Prokes] Basically, training was never interrupted, it goes  on in perfect continuity. The battalion is merely being  supplemented with additional servicemen. The deadlines for  forming the unit are relatively short. However, I am convinced  that we can meet them.    [Marek] Can you envision a situation when the parliament  decides, for example in six months, to deploy the brigade in  some combat mission? Would you be able to handle it?    [Prokes] As I said already, the brigade will be formed by 1  July. We shall meet that deadline.    [Marek] Are you satisfied with the quality of the people you  are getting? Are they real professionals?    [Prokes] Most of the additional people we are getting have  served in functions commensurate with those to which they are  being assigned. The problem could be only in the fact that  someone was, for example, a commander of a motorized rifle  platoon and now he will command paratroopers. When we place a  beret on an officer's head, it does not mean that he  automatically becomes a paratrooper. He will have to learn some  things. But if the person is only a little competent and has  certain prerequisites, that should not present any great  problems.    [Marek] Are these people in sufficiently good physical  condition?    [Prokes] That is an individual matter. However, the majority  of platoon commanders are young people who are in appropriate  physical condition.    [Marek] Do you try to make the training as interesting as  possible, make it as close to real combat conditions as possible?    [Prokes] It's not that we are trying. It is one of the basic  principles which we have been following for a long time. There  is much greater interest among the soldiers in that kind of  training. When you are interested in what you are doing, it is  much more effective than if it is merely something you are  ordered to do.    [Marek] How many times a year, for example, does a soldier  fire a submachine gun?    [Prokes] There is no firing range in Chrudim, and that is  causing us some problems. We have to travel to one. In spite of  that, our soldiers have the opportunity to fire at least once or  twice every month.    [Marek] Do you also practice reflexive firing?    [Prokes] For the time being, the rules do not make it  possible for us to do that. But if there should be a change,  such practice should be interesting and useful.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish National Defense Minister Piotr </F> Kolodziejczyk by Maria Wagrowska; place and date not given: "To  Be Far From Politics"]    [Text] [Wagrowska] As the minister of national defense,  when you were in office for the first time, in February 1991 you  signed the document dissolving the military structures of the  Warsaw Pact. Now you are implementing the program of military  cooperation with NATO--the "Partnership for Peace." Has Poland's  security been enhanced over the past three years, as Polish  foreign policy has been reoriented toward the West?    [Kolodziejczyk] Has it been enhanced in relation to which  period? If we go back to the period of the Cold War, then I  must say that, paradoxically, our security was greater because  it was based on the parity of well-organized and fully  controlled martial potentials. After the dissolution of the  Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, control  over the nuclear arsenal became noticeably weaker and is still  incomplete. In this context, the agreement on Ukrainian nuclear  disarmament, which U.S. President Clinton managed to negotiate,  should be treated as a step that enhances the security of  Europe--and also the security of Poland. Now we can only hope  that this agreement will be put into effect fairly soon.    The present condition of our Army is so poor that, if we  make  the abstract assumption that Poland would have to wage a  circular war [wojna okrezna], it would not allow us to ensure  security to our country. That is certain. However, the issue of  our sovereignty will not be decided in the military area; it  will by decided by the economy. This does not mean that the Army  would all of a sudden lose its importance. We are reforming it  laboriously and, despite all of the financial problems, we seem  to be closer to the goal that we have set.    [Wagrowska] Has the turnaround toward the West, declared by  politicians, been approved of by the military?    [Kolodziejczyk] An obvious change has been made in the way  we  think about our security, first of all among the professional  military cadres. The Army is not interested in being close to  politics, maybe with a few exceptions.    The image of the enemy was long and persistently created in  the Army; however, it was not perpetuated so much as to have any  effect today. This was probably because our Army "is satiated"  with people with university degrees.    I cannot say such good things about the issues of the  organization of the Polish Army and the level of technology at  its disposal. Unfortunately, the pace of change depends here on  how much money we get, but not only on that.. Work on changing  the legal foundations of the Army's functioning was only  partially successful. The last two Sejms lacked the willingness  to deal with these problems and to define what the civil  Ministry of Defense should really be. Thus, the division of  powers is still rather vague, and responsibility for issues of  defense remains rather blurred.    [Wagrowska] I gather that completing the legislative work is  your first and foremost request for the present Sejm.    [Kolodziejczyk] The Sejm must eventually adopt appropriate  constitutional and legal provisions. It must define the scope of  responsibilities of the president, as well as the instruments by  which he could fulfill his duties efficiently. Therefore, the  Ministry of National Defense [MON] suggests that the Security  Council be given such prerogatives that could allow it to  influence the government's activities in the area of defense.  The prime minister, according to the Constitution, is also  responsible for the state's security. MON believes that the  government's representatives in the Security Council should form  a Committee of Defense Affairs in the Council of Ministers,  which, similar to the Economic Committee of the Council of  Ministers or the Social Affairs Committee, would deal with  issues of state defense (not only the issues of the Armed  Forces). The committee would submit concrete solution proposals  to the Council of Ministers, which would accept them or not.  However, the drafts of these solutions would have to pass an  appropriate legislative path, or, if the powers of the  government allow for this, they would be accepted directly by  the Council of Ministers.    Such an attitude, however, calls for prior amending of the  Small Constitution, as well as amending of the Law on General  Duty of Defense of the Republic. This law must very precisely  divide powers between the civilian defense minister and the  General Staff head (now I am using the present name because  there are suggestions that he be called the inspector general or  the commander in chief). This process is under way.  Unfortunately, the talks between ministries in all issues are  extremely lengthy, and they raised many doubts of a political  rather than a substantive nature.    [Wagrowska] When do you expect the legislation process to  be complete? When do you plan to begin implementing reform in  the Army?    [Kolodziejczyk] I hoped that the prepared bills would be  submitted in the Sejm as soon as January because the  participants of the last session of the National Defense  Committee expressed unanimous views on the issue of the bills.  In the meantime, however, new problems cropped up, which I  cannot understand at all. I am afraid that once again someone  wants to cut down the legal regulations concerning the present  state of affairs, as well as concerning certain politicians.    [Wagrowska] Who exactly is blocking the reform?    [Kolodziejczyk] I will not say that because I do not want to  aggravate the situation. MON has prepared a detailed set of  regulations that defines the rights and duties in the ministry;  however, this time it was I who blocked its  implementation--untill the most basic decisions that we talked  about are made.    [Wagrowska] However, the new command structures in the  Polish  Army depend on the Defense Ministry, but they are not  functioning yet as well.    [Kolodziejczyk] The work on correcting these structures is  almost complete. Changes concerning the General Staff will be  quite fundamental. In line with the new concept, the first  soldier in the country--that is, the head of the General  Staff--is supposed to bear the responsibility for training,  combat readiness, and mobilization readiness of the Armed  Forces. He will have five deputies: for strategic-defense  planning, ground forces, air forces, navy, and logistics. The  General Staff will be decreased and will be, in the event of the  greatest need, a center that coordinates the combat efforts of  the various types of forces.    The commander of the ground forces, which is the greatest  novelty, will be the commander of corps-brigade structures,  which, as I see it, are lighter and more mobile. In line with  the previous strategic concepts, a military district became a  self-dependent Army for the period of war. Poland had two Armies  of the first group--made up of the Pomeranian district and the  Silesian district--and one Army of the second group, formed on  the basis of the Warsaw Military District. In line with today's  doctrine of equal security of all borders, we have formed the  Krakow district.    This is the general concept; however, as it always happens,  the devil is in the details, and our officers in the General  Staff are just now driving this devil away. We are planning to  complete the work in February. MON would like to be able to  implement the reform of command structures as soon as possible.    [Wagrowska] The importance of the Krakow Military District  for state security has been discussed for some time now.  However, somehow it just cannot be established.    [Kolodziejczyk] As I have said, the Krakow Military District  is subordinated to the strategy of ensuring equal security on  all of the state's borders. Previously, both in the south and in  the east, on the so-called eastern wall, Poland was almost  completely "naked." This must be rectified; however, it can only  be achieved at the cost of formations that were many years ago  grouped in the western part of the country. The Krakow Military  District is being established, even though it is being done very  slowly; this is because we have too little money, chiefly for  infrastructure, which is extremely costly.    Being in a difficult financial situation, we decided to  earmark all of the money that we had for the improvement of the  technical condition of the Army. We could act this way because  there is no danger of a sudden attack on our country; even in  the event of any danger, we will undoubtedly have enough time to  move the needed formations to the endangered region. Now, if we  had wanted to distribute the money in a different way, if we had  allocated a little for the infrastructure and a little for  equipment, ages would have passed before we could achieve what  we wanted.    [Wagrowska] The generals that I have spoken with stress that  we should gradually stop maintaining the ground forces and that  they should be transformed into air-ground forces. Do you share  these opinions?    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I do because air-ground forces are more  mobile and more efficient in combat; therefore, they would be  better in warding off any attack.    [Wagrowska] A few years ago, the assumption was made that 40  percent of the Armed Forces would stay in western Poland, 30  percent would be stationed in the central part, and another 30  percent would be in the east. How is the dislocation going?    [Kolodziejczyk] I do not think that there is a chance to  complete very soon the process of regrouping the Armed Forces  from west to east, for the reasons that I have mentioned before.  We are improving the positioning of soldiers by reducing  garrisons in the western part of Poland. The idea of regrouping  forces is the cause of alarm in the east. At this point, I would  like to recall my recent talks with the Belarusian defense  minister, who understands perfectly well that the shifting of  our forces to the east is not supposed to pose any danger to his  country. Politicians, however, sometimes use the issue of  dislocation in their gamesmanship. I think that the fears of  Ukraine and Belarus have been generated, among other things, by  reprehensible negligence in the eastern policy of our country.  Building a state's security, as I understand it, in today's  European conditions should consist of maintaining as good  relations with all neighboring states as possible; in close  regional cooperation; in continental structures of security;  and, finally, in disarmament.    [Wagrowska] What does the issue of changing the armament of  the Army look like?    [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, I regret to tell you that,  over the past few years, the Army has not received anything new,  except a modernized tank, which is called "hard" but which  actually is still not hard. We are still far from the  technologies that we should have.    [Wagrowska] What, then, does the Polish Army need the most?    [Kolodziejczyk] Fire systems and systems for controlling  fire. Our scientists, to be sure, are close to building such  systems, but we are not able to manufacture all of the  components in Poland, or it simply does not pay to manufacture  them all here.    [Wagrowska] Dangers to our security may be caused mainly by  local conflicts around the Polish borders. All the same, it is  known that the radio-electronic reconnaissance systems, the most  important element in warning of impending danger, leave a lot to  be desired. It is not even able to distinguish an enemy aircraft  from our own because practically all aircraft in the neighboring  states were made in the Soviet Union.    [Kolodziejczyk] All the same, the eastern wall is protected.  To make the air surveillance system more efficient, we need at  least 12 radio location stations with the "our-alien"  reconnaissance systems. We are creating a new identification  system. This issue is related to the problem of abandoning some  frequencies, which has become well-known recently. We will not  be able to abandon them until all of the location equipment in  the planes and helicopters is replaced. The work on this,  carried out jointly with "Thompson," will take from two to three  years.    [Wagrowska] What are your priorities as far as cooperation  with NATO is concerned? What is it exactly that Poland needs  from the West, from the point of view of the requirements of our  security?    [Kolodziejczyk] It is first of all technical and  technological cooperation that allow us to take rational  advantage of our scientific and production potential. So far, we  have consistently been denied this help.  <H5>  Box, p 2 </H5> <H5>  Basic Data on the Polish Army </H5>   The dislocation of the forces and division into military  districts:    --Number of soldiers: 225,000    --Number of people in the Army: 313,000, including 87,000  professional soldiers, 138,000 conscripts, and 89,000 civilian  employees.

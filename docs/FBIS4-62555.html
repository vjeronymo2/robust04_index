			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Georgiy Arslanov and Vyacheslav </F> Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing May 16 TASS -- The Russian State Duma views  China as a priority for both political and economic cooperation,  according to Speaker Ivan Rybkin who added that Beijing should  not be concerned by Russian plans to join the NATO "Partnership  for Peace" programme.    "With all the contradicting views and political sympathies  of  Duma factions we have agreed that the Chinese direction in  foreign policy and foreign trade is a priority", Rybkin told a  press conference on Monday.    He added that trade turnover between the two countries went  up by 30 per cent in 1993 and that Russia enjoys a three-billion  dollar favourable balance in it.    During talks in Beijing the Russian delegation offered  concrete cooperation projects which can be supported by the  governments and parliaments, according to Rybkin. He stressed  that Russia is proposing to China unique technologies which "are  very important for solving the burning economic problems of  China".    "Russia's joining `Partnership for Peace' plan should not  cause concern of the great eastern neighbour" as Russian armed  forces would remain independent anyway. Russia wants to  "preserve the originality of its army, both in armaments and the  organisational structure. Thus we shall preserve the  independence of the army which is not the last in the world",  the speaker said.    Speaking about the health of Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that  at his nearly 50 years of age he envies the fitness of the  president who is 63. "He feels well, has a strong handshake,  good logics and an intensive work schedule", the speaker added.</p>

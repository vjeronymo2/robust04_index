			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Building societies widen their lending margins - At a glance Building societies have been taking advantage of the spate of base rate cuts in the past few years to widen their lending margins. At the beginning of 1991, base rates were 14 per cent while mortgage rates were 14.5 per cent. The chart shows that lending margins were at their widest towards the end of 1992 when, for a period, base rates were 7 per cent and mortgage rates 9.99 per cent. Lending margins are once again edging towards the same level. Savings/mortgage rates, Page IV.</p>

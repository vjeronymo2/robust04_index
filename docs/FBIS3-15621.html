How the </F> North Atlantic Alliance Is Transforming Itself"]    [Text] He is married with three sons. He likes reading,  singing, and drawing. He goes skating and yachting. A brief  sketch of the private life of...no, not of a flourishing  representative of the bohemian way of life, nor of a rich heir.  We are talking about NATO's number three -- General John  Waters, deputy supreme commander in chief of NATO Joint Armed  Forces in Europe.    My meeting with him took place at the M.V. Frunze Military  Academy. Gen. Waters had come to Moscow to lecture on the  transformation of NATO, the change in the strategic concept of  the North Atlantic alliance, and its future role.    A new page in NATO's history was opened in November 1991.  The heads of state and government of the NATO member countries  issued the Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. What did this  mean? Nothing less than the end of the "cold war."    However, Gen. Waters believes that when the threat of a  major  war disappeared, petty conflicts being to flare up more  frequently, mainly over ethnic disagreements. How are they to  be averted, and how is regional peace and stability to be  consolidated? These are the questions facing NATO leaders  today. It was to resolve these issues that the "Partnership for  Peace" initiative was born. Gen. Waters said that he is not a  politician but a soldier, and, for him, this initiative means  only one thing -- the capacity to act jointly to consolidate  peace in regions of confrontation. Armed forces may be required  in these conditions, but their direct employment depends on the  circumstances arising on the ground. In the main, servicemen  will fulfill other functions in conflict regions: protecting  people from starvation, providing them with humanitarian and  medical aid, and rescuing people during natural disasters.    As a whole the North Atlantic alliance's strategic concept  is  defined by a broader approach to security, an approach based on  dialogue, cooperation, and maintaining the capacity for  collective defense. This concept also envisages substantial  changes in NATO's Joint Armed Forces.    The goal has changed, and the means of achieving it are also  changing. THe new structure of the armed forces, whose  formation will be completed in 1995, assigns the major role to  multinational formations. They will be provided to support UN  or CSCE peacekeeping missions.    The reconstruction of the NATO Armed Forces entails their  reduction by 25 percent by 1997. The main reduction will be in  the ground forces. In NATO's central region the reduction will  be 45 percent. True, at the same time the number of reserve  units will be somewhat increased.    So, what will the North Atlantic alliance become now, an  alliance which in the old Soviet history was never called  anything but aggressive and hawkish? However substantive the  changes in the NATO Armed Forces, it is clear that these forces  will still be sufficiently powerful, and the hawk's claws and  beak have by no means been blunted.    The most obvious illustration of this is the former  Yugoslavia and the current crisis in Bosnia. Gen. Waters was  asked how the decision on air strikes against the Serbs was  arrived at. He explained at length the so-called two-shoulder  method, which boils down to the adoption of first and foremost a  political decision at the highest international level on the  basis of specific proposals from the military leadership on the  ground. With evident relief the general acknowledged that this  decision is now the property of history.    He gave due credit to the Russian peacekeeping battalion,  which managed to complete its march to Sarajevo in difficult  conditions. The combat training of Russian soldiers is of a high  standard, the general remarked.</p>

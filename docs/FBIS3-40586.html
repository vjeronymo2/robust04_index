However, both sides hinted that no  major progress was achieved and the differences remained wide  even though the respective positions were made clear.    Pakistan and Indian diplomats remained tight-lipped about  the  first session of talks held on Sunday morning with Pakistan's  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan saying "no scores at half time"  when asked for comments. His counterpart J N Dixit also parried  questions telling newsmen that both the sides had presented  their positions in a matter of fact style and that there were no  acrimonious exchanges. More than that he would not say, he added.    Nearly all the participants of the talks from both sides  were  present at the reception hosted by the Indian High Commissioner  S K Lamba in honour of Indian Foreign Secretary J N Dixit.  Pakistani diplomats stressed that discussions with the Indian  side were held with utmost seriousness in which their position  was made crystal clear. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, who  avoided questions about the contents of the morning session, did  say that the discussions were intensive and that Kashmir issue  was the central point. Pakistani diplomats seemed happy that the  Indians had discussed Kashmir issue thoroughly even though there  were no indications that anything substantive had been achieved.    Some diplomats complained that media had hyped up the talks  too much. And some hints were dropped that after Monday's  session, the two sides may agree to hold more such rounds of  talks without announcing specific dates. However, it was clear  that side issues like Siachen, Sir Creek and Wullar Barrage were  sidelined during the first session of talks.    The second session was held at 10 pm at the Foreign Office.  Before that the Indian Foreign Secretary attended dinner hosted  in his honour by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. The  third session will be held today at 9:10 am.    APP adds: Seventh round of Foreign Secretary-level talks  between Pakistan and India, which began here on Sunday, focused  on the Kashmir dispute with the two sides reiterating their  stance on the issue.    Official sources here said that the negotiations started  with  a "note of seriousness." Pakistan called for creating requisite  conditions for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute. It  emphasised the urgent need to end Indian repression in Occupied  Kashmir to pave way for a peaceful settlement of the issue.    PPI adds: Calling upon India to create propitious conditions  for finding out a peaceful Kashmir solution, Pakistan put across  its known position on the issue during the first round of  Foreign Secretary-level talks which began at 9:40 am and  continued for 95 minutes.    The talks between the two countries at Foreign  Secretary-level have resumed after a break of around 17 months  for which both Islamabad and New Delhi have done a great deal of  homework since the announcement in this respect during last week  of November.    When contacted a Foreign Office spokesman told PPI that  Pakistan also underlined the need for an end to repression in  the Indian-held Kashmir to create propitious conditions for  securing peaceful solution to the problem which is a sine qua  non for the establishment of normal and cooperative relations  between Pakistan and India.    The 7th round of talks between the two countries at the  Foreign Secretary-level is of special significance for Pakistan  mainly because of the fact that India has, for the first time,  agreed to discuss the Kashmir question as a separate agenda item.    "The talks have so far focussed on the Kashmir issue," the  spokesman said and added that during the first round, the two  sides reiterated their known positions.    The Indian delegation is being led by Foreign Secretary J.N.  Dixit and senior officials of Indian Ministry of External  Affairs, including Joint Secretary M.K. Bhdra Kumar, Director  Prakash Sood, Deputy Secretary Y.K. Sinha and Under-Secretary Ms  Vijay Thakur Singh. The delegation was joined during the talks  by officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.    They include High Commissioner S.K. Lamba, Deputy High  Commissioner Bal Anand, Francis Vaz and N. Parthasarthi.    The Pakistan delegation was headed by Foreign Secretary  Shaharyar M. Khan. Additional Secretaries Munir Akram and  Khalid Saleem, Director-General India Desk Shafqat Kakakhel,  Directors Akberzeb and Jalil Abbas Jillani and Pakistan's High  Commissioner in New Delhi Riaz Khokhar.    The spokesman said the talks started with a note of  seriousness, adding that President of Pakistan and later the  Foreign Secretary have both underlined Pakistan's desire for a  peaceful solution of the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir on the  basis of the United Nations resolutions.    Amidst hopes for constructive and meaningful talks, Pakistan  has repeatedly announced during recent past that this is last  chance for India. The Indian Foreign Secretary, however,  disagreed with the announcement during his Saturday's Press  talk, saying that he does not think this is a last chance.    PPI adds: The second round of Pak-India foreign secretary  level talks was held here at the Foreign Office Sunday night,  informed sources told PPI that during the second round which  lasted half an hour, the two sides held indepth discussion  focussing on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir dispute.    Asked if the talks are heading towards a meaningful  progress,  the sources said, it would be premature to make any assessment  with finality about the talks at this stage.</p>

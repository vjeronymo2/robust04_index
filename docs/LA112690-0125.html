			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BARKLEY RUES WIFE-BEATING GAG  </P> <P> Charles Barkley, star forward of the Philadelphia 76ers, has apologized for a  postgame quip that women's groups claimed made sport of wife-beating, a club  official said today.  </P> <P> Barkley, who said the remarks were meant as a joke, was quoted as saying after  a tough Nov. 3 win over the underdog New Jersey Nets that "this is a game that  if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids.  </P> <P> Did you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That's because  she knew I wasn't going to beat her."  </P> <P> Asked by a reporter at the time if he wanted to reconsider the statement,  Barkley replied, "Nah, print it."  </P> <P> The comment, reported nationally, aroused the ire of battered women's groups in  Philadelphia and Los Angeles, prompting the apology.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAIR APPARENTS;  </P> <P> STYLE: BARBERS TURN HEADS INTO ART FORMS, ETCHING EVERYTHING FROM BASKETBALL  PLAYERS TO BATMAN ON THE SKULLS OF YOUNG BLACK MEN.  </P> <P> There's magic going on at The Cosmic Cut.  </P> <P> The hip downtown Inglewood hair salon is a place where teen-agers slink in,  baseball hats covering overgrown heads; an hour later, chests sticking out,  they leave sans hats with cuts so hot they sizzle.  </P> <P> An afternoon in the shop, which draws customers from as far away as Orange  County, shows you the cutting edge in black hairstyles.  </P> <P> Its founder, Emmanuel Jones, sets the 13-year-old shop's far-out tone with his  own bizarre style: EMMANUEL is etched ear-to-ear in huge block letters.  </P> <P> This is a place where some cutters keep a notebook and paper -- to preview  their creations -- next to the sterilized scissors. Here, haircutting has  reached an art form known in industry parlance as "hair graphics."  </P> <P> Clipper art uses the skull for a canvas. Picture a basketball player in mid-air  jamming a ball in the hoop, a smiling Mickey Mouse, the Nike symbol, the Joker  -- all shaved into the backs of heads.  </P> <P> "I can do anything I can draw," said Tai Miller, one of the shop's popular  clippers. "Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bambi, the Smurfs, any of  them."  </P> <P> None of them, however, would be allowed inside the doors of Inglewood High  School, which is around the corner from the shop.  </P> <P> In a clash of cultural vision, Principal Lawrence Freeman has banned the cuts,  saying blacks do not need any more hurdles on the way to success. He even  forced the current student body president to let his designs grow out before  letting him run for the leadership post.  </P> <P> But inside the Cosmic Cut, that view gets short shrift. Jones considers the  cuts so popular that they will cross over to the the white culture. Someday  you'll be able to get one at SuperCuts, he said.  </P> <P> Between trims, Jones, his wire-rimmed spectacles slung low on the nose,  philosophizes out loud, talks up the black merchandise advertised on the walls,  tells wild stories to the youngsters lined up for their chance in the chair and  supervises occasional songfests from the shop's second-floor balcony.  </P> <P> He has turned his shop into a hangout, a classroom, a marketplace, an amateur  theater.  </P> <P> "It's more than just a barbershop," said Cindy Cameron, one of Jones' staff.  "It's an entertainment complex. You get more than a haircut. You get a show."  </P> <P> Cosmic Cut outgrew its humble roots in a closet-like shop on Market Street  about six months ago, moving down the block to a two-story salon where a dozen  heads can be trimmed at a time.  </P> <P> The closely cropped haircuts embellished with designs first became popular  among young blacks on the East Coast and then spread to California in the  mid-1980s, Jones said.  </P> <P> Jones' 28-year-old son, Kevin, who also works at the shop, recalls cutting  small lines in the mid-'80s and then occasional peace symbols and outlines of  Africa. Now the designs fluctuate with the popular cultural icons of the day.  </P> <P> The younger Jones said he etched thousands of bat symbols onto heads during the  recent Batman craze. In one 40-minute session he copied an intricate T-shirt  design of a grimacing Joker onto one teen-ager's skull.  </P> <P> Jones, 50, said black hairstyles are a creature of the times, with Afros, short  crops and processed curls going in and out of style.  </P> <P> The graphic cut will be the cut of the '90s for the in crowd, Jones said. For  those who can't decide on a particular graphic for their head, there are fade  cuts in which the top of the head has long hair and the sides are shaved clean  and different color styles in which patches of the head are dyed red, blond or  some other color.  </P> <P> The reasons for sporting the graphic cuts are as varied as the designs  themselves.  </P> <P> "It separates you from everyone else," said Willis Turner, 19, a college  student who was waiting for a Chicken-Hawk design one day last week. "Girls  notice you."  </P> <P> Turner of Placentia says he drives to Inglewood every couple of weeks for a new  hair graphic because he doesn't trust his head to Orange County barbers.  </P> <P> Upkeep is a constant concern with the graphic cuts, which cost anywhere from $8  for a simple part to $20 and more for designer pictures that require more  intricate clipper action. The cuts get fuzzy after a week and lose their  picture completely in two weeks.  </P> <P> Brandon Braff, 17, an amateur dancer who attends Crenshaw High School in Los  Angeles, said a wild cut gives him an added lift. "You feel like a new man when  you come out of that chair," he said.  </P> <P> One high school track coach came into the shop one weekend because he had told  his team members that he would get a graphic cut if the students won a big  track meet. The white coach left the small shop with the school's initials  shaved into the back of his otherwise conservative hairstyle.  </P> <P> Freeman, who bans earrings on males and anything that can be construed as gang  attire from Inglewood High, sums up the view of those who find the cuts  laughable.  </P> <P> "Kids have every constitutional right to make themselves look like a fool," he  said. "But we are presenting our children as marketable items who have to be  accepted for jobs and schools. When I send a student from Inglewood High  School, I want someone I can be proud of."  </P> <P> Jones, of course, disagrees. He sees in the wild haircuts an effort by young  blacks to seek empowerment and build self-esteem in a society that tends to  view blacks as a whole in a negative light.  </P> <P> "Graphic cuts stir up a lot of excitement among those who see them," Jones  said. "When the energy is focused on the person with the graphics, they feel it  and it raises their self-esteem."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Death Over Iraq"] </F>   [Text] President Saddam Husayn's cruel and lawless regime  yesterday claimed the lives of 26 more Allied servicemen. The  direct cause of their deaths, in the shooting down over northern  Iraq of two US helicopters carrying British, French, American,  and Turkish officers, was that most embarrassing and terrible of  military accidents known as friendly fire. American aircraft  monitoring the "no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel  mistakenly took the two Black Hawks for the Hinds used by the  Iraqi military. This was an accident that should not have  happened if established military procedures had been properly  followed, and the Pentagon's investigation must be swift and  thorough.    But Saddam's brutality towards his own people is the reason  for the presence in Iraq of the officers, and for the military  surveillance operation itself. They were on a mission to liaise  with Kurdish leaders and United Nations officials on ways to  counter the increased threat from Baghdad to the aptly named  Operation Provide Comfort. This humanitarian rescue mission was  launched, at John Major's instigation, in April 1991 when  Saddam's troops drove nearly two million Iraqi Kurds to what  would otherwise have been death from exposure and starvation in  the mountains to which they had been forced to flee. Three years  after Iraq was chased out of Kuwait, Saddam still poses so  direct a menace to Iraq's Kurdish citizens that they remain  heavily dependent on UN assistance, within a "safe haven" which  has constantly to be monitored by a multinational taskforce.    Saddam has subjected this wholly admirable humanitarian  operation to constant and brutal harassment. He has imposed an  economic blockade against the north far more savage than the UN  sanctions against which he inveighs. Iraqi agents constantly  attempt to project into the safe haven the systematic state  terror condemned by the UN's special rapporteur on human rights  in the rest of Iraq as "crimes against humanity". UN guards  protect relief workers, journalists and human rights monitors  from ambushes, car-bombs and other forms of armed harassment.  Since the beginning of March alone, eight UN guards have been  murdered or wounded by Iraqi agents, in an escalation of attacks  which supports the US State Department's allegation that Saddam  has put a bounty of up to 6,000 pounds on the heads of UN  personnel and other foreigners.    The tension has increased since mid-March, when Saddam  issued  unspecific threats that Iraq would not "stand with its hands  tied" and his key aides vowed, rather more specifically, to  "return the beloved north to the motherland". Since then, the  three army corps permanently stationed just below the 36th  parallel have been reinforced by the deployment of three  divisions of crack Republican Guards to join two already there.  The Allied military force based at Incirlik in Turkey, which  polices the no-fly zone imposed in August 1992, has been on  heightened alert against a repetition of last year's Iraqi  attacks on Allied aircraft. Saddam has been emboldened by the  emergence of divisions within the UN Security Council over  sanctions. Previous decisions to maintain them have been  routine, but last month's was reached only after three days of  intense discussion, with Britain and America resisting French,  Russian and Chinese pressure to ease them. Firmness remains  vital. Sanctions must not be relaxed until Iraq is in total  compliance with all relevant UN resolutions. The UN needs at  least a year to be sure that Iraq cannot manufacture prohibited  weaponry and is finally co-operating fully with the UN's  systematic longterm monitoring programme to prevent future  cheating; but that is not the only issue. Saddam has yet to  account for hundreds of Kuwaitis and other hostages taken during  the Gulf War. Above all, in defiance of the UN ceasefire  resolution and international law, he has renewed his claim to  Kuwait. For all these reasons, his criminal regime remains as  clear a threat to international peace as it is to the wellbeing  of Iraq's terribly persecuted people. There is no case for  letting vigilance slip.</p>

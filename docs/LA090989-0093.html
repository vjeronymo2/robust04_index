			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: SHAFFER TAKES HIS PARTY MUSIC 'COAST TO COAST'  </P> <P> "What is hip?" asked Paul Shaffer, the keyboardist who is musical director of  TV's "Late Night With David Letterman." "It's hard to say. Why ask me? I'm not  really hip."  </P> <P> Ah, such modesty.  </P> <P> One reason Letterman's show is a favorite among the young, hip crowd is because  of Shaffer, who was in town recently from New York City to spread the word  about his new Capitol album, "Coast to Coast."  </P> <P> Shaffer may be an unlikely-looking hipster -- short, balding, 39 and, by his  own admission, no glamour boy.  </P> <P> But when you talk to Shaffer -- who wears tinted shades and has a distinctive  voice -- you quickly get the sense of a confident, glib, witty, in-crowd sort  of guy.  </P> <P> Part of the Letterman show's hang-loose atmosphere -- a sort of cozy nightclub  feel -- is due to Shaffer. Besides leading the band through some punchy rock  and R&amp;B, Shaffer contributes to the offbeat flair of the program by serving  as a sweet-natured foil for Letterman's unremitting sarcasm.  </P> <P> Savoring an afternoon aperitif in a quiet lounge of his Beverly Hills hotel,  Shaffer did finally concede, "Well, the show is hip, but I'm just a cog in it."  </P> <P> Despite his playful, nonchalant manner on the Letterman show, Shaffer has  established a reputation in the pop world as a quality musician, both through  his playing on the air and touring with his group, the World's Most Dangerous  Band.  </P> <P> The new Capitol album, however, is his most ambitious outside venture. Each cut  was recorded in a different city and features a noted performer -- such as  Valerie Simpson, Brian Wilson, KC (of KC and the Sunshine Band) and Eric  Burdon.  </P> <P> Additional stars turn up in minor roles. On the doo-wop style "When the Radio  Is On" (which has been released as a single), the background vocalists include  Dion DiMucci, Carole King and the Fresh Prince. The vocal lineup on "What Is  Soul" is longer and even more impressive, from Ben E. King and Bobby Womack to  Darlene Love avis Staples. "Wang Dang Doodle" offers the stirring lead-guitar  licks of Buddy Guy.  </P> <P> Shaffer, who has been playing the piano since age 6, said he wanted the album  to have the feel of a coast-to-coast party, something with the musical flavor  of a lot of different cities.  </P> <P> "It was an opportunity for me to work with a lot of people I've wanted to  record with and do the kind of music I love . . . rock 'n' roll and R&amp;B.  Ballads didn't fit into this party atmosphere I wanted to create."  </P> <P> In addition to co-writing and producing, Shaffer also does some singing. One of  his brightest vocal moments is a duet with KC, the former disco king never  known as a high-quality singer. Shaffer, who holds his own with KC, quipped:  "If he makes good records with his voice, I knew there was hope for me."  </P> <P> Shaffer grew up in a small Canadian town called Thunder Bay and became hooked  at an early age on soul and rock by listening to the radio, especially U.S.  stations that he could pick up in his area. It wasn't until he was in college  in Toronto, however, that he began thinking about becoming a professional  musician. His first big break was landing a position as musical director of the  Toronto company of the musical "Godspell."  </P> <P> He later moved to New York, playing piano in the band backing the Broadway  musical "The Magic Show." Then, in 1975, Howard Shore, an old pal from Canada,  got a job as musical director of a new television show called "Saturday Night  Live" and invited Shaffer to join the band.  </P> <P> After five years of the weekly grind (which included being Bill Murray's  lounge-act sidekick and a hilarious impersonation of rock impresario Don  Kirshner), Shaffer left the highly successful show to work as a studio  musician. But the break from television didn't last long. Letterman, who was  starting his late-night show, needed a musical director and he remembered  Shaffer from "Saturday Night Live."  </P> <P> "When they (asked) what kind of band I wanted to put together, I said a group  like you'd see in a smoky, late-night lounge that is a local hot spot," Shaffer  recalled of his meeting with Letterman. "I love to play organ, so I wanted a  band that would be based around the organ . . . a lot of soul music."  </P> <P> To drive home his point, Shaffer told Letterman, "I want the band patterned  after a group in this topless bar I knew in Toronto."  </P> <P> For Letterman -- the man who'd eventually keep millions up to watch Stupid Pet  Tricks -- it was an offer he couldn't refuse.  </P></p>

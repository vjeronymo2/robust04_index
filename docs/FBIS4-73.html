			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by South African Police Commissioner </F> General Johan van der Merwe in Pretoria on 30 March on the SAPA  PR Wire Service]    [Text] As result of media enquiries I wish to issue the  following statement:    I deny categorically that either the state president or the  minister of law and order in any way involved themselves in the  execution of a warrant which was issued for the purpose of  searching Shell House.    I personally held a discussion with Lt. Gen. Calitz,  regional  commissioner, Witwatersrand concerning the matter with the  understanding that he would inform Mr Mandela of the warrant and  attempt to obtain his cooperation in confiscating the weapons.  Lt. Gen. Calitz informed me that Mr Mandela had given him an  undertaking that the weapons would be handed over and therefore  it was not necessary to continue with this search.    The matter is being dealt with further by Lt. Gen. Calitz.</p>

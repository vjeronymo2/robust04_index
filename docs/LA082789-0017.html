			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE WORLD WENT BACK TO WAR;  </P> <P> ONLY ONE MAN WANTED TO IGNITE WORLD WAR II  </P> <P> The war that broke out on Sept. 1, 1939, was a war almost no one wanted. In  1914 cheering crowds had thronged the streets of every European capital as the  mobilization posters went up and the reservists marched to the railroad  stations garlanded with flowers. There were few flowers in 1939. Too many  wreaths had been laid on too many soldiers' graves in the years since the  Armistice for Europeans to accept the return of war with anything but dread and  foreboding.  </P> <P> Only one European really wanted war: Adolf Hitler. For him World War I had been  "the supreme experience," as he wrote in "Mein Kampf," and his political life  had been a struggle to win vengeance for the defeat Germany suffered in 1918.  He knew exactly who the victims of his vengeance were to be: the Jews, of  course, because their "international conspiracy" had been the cause of  Germany's defeat. But their ultimate fate was reserved for the future. In 1939  his immediate targets were the people of the East who had profited from  Germany's defeat, to found states on territory that had belonged to the German  or Austrian emperors -- the Poles and Czechs. He had finished the Czechs in  March, when half the country had been made a German "protectorate" and the  other half turned into a puppet state. By August he was determined to finish  the Poles -- at the price of war if necessary.  </P> <P> "Our enemies" -- he meant Britain and France -- "are small fry. I saw them at  Munich," he told his service chiefs at Berchtesgaden on Aug. 22. Yet that did  not mean he was prepared to risk invading Poland if the British and French  could bring Soviet Russia into a war against him. The British and French even  then had delegates in Moscow, seeking an anti-German alliance. Fortunately for  him, Britain and France could offer Josef Stalin nothing he wanted -- no direct  military aid, not even assurance that the Poles would let the Red Army into its  territory to confront the Wehrmacht.  </P> <P> Hitler, on the other hand, had much to offer the Russians -- a nonaggression  pact and, as a direct bribe, an agreement to carve up Eastern Europe after  Poland had been beaten. By the time he met his generals and admirals at  Berchtesgaden he knew the nonaggression pact was in the bag. Even as he spoke  in an atmosphere heavy with apprehension -- the German admirals were "deep in  gloom" at the prospect of confronting the Royal Navy -- he was awaiting word  from his foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, that the Russians were ready  to become active allies.  </P> <P> Von Ribbentrop had flown to Moscow on Aug. 23, was met at the airport by a band  playing the German national anthem under a display of swastika flags --  borrowed from a film studio where an anti-Nazi film had just been made. He was  then driven to a villa next to where British and French delegates were vainly  trying to persuade the Russians they were worthwhile allies. Shortly afterward  he found himself in Vyacheslav M. Molotov's office in the Kremlin. Stalin  entered. Von Ribbentrop was the first minister of a foreign government he had  ever met, and their talks were the first diplomatic negotiations he had ever  conducted. He nevertheless dominated discussions from the first moment.  </P> <P> Stalin struck out the effusive preamble to the treaty Von Ribbentrop had  written. "After six years of shoveling mountains of cow dung over each other,"  Prof. Donald Watt records (he also records that Stalin's language was "much  coarser" in the original), "they could not suddenly go public with this kind of  profession of eternal friendship." That settled, Von Ribbentrop laid down the  secret terms. Poland was to be cut in half, Germany to have the west, Russia  the east. Stalin insisted on having Latvia as well as Estonia, and a free hand  toward Finland (which he would invade the coming November). Finally, he  announced that he wanted the Bessarabian province of Romania. Hitler, by  telephone, agreed to everything. In the early morning, Aug. 24, the pact was  signed, to come into effect immediately. Toasts were drunk -- by Von Ribbentrop  to Stalin, by Stalin to the absent Hitler. The first shots of World War II were  as good as fired.  </P> <P> They were actually fired a week later -- not in battle but in an act of murder.  Hitler had got his preconditions for war in Moscow. What he then needed was a  pretext. Since the Poles were unlikely to attack him, he decided to manufacture  one. At Gleiwitz in German Silesia, just across the border from Poland, the  German post office operated a radio transmitter beaming anti-Polish broadcasts  across the frontier. Hitler's SS had decided that a simulated Polish attack on  the transmitter would persuade the world press that an act of aggression had  taken place.  </P> <P> On Aug. 30, SS men arrested a local resident, Franz Honiok, 41, an  agricultural-machinery salesman who had a record of sympathizing with Poland --  not uncommon in a border area where nationalities intermingled. On Aug. 31 an  SS doctor gave him an anesthetic injection; he was then taken to the Gleiwitz  transmitter and shot dead, his body left on the ground as evidence of a Polish  raid. Two other corpses were dumped nearby. Never identified, they are believed  to have been those of inmates of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.  </P> <P> Next morning, after news of the Gleiwitz incident had been made public, the  Wehrmacht crossed the Polish frontier on three broad fronts of attack and  headed for Warsaw. The Poles were ready, but no amount of preparation could  equip them to stay the German advance. The Germans went to war with 60  divisions of troops, 2,500 tanks, 2,000 aircraft. Poland's 500 obsolete  aircraft were almost destroyed the first day, often on the ground. Its 30  divisions of soldiers were old-fashioned marching infantry. Poland had almost  no tanks at all. Though it is not true that it sent cavalry to charge tanks,  its best troops were indeed cavalry and the Polish cavalry did charge to death  against overwhelming German firepower.  </P> <P> The Poles managed to make one stand outside Warsaw, on the little River Bzura  on Sept. 10. By Sept. 17, when the Red Army appeared at their rear, the Polish  army had been beaten. Its remnants went on fighting bravely until Oct. 6 --  almost as long as the British and French the following year in the Battle of  France. Then they accepted surrender -- the prelude to five years of occupation  that would leave one-sixth of the population dead.  </P> <P> I visited Gleiwitz -- part of Poland now, as a result of the Yalta agreement --  last month. The radio transmitter is still there; so is the building where  Honiok's body was dumped. I visited the banks of the Bzura, talked to villagers  making hay in the water meadows and saw the overgrown graveyard where the  German dead of battle are buried. And I visited the shrine of the Black Madonna  at Czestochowa where, amid all the other symbols of Poland's national survival,  they commemorate warriors who did not give up fighting in 1939 -- those who  found a way to die as pilots in the Battle of Britain, as sailors in the Battle  of the Atlantic, as tankers in Normandy, as paratroopers at Arnhem, above all  as infantrymen on the slopes of Monte Cassino in Italy -- today almost as  important a shrine to Poles as Czestochowa itself.  </P> <P> I remember Poles in England from my wartime childhood, fighter pilots from a  nearby air base. Clearly enough, too, I remember the outbreak of war in 1939.  Like the Poles, we had been prepared. The previous year there had been the  evacuation because of the Munich crisis, which for children meant being bundled  up without warning and deposited with strangers in the countryside, safe from  the bombing which was expected on London. In between there had been other  excitements -- the raising of the barrage balloon at the bottom of our London  garden, tests of air-raid sirens, a warbling for the approach of bombers, a  level note for the "all clear" and the issue of gas masks.  </P> <P> What my mother, with two infants and a baby in arms, can have thought as she  fitted the rubber pig-snouts round those young faces defies imagination. We  loved it. Gas masks were fun. Air-raid sirens were fun. Even barrage balloons,  though they made my younger sister cry, I thought fun. Indeed I thought the  whole war fun, from begining to end. I particularly enjoyed the begining. There  was a real evacuation, not just the short-lived practice of Munich. We went to  the West Country, far from London, to a new house, to new schools. We saw  entirely new things, all of them entirely more interesting than anything that  went on in our London streets. In the summer of 1939, when Poles and Germans  were fighting each other in hayfields beside the Bzura, I was learning to help  a farmer make hay in the meadow behind our new house, following a horse-drawn  hayrack and looking forward to supper of farm-fresh eggs and clotted cream.  Polish families had already begun to tighten belts, as a preliminary to a  starvation winter. I remember no winter at all of 1939, or of any of the six  years the war lasted. We were happy, well-fed and safe in our country refuge.  That it could be different anywhere else I had no inkling.  </P> <P> Today, of course, I know otherwise. My visit to Poland last month took me not  only to Gleiwitz, Czestochowa and the Bzura but to Auschwitz. It took me to  Warsaw, to the rebuilt Old City destroyed block by block by the Germans during  the uprising of 1944, when a quarter-million Poles died among the ruins. It  took me to East Berlin, to the remains of the Reichstag and Hitler's  chancellery, where his will determined that Europe should undergo the agony of  a Second World War. On Sept. 3, 1939, the day Britain honored its guarantee to  Poland and declared war, British aircraft scattered 6 million leaflets over  Germany; they read, "Your rulers have condemned you to the massacres,  privations and miseries of a war they cannot win."  </P> <P> Hitler must have sneered. How little can those who wrote the words have guessed  how exactly they had predicted the consequences. By the time the war was over,  7 million Germans would be dead, their country occupied and divided, their  capital lost and every one of their great cities burnt out to the heart.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Yurlov, editor of the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA </F> economics department: "The One who Pays is the One who is for  the Market"]    [Text] "If any sector exists which should prosper in  Russia it is power engineering,"--the well-known political  analyst of the Russian economy, John Guardino, exclaimed  recently. Unlike many of our compatriots who have been taken  prisoner of the populist criticism of Russia's fuel and energy  complex, supposedly guilty of all the defects of the transition  period, J. Guardino knows the subject of his research  thoroughly. And we ourselves know it. But to be sure one wants  very much to find a specific culprit for all misfortunes among  those at the helm. Let's recall how many indignant attacks were  made against just the miners alone, that it cost them to demand  that the government settle up with them regarding debts...    Let's recall that as regards energy-bearing resources,  Russia  is in a natural preeminent position in comparison with all the  rest of the world. For example, we have more than 40 percent of  the world's reserves of natural gas and coal and 20 percent of  the oil. And what is more, the exportation of energy-bearing  resources is a natural very important source of Russia's hard  currency revenues. We export about 40 percent of the energy  products produced, which constitutes almost half of all currency  earnings.    It would seem that given such a situation the fuel and  energy  complex should be the most prosperous sector of the Russian  economy. In fact it is the sector with the most problems. The  production of oil and coal is dropping every year. According to  the forecasts of the specialists of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Fuel and Energy, if such a trend is maintained then  the country may turn into an importer of oil by 1995. It is  difficult today to even imagine the consequences of such a  situation. One can assume with a large share of probability that  it will be simply impossible to carry out any reforms whatsoever  under such conditions.    At a pre-New Year meeting of the leaders of the most  important enterprises of the fuel and energy complex the  incorrect system of price formation was named as the chief cause  of the sector's decline. Let's recall that the central  government of Russia set the prices for almost 90 percent of all  goods and services free in January 1992. However, it retained  control of the prices for energy products. In fact fuel and  energy rose in price more than 80 times that year by  "administrative order." However, in spite of that the prices for  coal, oil, and other domestic energy products remain far lower  than the normal market level. They come to approximately 40  percent in comparison with international prices. Partially this  is related to the sharp fall in the value of the ruble when the  rubles in circulation were used for the payment of compensations  when the prices for energy products in Russia increased.    However, regardless of how much they have grown,  administratively increased prices cannot be comparable with free  market prices. Although it is clear that properly free prices,  or the opportunity to set them, naturally will lead to an  increase in the price of energy products on the domestic market.  Terrible? Of course. However, as Yuriy Shafranik, Minister of  Fuel and Energy, has cleverly observed concerning debtors "the  one who pays is the one who is for reform. And the one who  doesn't pay--although he shouts, he is not for reform. And no  litmus papers whatever in the form of the LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party], PDP [not further identified] and any PRES  [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] are needed here."    Of course, control over prices has substantially reduced the  cost of energy for the Russians. But as a result we are using it  carelessly and not at all as efficiently as the majority of the  world's population. And here you can't do without strong  economic levers.    And, finally, a last consideration. An economy, all of whose  sectors have been switched to market rails while power  engineering, that locomotive of the entire economy, remains in  administrative rods of iron, cannot in fact develop normally.  There is no choice here. The rules of the game must be the same  for all. Otherwise misfortune.    This is only a small portion of the problems which were  discussed at the meeting of the leaders of the fuel and energy  complex. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA intends to watch the course of the  reform in this leading branch of the country's economy very  carefully. And already in the next few issues we will grant the  floor to the most authoritative specialists and experts in this  field.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Observer: Lerner's lessons Who is behind MBNA, the major American bank which hit the headlines last week by getting a Pounds 7m grant out of the DTI to build a Pounds 43m headquarters in Chester? Whoever it was must have spun a good yarn to get that sort of treatment. The DTI and the Department of Employment could not elaborate on the brief press release, and even the Bank of England admitted that MBNA had only got its banking licence a few days before the announcement. However, it sounds like a bank in a hurry, judging by the career of Alfred Lerner, its 60-year-old chairman. Lerner is one of those irrepressible sorts who just won't let a little mishap get him down. Having made his first fortune in real estate, his second career as an investor in bank stocks seemed in danger of coming unstuck when he sunk Dollars 158m into the Baltimore-based bank MNC, parent of Maryland National which had run into problems with dodgy property loans. Lerner even disappeared briefly from the Forbes list of the richest people in the US. But not for long. In order to rescue MNC from its financial problems, Lerner helped spin-off its successful credit card operations as MBNA in 1991, and has never looked back. He earned Dollars 139m last year, according to Financial World magazine's annual survey of Wall Street pay.</p>

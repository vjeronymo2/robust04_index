			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg There were two gratifying aspects to SG Warburg's results. The underlying level of dealing profits appears quite strong in spite of February's particularly sticky patch in the gilts market, while fee income has forged ahead. Warburg's business will always have a cyclical element, but the case that it is also enjoying long-term structural growth starts to look more plausible as its international reach grows. In the short run much depends on whether market conditions sustain the large volume of corporate business that is evidently in the pipeline. Even so the shares do not look expensive. Stripping out Warburg's Mercury Asset Management stake leaves investment banking with a market value of Pounds 730m. That is not much for a business which generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 187m last year.</p>

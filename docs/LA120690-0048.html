			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> AIDS Show Will Air: The AIDS episode of "Lifestories" that NBC had been  reluctant to air will finally be shown Dec. 18 at 10 p.m., the network said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The program, which deals frankly with AIDS, gay men and television's fears of  dealing with the disease, had previously been scheduled to air on Dec. 2 in the  series' regular early evening time slot. But the network yanked it, saying the  subject matter was inappropriate for an 8 p.m. broadcast. Production on  "Lifestories" itself has been shut down because of low ratings. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Under starter's orders CALIFORNIA: for governor, Pete Wilson against Kathleen Brown. If Mr Wilson, the Republican incumbent, wins re-election convincingly, an improbable prospect as the year began, he would become a huge national political force  -to the point, some serious pundits believe, of becoming the instant favourite for the party's presidential nomination in 1996. A 'new face, west-east' ticket pairing him with Christie Whitman, the popular tax-cutting governor of New Jersey, has many Republicans salivating - though not the religious right because both are pro-choice on abortion. If Ms Brown, the state treasurer from California's most illustrious political family (daughter of Governor 'Pat', sister of Governor Jerry), revives her faltering campaign and triumphs, she, too, would assume great national significance, if not for 1996 then certainly for the millennial election. Mr Wilson is benefiting from a state economy finally in recovery and he has taken a tougher line than Ms Brown against illegal immigration and on crime. But he could end up as 1994's Jim Florio, the New Jersey governor who also appeared to have risen from pits of unpopularity last year only to be beaten at the wire by Ms Whitman. For the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent and former mayor of San Francisco, against Congressman Michael Huffington, the transplanted Texas oil heir married to the ambitious former Ms Arianna Stassinopoulos, who makes Hillary Clinton look positively retiring. No race anywhere will be more expensive and Mr Huffington will probably more than double the Dollars 10m he spent in 1992 to win his House seat. Lavish campaign advertising has narrowed Ms Feinstein's lead appreciably, but both Mr Huffington and his wife are now facing much media scrutiny and some derision. NEW YORK: for governor, Mario Cuomo, the Democrat going for a fourth term, against George Pataki, hitherto obscure Republican state legislator. The state may be getting bored with its prince of the Hudson, who keeps declining offers to move to Washington. A Cuomo loss would be devastating to liberal Democrats nationally. VIRGINIA: for the Senate, the joke is that the state would rather vote for none of the four candidates. Two independents muddy the 'character' war between Chuck Robb, the incumbent, two-term senator whose confessed extramarital sex life has left him open to criticism, and Ollie North. Doug Wilder, former Democratic governor, is running because he cannot abide Mr Robb, and Marshall Coleman, the Republican, wants to stop Mr North. Neither will win, but how they do may decide the outcome. The North advantage is that at least his fanatical core support is solid, especially from the religious right, now a real power in Virginia. The Robb edge lies in the populous Washington suburbs which hoped they had seen the last of North. TEXAS and FLORIDA: noteworthy because two sons of former president George Bush are Republican candidates. George W. Jr takes on the salty Ann Richards in Texas, while Jeb has a chance of handing Lawton Chiles his first ever defeat in a Florida election.</p>

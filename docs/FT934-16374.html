			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Survey of Cable TV and Satellite Broadcasting (3): The film that can erase itself For years Mr William Graven has been working away at his concept of an electronic video store through his company EMC3 - Entertainment Made Convenient 3. The idea is that the viewer orders a feature film from a library by using a free telephone number and the film is squirted down to the consumer in a five-minute digitally compressed burst to a specially adapted video recorder. The recording can be watched twice but erases itself on its second play. Mr Graven says he already has reached agreement with a number of Japanese consumer electronics companies to manufacture the new video recorder and believes his dream of creating an international electronic video store which never runs out of even the most popular films is now not far off. New video recorders with the EMC function are expected to become available by November 1994 and would cost around Dollars 500 although the cost could drop to Dollars 350 in mass production. Research carried out in Japan showed that consumers understood the concept of video-on-demand and said they preferred it to the existing subscription channels. While video-on-demand is likely to be one of the big themes of the next few years, and a possible financial driving force for the introduction of digital compression technology into the home, another will be the way US media companies are determined to drive their films and programmes around the world using all available and emerging technologies. Soon hardly anywhere on earth will be entirely safe from at least the potential of tuning in to cheerful American voices revealing the latest news or introducing the oldest films. Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network and CNN Inter- national proudly boasts that it is already on 12 satellites around the world, soon to be 13, and that only some parts of Greenland and Antarctica are still deprived of 24-hours-a-day television news. Mr Turner may have been the first to take his channel international, followed by Viacom's MTV, but more US channels are now trying to break out of the large but increasingly saturated American market and a number of significant US media companies are buying into regional satellite channels or investing in the setting up of new channels. There are also growing moves to create integrated media businesses that create film and television programmes in Hollywood and distribute them through everything from video to satellite and cable around the world. Increasingly, the name of the game is the creation and exploitation of intellectual property rights, and the more universal the appeal the better. One of the most recent examples of the drive towards integration was Mr Turner's purchase in August of two independent Hollywood production companies, New Line and Castle Rock, in a deal worth Dollars 672m. 'I had to (buy into Hollywood). No question. I have more than 3,000 old movies (from the MGM library) and no new movies except television movies. If you are going to be a big player you have got to have the product,' says Mr Turner who began transmitting two of his channels, TNT, based on old films and some sport and the Cartoon Network to Europe in the form of a single 24-hours a day channel. The integrated channel schedules cartoons during the day and films at night. Mr Turner did not quite get the welcome he might have expected in Europe. Although the UK gave the channel a licence, which ought to have given it clearance throughout Europe under existing conventions and directives, both the French and Belgian governments blocked its entry to their cable networks because it did not have enough European content. As Belgium is virtually completely cabled, it was a serious blow to the channel. According to the EC Television Without Frontiers directive, which came into force two years ago, satellite channels should have majority EC content where practicable. And although it is difficult to see how a film channel could be run without a considerable proportion of Hollywood movies, even an old movie channel, attitudes on the issue of American 'cultural imperialism' appear to be hardening. The UK, which has traditionally taken a rather laissez-faire approach to the issue of European content, although much less so to issues of eroticism or pornography beamed in by satellite, is starting to take a firmer line on content. Mr Peter Brooke, secretary of state for National Heritage, told the Royal Television Society's Cambridge convention last month that maybe it was time for Sky One, the general entertainment channel that has just recently been scrambled and included in the Sky Multi-Channel subscription package, to start thinking about including more UK-made programmes. The channel relies heavily on programmes bought in Los Angeles. Mr Sumner Redstone, the Viacom chairman, has not yet seemed to run into cultural resistance to his channels. He also plans to take Viacom channels - Nickelodeon, the children's channel and Nick-at-Nite and VH-1 around the world. He has a vision of an international children's channel, created with local partners that would give 'a chance of an international lobby for the kind of world we want to live in'. Nickelodeon has already arrived in the UK, with Nick- at-Nite and VH-1 following early next year. Mr Rupert Murdoch has also recently been spelling out his international ambitions, linked with the Dollars 525m purchase of Star TV and with it potential entrance to the Asian television market. 'It's a global dream that you never quite dared have, and suddenly it's there,' he says. The global dream is not universally shared in the region. The Malaysian government has already expressed reservations about Mr Murdoch's intentions. Partly maybe to answer such criticisms, Mr Murdoch is planning to create separate Star services for India and China, and possibly a third Star at a later stage for the 200m people of Indonesia to reflect, at least partly, the enormous cultural and linguistic differences that are involved. The News Corporation chairman makes no bones about wanting to take his UK channels, such as Sky Sport, around the world. 'We will also take Sky News around the world. There will be a parallel international service and Sky News as we know it today will be for Britain and Europe,' Mr Murdoch says, adding that he plans to work with local partners for the international service in different parts of the world. 'Maybe Kerry Packer in Australia,' he muses. An increasingly tense battle is now likely between international television news organisations. The well- entrenched CNN, already facing growing opposition from BBC World Service Television, is likely also to come up against competition from Mr Murdoch's Sky News. However, Mr Ted Turner of CNN is irritated at all the publicity that Mr Murdoch has had for his international news plans, which tend to put in the shade the fact that CNN is already there and has already done what Mr Murdoch is only hoping to do. Mr Murdoch in turn has long had the ambition to bring to the occupants of hotel rooms around the world news that is less obviously American than CNN - or at least less American than CNN used to be before CNN International was developed. Independent Television News of the UK is not yet a contender in the international television news battle but would like to become a player. Reuters, the international news and financial information group, now an ITN shareholder alongside Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications, is making no secret of its television ambitions. Given Reuters' expertise in business and financial reporting some sort of television business channel might make sense. The latest American arrival on the European media scene is NBC, the US network which runs cable channels in the US including a business news channel, and which has been looking at the pan-European market for some time. NBC has bought a 75 per cent stake in SuperChannel the general entertainment satellite channel which has access to around 60m cable television homes in western and eastern Europe. The deal is believed to be worth around Pounds 40m. Set up originally by a consortium of ITV companies, apart from Thames Television which declined to take part, the channel made significant losses until it was sold to the Marcucci family of Italy with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group retaining a minority stake for only Pounds 9 and the assumption of around Pounds 2.5m in debt. So far nearly Pounds 25m has been invested in the channel which has specialised in niche programming because it could not afford the big new movies or top exclusive sports events. As the Marcucci family move on to specialise in inter- national television production, the resources of NBC, both in programming and finance, could make all the difference to the outlook for SuperChannel. Time Warner has also been trying to maximise revenues from its programme library by taking its Home Box Office around the world. There have been pay-television joint ventures in Venezuela, Hungary, New Zealand and Scandinavia and through HBO Ole, the first Spanish-speaking movie and entertainment service available to all of Spanish-speaking Latin America and the Caribbean. Other US investors in the UK include Cox, the Atlanta-based media company, which has taken stakes in two new sat- ellite channels, UK Gold, based on the libraries of the BBC and Thames Television and UK Living, a channel devoted to women's interests. Inter- national Family Entertain- ment, a company linked with American television evangelist Pat Robertson, has bought TVS, the ITV company that lost its south of England franchise and brought The Family Channel, its successful American cable channel, to the UK. The strongest European opposition to growing American dominance of the international television news airwaves is coming from BBC World Service Television, which was finally launched two years ago after long delays. The British govern- ment, which funds BBC World Service Radio, refused to contribute any money to set up the service and forbade the BBC from using licence fee money to fund it. In the end, a modest sum was found from the sale of subscriptions in Europe for an existing BBC general entertainment channel to get World Service Television under way. Because of shortage of funds, Mr Chris Irwin, its chief executive, has had to proceed via a series of self-financing joint ventures. The service is now available in Africa and on cable networks in Canada. Next spring it will launch in Japan in a 10-year deal worth Pounds 150m, and there are hopes of getting into the US market. But perhaps the greatest impact that BBC World Service Television has had so far is in Asia, where it is delivered from London to 38 countries as one of five channels, including MTV, on the Star satellite system. In India alone, World Service Television has more than 13m regular viewers, according to independent research earlier this year. Indians are able to watch the BBC 6 O'Clock News live in the evening and Newsnight, the BBC evening current affairs programme, is shown the next morning. The BBC has recently signed a deal with Intelsat to use digital compression to help add the US and Latin American to its existing markets. Mr Tom Johnson, president of CNN, recognises that BBC World Service Television is very professional and represents growing compet- ition. However, he cites its lack of finance as one obvious weakness. In 1992 CNN in all its forms had total revenues of Dollars 535.6m and made operating profits of Dollars 150m. The Murdoch purchase of control of Star has caused uncertainty over the future of BBC World Service Television in Asia but Mr Murdoch has stated unambiguously that he will honour the BBC's 10-year contract with Star. It probably makes good business sense for him to do so because the BBC name is well regarded, partic- ularly in India, and the service is believed to bring in a signif- icant proportion of the advert- ising revenues of the Star system. In all this brave new world, the UK is playing a key role, not because of the size of the market but because of the number of things going on there. To a considerable extent North American media and telephone companies view the UK as a laboratory whose results merit careful study. It is the only place in the world where telecommun- ications deregulation has gone so far as to allow cable com- panies to offer a full range of telephone services in compet- ition to the PTT. As a result, most of the regional Bell operating companies from the US have piled into the UK cable market, partly because they see a good business opportunity but also to learn about cable in the hope that a similar pattern of deregulation is not far off in the US. At the moment, US telephone companies cannot run cable television franchises in their own telephone operating areas although they can buy systems elsewhere in the US. The issue is heading for the US legal system. Bell Atlantic recently won a local ruling in Alexandria, Virginia, allowing it to start up a cable system there in competition with Jones, a large cable operator, a decision that is being appealed against. The other interesting factor about the UK is the scale of the satellite subscription business that has been built up by BSkyB. Mr Murdoch, who owns 50 per cent, quite simply describes it as the leading satellite company in the world and points to an important lesson learned in the UK which is influencing his decision- making in other parts of the world such as Asia. 'There is no question we have shown here (in the UK) that first in gets the market,' he says. Canal Plus, the French pay television company is probably still bigger, but it enjoys one enormous advantage - control over conventional television frequencies so that it can broadcast over normal land-based transmitters. On the face of it, cable television's performance in the UK would give snails and tortoises a good reputation. After 10 years of effort, according to the latest official figures to the beginning of July, only 658,884 homes were connected to any form of cable and that involves a broad definition including blocks of flats connected to an antenna and old-fashioned television relay systems upgraded to carry at least a basic selection of the new satellite channels. The total for the modern broadband or multi-channel systems was 473,415 although the symbolic 500,000 figures was expected to be passed sometime this month. When it comes to broadband homes offering the full range of cable programme services, the total number takes on an even more pessimistic hue compared with the number of homes in the UK which could subscribe if they wanted to. That total by July 1 stood at 2,327,257, which meant that precisely 1,853,842 householders whose homes are passed by a cable network have decided not to subscribe so far. This gives a disappointing penetration rate  -the ratio of those subscribing to those who could subscribe - of 20.3 per cent. Indeed, the official quarterly bulletin from the Independent Television Commission carries the headline: 'Cable Growth Slows In 1993'. The report begins: 'The increase in the number of broadband cable subscribers slowed down in the first half of 1993, apparently as recessionary factors generated higher rates of disconnection.' This meant that although there was a net increase in subscribers in the first six months of 1993 of 33,000 because of faster rates of building cable networks, the average take-up rate dropped to levels last seen in early 1992. And all this has been happening at a time when Sky Television has been dominating the headlines with its 18-channel package and more on the way. At Pounds 19.99 a month, including three movie channels and a sports channel, it appears superficially, at least, to be so much better value than cable. Quite apart from the aesthetics of having a dish on the wall, whether flat, see-through or not, this illusion is at least partly created because satellite viewers have to buy or rent the receiving equipment. With cable, it is all included. Although the difference may be more apparent than real, it does not make cable's marketing task any easier. Against such a background, why are a growing number of big banks getting excited about backing cable while their lack of interest in earlier years blocked the development of cable? Why does Mr Richard Woollam of the CTA find his lunch diary clogged with engagements to expound on the newly discovered virtues of cable? The change can partly be explained in two words - cable telephony. Cable television as a business selling just more television channels always seemed like a long haul in the UK, where unlike the early days of the industry in the US good quality television signals carrying good quality programmes from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are almost universally available. But add telephone services and the economics are transformed. 'We are not a cable TV business. We are an entertainment and information and communications business,' says Mr Michael Turner, chairman of the CTA and chief executive of Southwestern Bell International, whose franchises cover a total of 1.14m homes in the midlands and north-west of England. The number of cable telephone subscribers is still small - around 200,000 - but the rate of increase and the effect on the revenues of cable operators are quite dramatic. Three years ago Mercury Communications supplied 200 telephone lines a month to the cable industry and revenues were in hundreds of thousands of pounds. The rate is now running at more than 20,000 lines a month and between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m is expected to be generated at the retail level this year. By the end of September just under 250,000 telephone lines had been handed over to cable franchises, though not all of these are yet in use. There are now 32 cable franchises in the UK offering telephone services, compared with 17 a year ago and many operators are installing their own switches. In August Mercury announced marketing and operations agreements with the largest cable operators, including Encom, General Cable, Nynex, CableComms, Southwestern Bell, TeleWest Communications and Videotron. Nynex, with franchises in the Brighton, Poole and Worthing areas, is providing telephone links for public services in the region. 'We have tied together Hampshire police stations and we are working on ambulance stations and other things,' says Mr Peter Lynch, marketing director of Nynex, the telephone company for New York and New England. Mr Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable, with interests in more than 1m homes under franchise including Aylesbury and Leeds, is very clear about the benefits of telephone services. 'We thought this year that 40 per cent of our revenues would come from telephony and 60 per cent from cable. We have just passed through where it's 50-50 and we are fast heading for 60-40 the other way around. To double your revenue on a margin additional cost (to install telephony) is phenomenal,' he says. The joint cable television/telephony package is much easier to sell than cable TV alone, Mr Bates emphasises. The English middle classes, he believes, habitually lie about what they watch on television and find it difficult to buy anything so vulgar as cable. But discounts of up to 20 per cent are something they understand, even though there is the inconvenience for domestic subscribers of changing their number. 'Then they say we'll take cable for the children,' laughs Mr Bates. The spread of telephone services on cable network will increasingly pose competition for BT, which the national operator will find it difficult to meet. The cable operators are local and geographically dispersed and each individual network can offer different packages of discounts, including free local calls in some areas. A BT price cut to tackle small cable discounters in a few hundred thousand homes would have to be offered nationally, costing the company millions of pounds. The emerging importance of telecommunications has led to a measure of consolidation in the industry as the well-funded American phone companies, which like to boast that they understand all about 'burying loads of money in a hole in the ground', have been buying up franchises that come on the market. For example, in March Nynex bought three franchises in Greater Manchester, Bolton and Derby that were previously held by Pacific Telesis, which decided to concentrate its investment thrust on mobile communications and began to withdraw from the UK cable market. More recently TeleWest, the joint venture between Mr Malone's TCI and Bell West became the largest cable operator in the UK when it bought seven Scottish cable franchises owned by Post-Newsweek Cable. Up and down the country, a rough pattern is beginning to emerge in cable sales: that of every 100 sales the cable industry makes, 70 people will take the combined television and telephone service, 20 people cable television only and 10 people telephone only. They are percentages that certainly impressed Mr Bates's bankers recently to enable him to negotiate what was seen as a landmark financing deal for cable. NatWest Markets, the corporate finance arm of National Westminster Bank, arranged a Pounds 152.5m financing for the 'construction and operation of a cable television and telecommunications franchise' in Leeds. The money is made up of Pounds 77.5m in equity and Pounds 75m in non-recourse finance. It is the first 'fully-funded' cable deal concluded before construction actually begins, although of course performance thresholds are built in. Five UK investors are involved including Cable &amp; Wireless, the parent of Mercury Communications, although most of the money came from US investors such as Capital Cities/ABC and Paine Webber and the debt was underwritten by the Bank of Nova Scotia and other banks. Even bigger cable finance deals are in the pipeline. It is believed that Citibank is in the process of raising Pounds 250m for the UK cable franchises of Nynex. If the deal goes through, it could further improve the investment climate for cable, though the bankers will be watching carefully to see that their positive analysis on the prospects for cable works out in reality. Mr Michael Turner is not downhearted at the slowdown in cable subscribers. 'It's been a mixed year for cable, but if you look at the fundamentals of the business there has been record investment, record build. Yes, the penetration rate is coming down a bit. We're disappointed but not really concerned. We are convinced it will come back, that the market is going to buy the product,' the CTA chairman says. This year a total of Pounds 750m will be invested in the construction of cable networks in the UK, more than in any previous three- or four-year period. But what if the British people simply do not want multi-channel television or at least the programmes now being offered? Many of the big cable operators have carried out their own consumer research just to make sure that there is not an invisible, insuperable barrier. 'I don't think there is anything in the culture of the British people that says that over time they won't want multi-channel,' says Mr Bates. And even if adults, were to behave in that 'perverse' way, then the children will certainly understand cable and the choice it offers. Another straw in the wind is the fact that not all cable operators are performing so very modestly. In Birmingham, for instance, the penetration rate is running at 33.5 per cent - and anything over 30 per cent, bankers say, is definitely a business because of the cash flows generated. If only the rest could lift their game to the Birmingham level, cable enthusiasts say. To Mr Turner the real challenge does not come from BSkyB but from the 75 per cent of the population who do not have multi-channel television of any kind. BSkyB itself has recently taken an enormous risk in moving towards a nearly total subscription package. The only BSkyB exception is the loss-making Sky News. On the day Sky Television was launched in February 1989, Mr Murdoch made it clear that other services apart from movies could be encrypted, or scrambled and charged for on a monthly basis. There is a large risk in charging for a service that has previously been 'free'. Last year Sky started to charge for its sports channel and this autumn Sky One disappeared from the gaze of those not prepared to pay. Mr Murdoch himself feared there could have been uproar at the decision to charge but, against all the odds, if anything the opposite has happened. Satellite dish sales started to rise after a period of slower growth. Partly this was the result of massive publicity and partly it was a response to carefully structured special deals and discounts. Perhaps above all else, the pill of having to pay was sugared by the arrival of new non-Murdoch channels in the package so that, at least by the beginning of next year, there will be a total of 18 channels under the Sky marketing banner at a total monthly cost to the consumer of Pounds 19.99. Twelve scrambled channels ranging from Discovery and The Family Channel to UK Gold, which draws on the programme libraries of the BBC and Thames Television and Country Music Television, are available in the Multi-Channel package for Pounds 6.99 a month - the equivalent of the basic tier of channels in the cable television package. Paradoxically, the simple subscription package may be easier to sell than the previous mixture, where some channels were only on subscription and others were free. 'People understand the subscription package. It's easier to sell,' says Mr Paul McMullan, of East Antrim Electricals, who has sold satellite equipment since the early days of Sky Television. The logic of the move to subscription is unassailable in financial terms, as long as Sky can retain most of its existing viewers and start to build again. As each new satellite channel becomes available the audience for the new media, as opposed to the traditional broadcasters, is further fragmented. The smaller the audience, however good the targeting or the demographics, the less significant that audience is for advertisers. Although there will inevitably will be elements of cross-over, the most obvious way to maximise the choice available to the public is for it to be funded by three separate streams of revenue - a licence fee, advertising and subscription. The new subscription revenues could transfer BSkyB's balance sheet, although the company will have to be sure that the subscribers are being given value for money and not progressively milked once they are 'hooked' on the extra choice. Viewers have been persuaded to pay a monthly subscription for a sports channel that used to be free, largely as a result of the exclusive Pounds 305m deal to show live premier league games. But if Sky were to take some of the best games out of the existing package and charge an additional pay-per-view fee, that might turn out to be a step too far for many of their customers. Sky has said it will launch a pay-per-view service next year, possibly at the same time as a second sports channel begins broadcasting although little has been said about what sort of events will be offered on the pay-per-view menu. BSkyB has made considerable financial progress in the past two years, and at least at the operational level, is now making more than Pounds 2m a week although there is still a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 70m a year when notional interest payments on the Pounds 1.7bn invested in the project are included. Next year, the money will start to flow back to the owners of the consortium who have so far not actually paid each other the interest on their loans to the venture. Apart from News Corporation and Pearson, the main investors are the Granada Group and Chargeurs of France. Compared with the enormous losses of the past, the figures that Mr Richard Brooke, BSkyB chief financial officer, announced for the year to June 1993 were remarkable. The operating profit of Pounds 61.5m represented a Pounds 108m turnaround on the previous year and turnover was up by 63 per cent to Pounds 380m - 80 per cent of it coming from subscription revenue. In addition, the satellite consortium had needed no new funding from shareholders since May 1992 and Pounds 34m of available funding had not had to be drawn down. It seemed like a turning point of some significance and, executives promised, the improving trends were continuing into the current financial year. Mr Gary Davey, the BSkyB deputy managing director, pointed out last month that 100,000 new movie channel subscriptions had been signed up in August alone, taking the total of movie subscriptions past 2m for the first time. BSkyB is facing a growing problem of pirate subscription cards. News Corporation's VideoCrypt system, based on a microchip embedded in a cards rather like a telephone card which 'unlocks' the scrambled pictures, was claimed to be pirate-proof. In fact, pirate cards are being openly advertised and sold in Scandinavia and Germany, and the trend is starting to spread to the UK. One company in England is already offering pirate cards for sale at Pounds 200 in what amounts to an unofficial subscription service of its own. If BSkyB changes the codes in the chip, the company offers to provide a replacement for an additional fee of Pounds 30. Like many transactions involving intellectual property, it is apparently not illegal to offer such cards for sale although it is illegal for consumers to use them. If the number of pirate cards in circulation were ever to become substantial, it would damage BSkyB in two signif- icant ways. In the UK piracy would simply mean the loss of revenue or potential revenue but in continental Europe the problem could be even more significant. The satellite company buys only the UK subscription rights to Holly- wood films which are sold by the studios on a country-by- country basis. The agreements with BSkyB are conditional on the films not being available all over Europe. Widespread piracy, unless tackled, could call vital film contracts into question. Overall, BSkyB was in more than 3.5m homes by the begin- ning of September including 2.57m homes with satellite dishes, according to BARB. Yet although the new channels are available in more than 15 per cent of UK homes, it has to be emphasised that their performance in terms of audiences and ratings has been modest. It is a rare satellite programme that has been able to assemble an audience of 1m and few apart from The Simpsons have achieved it. Despite the rapid growth in the number of channels avail- able, the new media still account for less than a third of total viewing in homes which can receive satellite channels. This ratio looks like staying fairly constant, or only increasing slightly, as more channels are added. This suggests that satellite channels, at least at their present stage of development, will have to content them- selves with sharing a finite amount of viewing time and rely instead for growth in getting their services into an increasing number of homes. For instance, in March, before the latest burst of new channels on the Astra satellite such as Bravo, Discovery, Nickelodeon, the Family Channel, TNT/Cartoon Network and UK Living, the official BARB figures show that the non-terrestrial channels took 29.4 per cent of viewing in cable and satellite homes. For the week ending September 19 with the new channels on stream, the total satellite share from more than 15 channels had risen only to 31 per cent - virtually the same as that achieved by the BBC with its two channels in new media homes. It is, of course, early days for the new channels in the BSkyB package but according to BARB the average weekly viewing to Bravo in cable and satellite homes was 10 min- utes, one minute ahead of Nickelodeon, although the Children's Channel was more successful at 13 minutes. The Family Channel was watched for an average seven minutes and UK Living for five minutes. This compared with an average 7 hours 23 minutes for ITV and even 1 hour 38 minutes for Channel 4 in cable and satellite homes. Zenith Media, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's media buying arm, believes that by the year 2003 satellite's share of viewing in satellite homes will, at 32.3 per cent, have hardly moved at all. Increased penetration for cable and satellite will enable the new media channels to account for 17 per cent of total television in all homes by 2003 compared with their 1993 figure of 5.2 per cent. More competition could yet be on the way in the UK television market. All hopes of establishing a national Channel 5 have not yet been abandoned. Following the decision last December by the Independent Television Commission to reject the only bid from a consortium led by Thames Television, mainly on the grounds of inadequate shareholder commitment, the whole issue is being reviewed this autumn. The ITC has called for expressions of interest by October 15 in three options: A national channel capable of reaching 74 per cent of the population, very similar to the one originally advertised. A much more local city-based television service, a concept that would need legislation to implement. Use of the Channel 5 frequencies as part of an overall plan to introduce digital television. The ITC has made it clear that the UK could have as many as 100 television services if the existing four national channels were also to move to digital. In practice, the ITC concedes, at least 10 years' notice would have to be given before ending existing broadcasts in PAL and there would have to be 'simulcasting' - broadcasting the existing main channels in both PAL and digital. In most parts of the country this would still allow the introduction of new digital channels. There could be as many as 20 new channels in some areas although the number would be much fewer in the south and south-east, where the spectrum is relatively crowded. The ITV companies, still coming to terms with the effects of competitive tenders for their new franchises, are now debating what extra services could be offered to persuade consumers to buy the necessary decoders. There are also suggestions that the new digital television services could effectively be funded by giving over part of the spectrum to the running of a digital communication system for industry and finance. Despite the technological attractions of the endless choice being offered by digital, a number of serious players are still interested in running Channel 5 as a conventional television channel. The big advantage is that unlike most of the ITV companies, the channel would not have to pay a percentage of its advertising revenue to the government and a small bid - Thames offered the minimum Pounds 1,000 a year  -would be enough to win the franchise. The main disadvantage is that any successful applicant will have to pay for the retuning of millions of video recorders at present tuned in to the frequencies Channel 5 would use. Across Europe the new media, particularly cable, have been making considerable progress. According to the 11th annual study of the European cable industry by CIT Research, the market research group specialising in communications, at the beginning of this year 68m out of western Europe's 152m television households had either cable television or a communal system fed by a satellite dish. A total of 30m homes were connected to cable networks, up from 26m the previous year. About 40 per of Europe's cable homes are in Germany, where the Bundespost's Telekom division has been pursuing a vigorous building policy, with 30 per cent in the Low Countries and the rest elsewhere. CIT believes that western European viewers spent nearly Ecu4bn on cable television in 1992 including pay TV revenues - up 24 per cent on 1991. 'Given that Europe is still in the teeth of recession, the industry can congratulate itself,' CIT concludes. By June this year, 12.8m German households were connected to cable networks, most of them in the western Lander. There are also plans to spend DM55bn on improving telecommunications in the east, DM3.5bn of which will be devoted to cable. In France cable is at last beginning to grow steadily, although cable subscribers still account only for 5.5 per cent of the country's 20.6m television households, according to CIT. The sixth Pan-European Television Audience Research survey, published earlier this year, was based on viewing figures from cable homes in Flanders and five European countries: Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. It showed that the viewing of commercial channels transmitted by cable or satellite continued to expand at the expense of the state-owned and public service sector. The audience shares of channels funded wholly or in part by licence fee now ranges from 32.1 per cent in Flanders to 56.3 per cent in Denmark. In Germany, Europe's largest cable and satellite dish market, the public broadcasters achieved a 32.6 per cent share in new media homes, although this dropped to 25.5 per cent among the 16-34 age group. The choice available somewhere in Europe continues to grow with more than 100 services available over both cable and satellite, not all subscription based. Eurospsort continues to provide Europe-wide competition for the UK-based Sky Sports and Euronews, the multilingual news and information service backed by more than a dozen public service broadcasters, is increasing its reach after a difficult birth at the beginning of this year. By the end of August the channel was reaching 11m cable and communal dish homes and, with the help of rebroadcasting on conventional transmitters, was available in a total of 43m homes. One of the most interesting uses of satellite television is to provide special services for ethnic minorities all over Europe. There are programming segments for Japanese and Chinese minorities, while TV Asia, the Asian channel on the Astra satellite, has expanded to 18 hours a day with programmes ranging from Indian and Pakistani films to daily news coverage in five Asian languages. MBC, the Arabic language television station based in London, recently reached an agreement to co-operate with the Arab Network of America, the main Arabic language network of the US. There will be programme exchanges and joint productions. MBC - the Middle East Broadcasting Centre - was launched more than two years ago and broadcasts its service all over Europe, North Africa and the Arabian Gulf. Back at the former studios of TV-am Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV Europe, insists: 'We don't take ourselves too seriously. It's only entertainment after all.' He is right, of course, about the ultimate significance of the new media and the technological driving force behind it - except that the new international channels will have growing cultural influence and new media empires will be created as public service monopolies give way, at least in part, to an era of greater choice and intensified competition.</p>

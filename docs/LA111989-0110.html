			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN  </P> <P> Re Laguna Laurel: Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas was dead wrong when he  stated that the 7,000 to 8,000 protesters in Laguna Canyon on Nov. 11  "represent a narrow, single-issue group."  </P> <P> My husband and I, from Brea, walked with others from Newport Beach, Orange,  Huntington Beach, Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, Silverado and Trabuco Canyon. We,  and the thousands of other protesters, are not only concerned with keeping  Laguna Canyon free from tract housing but are also very concerned about rapid  overdevelopment throughout all of Orange County.  </P> <P> There are simply some places in Orange County that should be preserved in their  natural state: Laguna Canyon, Trabuco Canyon, Silverado and Modjeska Canyon, to  name but a few. Orange County does not need subdivisions in its canyons. Orange  County needs to preserve its heritage and some of its beautiful natural lands,  not only for us to enjoy, but for the plants and wildlife that were here before  us.  </P> <P> If Orange County residents want to continue to enjoy the quality of life this  area is known for, we must insist on responsible development: Save the Canyons!  </P> <P> LAURI AUNAN  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

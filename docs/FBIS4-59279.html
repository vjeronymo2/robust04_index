			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--Well-informed Jordanian sources say that the  Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall's recent visit to  Baghdad dealt with the issue of Jordanian nationals being held  in the Baghdad regime's jails. Official Jordanian circles  estimate the number of these convicted detainees, who were  charged with offenses ranging from illegal currency exchanges  and smuggling to espionage for a foreign state, at 200.    The Jordanian Government is trying to solve this problem by  reaching an understanding with the Iraqi authorities.    The sources also say that during his visit to Baghdad,  al-Tall reached an agreement with the Iraqi officials on  organizing a meeting between the interior ministers of the two  countries in order to tackle unsolved issues facing the  Jordanian nationals in Iraqi jails.</p>

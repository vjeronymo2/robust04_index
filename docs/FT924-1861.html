			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / US gives big debt relief to Salvador EL SALVADOR'S 12-year-old civil war was formally proclaimed over yesterday as the US announced it would forgive a large share of the country's debts, write Damian Fraser in Mexico City and George Graham in Washington. Vice-President Dan Quayle announced the debt relief yesterday in El Salvador at the official celebration of national reconciliation, which followed final demobilisation of the former rebel army on Monday. The US will forgive a total of Dollars 464m, representing 80 per cent of outstanding food credits and 70 per cent of development assistance credits. Interest on the rest will be payable in local currency for environmental or child-care programmes. The forgiveness amounts to more than 20 per cent of total foreign debt of around Dollars 2.2bn, and will save an estimated Dollars 25m a year in debt service. Under January's peace accord, the FMLN rebels agreed to demobilise by the end of October, but this was extended to December 15 after disputes about land distribution and army reform. From yesterday, the FMLN has become a legal civilian political party, ready to compete in the 1994 presidential elections. The US Treasury announced smaller debt forgiveness packages for Chile, Uruguay and Colombia.</p>

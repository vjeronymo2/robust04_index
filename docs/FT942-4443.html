			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Sao Paulo blows whistle early for the World Cup The adage that football comes before business in Brazil was proven again yesterday when the Sao Paulo stock exchange announced changes to trading hours during the World Cup. On the three days later this month when Brazil is playing, the exchange will sacrifice its lunch break in order to stop work two hours earlier than normal, at 2.30pm local time. 'Since the games start at 5pm, people will have time to finish their duties and still watch the matches,' said Mr Flavio Guimaraes, exchange spokesman. About 100 of the exchange's 500 staff will remain on duty during the games to man vital services. Stockbroking firms are expected to follow the exchange's lead and allow workers to stop work early. Football, Brazil's national passion, often interrupts commerce but it is the first time for 20 years that the exchange has altered its trading routine to accommodate it. If the team progresses to the later rounds, the exchange may extend the idea. According to one broker, the closer Brazil gets to the final, the less chance there is of persuading people to remain at work.</p>

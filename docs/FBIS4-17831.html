			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant will not be closed  down within the next few years, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov.    He said at a meeting with the plant staff on Tuesday that  today's campaign for the closure of the plant pursued "above all  political" aims.    However, the Ukrainian leadership "shares the concern of the  world community over the future of the Chernobyl plant" and  regards the construction of a reliable shelter above Chernobyl's  generating unit no. Four and the commissioning of six new units  at other nuclear plants as priority goals, Shmarov said.    He said it would be a firm government policy to increase the  role of nuclear plants in the country's power industry.    Today Ukraine's nuclear plants generate a little over 30  percent of the country's electricity, but the government might  increase this proportion due to the shortage of fuel for thermal  plants.    Shmarov said Ukraine had already sent to Russia three  trainloads of nuclear warheads in fulfillment of a trilateral  agreement between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the  United States. As compensation for this, Russia is this year  due to provide Ukraine with 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel rods.    To date Ukraine has received one train with 25 tonnes of  rods  for the Zaporozhye plant, Shmarov said. The next shipment of  fuel is due to arrive this month, he said, quoting Russian  Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov.    Shmarov said the government was planning measures to bolster  nuclear power engineering and support nuclear plant personnel.  Thus, it has halved their income tax, is going to raise their  wages and establish new tariffs for electricity generated by  nuclear plants, which is today Ukraine's cheapest electricity,  costing 200 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour. The charges for it  are to be put up by 150 or 200 percent, which is expected to  provide enough funds to buy fuel and components in Russia and  implement safety measures.    In winter 1994, units one and three of the Chernobyl plant,  which are still in operation, produced 13 percent of the  country's electricity. From the moment the plant was  commissioned in 1977 to April 1, 1994, it has generated 258.9  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, including 109 billion  after the 1986 accident.    The funds allocated for safety measures at the Chernobyl  plant between 1986 and 1993 top one-quarter of the plant's  initial cost.    The plant today has a staff of about 5,000. The town of  Slavutich, servicing the plant, has a population of about 25,000.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> TWO CASTS IN NYCO 'WIDOW'  </P> <P> New York City Opera shucked the serious stuff and turned to Franz Lehar's "The  Merry Widow" over the weekend to close a six-day run at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The production, new in 1982, was revived last year, and offers much that is  attractive to look at. Helen Pond and Herbert Senn's Nouveau sets -- dominated  by turquoise, purple and rose -- are handsome. Suzanne Mess'  turn-of-the-century costumes are bright and stylish.  </P> <P> Ronald Bentley's staging, initially criticized for overly busy high jinks, was  later toned down into relatively straightforward action; it was this version  that was recreated in Orange County by Cynthia Edwards.  </P> <P> The company offered two casts in a number of key roles.  </P> <P> Leigh Munro was a warm, appealing, vulnerable, melting and yielding Sonia  (a.k.a. Hanna Glawari, the Widow) Saturday afternoon. She sang with an  aristocratic, dark-toned, weighty soprano, but inclined more toward beauty of  vowels than clarity of enunciation. Thus she sang "Vilia" with gentleness and  refined pianissimo, but the words were virtually indistinct.  </P> <P> Saturday evening, Michele McBride proved an intelligent, sophisticated, sly,  sensual and clever Sonia. She offered fine-edged vocalism though with some  wobbliness under pressure. But she sang "Vilia" with clear diction, seamless  line and magical tenderness.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, opposite each of them as Danilo was baritone Louis Otey -- tall,  broad-shouldered, handsome in a Clark Gable look-alike way, but stiff and  wooden in acting. There was virtually no chemistry between him and Munro in the  afternoon, but he reacted more credibly to McBride in the evening.  </P> <P> In both cases, he sang with coarse, forced vocalism, and had problems,  particularly in the afternoon -- losing focus, tone and even at times, control.  Oddly, he, rather than the Widows, got to interpolate a song in Act III, "Girls  Were Made to Love and Kiss" (from Lehar's "Paganini"). But the effort drew no  applause whatsoever from the Saturday evening audience.  </P> <P> (Nor did the song fit well stylistically or in terms of its orchestration.  "Paganini" was written 20 years after "Merry Widow," and in the meantime Lehar  had worked hard to develop his style.)  </P> <P> The secondary pair of lovers proved quite different. Gran Wilson brought  matinee-idol looks to Camille in the afternoon, but sang with a light tenor  more suitable for musical theater than opera, although it could blossom on top.  He offered generalized acting.  </P> <P> Ruth Golden was his Natalie, singing with lyricism and clarity, and strongly  exploiting her concern over their parting.  </P> <P> As the evening Camille, Mark Thomsen proved boyish but ardent, attentive and  serious. Despite a somewhat metallic and constricted tenor, he could portray  pertinent, genuine distress.  </P> <P> Opposite him, Susanne Marsee, who on Tuesday had portrayed a sensuous Maddalena  in Verdi's "Rigoletto," offered a rather prim, up-tight Natalie, and seemed  more involved in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with him than conscious of  painful loss. But she sang with fine focus.  </P> <P> Appearing in both casts, James Billings divested himself of the TV sitcom  cutesiness he had occasionally indulged in as the Second Priest in  "Zauberflote" earlier in the week and offered a dry, clever Nisch.  </P> <P> On both occasions, Imre Pallo conducted with style and dash, with lingering  affection and expansiveness, despite a penchant for slow tempos. However, he  also rather often allowed the instrumentalists to overwhelm the singers,  particularly at the matinee.  </P> <P> The company orchestra, which all week had repeated the dreary cycle of starting  imprecisely and gaining confidence only as the evening progressed, introduced  new levels of slovenliness at these performances. The strings, already  thin-sounding, were sour and squeally in the heights, occuring invariably at  the most exposed moments.  </P> <P> Choreographer Sharon Halley provided stilted waltzes, pseudo-folk character  dances and a surpassingly vulgar cancan. The dancers coped gamely, if not with  much finesse.  </P> <P> Adrian Ross provided the bright, clever translation.  </P></p>

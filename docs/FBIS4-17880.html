			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- The considerable similarity of  Russian and Israeli military doctrines was stressed today by  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev after holding talks with  Yitzhaq Rabin, Israeli prime minister and defense minister. The  meeting lasted more than an hour.    During the meeting the head of the Israeli Government, who  was a combat general in the recent past, set out the main  principles of Israel's military doctrine. Theoretically  Israel's defensive strategy corresponds to a considerable degree  with our own doctrine -- both of them are based on defense, the  Russian minister pointed out. The only difference is that we  mould our defenses in different ways. Their effectiveness  depends on equipment which both armies use.    Pavel Grachev stressed that the Russian leadership attaches  special importance to the achievement of peace in the Near East  since this region is in direct proximity to Russia's borders.  Failure to settle Near East problems could have unpredictable  consequences, including ethnic and religious ones, for the  entire world, including Russia. In this connection it is  essential to make every effort to bring about a political  settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This can only be  achieved through joint efforts.    Pavel Grachev noted the importance of varied, including  military, cooperation between Russia and Israel. Naturally, he  said, from the results of the first meeting we cannot examine  the possibilities opening up before us in detail. But a  mechanism for implementing these plans already exists: a  military attache from Israel is already working in Moscow, at  the end of April or beginning of May the apparatus of a Russian  military attache will be working in Israel. We shall charge  them with working out the relevant program, Grachev said. Today  our guest in his capacity as minister of defense has invited me  to make an official visit to Israel, and there we shall outline  a plan for our future bilateral relations in the military field.    Israel's prime minister stated that the Russian leadership,  and first and foremost Russian President Boris Yeltsin, had  assured him that Russia is striving to achieve the establishment  of peace in the Near East. This striving, Y. Rabin said, we  also share, although we have different contacts and relations  with the third parties. When the aims are identical, however,  corresponding interests also emerge that will, I hope, lead to  the successful completion of the Arab-Israeli talks.    After the meeting Yitzhaq Rabin delivered a lecture to an  audience at the Academy of the General Staff on the subject of  military doctrine in Israel.</p>

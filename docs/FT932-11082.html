			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Hoover accused of confusing workers HOOVER, the domestic appliances manufacturer, was accused yesterday by the AEEU union of contradicting itself over the future of its British operations. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the engineering and electrical union's Scottish chief executive officer, said he had written to Mr Leonard Hadley, president and chief executive of Maytag, the US parent company, asking him who was running Hoover. Earlier this year Mr Airlie negotiated an efficiency deal with Hoover that resulted in its decision to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in France to Scotland. Last week doubt was cast over that agreement when it became clear that the company is reviewing all its European operations. Mr Airlie said yesterday that Mr Hadley and the company's new European president, Mr Gerald Kamman, appeared to have contradicted each other over the future of Hoover's Scottish plant at Cambuslang. In his annual statement to shareholders in Iowa on April 27 Mr Hadley said the move from Dijon to Cambuslang was proceeding as planned. 'We took a 1992 charge of Dollars 53m to cover the expenses of this European reorganisation, but we expect to recover those charges in the future as we will eliminate duplicate overheads, reduce labour costs and realise economies of scale', he added. Only a day earlier Mr Kamman wrote to every Hoover employee in Europe to say that owing to financial losses 'nothing will escape review', including the transfer of production from Dijon to Scotland. Hoover was unavailable for comment yesterday. Management, Page 8</p>

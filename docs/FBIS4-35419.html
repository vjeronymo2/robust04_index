			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  emphasized Jordan's firm position on the current situation in  the Republic of Yemen and its support for the legitimacy and  unity that was realized through agreement among all parties in  the sisterly country.    At his meeting with 'Abd al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Yemeni  Presidential Council member, at his office in the Prime Ministry  this morning, the prime minister also emphasized the  noninterference of Jordan in the Yemeni internal affairs, and  Jordan's support for a cease-fire and a halt to fighting.    For his part, 'Abd-al-Ghani said in a statement to reporters  that the meeting reviewed bilateral relations, the latest  developments in the situation in the Republic of Yemen, and the  visit he will make to the United States to attend the Security  Council deliberations on the Yemeni crisis--a meeting called by  certain countries.    He added: We are always ready for dialogue and diplomatic  efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis, and we are always ready to  end fighting if the elements that created the situation return  to constitutional legitimacy and retract the statement which  sought--through armed rebellion--to separate parts of the  Republic of Yemen formed on 22 May 1990, and blessed by all  Yemeni people.    He added: We believe that discussing the issue at  international forums is interference in Yemeni affairs because  what is taking place in the Yemeni arena is a purely internal  Yemeni affair. He said: What is taking place is a rebellion  carried out by some elements of the Socialist Party that forced  the constitutional legitimacy to confront it in order to realize  security and stability in the Republic of Yemen.    Concerning the alternatives that may be proposed during the  Security Council deliberations on this crisis, 'Abd-al-Ghani  said the solution lies in resolving the issue in accordance with  the constitutional legitimacy that resulted from the elections  of March 1993, and--according to testimony of the whole  world--were honest, and in which all eligible voters  participated.    He added: We ask all brothers and friends to deal with the  Republic of Yemen in accordance with the principles of  international law which respect the sovereignty of every  country, and state that no country should interfere in the  affairs of another.    He emphasized that Yemeni unity is an accomplished fact  supported by all Yemenis, and added that no one can return Yemen  to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990.    He also stressed that the danger posed by presenting the  Yemeni issue [at the Security Council] is the interference in an  internal Yemeni affair. It is a serious step to discuss a  subject that concerns a sovereign state and member of all  regional organizations and the United Nations and one which is  committed to the UN Charter and regional and international  charters.    He added: We think that discussing any internal issue in any  country is a dangerous precedent because doing so is not  stipulated in the UN Charter, especially Article 2 of this  charter.    The meeting was attended by Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting  minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador  in Amman.    'Abd-al-Ghani left Amman for New York today. He was seen off  by the acting minister of state for foreign affairs and the  Yemeni ambassador in Amman.</p>

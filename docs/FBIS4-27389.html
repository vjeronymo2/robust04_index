			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part One" of the report delivered by Deputy Prime Minister </F> Phan Van Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly  Fifth Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26  May -- recorded]    [Text] In this report, on behalf of the Government and the  prime minister, I would like to make general remarks on the  current situation and present a clearer picture of a number of  major issues that need to be resolved in the days ahead to  implement successfully the National Assembly's resolutions on  the tasks for 1994.    Based on the results obtained from the implementation of  tasks for the first four months of the year and on the projected  developments of the situation till June, we can point out the  following outstanding traits:    First, the positive financial and economic changes of the  past few years have been sustained and developed in the first  six months of 1994, thus producing rather comprehensive progress  in the areas of economic production, goods circulation, finance,  money, and external economic relations with a higher growth rate  compared with the corresponding period in the past few years.    The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest  output so far, up one million tons compared with last year (or  an increase of 10 percent). The structure of the rural economy  has been reformed in the direction of increasing industrial and  special crop yields as well as of promoting animal husbandry,  especially aquaculture, and non-farming occupations.    The industrial production in the first six months of the  year  is expected to increase by 12 percent compared with the  corresponding period in the previous year (the target put forth  for the whole year is 11 percent), with the rather harmonious  development of all economic sectors, cities, and industrial  centers, a number of major electricity-generating and transport  projects have been completed and put into operation. These  include the last group of generators of the Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Power Plant, the turbine power plant in Ba Ria,  the 220-kilovolt powerline between Ba Ria and Long Binh, the  highway section between northern Thang Long and Noi Bai, and so  forth.    The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt powerline,  has  been completed as scheduled following two years of countless  difficulties and obstacles. This required the greatest efforts  to ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operations  started on 20 May 1994 and the network will be officially  switched on by early June to supply electricity from north to  south, thus exerting an overall impact on the national economy  and the people's lives.    The export value is estimated to increase by 27 percent (the  projected yearly target is put forth at 20 percent). Import  value is expected to increase by 23.4 percent. The foreign  Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first  quarter of this year has nearly doubled the 1993 amount. Direct  foreign investment projects licensed in the first half of 1994  totalled $2 billion in registered capital, or two-thirds of last  year's figure. The amount of capital actually put in use  increased by 60 percent over the same period in the previous  year.    The total value of retail sales is expected to increase by  37.76 percent, meeting the diversified demands of the population  with higher incomes and purchasing power. Goods and passengers  transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other  services have reached new heights. Price indexes of retail  sales and services in the first four months of the year  increased by 5.4 percent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during  the Tet holidays. Since March, prices have stabilized.    According to reports from the Statistics General Department,  the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent  over April with food accounting for 1.1 percent, non-food and  foodstuffs 0.2 percent, and services 0.4 percent. If we compare  May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has increased by  six percent with food and foodstuffs accounting for 11.1  percent, other goods for one percent, and services for 5.9  percent. In short, though prices this year increased more  rapidly than the same period in the previous year, they mainly  affected food and foodstuffs, a trend that suits the  government's policy of not letting the prices of food and  foodstuffs fall too low.    Regarding domestic budget revenue, it is expected to  increase  by 50 percent compared with the corresponding period in the  previous year. The annual increase was put forth at 31.5  percent. Phase two of the new wage policy, which would  introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage fund, has been  developed since early this year in a way that will not cause  unexpected price fluctuations but ensure smoother cash flow and  prevent cash shortages. The currency exchange rates and gold  prices did not show any major fluctuations. The credit system  was expanded a step further and the loan payment surplus was  estimated to increase by 23 percent compared with the  corresponding period in late 1993. The rate of credit loans to  the non-state sector -- mainly to peasant households --  increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in the first  half of this year.    However, positive elements to ensure economic stabilization  and favorable conditions for new development steps are not very  stable in many aspects. The state budget balance is facing  difficulties. Internal and foreign credit resources to cover  national overspending are still limited. Monetary circulation  still carries unstable factors, and the amount of foreign  currencies circulating outside state control is still fairly  great. Policies and measures on mobilizing more capital only  meet the current demand at a low level. Several agricultural  products, industrial commodities, and consumer goods are facing  difficulties finding a market. Planning for state investment  has been executed at a low level due to lack of capital.  Projects funded by loans and several foreign joint venture  projects do not have enough capital to get off the ground. The  reorganization and rearrangement designed to improve management  in the state economic sector and in handling public property,  guide and promote domestic investment, improve foreign  investment procedures, and establish order and discipline in  economic activities in the market mechanism have not scored  significant progress.    Second, together with economic development and increasing  incomes, cultural and social activities have progressed with  more students registered at all education levels and better  teaching and learning quality; the tertiary education system  has been reorganized with the formation of national universities  and regional universities; science and technology research has  been concentrated more on key programs; management of product  measurement and product quality is in progress, and  environmental protection activities have been implemented  according to the recently introduced law. The information and  cultural work have been directed more at the grass roots level.  Many activities have been organized to preserve historical  traditions and national cultural characteristics and to broaden  cultural exchanges with foreign countries. Activities to mark  the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory have been held  in many diversified and vivid forms, satisfactorily cultivating  encouraging and educational effects on different generations.  National programs to generate more jobs, prevent and fight  contagious diseases, provide family planning services and mother  and child care, support sports and physical education  activities, eliminate starvation and alleviate poverty, and  repay favors to people who have rendered meritorious service to  the nation have been implemented widely and become more  socialized.    The fight against social evils has received better guidance  and coordination from the government, mass organizations,  schools, and families.    The government has supplemented and carried out practical  lines and policies to support socioeconomic development in the  mountainous areas and in ethnic areas. Many mountainous  provinces and districts have established their own economic  structure to increase commodity production on the basis of  exploiting their local advantages. The government is directly  providing guidance to one pilot province and district to draw  experiences.    State investment in mountainous areas, including allocation  to local budgets and projects funded by different ministries, is  double the 1993 amount. Since the beginning of this year, many  construction projects and investment programs for mountainous  areas have been executed. They include projects to build more  public roads, provide electricity and water for production and  living, expand primary health care, fight against malaria and  goiter, restore and build more schools and classes, construct  boarding schools for ethnic students, and improve cultural and  information services.    The state trading sector has been entrusted with the duty of  purchasing all commodities and supplying staple goods to  mountainous areas. Apart from continuing to grant subsidies to  the transport cost of seven types of goods, the government has  decided to provide free four types of goods to upland people.  These goods are iodized salt, diesel, medicine, and stationery  for students.    The past progress has prevented the degradation and scored  new development steps in some fields. However, the improvement  is not great compared to the requirements of our human  development strategy in the transitional period for the national  industrialization and modernization. The advancement steps are  not powerful enough to push back and prevent social evils and to  help the spiritual life, morality, and social environment  improve and become more useful for economic development in these  areas. Commodity production, goods circulation, and material  and cultural life for the mountainous people still face many  difficulties.    Third, our international relations are expanding and  consolidating continuously in the direction of diversification  and multilateralization. During the first several months of the  year, exchange visits of our high-ranking leaders with leaders  of a number of countries, especially regional countries, have  contributed significantly to improving mutual understanding and  accelerating multifaceted cooperative relations.    The resumption of normal relations by international monetary  organizations with Vietnam, and the lifting of the trade embargo  against us by the United States administration early this year  have created favorable conditions for normalizing relations  between Vietnam and the United States, as well as encouraging  cooperation between international organizations and other  countries with us. Our international relations are progressing  at a relatively fast pace in a positive direction and are  contributing to consolidating peace, stability, and cooperation  for the sake of national construction.    There still, however, were some complicated incidents on the  borders, such as recent violations of our economic privilege  zone and continental shelf. The situation in Cambodia also  contains elements that cause concern.    National defense work continues to be consolidated in the  recent past, territorial integrity was well safeguarded, all  sabotage plots and activities were discovered and suppressed,  lawbreakers were subdued, and social order and safety were  maintained. The new situation requires the state and people to  strengthen their support and create better conditions for the  national defense forces so that they can cope with their heavy  responsibility.    Also, the state management mechanism has achieved good  progress in terms of leadership and managing tasks. While  consolidating its leadership role and dealing effectively with  urgent issues for the short term, the government has also tried  to study and resolve essential issues which are strategically  important in the new situation, such as the comprehensive plan  to combine economic renovation with administrative reform,  building up the legal system, planning for major industry  sectors and economic zones and for major projects that should be  implemented from now to the year 2000.    Coordination among the legislature, administration, and  judiciary agencies, and with mass organizations in a number of  fields have gradually regulated, thus guaranteeing better  performance.    The pace of reform of the state management mechanism,  however, is still too slow. The administration reform has not  genuinely functioned yet in reality. The contingent of cadres  in many agencies and at various sectors and echelons is  displaying the ineptness which makes them unable to catch up  with the demands of the renovation. Improper discipline,  degenerated morality, and, worst of all, corruption,  embezzlement and waste of public property, and extortion, are  still popular. Enforcing the law at one's own convenience, or  not obeying government decisions is still rampant at not only  the grass roots level, but also at some provincial  administrations. Several party and state policies, therefore,  could not reach the people, or have been misled and made  inefficient. These flaws within the state mechanism are the  major obstacles in the renovation undertaking and national  development.    Generally speaking, the socioeconomic situation in the first  several months of the year has been developing in a positive  direction, ensuring a good possibility to fulfill and even  exceed all 1994 tasks as determined by the resolutions of the  National Assembly. Difficulties, however, are numerous and  serious because of the slowness in rectifying weaknesses we have  had for a very long time, and also by the greater demands of the  new development stage as well as new complicated developments  that affect the protection of national order and safety.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Libya/Italy: Libyan Proposal for </F> Lockerbie Trial"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Libya wants a trial at the  International Court of Justice in The Hague for two of its  citizens accused of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, Libya's  ambassador to Rome 'Abd-al-Rahman Shalqam told Lower House  Foreign Affairs Committee chief Mirko Tremaglia on Wednesday [8  June].    Libyan authorities will suggest that an all-Scottish jury be  created for the trial of the two, wanted in Scotland and the  United States on charges of having planned the bombing.    Two hundred and seventy people died when a Pan Am jet  exploded in flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on  December 21 1988.    According to Tremaglia, the Libyan Government will send the  Italian authorities "a written statement on their decision,  which is aimed at finding a definitive resolution for the issue."    The Libyan ambassador argued that such a step would meet  demands of successive United Nations resolutions on the  question, Tremaglia said.</p>

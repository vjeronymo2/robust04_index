			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: A nice place to live I READ so many novels that in a palpable sense it is fiction that has made me what I am: tolerant, generous, civilised, kind, a humanist and a liberal. A flinty sort of liberal, though, nothing mimsy mamsy: for example, anti-authoritarian but also in favour of capital punishment, which is not, I believe, a common or garden coupling. Some novels are better than others, but that is true of everything. This is often, as it happens, the extent of my literary criticism, for I am not a natural critic. Yet I enjoy a book of criticism, especially when it is as spiky as After the War: The Novel and England Since 1945, by DJ Taylor, which will be published on Monday. We are not talking blockbuster. But in the week before the Booker Prize shortlist is announced, After the War deserves to sell a few copies, if only to see what the author makes of his assertion that the modern English novel - never call it British - is 'an art-form which nearly everybody admits is in a wretched state, and in which large numbers of intelligent people have lost interest'. His mission is to set the post-war English novel in its social context. Apparently this is known as English literary sociology, which is not as dire as at first it sounds. To show you what the author means, let us peek into his best chapter, entitled The Literary Consequences of Mrs Thatcher. Taylor is not blaming Margaret Hilda for the death of the English novel. Instead, he is asking why the 1980s - a decade of schism and drama - marked a further decline in the conventionally framed political novel. One of the side-effects of Thatcher's long reign, says Taylor, was the pressure placed on writers to take up positions on either side of the barricade, however embarrassing or pointless the result. Yet the death of British democracy - Maurice Edelman called Britain 'a kind of Venetian oligarchy' - and the impenetrable aura of secrecy increasingly in evidence during the Thatcher years had given politicians generally a phantasmagoric quality, with Thatcher herself the 'chief monster in an elaborate demonology'. This was not a good thing for the political novel. Says Taylor: 'Taking its lead from political satire of the Yes, Minister variety, the straightforward political novel has degenerated into a kind of burlesque, dominated by a single gargantuan monster. The fictive Mrs Thatcher . . . is no more than a caricature. Even a really subtle and imaginative spoof like Mark Lawson's Bloody Margaret (1991) . . . can only invest her with a . . . blurred remoteness.' Nevertheless, the late 1980s, he says, were remarkable for the unanimity among writers, and for the existence of a literary opposition more vocal and coherent than at any time since the 1930s. And if a single factor distinguished the literary response to Margaret Thatcher it was 'incomprehension, or rather a refusal to comprehend. The fact that millions of people had repeatedly voted for her seemed of little moment to a handful of left-leaning liberals whose favourite riposte was to regret Mrs Thatcher's 'vulgarity''. There was the Thatcherite fictional hero, of course - male, middle-class, suburbanite, self-sufficient, go-getting, entrepreneurial: a distinctive animal with recognisable social and psychological characteristics. But what formed the basis for a great many doubtful state-of-the-nation novels in the 1980s, Taylor maintains, was a handful of catchphrases. 'The novelists of the 1980s, you feel, did their 'research' in the cuttings libraries of national newspapers: their 'observation' was of headlines and government statistics, their conclusions could be found in leader-page articles in The Guardian.' In his introduction, Taylor says that writers are told repeatedly that truly intelligent people today become stockbrokers or video producers, and regard novel-writing as an antiquated hobby. He is an excellent critic. But I'm not sure he is right. Although I have read only a fraction of the novels he has read, I suspect that the late-20th century novel, in Britain and elsewhere, is a lot less raggle-taggled than people like him believe. I like modern fiction. It is a nice place to live. In the age of John Major it is the only place to live. After The War, Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 17.99.</p>

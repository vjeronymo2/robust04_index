			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Studio chief steps down as Disney revamps film unit Walt Disney said yesterday that Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg is to step down as chairman of its film entertainment unit, Walt Disney Pictures, when his contract expires at the end of next month. The group also announced that the film unit is to be restructured. It will be split into two separate entities: one for television and telecommunications, which will be run by Mr Richard Frank, currently president of Disney Studios, and one for movie production and distribution, to be run by Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the group's Caravan Pictures affiliate. The departure of the 43-year old Mr Katzenberg is a blow to Disney. Under his tenure, Disney has been one of the most successful studios in Hollywood. This year, the animated film The Lion King was a huge hit in the US and internationally, and is poised to become one of the most successful films of all time. Mr Katzenberg's decision to leave Disney is believed to be related to the failure of Mr Michael Eisner, the group's chairman, to appoint a successor to Mr Frank Wells, the former Disney president who was killed in a helicopter accident in April. Mr Katzenberg's achievements in his nearly 10 years as head of Disney's studios had appeared to make the 43-year old executive a natural heir to Mr Wells' position. When Mr Eisner declined to appoint a new president, it was widely seen as a rejection of Mr Katzenberg as a potential future Disney chairman. At the time, Mr Katzenberg was reported to have told friends that he would leave the group if he was not made president. The question of management succession at Disney has been a talking point in Hollywood since Mr Wells' death. It became even more urgent last month when Mr Eisner underwent emergency heart bypass surgery. Although doctors predicted a full recovery for Mr Eisner at the time, his illness, and the lack of a number two at Disney, cast a cloud over the group's long-term prospects.</p>

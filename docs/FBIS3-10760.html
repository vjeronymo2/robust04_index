			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army spokeswoman Edith Vargas de Marroquin stated  that in spite of what has been said by Monica Pinto, a UN human  rights expert, the armed institution believes that the voluntary  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] are positive for Guatemala.    Military reaction has come in the wake of a report prepared  by Dr. Pinto that describes PAC's as the main violators of human  rights in Guatemala and because the final resolution of the UN  Human Rights Commission requested that PAC units in areas where  there is no conflict be dissolved based on agreements that may  be reached during the peace negotiations.    In noting that the Army's position is similar to that  expressed by the Defense Ministry, Major Vargas affirmed that  "the Army respects the position stated by the UN representative  but we have our own opinion." She suggested that next time the  UN expert visits Guatemala, "she should stay longer because this  would permit her to speak with all the sectors, including PAC  members." The major said that a longer visit would allow Dr.  Pinto to have a broader idea and learn about special cases that  cannot be understood in only eight days.</p>

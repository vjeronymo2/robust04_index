			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SWEDES CANCEL TEEN OFFENDERS' REHABILITATION CRUISE AFTER OUTCRY  </P> <P> Local politicians, reacting to public uproar, decided today not to send a group  of teen-age offenders on a six-month rehabilitation cruise to the Caribbean at  taxpayer expense.  </P> <P> The social board in the suburb of Kista dropped plans to participate in the  cruise after it received a bomb threat.  </P> <P> Social Commissioner Ragnar Gotestam later announced on TV that the project had  to be canceled because at least two community social boards had changed their  minds about the $80,000 cruise on a 53-foot sailing craft to Saint Lucia and  other Caribbean islands. He said he hoped to pursue the project later.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Women use business centres too Sir, When Visa International set about finding out the important factors in choosing a hotel why did it restrict the question about business centres to men? (Business Travel Survey, October 10). Was it because the researchers assumed that the women interviewed were merely accompanying the men and therefore interested only in factors such as hairdryers and prompt laundry services? I have just returned from a business trip to Australia, during which I sent and received a large number of faxes, telephone message and packages courtesy of the business centre at my hotel. Of course I appreciated the hairdryer and the iron too and it was a refreshing change to be supplied with additional clothes hangers capable of holding skirts, rather than trousers. What is more, nobody batted an eyelid when I signed the Visa credit slip rather than my six-foot five-inch male partner. S Y Rhys Jones, Halley House, 49 Burney Street, Greenwich, London SE10 8EX</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Observer: Two legs good Oh no, India has discovered re-branding. Indian officials think their country has made so much economic progress as a result of the last three years' reforms, that they are changing the name of their annual meeting in Paris with their principal aid donors. Instead of the Aid India Consortium the two-day meeting starting on June 30 will henceforth be known as the India Development Forum. Will they also be asking for less money? Don't bet on it.</p>

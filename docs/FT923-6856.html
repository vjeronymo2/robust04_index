			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Leading Article: German money THE PARADOX of European monetary policy is that few, apart from the Germans, believe in the wisdom of targeting broad money. But all believe in the importance of fixed exchange rates. So willy nilly, everyone in Europe is a monetarist: when D-Mark broad money misbehaves, everyone must pay the price. Nowhere is this paradox more striking than in the UK. Many proponents of ERM membership were critical of domestic monetarism. Now they must live with the targeting of D-Mark M3, instead. The question is whether many will come to condemn the Bundesbank's present targetry, as they do the targeting of sterling M3 in the early 1980s. The Bundesbank argues that its attachment to D-Mark M3 reflects the solid empirical relationship between monetary expansion and inflation some three years later. Growth of D-Mark M3 at a provisional annual rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and July remains well above the official target of 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 per cent, which is based on what the Bundesbank thinks will give medium term inflation of 2 per cent. The growth rate of D-Mark M3 is slipping back, but too slowly. The Bundesbank is not simple-minded. It is well aware that broad money can be distorted by distress borrowing during an economic slowdown, by changes in wealth holdings in response to the structure of interest rates and by increased foreign demand for D-Marks. But it judges these various special factors to account for no more than one percentage point of monetary growth. The principal motor of M3 expansion is credit expansion, most of it medium and long term. In the last six months, complains the Bundesbank, the annual rate of credit expansion to the private sector was 11 per cent. Nor does it accept that profit-seeking banks are simply seducing foolish clients into excessive borrowing, which would make high interest rates the cause of the excessive lending. The question is whether anything can be done to curb credit growth, apart from high interest rates. The answer is yes. The Bundesbank complains of the effect of subsidies to lending in eastern Germany, arguing that such subsidies not merely increase the demand for credit, but reduce its sensitivity to interest rates. The culprit is the German government. It should recognise that its mistaken policies are now sacrificing German growth, not merely that of the rest of Europe. Unhappily, a change of heart in Bonn does not seem at all imminent. For the moment, high German interest rates remain certain. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the dollar is close to an all time low and sterling, at DM 2.8081, is only three pfennigs from its absolute floor within the ERM. The American authorities can, if they, wish, ignore the exchange rate slide. The British cannot. Bundesbank monetarism rules, in London as in Frankfurt.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: Award winning spontaneity - Eating Out When Fredy Girardet won three rosettes last November in Michelin's first guide to Swiss restaurants, he reacted simply, 'Well, we will just have to work harder.' Certainly, the 57-year-old master of cuisine spontanee shows no signs of fatigue. Slim and fit - he cycles regularly in the nearby Jura mountains - he produces wonderful surprises and still inspires younger chefs throughout the world. I first became aware of Girardet through his student Kiyomi Mikuni, whose Hotel de Mikuni became a favourite occasional retreat from Japanese fare while posted in Tokyo. Stepping into the master's discreet restaurant on a quiet street in Crissier just north of Lausanne a few nights ago, the connection was immediately clear. The dining room itself is plain, with only a dozen well spaced tables and a few austere abstract/landscape paintings by Girardet's friend Yves Mafli on the walls. Nothing distracts from the cuisine. 'I see the echoes,' I said clumsily to Girardet as he made his first of two cruises through the dining room. 'Mikuni is echoing me,' he corrected gently. We will not soon forget his foie gras with grapes jellied in Madiera or the half cooked wild salmon with rough sea salt kernels sprinkled on top or even the astonishing variety of homemade breads. The lime and raspberry souffle alone would be worth a detour. Because the restaurant is so small, it is best to book well in advance for Girardet. I rang in early April for a mid-June evening and found Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were already fully booked. Girardet, 1, rue d'Yverdon, 1023 Crissier, Switzerland. Tel (41-21) 634-0505. A la carte or set menus at SFr165 or SFr180. No credit cards. Closed Sundays, Mondays, three weeks from the last Saturday in July, three weeks from Christmas day.</p>

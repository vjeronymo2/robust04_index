			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Presumably, start-up costs for HACCP are normally higher than operating costs in subsequent years. The majority of firms that could estimate their own start-up costs indicated costs in the $1,000 to $5,000 range. The remaining minority appear to be roughly equally divided between lower and higher costs. A few firms indicated costs in the $20,000 or higher range. These may be firms that decided to hire additional personnel in order to install or implement HACCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the cost figures that come from firms that operate more than one plant are for the total costs of their plants collectively; in order to calculate the average start-up cost per plant for these firms, their costs would have to be divided by the number of plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nearly twice as many firms did not hire additional personnel or did not anticipate hiring additional personnel as a result of operating HACCP systems as those who did or felt the need to do so. The overwhelming majority of firms reported that they believed that the advantages they derived from HACCP were worth the costs to them in terms of better control over their operations, better sanitation, and greater efficiencies, such as reduced waste. Virtually all foresaw long-term benefits from operating under HACCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA notes that there are several uncertainties with this data. The first is that FDA does not know the extent of previous HACCP-type activities in these firms so that they may have different incremental costs than the industry average. In addition, these firms may have been relatively larger firms so that they may not be fully representative of the industry. Also, FDA does not know whether or not these firms would necessarily be in full compliance with the proposed regulations so that additional costs might have to be expended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Costs: MSSP Study <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The MSSP study provides FDA with survey data from which detailed cost estimates have been made in the PRIA, subject to numerous uncertainties. As this is the largest and only randomly selected data base available to FDA, the PRIA relied primarily on estimates based on these data. The contractor in the MSSP study sent teams into 130 processing plants, none of which were operating under HACCP systems, to project the costs to each plant to implement and operate a form of HACCP chosen for that study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In areas where FDA had better data than that used in the contractor reports, the agency has used information available from its field surveys on current practices or conditions in the industry in general, and it has substituted that information for the information gathered from the sample plants in the contractor reports. Where gaps in the contractor estimates exist that could not be filled in by information from FDA field surveys, a number of assumptions have been made for the purposes of this economic assessment. FDA views the cost estimates extrapolated from the contractor reports and other sources as preliminary and requests comments on them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From FDA's 1992 official establishment inventory, FDA has estimated that there are 4,846 domestic seafood manufacturing plants that will be affected by the proposed rule. Thirty-three percent of the first year costs can be attributed to expenditures necessary to comply with the HACCP-based sanitation provisions of the proposed rule. Another 36 percent are attributable to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, approximately 31 percent of the first year costs are for equipment such as temperature indicators, temperature recorders, and can seam tear-down machines. Additional costs are for HACCP training, consulting by processing authorities, writing HACCP plans, instituting operational changes, responding to critical limit deviations, and analytical testing. The average expected cost of the proposed rule per domestic manufacturing plant is estimated to be $23,900 in the first year ($24,000 for small plants, $23,400 for large plants) and $15,000 in the following years ($14,700 for small plants and $15,700 for large plants). Total costs of the proposed rule for domestic manufacturers are estimated to be $117 million in the first year and $65 million in the following years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, FDA estimates that 924 importers will bear start-up costs of approximately $8 million, and 1,571 repackers and warehouses will bear annual recurring costs of $14 million. Therefore, based on these data, FDA estimates domestic costs for this rule to be $139 million in the first year and $79 million in succeeding years. Discounted domestic costs are estimated to be $676 million over 10 years (6 percent). FDA also estimates that 8,125 foreign processors will have initial costs of $96 million and recurring costs of $44 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

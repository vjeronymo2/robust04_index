			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Prosecution drops witness in Collor trial IN the latest twist in the saga of Brazil's suspended President Fernando Collor, the prosecution in his impeachment trial yesterday withdrew a key witness, intimating that it suspected a deal had been reached between the two men. The testimony of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the alleged front man in the multimillion dollar corruption scam which brought down Mr Collor, had been expected to be crucial to the Senate hearings. Mr Farias had been expected to turn on his friend and former boss as revenge for Mr Collor's defence, which pins all blame on his shoulders. Tension was high in the Senate yesterday before his scheduled appearance since his brother Augusto had told reporters that his revelations 'would rock the court'. 'We think it is in Brazil's interest to accelerate this process and we do not think it will benefit the country to be subject to more spectacular allegations or to give credence to the chief of a crime racket,' Mr Evandro Linse Silva explained for the prosecution. Mr Collor's lawyers said they would not call Mr Farias to testify for the defence: 'It's too much of a risk', said Mr Evarista de Moraes, 'we don't know if he'd tell the truth'.</p>

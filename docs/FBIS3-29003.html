Senator Evans says Australia has been pushing  President Clinton and his administration on the issue:    [Begin Evans recording] We have been urging him and previous  administrations to go down this route, of course, for a very  long time. We have regarded it as, quite frankly, absurd that  the POW-MIA issue should have occupied the time and attention  and been the distraction that it was. Obviously it is in  everyone's interest that there be a resumption of major economic  activity in Vietnam, and we are very glad that has happened.  [end recording]    Sen. Evans said Australian industry should not fear American  competition in Vietnam, because it should generate higher  economic activity. The foreign minister said Australian  industry was much more internationally competitive and Australia  already had an established track record in Vietnam.    Belinda Tromp reports that the American decision is expected  to remove some obstacles for Australian investors:    [Begin recording] [Tromp] With a literacy rate of around 80  percent and a government keen to achieve rapid economic growth,  Vietnam has some of the fundamentals for attracting new  investment. What is missing, according to an executive member  of the Australia-Vietnam Business Council, Robert Wilcox, is a  modern bureaucracy.    [Wilcox] The Vietnamese need to move, I believe, more  quickly  with their reforms -- in getting their legal system together,  getting their administrative act together -- as a result of this.    [Tromp] Mr. Wilcox says the reputation and expertise  established by Australian companies already in Vietnam -- such  as BHP, Telecom, and the ANZ Bank -- put Australian companies in  a good position for the onset of competition from U.S.  investors.

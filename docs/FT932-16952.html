			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (2): Markets distrust dogma - Why the Convergence Plan may come to grief MR Felipe Gonzalez is often described as a pragmatic politician whose governments understand that politics is the art of the possible. But that is demonstrably not true where economic policy is concerned. The doctrinaire espousal of economic and monetary union within the EC is a case in point. The government has fixed its sights on converging with the rich Community economies, worked out how to reach its target in closed doors meetings of motivated policy makers and relentlessly set out on its course although it may scorch the earth it treads on. 'We have made a commitment to Europe and to economic and monetary union and we believe that Spain will, in 1997 or in 1999, be a member of the group of European nations that will redefine the role of Europe in the world's economy,' Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, told domestic and international businessmen in January. 'Because of this, the government, for several months now, has considered the macroeconomic and monetary measures in the Convergence Plan to be a priority.' With hindsight, the most distressing aspect of Mr Solchaga's January panegyric of Spain in a fast-track Europe was that he got his sums wrong. He told his audience it was 'probable' that in 1992 GDP grew by 1.5 per cent. Less than two months later it was revealed that GDP had grown by just 1 per cent. The Convergence Plan that the policy makers drew up in April last year was a set of targets through to 1996 that would allow Spain to meet the criteria for joining Economic and Monetary Union laid down at Maastricht. A year later, the plan is hopelessly off target. According to the plan, fixed capital formation should have grown by 3.2 per cent in 1992. In the event, it fell by 3 per cent during the year and by 6 per cent in the last quarter. The construction sector, which should have shown 2.4 per cent growth, shrank by 4 per cent and by 6.3 per cent in the last three months of the year. At the begining of 1992, Mr Solchaga's economic team forecast a GDP growth rate of 3.3 per cent, which was marginally trimmed four months later to 3 per cent by the Convergence Plan. The estimates were mere wishful thinking. In the last quarter of 1992 GDP grew by only 0.2 per cent and Spain formally entered a recession. Inflation, which came down to 4 per cent year on year in February against 5.4 per cent at the end of December was the sole element in the Convergence Plan in line with last April's forecasts. Nevertheless, the fall in prices owed virtually everything to the economy's accelerated depression. The government's main problem is that it continues to treat convergence towards economic and monetary union as an article of faith; as usually occurs among those embracing a dogma, it is quite unaware of the disbelief among others. The markets do not have much time for the convergence criteria and, should there be a fast-track Europe, they are entirely sceptical about Spain running on it. Midway through last year, the markets began to make the obvious point that the peseta was overvalued in the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system and they forced it to devalue within the mechanism by 5 per cent in September and by 6 per cent in November. By far the cruellest cut came earlier this year from Mr Jacques Delors, the EC commission president. He was widely quoted as saying that Spain could not expect to join the inner EMU core when more than 20 per cent of its labour force was unemployed. Mr Solchaga testily replied that employment was not one of Maastricht's convergence criteria; he was perfectly right in saying so. However the response that Mr Delors, and for that matter the markets, were looking for had to do with the credibility of the Spanish economy and Mr Solchaga did not have one readily available. In the past weeks the people who matter in the Spanish economy - and that means the business community, not the policy makers - have indicated that they no longer believe in either the Convergence Plan or economic and monetary union. Their disbelief is likely to gather momentum. The business community accuses the government of putting the economy into a straitjacket. Convergence is likened to a corset that has squeezed market enterprise to the point that it can scarcely breathe. Last year profits were down almost across the board and 847 companies applied for protection from their creditors. The number of companies that entered receivership last year was only slightly less than the total in 1982 when Spain's previous slump peaked but the accumulated debts last year of the troubled businesses stood at Pta780bn (Dollars 6.6bn) which in constant pesetas was nearly double the 1982 debt total. Mr Solchaga is now warning that things will get worse before they get better. Few in Spain see any significant recovery this year and bad debts are set to accumulate. Business in Spain is fettered by two sets of chains. The first is the very high cost of borrowing - the Bank of Spain's official intervention rate stands at 13 per cent - which the government maintains in order to defend the peseta within the exchange rate mechanism and to attract capital inflows that will finance the budget deficit. The second shackle is the government's unwillingness in an election year to liberalise an extremely rigid labour legislation that makes lay-offs prohibitively expensive. It is hard to find a senior business executive in Spain who does not believe that sooner if not later the government will kick-start the economy by devaluing the peseta and cutting interest rates. After this year's elections, what is left of the Convergence Plan is almost certain to be thrown out of the window.</p>

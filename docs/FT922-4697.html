			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken loss grows to SKr1.97bn in quarter NORDBANKEN, Sweden's state-controlled bank, suffered a SKr1.97bn (Dollars 345m) loss in the first quarter of the year, representing a 13 per cent fall from the SKr1.745bn loss made for the same period of 1991, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The bank said the further deterioration in its performance stemmed from a deepening of the crisis in financial and property companies, particularly in Sweden, which had borrowed heavily from the bank. The total credit losses amounted to SKr3.208bn for the first quarter. The recent collapse of Coronado, the Swedish property company, occurred after the end of the first quarter, but would add to the bank's overall losses. Nordbanken's financial results before credit losses worsened by 19 per cent in the first quarter to SKr1.238bn from SKr1.752bn for the same period of 1991. Credit loss for the whole of this year is expected to total SKr6bn-SKr8bn, making it impossible to fulfil its capital adequacy ratio requirement this year or in 1993, without a strengthening of its capital base. In order to rescue the bank from its growing difficulties it was agreed last month the Swedish state would buy the whole of Nordbanken from its remaining shareholders and restructure it.</p>

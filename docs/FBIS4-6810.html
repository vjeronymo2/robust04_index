			<p>BFN     [Text] Regarding a misunderstanding between Thailand and  Cambodia, the prime minister has said that certain countries  could be harboring prejudice against Thailand, so therefore the  mass media should cooperate by filing reports that concern  Thailand and Cambodia in ways that help restore good  understanding between the two countries. The prime minister  said this at Government House this afternoon.    [Begin recording] [Chuan] This was a topic discussed in the  National Security Council meeting, to the effect that some  countries appeared to be prejudiced. Therefore, the mass media  is asked to cooperate.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will the government readjust  its policy toward Cambodia?    [Chuan] I said two days ago that there would be no changes  in the policy.    [Second correspondent] Did the military give you any new  information? Did it ask for approval to carry out any action?    [Chuan] No. It was I who invited the defense minister and  the supreme commander to discuss issues which were touched upon  earlier, such as the border and the Cambodian issues. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  told newsmen after his meeting today with the prime minister  that he informed Chuan that he would inspect the Cambodian  border in Ubon Ratchathani and Trat Provinces. He would listen  to briefings by local officials and visit the border areas where  residents might be affected in order to gather information for  planning appropriate measures.    Prasong said the Thai ambassador in Phnom Penh has been  sending him regular reports and has tried to call on the  Cambodian Government to clarify matters and to request certain  documents, such as photographs. The photographs concerned have  not been supplied so far. The ambassador reported this  morning that from 2-7 May Samdech Norodom Sihanouk will hold a  roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge  with the aim of creating national reconciliation. This  roundtable meeting is a good idea.    The foreign minister said he hopes that the problems will be  resolved. Diplomatic measures will have to be carried out  promptly in order to achieve understanding between the two  countries. Regarding the Thai military's reaction to the  Cambodian Government's conduct, the foreign minister said the  military probably wanted to gauge the people's reaction. The  people's tolerance also has its limits. Regarding possible  interference by third countries, the foreign minister said the  issue could not be verified at this time. Therefore, it is not  prudent to charge any country of interference unless there is  evidence to substantiate it.</p>

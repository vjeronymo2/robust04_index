It was learned that consultations over this  matter will be discussed among related ministries soon to settle  this matter.    A government official said on 27 February: "Considering our  relations with Russia and North Korea, the government has not  accepted requests to defect from North Korean loggers who escape  from logging camps in Siberia. However, since the number of  those who want to defect is over 100, this is a matter that can  no longer be ignored. A meeting of related ministries will be  held and a final decision made on whether to allow the North  Korean loggers to defect."    This official also revealed: "The government has already  held a meeting with the National Unification Board [NUB]; the  Foreign, Home Affairs, and Justice Ministries; and the Agency  for National Security Planning [NSP] to deal with this matter.  They agreed to examine the possibility of their defection."    An official who participated in this meeting said:  "Diplomatic problems with Russia and China could arise if the  North Korean loggers are allowed to seek asylum and settle in  the ROK. We have, however, generally agreed to allow them to  seek asylum from a humanitarian perspective."    In the news conference on the first anniversary of his  inauguration on 25 February, President Kim Yong-sam said: "The  issue of allowing the North Korean loggers in Siberia to defect  is a matter that must be examined at the international law  level. However, basically, we will deal with this matter from a  humanitarian and human rights perspective." An official said:  "Director-level officials of the NUB; the Foreign, Home Affairs,  and Justice Ministries; and the NSP will hold a meeting to deal  with this matter. Before allowing the North Korean loggers to  defect, discussions will be held on requesting Russia to issue  exit visas and on how to deal with the problems that will arise  if they settle in the ROK."    In addition to our embassy and consulate general in Russia,  the North Korean loggers are seeking asylum at our embassies in  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Recently, the Chinese Embassy there  has also been flooded with defection requests. It is being  pointed out that it is urgent to take measures regarding this  matter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  accepted the resignation tendered by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang  Friday and named Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and National  Unification minister, to succeed Yi Hoe-chang as new prime  minister.    President Kim told his secretaries to submit to the  National Assembly on Saturday a bill asking for parliamentary  endorsement of his appointment of Yi Yong-tok as new prime  minister.    Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik said  in an announcement soon after Yi Hoe-chang's weekly Chongwadae  [meeting] reporting that "Prime Minister Yi tendered his  resignation as prime minister at 5 p.m. and President Kim  accepted it promptly."    President Kim met Prime Minister Yi at Chongwadae for about  40 minutes beginning 4 p.m., during which the president was  learned to have reproached Yi in connection with his recent  behavior.    A source said that Prime Minister Yi did not express his  intent of resignation during his Chongwadae meeting with the  president.    But, on return to his office in the integrated government  building, Yi tendered his resignation through Government  Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha, the source said.    The acceptance by President Kim of Yi's resignation is taken  as the revelation of the president's determination to firm up  the discipline of the cabinet under the presidential system.    The president is expected to appoint a new deputy prime  minister and national unification minister soon after the  parliament endorsed the choice of Yi Yong-tok as new prime  minister.</p>

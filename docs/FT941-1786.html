			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Nordic states fear effect on referendums: 'All this is making Swedes ask: What kind of a Union is this?' A sense of irritation, frustration and mounting anxiety was evident in the Nordic capitals yesterday as the governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden watched their carefully laid plans to bring their reticent countries into the European Union threatened by a row they have no power to influence. The dispute between Britain and Spain and their 10 fellow EU members over voting rights after the three Nordic applicants and Austria enter the Union has shattered the optimistic mood that prevailed when accession terms were settled this month after months of tough negotiations. A compromise that will allow enlargement to go ahead is still expected in the north. But there is a growing fear that the issue will not be resolved for some time, leading to the entry date for the applicants - set for January 1 next year - being delayed and making the task of persuading the three already reluctant electorates to vote for membership in referendums in the autumn much more difficult. 'In the worst case scenario this could lead to a No vote in the referendum,' said a senior Swedish official. 'All this is making Swedes ask: 'What kind of a Union, what kind of an organisation, is this?' It is so stupid because it should have been sorted out long ago. And it is frustrating because there is nothing we can do about it.' The frustration is heightened because polls in Finland, Sweden and Norway had begun to show a strengthening of the Yes camp, leading the three governments to feel that they were at last beginning to win the referendum argument - even in Norway, where opposition is strongest. 'We have become fairly optimistic that if given a clear six months to explain the issues, we have a sporting chance to win. This is not going to help,' said an aide to Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister. The domestic embarrassment is especially acute for Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister whose conservative Moderate Party is close to the British Conservative Party. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, was in Stockholm on Tuesday, but offered little comfort, apparently telling Mr Bildt he was pessimistic about achieving a breakthrough on the voting issue. 'I think we understand the problems facing Major inside his party. But he has cornered himself. Of course we are concerned if Major is going to go back to the Thatcher attitude on Europe,' the Swedish official remarked. The three Nordic governments have by no means given up hope of a resolution and have been careful not to make apocalyptic public pronouncements. If a solution is found soon, attention in the referendum campaigns is likely to shift quickly back to the core issues of national sovereignty, the price of membership for the economy and, especially in Norway and Finland, the effects on agricultural and fishing communities. But those debates will be hard enough to win without additional squabbles reverberating from Brussels.</p>

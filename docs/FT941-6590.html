Prior to the takeover, the company had a successful record of growth and employment.' At the time of the Aspro acquisition last year, Airtours said the purchase would strengthen its markets in Wales, Northern Ireland and the south-west of England. It said Aspro's programmes to the eastern Mediterranean would complement Airtours' holidays to the western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. Airtours said yesterday that Aspro and its airline had now been fully integrated into its operations.

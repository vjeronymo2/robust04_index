			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The DPRK will consider a declaration of war any kind  of sanction promoted by the United States against the DPRK in  order to to solve the nuclear disagreement on the peninsula. The  daily paper RODONG SHINMUN affirms that the U.S. Government is  exacerbating the situation by pressuring Pyongyang to accept a  total inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  threatening to take the nuclear problem before the UN Security  Council.    North Korea has repeatedly denied charges that it is  developing nuclear weapons on its territory and rejected the  inspection by the international agency arguing that its  installations are devoted to peaceful ends.    The DPRK calls unjustified the position that has been taken  by the White House and insists that a negotiated solution can be  reached only through talks between Washington and Pyongyang, in  order to reach a global agreement.</p>

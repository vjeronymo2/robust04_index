			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Observer: Scriblerus club Lord Hailsham, former Lord Chancellor, grows increasingly eccentric with age. His new book, Values: Collapse and Cure, about a spiritual crisis he underwent in 1992, is being produced in a facsimile of his handwriting, just as he presented it to his publisher, HarperCollins. Or maybe it saves on typesetting bills. Still, for a man of 87, the handwriting is remarkably legible - even when in Latin.</p>

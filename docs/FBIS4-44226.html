			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Challenge for EU Supporters"] </F>   [Text] From the point of view of the European Union [EU]  supporters, we are presenting anything but good news today with  the latest Opinion A/S opinion poll on the Norwegians' attitudes  to membership in the EU. The opponents have increased and the  supporters decreased since the last opinion poll in May. At the  same time another poll shows that the undecideds in North Norway  are about to become opponents. If the replies in the poll are  to be believed, a majority of the Norwegian people will say no  to EU membership regardless of what happens in the referenda in  Finland and Sweden.    In our poll 44 percent said no and 35 percent said yes to  the  following question: "If Sweden and Finland become members of the  EU, how will you vote?" So the supporters of Norwegian EU  membership are losing ground following the government's  presentation of a negotiation outcome that is very good,  particularly as regards our fisheries policy.    The opinion polls from Sweden indicate that on that side of  the border it is the proponents who have finally gotten on the  offensive. Granted, only 3O.5 percent are as yet saying yes,  while 40 percent say no. But this is an improvement of 4.5  percent for the proponents and a loss of 4.8 percent for the  opposing side.    And then there is the peculiar situation with 59.4 percent  of  the Icelanders saying yes to an EU membership the country has  not even applied for yet. The majority are giving the fisheries  resolution Norway obtained as their reason for saying yes. It  is a healthy Norwegian trait to be skeptical of the authorities  and the politicians. But at this point the skeptics must also  ask themselves what the alternative would be to participating,  along with Finland and Sweden, in that European community on  whose door even Iceland is now knocking.    Because, contrary to what the Center and the Socialist Left  parties are saying, the alternative to participating in the fora  where our common European future is being forged is not to carry  on as before. Whether you like it or not, we already are in a  new, more demanding reality than only a few years ago. The  great challenge for Norwegian farmers is the requirements that  issue from the revised agreement on tariffs and trade. It is the  GATT agreement that draws up the broad international regulations  matrix that both the EU and we will have to respect.    Of course the Norwegian opponents have a right to say no.  But they should also try a little skepticism towards their own  reasoning. Because those vital Norwegian interests that they  claim to protect by saying no are also the EU proponents' basis  for saying yes at the upcoming referendum. Having said that, we  also want to say that it is the EU proponents who should see  this latest poll as a challenge. We have six months to go until  the referendum. But that battle is lost unless the Norwegian  supporters of the EU go on the offensive the way their  counterparts in Sweden have succeeded in doing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Latvia's Way Will Not Break </F> the Coalition With the Farmers Union"]    [Text] Riga, 29 Apr -- During a meeting today with  representatives of the mass media, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs expressed the conviction that Latvia's Way could form a  coalition even without the Farmers Union, but it will naturally  try to maintain the present coalition as long as possible, and,  for its part, will never attempt to break it.    The threat to the ruling coalition arose after the Wednesday  [27 April] vote of Farmers Union deputies in the Saeima  [parliament] concerning the case of rescinding the mandates of  the Saeima "five" [deputies accused of KGB collaboration], but,  as Birkavs stated today, it was a vote of conscience which  cannot be attributed to factional discipline. V. Birkavs also  expressed the view that the signing of the agreements with  Russia could mean "the end of the coalition." Nonetheless, the  prime minister admitted that no changes in the government are  being planned for the present time. There also have been no  concrete proposals on this matter from the Farmers Union --  "there are only some attempts to increase one's own influence by  taking advantage of the unstable situation."    Considering the possibilities that could result from an  eventual split in the coalition, V. Birkavs first of all  mentioned the creation of a new coalition which will be able to  fulfill the economic policy of Latvia's Way, with perhaps some  contributions regarding a few portfolios or a slight slowdown in  the pace of reform. Latvia's Way, however, will never consent  to a radical alteration of course. The creation of the  coalition can be problematic, because Latvia's Way has its  supporters in foreign policy, as well as in economic and social  policies, but they do not represent one definite political group  or direction. The consultations with these supporters are being  held on an ongoing basis. V. Birkavs described it as a  strengthening of the existing coalition. As a second  possibility which may arise if the present coalition ceases to  exist, V. Birkavs mentioned the support which Latvia's Way will  render in the process of creating a new government based on  radical national forces. At the same time, however, Latvia's  Way will not fail to point out the losses which Latvia could  incur.</p>

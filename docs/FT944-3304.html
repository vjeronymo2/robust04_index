			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Recruitment: Don't throw away those gold watches - Assumptions that lifetime employment is a thing of the past are being challenged The debate about whether we have a job for life has reached an interesting stage in the life-cycle of a trend. First we have the observations of the trend spotters, in this case and perhaps most prominently management writer Charles Handy, whose observations and anecdotes are striking chords of recognition among many employees and managers. Second we have the academics who test the theory. What often happens with such trend observations is that they attract disciples who accept them as gospel truth. This stimulates the academics, who then take great delight in demolishing or blowing holes in the theory. There follows a period of calm in which the trend is found to be not a trend at all, or where its real strength emerges. In the 'end of jobs for life' debate, we have reached the second stage. Last week Simon Burgess and Hedley Rees at Bristol University published findings which suggested that many more people than might have been expected are spending their working lifetimes with the same employer. Peter Robinson, a researcher at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics, welcomed the findings, which, he said, was 'nailing another myth' about the labour market. He pointed out that in the US, where many similar trend observations have been made, the proportion of employees reporting they had been in their existing jobs for more than eight years had hardly changed in the 21 years from 1979 to 1991. So what are we to conclude? Have the seers got it it wrong, or are their often anecdotal observations alerting us to the beginnings of a large-scale change? Should we, in fact, ignore the evidence of our own eyes and experiences? Robinson says we should at least be guarded about what we might believe from our observations. Take short-term contract working, for example. Surely this is becoming far more widespread? Not so, he says. 'The tendency is to look around you and see what's happening in your own area. I and my colleagues are all on temporary contracts now, but when you look at the proportion of employees on temporary contracts you see it hasn't changed between 1984 and 1994.' Part of the problem with such academic observations is that they are far less fun for consultants and writers - including journalists - who make their livings from trend spotting. They may also have their flaws in that their findings are historical. Robinson does not deny that there may be a trend. What he is saying is that the evidence suggests the changes may be far more gradual than we have assumed. When change does happen, however, it sometimes takes time to gain momentum. Many of the changes in work patterns emanating from the industrial revolution mainly took place in about 30 or 40 years around the turn of the 18th century. Some people are asking whether the information technology revolution will prove a similar watershed in the way we work. The tension between popular observation and hard statistical analysis does nothing to clear the confusion among employees and job applicants who would really like to know what to do for the best. University graduates could be forgiven for becoming particularly cynical They are courted by the large companies on the university milkround, yet they are becoming increasingly sceptical about the prospects on offer. The careers department that serves both Manchester University and Umist (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) has started a scheme which is trying to encourage more small and medium-sized businesses to take an interest in graduates. Chris Phillips, the department's deputy director, said: 'We need to do this because the large companies will continue to recruit graduates but nothing near enough to keep up with the increase in the numbers of graduates leaving universities.' Such careers-orientated schemes are particularly appealing for Umist, which likes its students to take part in company-based research projects, utilising disciplines learned in their first year. Dale Littler, Umist professor of marketing said the university's approach, which avoids set texts, tries to encourage students to think strategically about their work and to obtain first-hand knowledge of company expectations in project work. Abilities to do the work, complete reports, carry out presentations and meet deadlines are all tested in the workplace. The benefit to companies is that findings can be used to their advantage. In one project, a team of Umist students suggested improvements to a new banking kiosk developed by the Co-operative Bank. 'Some of the solutions to the things they are working on are not found in text books,' said Littler. The separate careers scheme, in turn, gives companies which might usually consider taking on graduates the opportunity to put them through their paces without any obligation or commitment. Some interesting findings on student expectations and approaches to their jobs have been discovered by John Arnold, lecturer in organisational psychology at Umist, in research he carried out with Kate Mackenzie Davey at Birkbeck College, London. They found that absence or provision of clear career paths had a strong influence on whether graduates stayed with an organisation or left. It also found that they had a preference for being developed through the work they did rather than through theory in training programmes. This again seems to point to quite conservative tendencies among graduates. In other words, if companies are offering well defined career paths, they should maintain their promise. They might also devise projects or programmes that enable them to use their graduate recruits as performing assets from the start of their employment. Returning to the theme that things may not be always as they seem. No sooner had I reported on a trend among recruiters to seek out competencies from job applicants that was questioning the need for such things as curriculum vitae and paper qualifications, than I came across a system for sifting CVs that is being widely used in the US and which promises to streamline recruitment and sifting procedures for recruiters. The more thoroughly composed the CV, the greater advantage there is for the system. The system, called Resumix - there are other CV database systems on the market but Resumix, based in Santa Clara, California, has patents for its information sifting method - was devised about six years ago and has been on the US market for about two years. Whereas part of the recruiter's art is to sift and funnel applicants into a digestible interviewable group, Resumix acts like a bucket, scanning as many CVs as you want to put in it. The information on them is stored and when you have a job which has a particular skill or qualification requirement, all you need do is punch in the particular skills you are looking for and it spouts out a list of names. Mercury Communications, which is using the system to select from the 8,000 graduate applications it will have received by the end of March, says it has made the selection process much speedier. By retaining names on a database, employers can sift through for any number of jobs they please and applicants' CVs which would otherwise be filed away and forgotten if they were unsuccessful in their specific job application can be instantly reappraised for other job openings. It is proving particularly popular among the big mass recruiters in the US such as IBM and Disney. So the CV is dead, long live the CV. The potential of such systems seems enormous. It may be worth questioning at some stage whether there is any potential for abuse. The day when all our CVs are on such systems may not be far away. If we have a job for life, however, we should only need to use them once.</p>

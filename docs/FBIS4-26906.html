			<p>BFN     [Text] Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party  committee and president of the party school of the provincial  party committee, led the comrades of concerned departments  directly under the province, in handling work on the spot at the  party school of the provincial party committee. After hearing  reports by the party school of the provincial party committee,  Cheng Weigao stated his views about issues of how to strengthen  the party school and solve the problems in cadres' education.  He stressed that to develop the economy, emphasis should be  placed on cadres; and that to improve cadres, emphasis should be  placed on party schools.    Cheng Weigao said that at present, attention should be paid  to four aspects of party school work.    First, we should conscientiously carry out the guiding  spirit  of the central instructions concerning the strengthening of the  party school work and further clarify the nature,  characteristics, obligations, reform direction, and objectives  of the party school. Under the leadership of the party  committee, party school is the school to educate and train the  party's cadres according to the requirements of the socialist  modernization, is an important front for training leading cadres  at all levels, developing the theoretical backbone, and studying  and doing research of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and  is also the furnace for cadres to strengthen the tempering of  the party spirit. Party schools at all levels should place  their work emphasis on enhancing the quality of cadres,  especially the quality of party and government leading cadres at  all levels, and, through party school education, further turn  party and government cadres, especially leading cadres, into  ones who meet the needs in developing the socialist market  economy and who have political integrity and ability, strong  party spirit, and good work style. Party schools at all levels  should conscientiously carry out the spirit of the "opinions of  the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the party school work  under the new situation" and successfully conduct party school  reform closely, in line with the actual conditions of Hebei and  guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This  overall principle must be firmly adhered to. What kind of  talented persons should party schools train, what are the  problems of the persons to be trained, and what problems should  we emphatically solve in developing these types of talented  persons? If this question and the objective of training are not  clarified, the reform of the teaching of party schools will not  succeed. There are three main tasks for the party school of the  provincial party committee: 1) To cultivate leading cadres, 2)  to play a teacher-training role among party schools and train  teachers for party schools at all levels, and 3) to conduct  theoretical study. The first two points are the main focus.  Reform is the way to successfully build the two civilizations  in Hebei, and the crux is cadres. The party school assumes the  main responsibility of enhancing the quality and the level of  cadres.    Second, in the reform of the education of the party school,  we should emphasize mastery of one theory, learning of two  knowledges, establishment of one concept, and initiation of one  spirit. The one theory is the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.  At present, many cadres in Hebei still have a long way to go to  thoroughly understand and comprehensively master Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. For example, they often fail in handling the  three cardinal issues on work practice. 1) They fail to uphold  well the cardinal viewpoint that "development is the essential  criterion." 2) They fail to uphold the criterion of "three  advantages." When anything comes up, some cadres still  contemplate first upon whether it belongs to socialism or  capitalism and banish the "three advantages" from their minds.  3) They fail to successfully adhere to the policy of "attaching  equal importance to two tasks and never wavering in either."  One manifestation is "doing well in one task but not in the  other;" and the other is that both tasks are not done well.  Even persons in charge of the spiritual civilization do not do  tasks well and lack boldness and assurance. Hence, party  schools at all levels should regard the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the central substance  of their teaching, adhere to arming leading cadres at all  levels and the whole party with this theory without wavering,  work with perseverance, and, by our effort, enable party and  government leading cadres at all levels to have a comprehensive,  in-depth, and correct understanding of the scientific system of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and to firmly and consciously adhere to  the party's basic line.    Knowledge of the socialist market economy and knowledge  of modern science and technology comprise the two knowledges. A  large number of our comrades are influenced by the system of the  planned economy and are accustomed to the old, stereotypical way  of thinking and working. They apply lots of old thinking and  very little new knowledge. For young cadres, the socialist  market economy and modern scientific and technological knowledge  are also a new field of knowledge. Therefore, unless the vast  number of cadres across the province take the learning of the  two knowledges as a priority, they cannot meet the requirements  of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist  market economy. Party schools at all levels should make the  "two knowledges" an essential element in teaching.    One concept refers to the concept of the party spirit. Some  of our leading cadres, with few years of party standing and  little party nurturing, joined the party without any test or  risk. Some cadres lack revolutionary steadfastness, and their  party spirit and sense of the party are vague. They have not  established a correct outlook on the world, life, and values,  and they cannot adopt the correct attitude towards the relations  between the individual and the organization and between the  individual and the masses. Some cadres do not even know the  party's elementary rules. Thus it can be seen that the  political quality of the cadre contingent is in need of prompt  improvement. As party schools are the schools of the party,  they should stress the education on the party spirit and give  priority to strengthening the cultivation and tempering of  cadres with party spirit.    One spirit is the spirit of arduous effort in pioneering a  new cause. Some cadres are influenced by the ideas of money  worship, pleasure-seeking, and extreme individualism. They seek  fame and gain, covet comfort, and lack the spirit of sacrifice,  solid work, arduous efforts, and pioneering of an undertaking.  They lack arduous efforts in work, in thinking, and in style,  their spirit in making painstaking and enterprising efforts is  weak, and they have thrown away the fine traditions and work  styles of the party. In view of the actual ideological level of  cadres, party schools should intensify the education on arduous  effort to call back the cadres' spirit of pioneering an  undertaking through arduous effort so that their political  quality can be improved significantly.    Third, the crux of running party schools well is to pay  attention to the teaching and research contingent. Party school  teachers are the backbone force of party school education. All  party school teachers, backbone force of teaching, and  administrative leading cadres must possess higher political and  vocational quality. Above all, they should be tempered well  with party spirit to continuously upgrade their level of party  spirit. Party schools should stick to the policy of integrating  theory with practice in their teaching. Teaching from book to  book and from theory to theory without knowing practice and the  ideological trend of cadres, they cannot solve problems. The  organization department and the propaganda department should  often study party school work with the party school of the  provincial party committee and provide it with the materials  concerning the ideological and the working conditions of the  cadre contingent. The organization department and the actual  working department must give support and convenience for party  school teachers to conduct social survey and investigation and  study. Party school teachers may work in departments, bureaus,  cities, counties, and enterprises. The party school of the  provincial party committee may also organize and send groups to  outside the border and outside the country to conduct  observation activities or undergo training in order to widen  their field of vision and constantly strengthen the ability of  integrating theory with practice.    Fourth, party committees at all levels must conscientiously  attach importance to party school work and really solve the  practical problems in the construction of party schools. The  primary task of party committees at all levels is to pay  attention to the building of the cadre contingent; and to  improve the cadre contingent, party schools should be improved.  To develop the economy, emphasis should be placed on cadres;  and to improve cadres, emphasis should be placed on party  schools. Two points should be focused in building the party  school. 1) We should build a good contingent of the party  school, stabilize it, and continuously improve its overall  quality. We should make sure that this contingent is improving  and be concerned about its work and life. 2) We should build the  infrastructure of party schools well, improve the condition of  running schools, and continuously enhance the ability of running  schools. The construction of the party school is an important  aspect of party building, and there should be no grudge in  investing in this aspect and spending money on party building  and the spiritual civilization.    With regard to teaching, capital construction projects, the  teachers and the students' work, and some specific problems in  learning, Cheng Weigao along with the comrades of the  departments directly under the province studied the opinions on  ways to deal with them and resolved a batch of problems in need  of urgent solutions.    Li Zhanshu, standing committee member and secretary general  of the provincial party committee, attended the on-the-spot  handling of work.</p>

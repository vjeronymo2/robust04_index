			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / EU aid for Portugal Portugal is to receive Es4,450bn (Pounds 17bn) in European Union aid over the next six years - more than twice as much as in the previous six years - according to an agreement signed yesterday, writes Peter Wise from Lisbon. The aid, equivalent to about 3 per cent of Portugal's gross domestic product over the six years, will be made up of Es3,250bn in direct transfers from the EU and Es1,200bn in low-interest loans from the European Investment Bank. Most of the funds will be spent on transport infrastructure. Economists estimate the aid will mobilise total private and government investment of more than Es10,000bn up to 1999 and create 100,000 jobs.</p>

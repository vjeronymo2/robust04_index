			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Bosnian Serbs bent on revenge Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared a full-scale state of war at the weekend in the wake of the biggest setback suffered by Serb forces since fighting began in Bosnia. Serb troops in Croatia also went on a state of alert along the border with Bosnia yesterday, but UN peacekeepers said there was no evidence they had crossed over to assist the Bosnian Serb army. These moves came as Bosnian government forces continued their offensive in the north-west, raising fears of a Bosnian Serb counter-attack against Bihac, the Moslem enclave which is one of six UN safe areas in Bosnia. 'If the pocket is attacked, the UN will have no choice but to request Nato air support,' said Mr Colin Murphy, UN spokesman in Sarajevo. In a sign of possible plans for a counter-attack, Mr Karadzic ordered a general mobilisation in his self-styled Serb state. Over the past week, Bosnian Serb forces have lost some 200 sq km in the north-west. The Bosnian Serbs are isolated after being cut off three months ago by their patron, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. There is even speculation Mr Karadzic has engineered the stunning losses in a bid to force Mr Milosevic to abandon his blockade against the Bosnian Serbs. But Belgrade's state media has imposed a total news black-out on the losses. Renewed fighting erupted yesterday after the mostly Moslem government forces encircled Bosanska Krupa, a Serb-held town on the River Una in the north-west. In an unconfirmed report, Sarajevo radio said government forces had entered the town. Serb forces from Bosnia and Croatia have surrounded the dense Moslem pocket in the north-west for most of the 31-month war. But last week the Bosnian Fifth Corps drove Serb forces from the Grabez plateau, strategic high ground above Bihac town. Up to 10,000 civilians have fled the area and Serb soldiers have abandoned tanks and other hardware to their foes. In Sarajevo, Mr Murphy said the UN was considering using air power against government forces in the nearby demilitarised zone who have been launching attacks on Serb-held territory. General Rose, British leader of UN forces in Bosnia, issued a similar threat earlier this month, but it is likely the US would be opposed. The Bosnian Serbs meanwhile released four British UN soldiers detained in the Kupres region of central Bosnia last week on suspicion of spying. Russia would withdraw its peacekeeping troops from former Yugoslavia if Nato gained ultimate control over whether to use force, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, said yesterday. On Friday Nato approved a deal with the UN on plans for joint bombing operations in Bosnia. Though Nato officials stressed there would be no change in the basic 'dual key' command structure under which Nato supports UN decisions, Mr Kozyrev warned against its abolition.</p>

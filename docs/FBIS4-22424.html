			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jukka Knuuti, Ministry of Defense special </F> advisor: "Is a Russian Attack Possible?"]    [Text] The Swede writing under the pseudonym Harry Winter  has written a scenario on how Russia will occupy the Baltic  countries"    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian parliamentary  elections were greeted in the Baltic newspapers with headlines  including: "What Was Feared Has Happened." A party with  significant strength that demands the return of the Baltic area  to the "empire" is not really desired in the Baltic countries.    In Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania people know all too well  that among leading circles in Russia there are those for whom it  is difficult to approve of the independence of the three  republics. After all, they were a part of Russia since the Great  Northern War at the beginning of the 1700's with the exception  of a short period of independence between the World Wars.    Indignation and concern were aroused last summer by the  staff  exercise carried out by the Russian Northwest Group of Forces,  the former Baltic Military District, having the theme of a  renewed occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This  provocative exercise is a subplot like the repeatedly alleged  submarine violations of Swedish territorial waters, in the new  Swedish book by Harry Winter, Operation Narva, which  portrays an attempt to seize the Baltic countries back for  Russia.    The secret project is organized behind the back of the  political leadership by the KGB of the former Soviet Union, now  the Security Ministry (which Yeltsin ordered reorganized last  Christmas) and its foreign intelligence wing, which is  subordinated directly to the president (and whose head, Yevgeniy  Primakov, warned in November that any decision by NATO to accept  the countries of East Europe as members would lead to  countermeasures by Moscow) and the military intelligence  organization GRU.    In the book the provocation bringing Russian armed forces  back into the Baltic countries is planned through having KGB  agents disguised as local ultrapatriotic groups undertake  terrorism against the Russian minority living in those  countries, which would give the Russian armed forces a reason to  go to the aid of their countrymen.    The Swedes are tied in through the fact that the KGB  organized a wave of robberies of the weapons depots of the  Swedish defense forces and the evidence was supposed to point to  the oppressors of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia.  The weapon thefts were successful, but the conspiracy in the  Baltic countries failed, and the former KGB and GRU plotters  were imprisoned.  <H5>  A Prophecy? </H5>   Has Winter written a prophecy, the basis for which is found  not only in Zhirinovskiy's election victory but also in the new  Russian military doctrine that was approved at the beginning of  last November? In it the infringement of the legitimate  interests of citizens of the Russian Federation in other  countries is regarded as a military danger. At the same time it  considers it possible to maintain troops outside its borders if  the interests of the Russian Federation so demand. Harry  Winter's tale is not necessarily credible, but it is interesting  in combining a lot of facts with the fiction.    The pseudonym Harry Winter, under which the book was  written,  is well known in Sweden. The three-part novel Operation  Garbo telling about an attack on Sweden contemplated by the  Soviet Union was published in the years 1988-91. The book became  a best-seller because the person behind the pseudonym was known  to be very knowledgeable about what was said in the book. Harry  Winter was said to be a joint pseudonym for retired Colonel Bo  Hugemark, the journalist Lars Richardson (now an aide to Prime  Minister Carl Bildt), and a researcher who is now working in the  Swedish Foreign Ministry, Ingemar Doerfer. Operation  Narva, however, is primarily Hugemark's handiwork.    The popularity of Operation Garbo was increased by  the fact that the books are to a certain extent romans a clef.  Several of their characters were modeled more or less in the  image of actual persons operating in Swedish domestic politics.</p>

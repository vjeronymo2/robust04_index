			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Recession trims First Leisure interim profit - Pounds 70m discos and bowling alleys expansion planned over the next two years FIRST LEISURE, the ten-pin bowling, discotheque and theatre group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits lower at Pounds 11.7m, compared with Pounds 12.1m, for the half year to May 3 1992. The results reflected the continued effect of the recession, with turnover showing a marginal decline from Pounds 46.88m to Pounds 46.11m, as spending was reduced. Lord Delfont, chairman, said that the group had yet to experience any sustained improvement in customer demand and he expected difficult trading conditions to prevail throughout the second half. Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group managed to hold ground in some key divisions and he expected an improvement in second half trading, particularly in discotheques and bowling, as more new openings and refurbishments come on stream. He said that the expansion programme would be unaffected by the current trading climate. There are three discos and eight bowling alleys planned to open over the next two years, which together with refurbishments will involve a Pounds 35m a year capital expenditure plan. The profit was struck after taking account of a decline from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 1.03m on property disposal profits but after a drop in interest charges from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.6m. Earnings per share rose, from 5.83p to 5.88p, and the interim dividend is raised to 1.88p from 1.745p. The resorts business, which includes Blackpool Tower, turned in the best relative performance, increasing pre-tax profit 17 per cent to Pounds 1.4m after fine Easter weather improved demand. Profits from ten-pin bowling Pounds 7.2m, with Mr Conlan pointing out that last year's figures also benefited from four new outlets, compared with just one for this period. Discotheques profits declined from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 6.1m, with the jewel in the group's crown - the Empire (now Equinox) in London's Leicester Square - closed for a Pounds 2m refurbishment. COMMENT Sticking slowly but tenaciously to its unglamorous niches, First Leisure continues to enhance its market share and maintain its margins. Yesterday's interim figures were a bit better than expected and the company is confident of second-half improvement as refurbishments and expansion pay off. But its warnings of tough second-half trading led to a shaving of full-year forecasts to around Pounds 32m for a p/e of 19. The rating fully reflects First Leisure's recessionary strengths and growth potential when the economy improves. Investors looking for greater exhilaration in the leisure sector will find it more diversified and underperforming stocks.</p>

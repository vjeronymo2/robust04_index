			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / People: Morrison makes tracks northward The team which will operate ScotRail as a shadow franchise in the structure of British Rail due to come into force from next April has gained a strong addition with the appointment of Bill Morrison as its financial adviser. Morrison, 55, takes up his ScotRail appointment on October 1 when he retires as deputy UK senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick. Last month Chris Green, one of British Rail's high flyers, was named director designate of the ScotRail shadow franchise, one of the pilot projects leading to the franchising of selected rail services. Green said then that his management team would 'definitely be bidding for the franchise when the director general of franchising puts it on offer' - within six months to a year from the beginning of shadow operations. Green joins Scot-Rail on April 1 next year when he gives up being managing director of InterCity, which is to be broken up. Morrison's appointment is the first of a financial adviser to a shadow franchise. Born in Glasgow, he has been an accountant all his working life, starting with Thomson McLintock which merged with Peat Marwick in 1987. He has had a number of non-executive directorships and is to join the board of Scottish Amicable. He is chairman of the auditing practices board of the UK and Ireland, and is to be chairman of the executive committee of the joint disciplinary scheme of the UK accounting profession.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Portugal's stance on Europe and the 12  June European Parliament elections have sparked commentaries in  the Lisbon press.  <H5>  PSD, PS Candidates Discussed </H5>   The choice of long-time Social Democratic Party (PSD)  luminary and former Deputy Prime Minister Eurico de Melo as head  of the PSD list for the Euroelections is considered "surprising"  by commentator Jose Antonio Saraiva in the 12 March Lisbon  weekly EXPRESSO. Inasmuch as European elections, which lack the  significance of legislative or municipal elections, often lead  voters to select a party other than their own, the determining  factor in the election is the identity of the head of the list,  Saraiva comments. Consequently, the difference in the June  Euroelections will be made by leader of the rightist Center  Social Democratic (CDS) party Manuel Monteiro, who is running  for the European Parliament on a platform of "nationalism"--as  opposed to the internationalist values of the European  community--that seems to be widely accepted by large groups of  people. In addition, Monteiro's youth personifies the revolt of  the new generation against the obligations assumed by the old.  Eurico de Melo, while certainly not anti-European, will  therefore be considered the "symbol of the old generation's  abdication to European interests." He will thus contribute to  the "aging" of the PSD, Saraiva concludes, adding that only  speculation can explain Cavaco Silva's choice. By choosing a  politician who made a smooth transition from legendary Prime  Minister 5a Carneiro's era to "Cavaco-ism" and who supported  Cavaco Silva from the outset, the prime minister may have wished  to bring internal pacification to his party, or he may have  launched a "trial balloon" to gauge de Melo's chances for the  next presidential elections.    Saraiva returns to the same theme in the 1 April EXPRESSO,  this time stressing the "defensive" side of Cavaco Silva's  choice. Fearing that Monteiro's nationalist discourse may  resonate in the social democratic electorate, the prime minister  sought a "conventional" candidate who cannot be suspected of  "Europeanist excesses," Saraiva contends. However, Cavaco Silva  may have erred. Monteiro, the embodiment of young urban voters  who "tasted the delights of Europe and did not like them," seeks  to represent youth revolt in a crisis of values that rejects  foreign influences and "rallies round the flag in a  future-oriented, post-European reaction." For his part, Eurico  de Melo's "non-Europeanism" is not a reaction to Portugal's  European experience, but the product of natural conservatism  anchored in the past, Saraiva comments. The Euroelections may  thus be reduced to a battle between "Euroenthusiasts," who will  vote for the European-minded Socialist Party (PS), and  "Euroskeptics," who will choose Monteiro's CDS.    According to Cristina Figueiredo writing in the 12 March  EXPRESSO, Northern politicians are "exulting" over Porto  resident Eurico de Melo's candidacy. In their opinion, Cavaco  Silva is indicating he will support him for the presidency,  provided de Melo obtains "at least" 40 percent of the June vote.  Diametrically opposed are those who believe that, while the  prime minister has definitely parried off a de Melo presidential  candidacy, simultaneously fielding an "illustrious" candidate  for the Europarliament, he has, in the process, lost a good  presidential candidate and created the problem of "reviving the  hopes of former President Ramalho Eanes," Figueiredo comments.    On the PS side, following a week of uncertainty and  "intensive talks" between leader Antonio Guterres and PS  luminary Vitor Constancio, the latter finally rejected  Guterres's offer to head the Euroelections list, writes Jeronimo  Pimentel in the 26 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO. The final  candidate is long-time party official Antonio Vitorino. Joao  Soares's nomination for the second spot relegated well-known PS  official Joao Cravinho to third place--even if Cravinho headed  the list in the 1989 Euroelections and is cited by Pimentel as  being "disappointed"--and may cause great intraparty confusion,  Pimentel comments. It will also expose Guterres to criticism for  the manner in which negotiations were conducted.    Constancio's presence at the head of the PS list would have  been a threat to Cavaco Silva and a success for Guterres,  contends Joao Amaral in the 26 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO.  While Europe continues to be an "eminently political" issue at a  theoretical level, it is an "essentially economic" question for  the people, who are less concerned with threats to national  sovereignty than with subsidies from Brussels, he writes.  Constancio, a "prestigious and moderate" politician as well as a  "respected and competent technocrat"--all Cavaco Silva's  attributes as well--would have been the "most Cavaco-ist" of the  candidates to the European Parliament and could have attracted  PSD voters, Amaral continues. Additionally, economist Constancio  has in-depth knowledge of his field, a factor of fundamental  importance to the man-in-the-street when he thinks of Europe.  Cavaco Silva must have "breathed a sigh of relief" when  Vitorino's choice was announced, Amaral comments.  <H5>  Stance on Europe </H5>   Writing in the 19 March EXPRESSO, Jose Antonio Saraiva  reviews the candidacies for the Europarliament. CDS leader  Manuel Monteiro is "feared" by other candidates for his  unabashed "patriotic" feelings. PSD candidate Eurico de Melo is  not considered a convinced Europeanist. Before choosing  Constancio, the PS sounded out Manuel Alegre, a "romantic" who  sees Portugal's future linked more to Africa and Brazil than to  the "bourgeois states" of Europe. Finally, the Communist Party's  (PCP) candidate, Luis Sa, is well-known for his anti-Europeanist  stance. Saraiva contends that advocating European unity is  increasingly considered a "sin" in Portugal. In their speeches,  ministers are now less eager to "exalt" the European ideal,  while they unceasingly stress that European integration will  safeguard Portuguese interests. Consequently, the PSD will have  to "use doubletalk" in the June elections: Eurico de Melo will  make "patriotic" speeches while the government simultaneously  concludes agreements that in fact will increasingly restrict  Portuguese sovereignty. Saraiva concludes that Euroelections may  thus be transformed into a public opinion poll centering on the  Portuguese perception of the future of Europe and the role  Portugal will play in it.    It is increasingly obvious that the initial enthusiasm for  Portugal's European integration is waning and that "two Europes"  are confronting each other in a Europe essentially defined by  market priorities and profits, writes Fernando Rosas in the 23  March PUBLICO. One is a community where unprecedented levels of  productivity and accumulation translate into a large-scale  offensive against employment, salaries, and social gains rather  than a fairer distribution of wealth, improved welfare, and  increased access to culture; a community where extraordinary  technological advances coexist with the most savage attacks  against the environment; a Europe that excludes its poor Eastern  and Southern neighbors; a world condemned to an anonymous and  uncontrolled bureaucracy, whose federalist ideal has been  reduced to "two speeds," Rosas contends. The other Europe is the  political heir of the the French Revolution, a community of  citizens, human and minority rights, secular institutions,  international solidarity, and the right to public education. In  sum, a Europe that largely represents "the heritage that  differentiates contemporary European culture," Rosas writes,  adding that a careful observation of social and political events  in the EU makes it uncertain whether these two Europes can  continue to coexist in the future.    "Suddenly, complete disorientation has occurred," exclaims  Jose Manuel Fernandes in a 19 March PUBLICO editorial in view of  the "grotesqueness" of the Euroelectoral campaign, in which all  parties are vying to field the most anti-Europeanist candidates.  In the view of both Cavaco Silva and Guterres, Euroelections are  a mere rehearsal for the 1995 legislative elections, and a  discussion of Europe holds no interest, Fernandes contends. Had  a referendum taken place over the ratification of the Maastricht  Treaty, it would have allowed the "ghosts" evoked by Manuel  Monteiro to be put to rest, he continues. The situation is more  complex at present, especially because Europe has generally been  reduced to a monetary question and to wrangling over Portugal's  share of community funds at the same time that a fundamental  issue such as intervention in Bosnia--which presupposes a common  foreign and defense policy--is ignored. In their haste to  outflank Monteiro, concludes Fernandes, the PSD and the PS seem  unsure of whether they want a "Europe of grants" with Portugal  waiting for handouts, or a gradually integrated and mighty  Europe where the strong help the weak, even at the cost of a  partial transfer of sovereignty.</p>

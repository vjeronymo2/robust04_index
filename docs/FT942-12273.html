			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Accidents in company cars up Company car drivers could be playing at least as big a role as thieves and vandals in sending insurance rates soaring, according to a survey of accident rates. Last year more than eight out of 10 drivers employed by companies using the Shrewsbury-based Fleet Management Services had an accident, according to its survey. The survey analysed reports to FMS's insurance claims management department last year. Directors and senior managers were the worst offenders, while the most common form of accident - 10 per cent of the total - was hitting obstructions while reversing.</p>

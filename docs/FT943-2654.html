			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (10): Has money, lives humbly - What makes a serious investor / For them, making money is a way of keeping score, says Gillian O'Connor, as she looks into serious investment mythology, and asks whether mere mortals can learn from the gods The Serious Investor is the antithesis of the Punter. Not for him a quick flutter on the back of a golf club tip. He regards investment as a vocation, and all his risks are calculated. Making money is his way of keeping score, so he probably makes a lot; but he often lives comparatively humbly. He spent several years working in investment management before branching out on his own, and now usually has a rather scathing view of most professional investment managers. He is probably American. The father of investment analysis was Benjamin Graham, born in London 100 years ago this year, but a Wall Streeter all his life. Co-author of the influential Security Analysis, a book more cited than read, he later wrote a popular and comprehensible manual, The Intelligent Investor. This is still in print today and well worth reading. Best known as the proponent of Value Investing, Graham actually outlined two distinct approaches to investment management: one for the defensive investor, the man who was not very interested and not prepared to take much risk; another for the enterprising investor. Defensive investment His portfolio for defensive investors was based on a bond/equity split with the equities spread among 10-30 sound blue chips. Update his thinking to take in the worldwide switch into equities, because of their greater resistance to inflation, and you have the kind of portfolio most professional investment managers recommend today. The basic concept is of a team whose members' qualities are complementary. Modern portfolio managers will, for instance, look for investments which normally move in opposite directions, in order to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. The defensive investor's heirs are mainly found among 'top down' managers - ones who create an identikit portfolio and then go out to look for stocks to put in it. Aggressive investment The enterprising investor is a dedicated stockpicker, who pays scant attention to portfolio theory. What he is looking for is shares which will do significantly better than the overall market. He is quite prepared to run a lumpy portfolio as long as all the lumps are of good quality. Graham identified two types of share which fit the enterprising investors needs: Growth shares - companies whose businesses and profits were expanding both rapidly and reliably, and whose shares were cheap in view of their potential; and 'Bargain issues' - companies whose current worth made their shares cheap on strictly mathematical criteria. Being a cautious man, Graham chose to concentrate exclusively on the latter. His criterion was that the share should be selling at not more than two thirds of net current assets per share, ie, assets excluding all fixed assets such as factories. Thus you count stock any cash or liquid investments, but knock off debts to suppliers, customers and any other creditors. You buy all shares selling at or below two thirds of net current assets per share, and sell once the share price reaches net current asset value. It is a purely objective mathematical system. Graham's most famous disciple is now the world's best known investor, Warren Buffett, the sage of Omaha and America's second richest man. All his wealth  -Pounds 5.5bn at the last count - comes from his own investments. He began by running an investment partnership, and now runs a public company called Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports have long been collector's items, and the company has recently taken to charging for them. The Buffett way Buffett has adopted but modified Graham's belief in bargain issues. Like Graham, he will only buy companies whose shares offer fundamental value. But, unlike Graham, he also has subjective criteria: he will only buy good businesses with good management and good long-term prospects. And once he has found such a company he will continue to hold its shares until it loses the characteristics which first attracted him. Such businesses are too rare to be discarded lightly. He says he buys shares as if he were buying the whole business, his criteria being: A business he can understand; with favourable long-term prospects; operated by honest and competent people; available at a very attractive price. The basis of this investment cocktail remains value, but there is more than a hint of growth there as well. Other successful stockpickers blend the ingredients in other ways. But their recipes have common elements. Most serious investors find a method that suits them and stick to it; most do not attempt to predict short-term stock market movements; most do much of their own research and like finding shares that no one else thinks worth buying; all of them are fascinated by the business of investment. Copying the masters Is there any way that the personal investor can emulate men such as Graham and Buffett? The biggest obstacle is getting first-hand experience of the markets. Many of the masters operate far away from financial centres, but all had extensive practical experience first. But the personal investor has the enormous advantage that he is answerable only to himself, and so can take a longer-term view. He can retreat into cash if he wants to, he can stick with a company going through a difficult patch, and he need never buy unless he is really convinced that he has found a winner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Representatives of  Georgia and the country's breakaway region of Abkhazia, brokered  by Russia, signed here today an agreement on cease-fire and  disengagement of their forces in the conflict area.    The Russian Government said in a statement that it was  satisfied with the steps taken by Georgia and Abkhazia to ensure  peace in the region.    The statement also said peacekeeping troops from the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will be deployed in the  security zone to be established under the agreement.    The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the  region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to  return home.    The Russian Government expressed the hope that both sides  would fulfil their own obligations and that it was willing to  promote, together with the United Nations, a comprehensive  solution to the conflict in the region.    Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old  military conflict between government forces and Abkhazian  separatists, who last year drove the Georgian troops out of the  region on the Black Sea coast.</p>

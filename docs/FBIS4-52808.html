			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos yesterday approved in principle the  adoption of new policies in the 1994 Investment Priorities Plan  (IPP), among them the withdrawal of the income tax holiday for  garment exports to quota countries and all expansion projects of  domestic-oriented industries.    The IPP which lists the preferred areas of economic activity  that will be promoted by the government this year, also adopted  the following policies:     -  Incentives shall be given only to importation of brand-new  and unused equipment and spare parts.    -  Capital equipment incentives shall be available for three  years  only from the date of project registration, but a six-year  availment period shall be given for projects which take long to  bear results.    -  Projects of a firm producing the same products and locating  outside the 50 kilometer radius of the firm's site may be  registered as new.    -  Expansion projects by firms which applied for registration as  new export producers prior to 1 January 1989 and consequently  registered will be exempted from the industrial location policy.    -  New enterprises registered under the 1994 IPP shall be given  five years to avail themselves of the exemption from wharfage  dues and any export tax, duty impost and fees. Expansion  projects, however, shall no longer be entitled to this incentive.       The 1994 IPP contains 59 preferred areas of activities,  majority of which are carry overs from the 1993 IPP. Of these,  12 are new inclusions.    President Ramos also stressed the need to speed up passage  of  pending economic measures in Congress.    The president made the statement after Finance Secretary  Roberto de Ocampo informed him International Monetary Fund (IMF)  is expected to approve the government's Letter of Intent and the  Memorandum of Economic Policy by end of June. Aside from the  $650 million in Extended Fund Facility to be released by the IMF  to the Philippines in three tranches over three years, the  program will also serve as the country's exit plan with the IMF.    The other vital economic measures still pending in Congress,  the president said, include the bill liberalizing the entry of  foreign banks, the investment incentives bill for the mining  industry, the Magna Carta for Exporters, Education bill, Armed  Forces modernization bill, Public Works Act, and other bills  contained in the Social Pact for Empowered Development (SPEED).</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Security Council to discuss its Soviet role THE United Nations Security Council looks set to meet on January 30 to discuss the break-up of the Soviet Union and the role of the UN in the post-Cold War era. The meeting was proposed by the UK, supported by the US and France. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, would preside over the meeting which would formally recognise Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union and permanent member of the Security Council. The meeting is partly intended to allay western concerns about command and control of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and the risks of nuclear proliferation. A broader aim, however, is to reinforce the authority of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new UN Secretary General. Mr Ghali is expected to be asked to prepare a report on the UN role in peace-keeping and other forms of collective security in the 1990s, according to a senior UN representative in New York. The New York forum would also offer President George Bush an early opportunity to hold talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, their first meeting since the resignation of President Mikhail Gorbachev and the dissolution of the Soviet Union last month. Russia has applied to join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to win financial backing for its transition from communism to capitalism, Reuter reports from Washington. The IMF said that the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan had also applied to join.</p>

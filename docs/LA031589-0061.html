			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> FUROR IN INDIA PARLIAMENT  </P> <P> India's Parliament adjourned in an uproar after an hour of shouting and  arguments over a newspaper report alleging that a powerful aide to Prime  Minister Rajiv Gandhi was a possible suspect in the 1984 assassination of his  mother, Indira Gandhi. The Indian Express quoted what it said were secret  documents from a judicial panel saying that Indira Gandhi's longtime personal  secretary, R. K. Dhawan, had suddenly changed her schedule Oct. 31, 1984, the  day of the slaying, and was responsible for deploying the two Sikh bodyguards  who killed her. Dhawan was fired by Rajiv Gandhi when he came to power but was  returned to the inner circle last month.  </P></p>

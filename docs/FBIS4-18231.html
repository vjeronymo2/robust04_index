			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Schroeder, minister-president of </F> Lower Saxony, by Olaf Petersen and Klaus Wirtgen: "`Take a  Chance'--the SPD's Lower Saxony Election Winner on His Party's  Strategy in Bonn"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, have you already  thanked your chairman Rudolf Scharping for the fact that he has  improved the attitude toward the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] throughout the nation and that you can continue to  govern in Lower Saxony with the absolute majority of seats?    [Schroeder] I have done that several times and even  effusively for me.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you share our impression that your election  victory was not exactly celebrated enthusiastically by the  national SPD?    [Schroeder] They are all very businesslike people. They are  incapable of enthusiasm, because in the past there was hardly  any reason for it. Something like that has to be relearned.    [DER SPIEGEL] The party chairman warned his friends against  holding their noses so high that it rains in. Was that aimed at  you?    [Schroeder] No, there is no danger of that with me. I can  say  in all modesty that people will be able to judge the political  implications of our election result correctly only when they can  look back six months.    In Hamburg, the SPD lost almost 8 percentage points. We  actually gained a little and won the absolute majority of seats.  That must be repeated in the coming elections. All SPD  representatives have direct electoral districts. We did not have  that before here.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the party headquarters in Bonn, your  comrades were not at all happy with the fact that in the final  phase of the election campaign you suddenly issued the catchword  "absolute majority."    [Schroeder] That is what I heard too.    [DER SPIEGEL] They were for red-green not just in Lower  Saxony. In the contest for the party chairmanship, you  recommended this alliance as a model for Bonn as well.    [Schroeder] In the first place: coalitions are always  second-best solutions. When a party like the SPD that can gain a  majority of its own--and mine was within reach according to the  polls--does not formulate this ambitious goal, it gives up a  piece of itself.    In the second place: at the time of the membership polling,  I  said that anyone who wants to do something in Bonn must specify  a power-transfer alternative to the current coalition. Mine is  red-green and I stand by that. The party decided against me and  against my strategy. And now it must be done by the one who was  chosen by the party.    [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping must finally say how he wants to  come  to power?    [Schroeder] I will not give Rudolf Scharping any public  advice on his strategy to come to power. I was annoyed by  recommendations and by the statement from the federal business  manager Guenter Verheugen that it was dumb of me to strive for  the absolute majority.    [DER SPIEGEL] If you had failed to reach your election goal,  the chancellor candidate would also have suffered.    [Schroeder] One cannot abandon an achievable goal out of  fear  of failure. The trouble with politics is that very few are still  willing to take a risk.    [DER SPIEGEL] When Johannes Rau propagated his "own  majority"  in 1986, you were among the critics of his strategy.    [Schroeder] The election goal must be achievable and it must  remain realistic.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider it realistic that the SPD  wants  to postpone the question of a coalition in Bonn until after the  election?    [Schroeder] Whether that can be done depends on at least two  preconditions. The first is the discipline of the party  leadership, which must not force a debate on the chairman. And  the second is whether people like you, that is, the media, will  permit such a strategy. I cannot judge either one.    [DER SPIEGEL] But you are familiar with both circles.    [Schroeder] I have read that three Bundestag representatives  have publicly advised Rudolf Scharping to bet on red-green. It  would have been better for these honorable people to have done  this internally. But once a member of the party leadership  starts such a debate, Rudolf Scharping would have a problem. I  do not want to give him one.    [DER SPIEGEL] What has now changed about your assessment of  a  red-green coalition?    [Schroeder] For me personnaly only one thing has changed,  namely that Rudolf Scharping is party chairman and chancellor  candidate and not I. For this reason, he alone has the right to  set the strategy publicly.    [DER SPIEGEL] The SPD received only 33.5 percent in the 1990  election and gives the impression that it could come to power  through its own strength. Is this credible?    [Schroeder] Even if you dig through the cellar, you will get  nothing from me. It is a matter of the strategic orientation of  the candidate and his specific credibility. And if he is not  allowed to do what he has conceived, then he cannot fight the  way that someone must fight who wants to remove Kohl from his  chair. He is literally heavy in his armchair.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not afraid that sometime you might be  accused of failing to help Scharping?    [Schroeder] That is a theme that is relevant in criminal law  but it plays no role in politics. Moreover you are  underestimating the strategic mental capacity and the  intelligence of the party chairman if you think that he himself  would not do what is necessary at the right time. If it were  otherwise, he would not have won against me.    [DER SPIEGEL] In Lower Saxony, you began as a reform  government with the Greens four years ago. Is red-green at all  attractive at the national level if they are really just seeking  crisis management there?    [Schroeder] It is a mistake to believe that crisis  management  per se must have nothing to do with reform policy. Crisis  management relates, after all, to the overcoming of the economic  crisis. And besides the conventional instruments there are  always those that go farther. We in Lower Saxony never forgot  the ecological dimension in large projects of industrial  policy--I admit that from time to time I personnally had to put  them through against the Greens. It is still that way in the new  SPD government as well.    [DER SPIEGEL] You reject the speed limit that was originally  included in the first SPD draft for a government program. That  will certainly not be interpreted in your favor as an ecological  accomplishment.    [Schroeder] That is right. But for me reform policy does not  mean that one constantly drives old horses through the arena. I  am against a general speed limit. Where a speed limit is  necessary, we do that in Lower Saxony as well. Besides,  Scharping sees that the same as I do.    [DER SPIEGEL] You also oppose a further increase in the  mineral oil tax?    [Scharping] If driving a car in this country becomes  something that only the upper half or even the upper third of  the income pyramid can afford, then something is wrong.  Certainly the mineral oil tax has an ecological dimension but it  also has a social dimension. In an extensive land, one can never  organize the local public transportation of passengers so well  that the worker in eastern Friesland who drives 80 km or more to  Volkswagen in Emden can get along without his car.    This consideration of the broad strata of the working  population in plants and management has brought about our  election success--naturally along with the first-class national  policies of the SPD....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...that wants to increase the mineral oil tax.    [Schroeder] It was increased by just 16 pfennig. We cannot  go  any higher. Besides the mineral oil tax, the contributions for  health insurance and for retirement have also increased, the  value-added tax has been raised, the municipal taxes and rents  are rising, and we are imposing a supplementary levy instead of  the social surcharge. How can the people bear it? And then we  come along and tell them that our reform policies are adding  something to that. That cannot go well.    [DER SPIEGEL] It was relatively simple for you to push for  jobs in the election campaign: you left the ecological part to  the Greens. Is such a double strategy also suitable for the  election campaign for power in Bonn?    [Schroeder] I am not giving any recommendations for  Scharping's strategy in this respect. The SPD must not forget  the ecological dimension. I know that is difficult. Once in  power, the SPD itself must come up with a rational concept for  coordinating economy and ecology.    [DER SPIEGEL] What benefit can the opposition leaders in the  Bundestag or the chancellor candidate derive from the successful  formula of the Lower Saxon minister-president?    [Schroeder] This is the reason why it is sensible for an  acting minister-president to be chancellor candidate. He can  show competence and a capacity to act at the land level for a  sector of politics. He will say: now I want to do on a large  scale what I have already done on a small scale. He has the task  of taking the ideas from the laender and putting them into  effect credibly as our concept at the national level and to  expand it beyond himself and Lafontaine.    [DER SPIEGEL] You are a public symbol of a successful  red-green policy. In reality, you achieved your election victory  with a policy that could have come from a trade union chairman  in Lower Saxony.    [Schroeder] You are right as far as industrial policy is  concerned but you are wrong with respect to ecology.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Greens have taken care of that.    [Schroeder] We had our part in it too. Nothing could have  been done against us. But it is quite clear that the Greens have  had a major role in setting the ecological questions.    [DER SPIEGEL] The conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE writes  that Lower Saxony red-green has "truly lost all of its terror."  Nevertheless Chancellor Kohl is continuing to foment fear of  this combination.    [Schroeder] He will fail, because, in the first place,  Rudolf  Scharping and the SPD--we are once again in the midst of a  coalition debate--will not let themselves be tied to this  coalition....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...because they will not follow you....    [Schroeder] ...and second, because this question does not  frighten anyone anymore.    [DER SPIEGEL] The radical resolutions of the Greens on  withdrawal from NATO, the Bundeswehr, and nuclear energy ought  to suit the plans of the chancellor candidate: in this way, the  Greens graze on the left fringe and the SPD can become indignant  and take some votes away from the Union. After 16 October, the  votes will be counted together.    [Schroeder] I do not want to put myself in Scharping's role  out of respect for the party chairman's prerogative to make  decisions.    [DER SPIEGEL] You are not otherwise averse to mental games.    [Schroeder] That is true but this mental game is especially  dangerous, not so much for me as for Rudolf Scharping and the  SPD. If it were dangerous for me, it would have an appeal, even  a different appeal than just to think about it. But one cannot  deal with these matters so tactically. All of these games can  arise out of a certain situation but it cannot be planned.    [DER SPIEGEL] The second red-green alliance in the country,  in Hesse, is approaching an early end.    [Schroeder] I believe that especially in a red-green  coalition, as in no other, the SPD must make it clear how it  stands for work and male and female employees. Secondly, it must  be clear who is leading: Who is the dog and who is the tail? And  the SPD must not want to be greener than the Greens in important  parts of the land party. The fascination will then come by  itself.    [DER SPIEGEL] You won the election with economic policy  themes. Are you resigned to the fact that the economy and  finances are being determined only by axis powers Scharping and  Lafontaine?    [Schroeder] That is the result of the party's decision last  summer.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will you remain silent if your leaders  Scharping and Lafontaine say that between the so-called key  planks--no tax increase and no additional debts--there is no  place for aid to the aircraft industry, but there probably is  room for coal subsidies?    [Schroeder] No, by no means. Then the danger of losing the  election with such policies would be too great. Imagine that we  refuse to subsidize the shipyards for high-tech products and  support hard coal with 11 billion annually--that would be a  strange economic program.    [DER SPIEGEL] The axis must not harm your terrain.    [Schroeder] It will not make any decisions that are  obviously  irrational. But you did select a nice example.    [DER SPIEGEL] No one believes that you have already  fulfilled  your political life goals in Hannover.    [Schroeder] I know those who would prefer to have me with  the  United Nations.    [DER SPIEGEL] How much longer will you be satisifed with  Lower Saxony Land?    [Schroeder] I know a soccer coach who is still uncommonly  successful, Franz Beckenbauer from Bavaria Munich. He always  says: "Let us take a look and we will see."    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, we thank you for this  conversation.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Observer: Rough landings? As Jacques Delors' regime in Brussels draws to a close, loyalists of the European Commission president are scrambling for their survival parachutes. The aim of the game is to jump before you are pushed overboard when Delors' successor arrives. Insiders report that Francois Lamoureux, the philosopher-type who was a key player in the Maastricht treaty negotiations, has quietly moved to a senior management job at DG3, the Commission's industry directorate. Jean-Michel Baer, who headed the Commission's Paris office, has taken charge of the audio-visual section of DG10, the information and culture directorate. Jean-Francois Pons, formerly working on monetary affairs, has been promoted to deputy director- general of DG4, the competition directorate. Delors has not been as active as some of his predecessors in fixing up top jobs for his acolytes. Bruno Dethomas, his spokesman, remains uncertain about where his next move will be, but insists he is not going back to his old journalism job at Le Monde. Brave words.</p>

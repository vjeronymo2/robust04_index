These attempts against  Lebanon's unity, he added, will keep happening but security  forces are prepared to foil them.    Dean of editors' Milhim Karam, who visited the president  with  a delegation from the Editors Union, reported that the president  said that President Hafiz al-Asad is going to Geneva to defend  not only issues concerning Syria and the Golan but also Lebanese  issues. This summit has been well prepared and will therefore  achieve positive results, he noted.    On municipal elections, the president hoped that elections  will be held for the posts of village heads and mayors because  municipalities have not had adequate representation.    The president emphasized that the Constitution is not a  bible  or divine and that it can be amended because it is man-made,  negotiable, and subject to change. He noted that this  Constitution did great injustice to the presidency because it  weakened Article 58, which deals with urgent decrees; made the  dissolution of the cabinet impossible; and annulled presidential  authority on the cabinet.    The president reiterated his pledge to respect freedoms. He  said that the media have a role in educating the public and  saving them from perversion, which requires correspondents to  tell the people all the facts.    On the cabinet debates, the president said: I agree with you  that the cabinet sessions, resolutions, and agenda are not  secret, but it is not wise to publicize every issue discussed by  the cabinet.</p>

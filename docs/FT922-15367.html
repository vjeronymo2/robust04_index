			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Insurance claim lifts Garton Eng GARTON Engineering lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.36m in 1991, helped by exceptional receipts from insurers. The results were considerably influenced by the continuing effect of the fire at the end of 1990, Mr Aubrey Garton, chairman, explained. Given the depressed economic conditions a lower level of profitability would have occurred. Turnover fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 22.9m) but the operating surplus moved up to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 1.34m). That included Pounds 2.6m net surplus on replacement of fixed assets and Pounds 1.35m from consequential loss insurance, and was struck after Pounds 1.3m restructuring and reorganisation costs. Earnings per share jumped to 25.84p (17.06p). The dividend is again 7p with a final of 5.25p.</p>

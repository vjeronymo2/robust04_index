			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Building societies - a spread that would be a little too thin (2) Sir, Mr Mark Hull is mistaken. The rule (used by the American savings and loan institutions until the 1980s) is in fact '3-6-3' (borrow at 3 per cent, lend at 6 per cent, be golfing by 3pm). The so-called technological age has done nothing but electrify their golf-carts. Antony Millard, Leslie &amp; Godwin Financial Risks, 6 Braham Street, London E1 8ED</p>

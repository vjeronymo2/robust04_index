			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "America, Don't Miss the Opportunity"] </F>   [Text] Today is the second day of negotiations between the  Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge in Pyongyang. The meeting,  scheduled to last until 31 May and chaired by King Norodom  Sihanouk, is aimed at putting an end to the killing among  Cambodians and finding ways to form a national reconciliation  government to rule the country. Meanwhile, the United States,  Australia, and France, in another part of the world, are  considering sending weapons to Cambodia to prolong the massacre  in that country.    We wish to appeal to all world powers to think carefully  before sending weapons and military assistance to help the  Cambodian Government fight the Khmer Rouge. It is not difficult  to decide to send arms and assistance to Cambodia. However, it  might be impossible to completely wipe out the Khmer Rouge.  Hence, sending weapons and assistance to Cambodia is tantamount  to fanning the flames of war which is a mistake the major powers  could make in their attempt to solve the Cambodian problem.    Judging from the remarks of Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy  assistant secretary of state; and Kent Weidemann, U.S. assistant  secretary of defense, after their visit to Phnom Pehn and  consultative meetings with Thai ministers, we feel that the two  U.S. officials, whose mission was to write a report to help the  U.S. Government make a final decision, are worried that the  Phnom Penh Government, without external support, will not be  able to resist the Khmer Rouge's massive offensive and that the  country will fall into Khmer Rouge hands.    We have a solution to the problem. The Thai people and  Government believe that the major powers and the international  community are capable of ending the war in Cambodia this very  moment by making the two factions recognize each other and form  a national reconciliation government to rule the country so that  they can solve all problems at the negotiating table instead of  fighting an endless war using lives, blood, flesh, and the agony  of the people as their stakes.    Following the stormy accusations made by the Cambodian  Government about Thai support for the Khmer Rouge, we, the mass  media, have noticed a decline, to a certain extent, in the Thai  Government's credibility in this regard. So effective are the  fabrications, that the United States, France, and Australia are  induced to give assistance to the Phnom Penh government. We  wish to remind the United States that a genuine solution to the  Cambodian problem must include the end of the war and mutual  recognition among the Cambodian factions. So, the United States  must think carefully before doing anything.    The United States must not miss the opportunity to exploit  the new expanding market in this region with a total population  of 350 million. If the international community sets the  ultimatum for national reconciliation and the end of fighting in  Cambodia, we do not believe that the Khmer Rouge will be crazy  enough to risk fighting the war to gain full control of Cambodia  because it will surely face something it deserves.</p>

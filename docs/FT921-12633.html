			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Pfizer commits up to Dollars 505m to meet heart valve claims PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, has agreed to commit up to Dollars 505m to cover claims by recipients of the company's artificial heart valves who become ill or die. The allocation, which consists of up to Dollars 205m in a settlement of a lawsuit plus a Dollars 300m pre-tax reserve taken by the company, represents one of the largest product liability settlements in the history of the US pharmaceuticals industry. The record was set in 1988 when AH Robins agreed to set up a Dollars 2.4bn fund to compensate women who claimed injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device. The Dollars 300m fourth-quarter charge - which amounts to Dollars 195m after tax and is separate from the settlement of a lawsuit covering 55,000 heart valve recipients - wiped out nearly all the company's net earnings in the quarter, reducing them to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 154.8m in the last quarter of 1990. Quarterly sales were 4 per cent higher at Dollars 1.85bn. For the whole of 1991 the charge resulted in Pfizer's net income declining by 10 per cent, to Dollars 722.1m. Sales for the year were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 6.95bn. Pfizer said yesterday that 400 recipients of the artificial heart valve, which was taken off the world market in 1986, have either died or suffered from its fracture. But the company will not admit that the valve is defective. Last September, the New York-based drug company sought to refute a report of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) task force finding that a Pfizer subsidiary had schemed to thwart FDA regulatory efforts and to prolong the marketing of the flawed heart valve. The task force charged that the valve, made by Pfizer's former Shiley subsidiary, was defective at the time of FDA approval in 1979. The settlement, which still requires court approval, is in response to a class action lawsuit filed last April. The agreement sets up a fund of between Dollars 80m and Dollars 130m to provide heart valve patients with medical payments plus a further Dollars 75m of funds that will be administered by the court in order to finance heart valve research. Claims will be awarded to patients on the basis of a sliding scale that ranges between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 2m per claimant. The Dollars 300m taken in the fourth-quarter charge is for future claims by patients who suffer from fractures of the valve. Mr Stanley Chesley, the lawyer who acted on behalf of the heart valve patients, said the settlement was significant because it does not contain a ceiling on total claims by patients. Pfizer said this means that valve recipients have the right to bring further legal action against the company if they are not satisfied with the payments already specified. Pfizer said it expected to offset the Dollars 155m to Dollars 205m of payments agreed in the settlement with its own insurance and from gains recorded on the sale last month of most of Shiley's remaining product lines to SNIA BPD, a subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group. On Wall Street yesterday, Pfizer's share price rose by  5/8 to Dollars 75 7/8 .</p>

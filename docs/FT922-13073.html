			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Libya sanctions leave Arab world divided AS TIME ticks away to the imposition tomorrow of United Nations-imposed sanctions against Libya, Arab states are wrestling with the knotty problem of how they might react. Egypt, the Gulf states and Jordan have indicated they will probably fall reluctantly into line with the sanctions provisions, but it is not clear how Libya's North Africa's neighbours or such countries as Syria will respond. The Arab League, which has passed three resolutions in an effort to defuse the crisis, has not outlined a collective stand in the event of sanctions, and, given divisions within the league, it may prove difficult for it to do so. However, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the league's secretary-general did tell reporters last month that in his view the Arabs should not impose sanctions. This was perhaps surprising coming from Dr Meguid, a cautious lawyer-turned-diplomat, who served as Egypt's UN representative for more than a decade throughout the turbulent 1970s. Arab League officials say no date has been set for a special foreign ministers' session to consider a collective response; but Mr Adnan Omran, a deputy secretary-general, indicated there were pressures for one to be held soon, although he acknowledged it would not necessarily be easy to forge a consensus. Broad agreement was achieved in the three league resolutions aimed at defusing the Libya crisis - these were acclaimed on December 5, January 16 and March 22 - but discussion of how in fact to respond to sanctions themselves may prove divisive. Pro-western states such as Egypt, which is heavily dependent on US aid, will not wish to adopt a stance which runs counter to US interests, even at the risk of being accused of being in Washington's thrall. The Libyan situation would seem to be tailor-made for Iraq which will almost certainly try to use the crisis to help it regain its voice in Arab councils. Iraqi representatives are already arguing that 'first it was us, now it is Libya, who next among the Arabs?' Mr Omran was highly critical of the western approach to forcing Libya to disgorge its nationals suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, insisting that resort to the UN sanctions, including an air and arms embargo, was hasty and ill-conceived. 'This kind of policy,' he said, 'is an encouragement to extremism. Mr Saddam Hussein must be very happy with American policy now.' Western officials acknowledge the Libyan crisis has become 'messy', in the words of one. 'No matter how hard we try to explain the situation reactions are emotional,' he said. 'People believe what they want to believe.' Egypt, which has led the Arab diplomatic drive to prevent Libya's further isolation, appeared early this week to have resigned itself to the sanctions coming into force, and for this in turn to lead to complications regionally. President Hosni Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on his way back to Cairo from Tripoli on Sunday that Egypt had done all it could to defuse the crisis. The implication was that nothing much more could be achieved unless Libya was willing to consider seriously handing over its nationals. Interestingly, an Egyptian official newspaper yesterday hinted at criticism of Libya. Al Akhbar described the Libyan leadership as 'hesitant' and 'lacking decisiveness in confronting the problem'. Egypt's official Middle East news agency, MENA, quoted Mr Mubarak as warning that Libya must take the necessary steps to protect itself from the repercussions of the crisis. This hardly amounted to an Egyptian pledge to go all the way with Tripoli.</p>

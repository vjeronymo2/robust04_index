			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWER APPOINTED TO DEFENSE POST  </P> <P> The appointment of Tower as secretary of defense has brought to my mind an  interesting situation. Tower was appointed by President Reagan to investigate  his and Vice President Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. Tower  exonerated both of them, saying that while Reagan may have been asleep at the  wheel he was not guilty of knowing of, or being involved in, the trade of arms  for hostages and the subsequent use of money from the sales of the arms to fund  the Contras in their battle with the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> Tower also concluded that Bush was not involved in either the swap part of the  deal, or the transfer of funds part. How strange it is that this man, the  investigator, should then be given such a powerful and influential position in  the new government of the man he recently investigated, and cleared. And even  stranger is the silence about this transaction in the news media.  </P> <P> But most of all I find it hard to understand the silence of the leaders of the  Democratic Party. When one has a government which feels itself above the law we  must have an opposition party to watch over the administration of justice, and  to protect the interests of the people. We have, for too long, left this  function to the press. Today, however, the news media function more as an  advertising medium.  </P> <P> STANLEY R. BERMANN  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

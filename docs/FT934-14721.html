			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Cup loss could cost Pounds 35m AFTER the national side lost 2-0 to The Netherlands on Wednesday night, English football could lose up to Pounds 20m if Graham Taylor's team fails to qualify for next year's World Cup finals in the US, Diane Summers writes. Failure would cost the travel industry an estimated Pounds 15m, and there would also be losses in publishing and broadcasting, gaming and to companies associated with football merchandising. Mr Trevor Phillips, the Football Association's commercial director, said the FA would forgo between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m in receipts and as much as Pounds 20m could be lost to football as a whole, including a drop in takings on gates during the season after the cup. Greaves Travel, FA official travel agent, said that reductions in bookings to the US next year would mean a loss of up to Pounds 15m for the travel industry as a whole. However, Mr Michael Myers, marketing director, said that inquiries from the corporate market was holding up and there could actually be a boost to family holidays in the US. 'Families can now go knowing they won't be mixed up with that kind of supporter,' he said. American Airlines, official airline to the World Cup, is suspending television and press advertising because of the negative association with the competition. It was 'deemed to be insensitive in the short term' to advertise, said the airline, although it did not plan to cut its promotion budgets overall.</p>

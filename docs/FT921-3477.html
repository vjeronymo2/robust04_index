			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Holzmann posts 18% advance in sales for 1991 PHILIPP Holzmann, one of Germany's leading construction companies, yesterday reported an 18 per cent increase in sales for 1991 and said it had started the new year with orders on its books equivalent to 12 months' output, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. Turnover was DM10.95bn (Dollars 6.6bn) and the company said operating profits had increased, without giving figures. Shareholders, paid DM11 a share from profits of DM106m last year, would get a 'satisfactory' dividend. Improvements in the domestic market more than compensated for weaknesses in the US, where sales fell almost 12 per cent during the year, and order intake slumped by more than 40 per cent. Activity in Germany, source of half the group's outstanding orders, remained strong.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ML Laboratories wins licence for dialysis drug SHARES IN ML Laboratories, the USM-quoted medical research and development company, yesterday jumped 55p to a high of Pounds 11.60 after the group accompanied its annual results with an announcement that it had won a UK marketing licence for Dextrin 20, its patented kidney dialysis drug. The shares have risen 27 per cent since mid-December, lifting the group's market value to Pounds 318m. Sales of Dextrin are likely to transform ML's financial position - it has failed to make a profit since the 1987 listing - if the drug is accepted by the medical profession and production meets demand. Pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 496,000 to Pounds 887,000 in the year to September 30. Turnover rose sharply to Pounds 604,000 (Pounds 288,000) but higher cost of sales and administrative expenses increased operating losses to Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 979,000). Losses per share were 3.5p (0.2p). Dextrin has been billed as a cheaper, safer and easier alternative to the existing 'mobile' dialysis treatment for people suffering from kidney failure. ML estimates 465,000 people are on dialysis worldwide, a figure increasing 9 per cent a year, of whom 65,000 are treated by mobile dialysis. Directors said ML was applying for licences worldwide and should be able to sell Dextrin throughout Europe by mid-1994, followed by the US in 1995, and Japan shortly thereafter. ML was expanding its manufacturing capacity to meet 20 per cent of UK demand from its upgraded pilot plant, with construction of new facilities to supply half of the European market set to start in March. The group, which is also researching Aids treatments and drug delivery systems for asthma and cancer treatments, also proposes a 4-for-1 scrip issue to improve the marketability of its shares.</p>

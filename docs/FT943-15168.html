			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Korean iceberg starts to melt 'Whatever can he have meant by that?,' Metternich is supposed to have said on learning of the sudden death of a political rival. It is tempting to ask the same about Kim Il-sung, the founder-president of communist North Korea, so thick was the veil of secrecy with which he surrounded himself and his country, and so dramatic the timing of his final departure. Only a month ago his intransigence seemed about to plunge the world into a very dangerous crisis. Repeated prevarication over the inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities had forced the world to conclude that Mr Kim was indeed concealing a nuclear weapons programme, and had left the Clinton administration with no option but to ask the UN Security Council to impose sanctions - a move which North Korea had served notice it would treat as an act of war. Then a meeting between Mr Kim and ex-President Jimmy Carter produced a sudden change in atmosphere. North Korea agreed to 'freeze' its nuclear activity for the duration of a new high-level meeting between US and North Korean officials - a meeting which actually began in Geneva on Friday when Mr Kim was apparently already dead. Meanwhile, a few days after Mr Carter's visit, North and South Korea agreed on the first ever summit meeting between Mr Kim and his southern counterpart, scheduling it for July 25. Power struggle Were these meetings a device to gain yet more time, or was Mr Kim preparing to extract the best possible price, in economic and diplomatic concessions, for an agreement to open up his country to full and effective nuclear inspection? That question is now displaced by others. Will his son Kim Jong-il be allowed the smooth inheritance of power and office which the elder Kim so elaborately prepared, or is there already a secret power struggle in progress such as followed the deaths of Stalin in Moscow and Mao in Beijing? Assuming he does succeed, and goes ahead with both the Geneva talks and the Pyongyang summit, will the younger Kim use the meetings to bring about a more general opening up to the outside world, or will he feel the need to prove to party and army veterans at home that he remains faithful to his father's doctrine of juche (self-reliance)? In the longer term, it is hard to believe that the post-Kim Il-sung era will not be marked by an attempt at economic reform, combined with an attempt to maintain tight political control. Both attempts will be dictated by the small ruling elite's desire to survive, with or without Kim Jong-il. The question that must be tormenting them is whether such a policy mix has any hope of success in a state where till now everything has been minutely controlled, and more especially one which comprises only part of a nation, the other and larger part being successfully integrated into the global capitalist economy. Threat to stability The division of Korea is no less unnatural and no more desirable than was that of Germany, and no more likely to prove permanent once North Koreans (like East Germans) acquire the freedom to vote with their feet. But Korea's reunification may well prove even more expensive, and pose a greater threat to regional peace and stability. The risk that the communist regime would not go quietly is much higher, and the reaction of at least one neighbouring power (China) is harder to predict. The next few years will provide the South Korean leadership and the Clinton administration with a test at least as difficult as that faced, and passed, by Helmut Kohl and George Bush in 1990. But in the short term neither South Korea nor the wider international community has any real choice but to wait and see what the mysterious processes of North Korean politics produce. As much as possible should be done to encourage Kim Il-sung's successors to put a benign and imaginative interpretation on the enigmatic diplomacy of his last weeks. That means continuing to refine the carrots and sticks wielded in recent weeks - offering the prospect of increased trade and investment to encourage compliance and reform, but maintaining the threat of further isolation should the younger Kim prove as intransigent as his father.</p>

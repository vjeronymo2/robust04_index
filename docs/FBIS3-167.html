			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A major raid has been carried out in Senegal.  Police forces and the gendarmerie arrested more than 1,000  people in Dakar yesterday. Nicolas Balique reports:    [Balique] A total of 1,262 people were arrested for  questioning during the operation, a major roundup which required  almost 1,000 men during the Sunday [27 February] night. Given  the number of arrests -- some for mere identity checks, others  for drug trafficking, prostitution or possession of knives --  this cannot be called a routine operation. It is rather an  operation carried out within the framework of an all-out policy  of firmness after the trauma of the bloody events of 16  February. Forty-eight hours after the raid, it must be pointed  out that a similar raid, which was carried out in the caves of  Dakar seafront, led to the arrest of more than 150 dropouts,  including armed bandits from the subregion, Guinea, Gambia, or  Liberia. Meanwhile, the inquiry into the violence of Black  Wednesday [16 February] is continuing, the religious movement  Moustarchidine has been banned, and the two main opposition  leaders have been placed under committal order. Some are  wondering whether this latest raid will not be a mere flash in  the pan. In any case, the authorities do not think so. This is  Nicolas Balique in Dakar for RFI.</p>

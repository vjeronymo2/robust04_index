			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Emap calls for Pounds 77.9m to fund growth EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday announced a Pounds 77.9m rights issue to enable it to continue with its strategy of buying and launching new titles. The announcement of the issue of 34.7m shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 230p apiece accompanied pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.1m for the year to March 28, an increase of 9 per cent on last time's Pounds 24.8m. The figures were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 7.21m). The previous year's figure was restated to take account of recent accountancy standards recommendations about the treatment of exceptional and extraordinary items. The share price fell 4p yesterday to close at 281p. Over the last three years Emap has spent Pounds 121m on acquisitions, including a number of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business magazines and exhibitions. About Pounds 65m was spent in the last 12 months. Over the same period a further Pounds 17m was spent on launching 20 consumer magazines, four business magazines and and seven exhibitions. Before the rights Emap's internal budget suggested average borrowing of Pounds 64m in the present financial year. 'The directors believe that this level of borrowing would be likely to restrict their ability to react to acquisition and investment opportunities in a timely and flexible fashion and that the rights issue is the most appropriate way to remove this constraint,' the company said yesterday. The issue is fully underwritten by Schroders and Emap said that the sub-underwriting had been successfully completed by the end of business yesterday. Negotiations for a British publishing acquisition worth less than Pounds 10m are already under way. Emap will be looking at further expansion into continental Europe particularly in consumer magazines. Purchases are likely to be in the small to medium range which Emap considers to be up to Pounds 20m. Mr Graham Ross Russell, chairman, said yesterday that all divisions increased operating profits in the second half when overall operating profit increased by 22 per cent. This was mostly due to cost-cutting rather than any recovery from recession. Mr Robin Miller, group chief executive, said that advertising had stopped going down, 'but is so far showing no real signs of going up'. Display advertisements were improving but jobs ads are still falling year-on-year. Turnover was static at Pounds 269.4m (Pounds 269.3m). Net interest charges rose to Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 1.17m). Earnings per share increased by 9 per cent to 12.6p. An increased final dividend of 5.5p is proposed for a total payment of 7.5p (6.9p). Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 42m for the current year and about Pounds 53m for 1993-94. See Observer</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR A CHANGE, MAHORN TAKES A FEW SHOTS  </P> <P> Mike Downey's article on the Detroit Pistons' Rick Mahorn was so brutally  vicious that I will certainly remember it for a long time.  </P> <P> Downey engaged in merciless butchery of the "Bad Boy," outright destruction of  Mahorn's dignity.  </P> <P> There is only one thing that I can say to Downey after he so utterly attacked  Mahorn, the Charles Manson of the basketball court . . .  </P> <P> Thank you.  </P> <P> STEVE LEVIN  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

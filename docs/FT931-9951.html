			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Hurd warns of showdown with Euro-sceptics THE government threw down the gauntlet to Conservative Euro-sceptics and the opposition parties yesterday by insisting it would rather sink the Maastricht treaty outright than accept British adherence to the social chapter. But as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, issued the warning, Lord Tebbit, a former party chairman, urged Tory MPs to defy the leadership and vote for a Labour amendment on the social chapter - expressly in order to destroy the treaty. In a vituperative speech to political journalists, the arch Euro-sceptic argued that support for the amendment would not lead to its imposition. He said: 'Those who are fighting to preserve self-government for Britain are well entitled to use every procedural device to destroy the treaty'. Lord Tebbit's intervention provoked an outcry from government loyalists and put the anti-Maastricht faction on the defensive. Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading opponent of the treaty, described it as unhelpful, but added: 'There is no way we are going to co-operate in the treaty going through if we don't get a referendum.' The latest outbreak of internecine warfare within the Tory ranks came as Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, joined the fray by implicitly criticising the UK with his most stinging attack yet on the 'renationalisation' of economic policy in the EC. In a Strasbourg speech presenting the Commission's programme for 1993-94, he said competitive devaluations were jeopardising plans for economic and monetary union and 'the very idea of a united Europe'. Mr Delors also warned that Brussels would 'take up the cudgels again' to get controversial items from the EC's Social Charter into Community law - a move that will confirm the worst fears of British Conservatives. The government's decision to raise the stakes over the vote - in spite of commanding only a narrow 21-vote overall majority - came after careful consultation between Mr Hurd and Mr John Major, the prime minister. In a BBC radio interview, the foreign secretary called on Conservative MPs to take note that: 'We are not going to join a treaty which imposes the social chapter.' Downing Street insisted that the prime minister was confident the party would support the government in the Commons' vote, expected in about six weeks. But a senior official stressed that there was no possibility of Britain returning to treaty negotiations with its European Community partners if the amendment was passed. 'The politics of this is that once you open up this can of worms everything comes out. We can only ratify the treaty that we negotiated. If it is not ratified by all 12, the treaty does not come into being,' he said. In fact, a defeat for the government on Labour's amendment would not necessarily halt the ratification process. The government would have opportunities both in the House of Lords and at the Commons report stage to reverse it. Privately, Labour acknowledged it had little chance of imposing the social chapter on the government, but every effort would be made to maximise the Conservatives' discomfiture.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: US Pru's stockbroker unit to quit Tokyo SE Prudential Securities, the stockbroking arm of Prudential Insurance of the US, is to join the lengthening list of foreign securities companies leaving the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company announced yesterday that it had notified the TSE of its plans to relinquish its regular membership of the exchange, transferring it to a third party. The decision reflects Prudential's plan to 'substantially downsize' its operations in Japan, including Japanese equity business, as part of a wholesale review of the parent's worldwide operations, the company said. Sale of its TSE membership will enable Prudential to cut operational expenditures and divert funds for other businesses. But it said it planned to continue to trade US securities in Japan, as well as Japanese government bonds. In the last few years foreign brokers have been leaving Japan as business in the Japanese securities market has dried up. Equity trading volumes reached a peak of more than 1bn shares a day in 1989 but then fell to less than 300m shares a day last year. After a slight increase in the first half of 1994, volumes have slumped again. Foreigners flocked to Tokyo in the 1980s as the market was liberalised and equity trading increased exponentially. The total of subsidiaries and representative offices grew from 112 in 1984 to 280 in 1991. But since the slump, many brokers have been leaving the TSE. Prudential's departure takes the total to below 230.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon [12 May], while holding a  discussion with responsible comrades from journalists' centers  stationed in Gansu by main central press units and with main  provincial and city news reporting units, provincial party  Secretary Yan Haiwang pointed out: Press and propaganda work  must give first play to positive reporting, and exert its main  effort to rouse the drive of the people to actively guide,  supervise and promote government work.    This discussion was presided over by Sun Ying, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee. (Song Zhaolong),  member of the standing committee of the provincial party  committee, was present at the discussion as well. Sun Ying  said: The provincial party committee has attached great  importance to the work of our press units, and has pinned great  hopes on them. We are satisfied with the correct guidance for  public opinion which is provided by our news reporting and  propaganda work, and by work done by everyone present over the  past four months. There have been some marked features in our  news reporting and propaganda work over the past four months:  1) We have implemented the spirit of the national and  provincial propaganda and ideological work meetings. 2) We have  persisted in correct guidance for public opinion. 3) We have  grasped typical reporting in a vivid and dramatic manner, and  have propagated the main theme of the era.    Sun Ying also set several specific demands for doing news  reporting work well. Responsible comrades from the Gausu  Provincial Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, provincial radio  and television department, GANSU RIBAO, and other units spoke  without any inhibition. They talked about their tentative  working plan for both the present and the near future. While  listening to their speeches, Yan Haiwang also exchanged views  with them. When they raised the issue that the masses in the  Gannan area and the southern part of Gansu have difficulties in  listening to radio broadcasts owing to poor signal strength, he  said: This is because of the weak transmitting capacity of our  broadcasting equipment. The provincial authorities will  coordinate with the central authorities to solve this problem  well.    Yan Haiwang briefed all the participants on economic  construction and social development in Gansu Province since the  beginning of this year. He stressed: The guideline of the  provincial authorities is that we must further emancipate our  minds and change our concepts. In the meantime, we must strongly  advocate self-reliance and hard work. Our province had a poor  foundation to start with. Our news reporting and propaganda  work must rouse the drive of the masses and inspire their  enthusiasm. In our future news reporting and propaganda work,  we must pay attention to exploring certain questions, devote our  main efforts to positive reporting and providing active  guidance, and grasp typical reporting well. We must encourage  the masses, and arouse their enthusiasm so as to give play to  the guiding role of news reporting in organizing, encouraging,  promoting, and inspiring our people.</p>

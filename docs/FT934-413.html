			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No relief on share loss I quite understand that, from last month's Budget, losses can no longer be indexed; but can you please advise on the following. Ward Group plc shares were declared 'of negligible value' in July 1992 and I have not yet established this loss. It is my intention to set it against gains in the present year, 1993-94. Will I be able to index this loss to July 1992, or even to October 1993 (the month before the new legislation became effective)? No, you will get no indexation relief at all. Had you submitted a negligible value claim before Budget day, you could have got indexation relief up to the month in which the claim was submitted; but we take it that when you say: 'I have not yet established this loss,' you mean: 'I have not yet submitted a negligible-value claim under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992'. Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, for a free copy of the Budget day press release IR28 (Capital gains: indexation allowance and capital losses). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

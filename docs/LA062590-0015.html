			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IT JUST DOESN'T FIGURE TO BE MATCH FOR AGES  </P> <P> Top-seeded Ivan Lendl, still looking for his first Wimbledon championship,  figures to have an easy time today with his first opponent, Argentina's  Christian Miniussi. But the ATP's official players guide shows a statistic that  makes Lendl a cinch to beat tennis' latest wonder child. The guide lists  Miniussi's birth date as July 5, 1987.  </P> <P> ATP officials said this was a typographical error and that Miniussi is 22, not  2.  </P> <P> Name game: The following is either a public service or a public nuisance,  depending on your opinion of Chris Berman, ESPN's nickname-happy commentator  and play-by-play man.  </P> <P> No longer restrained by network management, which muzzled his nicknaming a few  seasons ago but relented when his fans protested en masse, here is Berman's  1990 lineup:  </P> <P> Sil (When The Swallows Return To) Campusano, Philadelphia Phillies; Roberto  (Remember The) Alomar, San Diego Padres; Mark Carreon (My Wayward Son), New  York Mets; Eric (Little) Anthony, Houston Astros; Gary Sheffield (Of Dreams),  Milwaukee Brewers; Robin Ventura (Highway), Chicago White Sox; Todd (Good  Housekeeping) Zeile, St. Louis Cardinals; Jeff Ballard (Of A Thin Man),  Baltimore Orioles.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the originator of Berman's "back-back-back-back-back"  call?  </P> <P> Spitting it out: Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra, when asked by  Richard Justice of the Washington Post whether the world is ready for him:  "Wake up, Dude, it's the 90s."  </P> <P> Where's Lou Holtz?: No. 1 in the architecture poll: Sally Jenkins of the  Washington Post recently noted Jennifer Capriati's "youthful frame of  reference."  </P> <P> In Paris for the French Open, Capriati was awed by the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  Said the 14-year-old: "I thought we were going to a football field."  </P> <P> His kind of town: Steve Jacobson of Newsday, on John Thompson's decision to  stay at Georgetown rather than become the Denver Nuggets' general manager: "He  would have been a strong black man working for the only black ownership in  sports. But then he has his penchant for control, which is his at Georgetown .  . .  </P> <P> "He'd have been as big as his players, but they wouldn't be his students. And  the job calls for some public relations skills. One of Thompson's favorite  tricks is to return calls to media people at dawn's early light after a night  game.  </P> <P> "It sounds as if he has worked out who is in charge with the new university  president."  </P> <P> Can't take the heat: In the old-timers game played Saturday at Arlington  Stadium, eight players were younger than Nolan Ryan, who pitched the day before  for the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> One of them, 40-year-old Cecil Cooper, says that's OK. "When he starts playing  in them, I won't anymore," Cooper said. "You think I want to face that  90-mile-an-hour fastball?"  </P> <P> Toiling in obscurity: While most of Italy braced itself for Sunday's round of  World Cup soccer games, Richard Olsen concentrated on other things.  </P> <P> The 33-year old Hawaiian-born right-hander, a former minor leaguer with the  Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A Vancouver franchise from 1979-82, pitched a partita  perfetta (perfect game) for Grosseto of the Italian league, striking out 18 in  a 7-0 victory over Turin.  </P> <P> "No matter where it happens, it's a great feeling," Olsen told the Associated  Press. "I've never seen a perfect game . . . it's hard to even imagine throwing  one."  </P> <P> In a game last season, Olsen retired the first 24 batters, but his teammates  let him down. Italian rules state that if a team has a 10-run lead after seven  innings, the game is over. Grosseto led, 10-0, at the time.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Red Barber.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Charles Barkley, on receiving the most votes for the NBA  all-interview team: "I say what I think. I tell the truth, and there are times  when you are not supposed to tell the truth." TED BROCK  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / German monetary drag on bond markets' anchor Europe has been to the polls, but as far as the European capital markets are concerned the problem seems to be that international investors are voting with their feet. German bonds, the bedrock of the European securities structure, have had a terrible year, with the 10-year government bond yield now up to 7 per cent, from 5 1/2 per cent at the beginning of January. Other bond markets may have performed more badly, but in less than six months bunds have lost all the gains of the previous 12. Unlike their US and Japanese counterparts, the European equity markets have not been able to brush aside the weakness in bonds, so that in local currency the Europe index is down 6 per cent against only about 1 per cent for Wall Street and the rogue 17 per cent gain in Japan. The indices in France, Germany and the UK are all down by between 7 and 10 per cent. European currencies have held their own against a weak dollar which still offers a lower short-term interest rate, but they have slipped by around 3 per cent this year against the yen. A basic factor behind all this is the loss of monetary control by the German Bundesbank. Only last week the world's top central bankers were in London celebrating the rare peak of their power and influence, but markets often cynically sell into signs of hubris. Sturdily independent the Buba may be, but it is floundering in a sea of M3 bank deposits, up an annualised 15 per cent so far this year compared with a target growth range of 4 to 6 per cent. Since the beginning of 1992, German M3 has risen by 24 per cent, twice as fast as if the central targets had been hit. At least the surprisingly strong performance by the Christian Democratic Union in the European parliamentary elections, with positive implications for Mr Helmut Kohl's chances in the domestic poll next October, may soothe fears that the Bundesbank will continue to bend over backwards to help the government. All the same, the Bundesbank's apparent willingness to take inflationary risks through surprisingly aggressive rate-cutting, and measures to support the dollar, has upset the bond markets. It may all, of course, turn out to be an unimportant technical tangle, a shift in velocity best left to academic monetarists. The expansion of the D-Mark area into east Germany and (unofficially) beyond may have invalidated past trend lines, and furthermore the speculative bubble in global bonds last year priced bunds out of the reach of domestic investors. Foreign investors and banks bought the German bond issue in 1993, with domestic non-bank investors notable for their absence. At the end of last year the wholesale money market rate on three-month D-Marks was 30 basis points higher than on 10-year bonds. Hence the pile-up of savings in deposits which are included in M3. This year's drastic measures to turn the yield curve around should cause those savings to shift longer, once investors have lost their fear of further price falls in bonds; even now, however, bond yields are short of their long-run average of some 7.5 per cent. Meanwhile the gamble is that lower short-term rates will not set off a renewed growth in credit - at a time when the German economy is starting to pull quite decisively out of recession. The Bundesbank Central Council will meet for a mid-year monetary target review on July 21. Hardliners are bound to fear that the protracted period of double-digit monetary expansion is inevitably going to lead to currency weakness and, within two or three years, to rising inflation. In the immediate future, however, German inflation may be about to dip below 3 per cent. For global investors it must be worrying that the European Union should be in danger of losing its financial anchor at a time when the weekend poll showed signs of political fragmentation in France, not to mention continued waywardness in the UK. The recession and falling interest rates last year covered up the financial pressures in Europe but economic recovery will prove testing. Already the bond markets have seen significant divergence, with spreads against bunds widening for UK and Spanish government bonds, for instance. But the uncertainty has spread right to the heart of the European capital markets.</p>

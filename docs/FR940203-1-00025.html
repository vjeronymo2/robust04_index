			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff, however, performs similar safety and environmental compliance functions with respect to hydroelectric projects that are operated pursuant to a 5 MW or conduit exemption as it does for projects that are operated pursuant to a license. The Commission also incurs costs in processing exemption applications. Therefore, as a matter of policy, the Commission believes that it would be appropriate for projects that are operated pursuant to the 5 MW exemption to share the cost of the Commission's application and compliance programs, and that the same principle applies as well with respect to conduit exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(e) of the FPA provides that ``the licensee shall pay *&blank;*&blank;* annual charges *&blank;*&blank;* for the costs of the administration of this Part *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). We believe that this statutory language may preclude imposition of annual charges on 5 MW and conduit exemptees under section 10(e) of the FPA. It is arguable that such exemptees could not be construed as ``licensees'' within the meaning of section 10(e). The Commission believes, however, that it has the legal authority under OBRA to assess annual charges to exemptees, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and proposes to do so with respect to both the 5 MW and the conduit exemptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3401(a) of OBRA provides as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) In General._(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and beginning in fiscal year 1987 and in each fiscal year thereafter, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall, using the provisions of this subtitle and authority provided by other laws, assess and collect fees and annual charges in any fiscal year in amounts equal to all of the costs incurred by the Commission in that fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the provisions of this subtitle shall not affect the authority, requirements, exceptions, or limitations in sections 10(e) and 30(e) of the Federal Power Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas this provision makes clear that OBRA does not authorize the collection of annual charges from,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  municipal licensees who qualify for an exemption under the terms of section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, projects under exemptions from licensing are not subject to section 10(e), and therefore charging them under OBRA does not affect any provision of section 10(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act requires the Commission to collect from exemption applicants and certain license applicants, on behalf of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and state fish and wildlife agencies, these agencies' project-specific costs under section 30(c) (establishment of mandatory conditions with respect to fish and wildlife resources). These agencies are required to subtract from their section 10(e) claims the money they recover under section 30(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Holders of 5 MW and conduit exemptions would, however, be able to apply for exemption from annual charges based on their municipal status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, pursuant to &sect;381.601, the Commission currently imposes a filing fee for applications for a 5 MW exemption. The fee is based on the cost of processing all 5 MW exemption applications received each year divided by the number of applications that the Commission has completed processing in that year. At present, the fee established by &sect;381.601 is $21,620. Because the Commission is proposing to assess annual charges on 5 MW exemptees, the Commission proposes to delete &sect;381.601 from the regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission does not impose a filing fee for conduit exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Other Revisions to Annual Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 11.1(d) currently states that the minimum annual charge for projects involving transmission lines will be $5. The Commission's current practice, however, is to state that charge in the articles of the individual licenses, as appropriate. Therefore, we propose to conform the text of &sect;11.1(d) to that practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its current form, &sect;11.20 provides two separate deadlines for payment of bills for annual charges: 30 days for headwater benefits bills and 45 days for other annual charges bills. The purpose of this distinction is not readily apparent. Therefore, the Commission proposes to make all such bills payable upon 30 days of their rendition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There has also been some confusion over the procedures that a licensee should follow if it believes that the bill is incorrect. The proposed new &sect;11.20 provides for licensees to file an appeal of the bill to the Commission's Chief Financial Officer. All decisions of the Chief Financial Officer on appeals would be subject to rehearing by the Commission pursuant to &sect;385.713. This would essentially codify the current informal practice. Most billing disputes involve mathematical calculations that can be readily resolved by discussion with the Commission's staff without the need for a formal request to the Commission for rehearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bill would still have to be paid within 30 days of its rendition in order to avoid the assessment of penalty payments under &sect;11.21, but if a timely appeal or request for rehearing is filed the bill could be paid under protest and subject to refund. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As currently in effect, &sect;11.6(i) requires that applications for exemptions from payment of annual charges ``shall be prepared on forms prescribed by the Commission *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Inasmuch as the Commission does not currently prescribe such forms, the reference to such forms will be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This circuit overcomes  the problem of a drop in sensitivity caused by conventional AGC  [automatic gain-control] circuits. This world state-of-the-art  PIN-FET receiver, now successfully incorporated into the optical  terminal production lines at MPT's communications equipment  plants, has a dynamic range of over 40 dB and a sensitivity  about 2 dB higher than foreign-made products. For interested  manufacturers, equipment investment costs are about 7 million  yuan, annual output value is 3 million yuan, and annual profit  should be at least 1 million yuan.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SIGN HERE: Want to rewrite the state Constitution? An Orange County firm now  advertises that if your initiative is reasonable, it will gather the signatures  to put it on the ballot within 45 days -- or your money back. . . . Bill  Butcher and Arnold Forde, longtime and often controversial campaigners, say  they can do it with 12 years' worth of direct mail and computer lists. . . .  But at considerably more than $1 per valid signature, it can cost a bundle for  the almost 600,000 signatures needed. Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren  </P></p>

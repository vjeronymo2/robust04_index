			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Against the coal tide - Powell Duffryn International Fuels AMID THE controversy surrounding the government's pit closures programme during the last six months, there was near unanimity about one thing: without subsidies of a scale never likely from a Conservative government, the UK's exports potential is small and declining. However, one company is showing that it is possible to make a success in a small market by exploiting niches. Powell Duffryn International Fuels is today rewarded with a Queen's Award for Export Achievement. This is the first time that the company, a subsidiary of Powell Duffryn, the diversified industrial group, has won a Queen's Award, although in more than 100 years of existence in various forms, it has acquired a considerable reputation and, according to at least one industry analyst, the company is currently the most efficient coal trader in the UK. Mr Barry Hartiss, chairman of Powell Duffryn's fuel distribution subsidiaries, says one key to the company's success in recent years has been PDIF's seven members of staff. Mr Hartiss is, however, less informative with numbers involving PDIF, declining to supply figures for turnover and profitability or even for the proportion of purchases which the company makes from the UK. 'The company generates a healthy flow of income from abroad but I cannot go into details because this is such a competitive market,' he says. The effects of the rivalry were demonstrated graphically last month in the government's white paper on coal. This showed that exports by British Coal amounted to 1.4m tonnes in 1991-2, against 2m in recent years. (Coal imports, at nearly 10 times that level, are increasing at a similarly speed.) The white paper said British Coal expected to export only 700,000 tonnes in 1992-3, reflecting the corporation's decision to withdraw as quickly as possible from loss making business first hand. 'There may be limited scope for profitable export of larger size of coal and of anthracite, which are effectively niche markets, but readily accessible UK supplies are limited.' PDIF, however, buys coal from many other sources than British Coal. One source is private UK producers whose number is expected to grow in the privatisation process of the next few years. The company also buys coal from Australia, the Americas and South Africa among others. Most of the coal is sold in Europe, outside the UK, mainly to industrial customers including electricity generators, cement and steel makers. The company, which specialises in short sea movements of cargoes throughout north west Europe, processes as well as handles coal. Mr Hartiss says it is committed to being active participants rather than 'paper transaction traders'. Mr Hartiss says the company operates in markets dominated by large trading houses and low cost mass producers. 'Our skill is in identifying niche overseas trading and export markets for mainly specialised coal and anthracite products. We are looking at uses to which customers put coal and matching them with what we buy.'</p>

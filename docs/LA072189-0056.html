			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK PARKS BOARD REJECTS SPORTS COMPLEX IN THE HILLS  </P> <P> The Burbank Parks and Recreation Board on Thursday rejected plans for an  $8-million sports and tennis center in the Verdugo Mountains at an emotional  eight-hour hearing marked by disputes about the effect such a facility would  have on traffic and noise in adjoining single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The board voted 3 to 2 to go along with a staff recommendation that Stough Park  Family Sports Center not be built until the environmental impact of the center  and other planned recreational facilities in the Verdugo Mountains is  determined.  </P> <P> Steve Starleaf and Associates, which wants to build the center, is expected to  appeal the decision before the Burbank City Council next month.  </P> <P> More than 300 people attended the board meeting at John Muir Junior High  School. The meeting was repeatedly interrupted by applause from residents on  both sides of the debate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Property Values  </P> <P> Many in the audience felt that the center would ruin the hillside,  commercialize city parkland and reduce property values.  </P> <P> "I'm not against the concept, and I think it's a great idea," said Carol  DePhillip, who has lived in the hillside area for a year. "But this should not  be up there. If we go up there and tear down the hillsides, we will never be  able to get them back. It's an unnecessary destruction of nature and wildlife."  </P> <P> But other residents said the center was needed and posed no danger to  surrounding neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "There is obviously a great interest in tennis in Burbank and not enough  programs or courts available," Georgette Bishop said. "It's a shame that once  again, a few people with a not-in-my-back-yard philosophy are trying to kill  such a wonderful opportunity for our community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regional Center  </P> <P> Starleaf had hoped that the facility would become one of the largest of its  kind in Southern California, as well as one of five regional training centers  of the United States Tennis Assn., the official sponsor for national tennis  athletes.  </P> <P> The center would include 30 tennis courts, a center court for 2,000 spectators,  swimming pool, clubhouse and an 8,000-square-foot luxury restaurant.  </P> <P> Several homeowners earlier this year had voiced similar complaints about a  summer concert season at the Starlight Amphitheatre, which is near the site of  the proposed sports center. Protests forced cancellation of the season.  </P> <P> Parks and Recreation's staff opposed the tennis center because it would be  built in an area where other traffic-generating projects are located or being  considered.  </P> <P> In addition to the amphitheater, the area includes DeBell Golf Course, the  Castaway restaurant and Wildwood Canyon Park.  </P> <P> Parks and Recreation Director Richard R. Inga said the city plans to improve  parkland in the area, and the Castaway has announced intentions to expand the  restaurant, both of which would increase traffic in the area.  </P></p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Forget the experts, watch the individuals - Wall Street The year 1993 was a record-breaker for the US stock markets, with the main share indices ending the year close to their record highs. This week alone the Dow Jones industrial average reached a new peak on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, before some late profit-taking stopped the winning streak. Profit-taking was started by heavy selling on the Treasury market, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond over 6.3 per cent. Yet, the jump in bond yields was the result of bullish economic data. Among the good economic news released this week was a big decline in the number claiming unemployment benefits (to what was almost a five-year low), strong existing and new home sales, buoyant retail sales, and healthy leading indicators. With share prices buoyant, interest rates still low, company earnings steadily improving, and the economy showing signs of real and sustainable strength, 1994 should be another year for the record books on US stock markets, right? Well, maybe not. While analysts agree that both the economy and corporate profitability should grow at a handy pace this year, some fear this will lead to a revival in inflation and higher interest rates which, combined with investors' rejection of expensive stock values, will bring the long bull run to an end in 1994. Yet, if this year is going to be a disappointment, no one seems to have told US individual investors. Judging by the rate at which they continue to pour their money into stock mutual funds, investors are confident that 1994 will be as rewarding as 1993, when the Dow gained more than 14 per cent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 8 per cent and the Nasdaq composite climbed 13.5. per cent. Analysts estimate that net sales of stock mutual funds last month were up 30 per cent on a year earlier - although official figures for December have yet to be released. That would take the total of stock mutual fund sales for 1993 to Dollars 220bn. This would easily eclipse the previous record for sales set in 1992 of Dollars 142.9bn. These huge flows of funds have driven share prices higher, even though valuations have looked expensive historically.  Moreover, individuals have been pouring so much money into stocks that they are beginning to reverse the established trend of equities ownership in the US. After the great stock market crash of October 1987, many individual investors were scared away from equities (some feared for good), and over the following years institutional holdings of stocks rose steadily while individual holdings declined. That trend, however, looks as though it is now being reversed. Figures supplied by Birinyi Associates, a Connecticut-based financial markets research firm, show that at the end of the third quarter of 1993, the value of all US equities was Dollars 5,600bn. Of that total, 71 per cent was owned by households, either in the form of direct holdings (Dollars 3,000bn) or mutual funds (Dollars 1,000bn). That is a big increase from the three years 1990-1992, when households on average owned only 66 per cent of the value of equities, and it is fast approaching the levels seen before the 1987 crash when households accounted for as much as 75 per cent of equities ownership. The message from all this is clear: if you want to find out about how the US stock market will perform in 1994, look at what individual investors do, not what experts say. The weight of money into stocks can only keep pushing prices higher, and the Dow, which has been flirting with 3,800 in recent days, will probably test the 4,000 mark before 1994 is over. There's a happy thought for the new year.  ------------------------------------------------ Monday           3792.93     +      35.21 Tuesday          3793.77     +      00.84 Wednesday        3794.33     +      00.56 Thursday         3775.88     -      18.45 Friday           3754.09     -      21.79  ------------------------------------------------</p>

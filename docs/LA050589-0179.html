			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF BEATS AUSSIE, COASTS INTO SEMIFINALS;  </P> <P> AFTER STRUGGLE THURSDAY, SHE TAKES ONLY 50 MINUTES FOR VICTORY  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf cruised into the semifinals of the $200,000 Virginia  Slims women's tennis tournament today with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Rachel McQuillan  of Australia.  </P> <P> Graf, the top-ranked woman player in the world, struggled in her opening  tournament match Thursday against Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands. But  today, the West German needed only 50 minutes to dispatch the unseeded  Australian on the slow clay court.  </P> <P> Watched by Alexander Mronz, a West German tennis player reported by Hamburg  newspapers to be her boyfriend, Graf unleashed her full range of shots against  McQuillan.  </P> <P> McQuillan, ranked 127th in the world, tried to counter by rushing to the net  but found herself constantly passed by Graf's nearly error-free game.  </P> <P> "It was a good opportunity to practice a few shots before the upcoming  tournaments in West Berlin and Paris," said Graf, who is trying to repeat her  Grand Slam triumph of last year.  </P> <P> "I'm not playing yet the way I want, but it went well today," she said.  </P> <P> In Saturday's semifinals, Graf is to meet Bettina Fulco of Argentina, who  ousted Nathalie Tauziat of France 7-5, 7-6.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Men's Tennis  </P> <P> In Munich, meanwhile, Stefan Edberg crushed Alberto Mancini's hopes of winning  his second consecutive clay-court tournament, defeating the 19-year-old  Argentine 7-6, 6-2 today for a semifinal spot in the $205,000 Bavarian Open.  </P> <P> There was another setback for Argentina when Guillermo Perez-Roldan, last  year's Munich champion, was ousted by Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Chesnokov, winner at Nice two weeks ago, outlasted the Argentine 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> Edberg, the Wimbledon champion, routed Mancini in the second set after winning  the first-set tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Mancini, a clay court specialist who beat Boris Becker for the Monte Carlo Open  title last week, had no answer to Edberg's textbook serve-and-volley game.  </P> <P> "If I keep playing like this, I think I can win this tournament," said Edberg,  who is playing his first clay court event of the season.  </P> <P> Edberg's semifinal opponent will be Martin Strelba of Czechoslovakia, who  prevented an all-Swedish encounter by upsetting Jonas Svensson 6-4, 6-2.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union was assured of having one player in the final when Alexander  Volkov beat Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-2, 6-4. Volkov plays his countryman  Chesnokov in the semifinals.  </P></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: Paid does not necessarily mean earned Sir, 'Company chiefs accused of greed' said your headline (April 19). The 'greed is good' culture, illustrated by some of the corporate excesses of recent years and so tellingly shown, albeit partly tongue-in-cheek, in the US movie Wall Street, is further 'hyped' by so many articles in the financial press which say that the chairman of company A or the chief executive of company B last year earned Pounds Xm. In the vast bulk of cases they did not 'earn' that sum, they just happened to have been 'paid' it. D H Macpherson, Corner Cottage, 6B Green Lane, Burnham, Bucks SL1 8DR</p>

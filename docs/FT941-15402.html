			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Optimistic Rexrodt expects 1% growth Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday confirmed an official forecast of 1.0 to 1.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year, showing considerably more optimism than independent analysts. He insisted the prediction, based on a significant recovery of exports, steady growth of 6 to 8 per cent in east Germany, low interest rates and moderate wage settlements, was 'not optimistic, but serious and realistic'. Speaking in advance of next week's publication of the German government's annual economic report, Mr Rexrodt also spelt out plans for measures to deregulate the labour market, promote investment by small and medium-sized enterprises, and accelerate privatisation. The economics ministry forecast is significantly higher than that of the government's independent economic advisers - the so-called five wise men - who predict zero growth. The federation of German banks said yesterday that recovery would only be very gradual because of the low levels of capacity utilisation, low level of industrial orders, and modest outlook for consumer spending. Mr Rexrodt said the government forecast assumed a recovery of between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent in west Germany, and between 6 and 8 per cent in the east. He agreed that caution was still justified, because disposable incomes would be squeezed by higher pension and social security deductions, and by an increase in oil taxes. Among measures to promote competition and deregulate the German economy, he promised an amendment to energy legislation giving third parties increased access to the country's gas and electricity grids. The government forecast still expects an increase of 450,000 in unemployment, to reach more than 3.9m during the year. Mr Rexrodt said radical thinking was needed to make labour markets more flexible. He called for more low-wage employment, and a relaxation of tax and social security rules governing employment of cleaners and other household staff. Thyssen Stahl, the steelmaking arm of the Thyssen group, yesterday announced a further 1,250 job cuts this year after the continuing 'catastrophic' pattern of earnings in the industry in the last quarter of 1993. The latest redundancies come on top of 12,000 job losses already announced by Germany's largest steelmaker, and will affect primarily all the company's long product plants. Thyssen said it could not make redundancy payments, and asked the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia to provide funding. Separately, Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, announced short-time working in its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern and Eisenach during the first quarter of 1994, saying it did not expect 'any significant recovery' in the car market this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov: "How </F> Should We Shape NATO? Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov  Suggests We Consider This Issue"]    [Text] The chiefs of the leading Russian Federation mass  media recently received an official invitation to visit NATO  Headquarters in Brussels -- to familiarize themselves with the  organization in greater detail. The invitation was hardly an  accident -- the NATO leadership currently has a considerable  interest in ensuring more vigorous support for its "Partnership  for Peace" program from Russia's fourth estate.    Within Russia itself the arguments about whether or not to  join the NATO program have been raging for three months now.  According to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's information, the Russian  Federation president and Foreign Ministry leaders received a  report on this subject 24 May from Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov, currently Boris Yeltsin's representative at the  "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has also  learned that the marshal did not address himself to the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry because of the absolute inability,  in his view, of certain military department leaders to take  other opinions on board.    [Shaposhnikov begins] ...In the postwar period politicians  in the leading countries wasted a historic chance to strengthen  allied relations between the states and peoples which defeated  fascism and to offer the world new conditions for normal  coexistence without the threat of military confrontation. In  subsequent decades huge efforts were needed to convince people  of the fruitlessness of these kinds of relations.    There are now grounds for believing that our relations are  moving to a qualitatively new state -- from distrust to  cooperation, from confrontation to partnership, from the arms  race to arms cuts. Naturally these processes are complex,  multifaceted, and sometimes ambiguous. Also ambiguous is their  assessment by our society -- which has to be taken into account.  But if mutual extremism in assessing events, phenomena, and  trends is eschewed, the question still arises: Why has NATO not  been disbanded if it has no enemies and there is no  confrontation? In fact, the bloc is beginning to expand.    The fairness of this question is obvious even to NATO  members  themselves, since, under the conditions of detente, the bloc  would, figuratively speaking, be "unemployed." Having lost its  simple and comprehensible guideline of the image of the enemy,  military force -- and not just NATO's -- is today in a profound  ideological crisis. This is why the bloc participants have been  looking for a raison d'etre for several years now. One idea  they have come up with is the "Partnership for Peace" program,  which allows NATO to exist, but in a new and broader makeup,  with its claims to the establishment of a "new world order"  under its flag disguised....    Against this backdrop Russia's passivity is unjustifiable.    ...The invitation to participate in the program leaves  Russia  with a difficult and crucial choice to make. Let us look at the  likely scenarios and possible consequences of this choice.    Were Russia to unconditionally sign "Partnership," NATO's  influence would extend east to the Pacific and the Chinese  border -- which would not only upset the balance of power in the  East but could also lead to a resumption of confrontation with  our great eastern neighbor. Other negative consequences are  also possible.    Were Russia not to sign "Partnership," it could find itself  isolated from Western countries, and the borders of the NATO  bloc would come right up to our own borders. This could be  followed by the breakdown of the trust and mutual understanding  achieved during the detente period and would provide favorable  grounds for the reemergence of the Cold War -- something that  the world has grown tired of.    Raising the question of Russia's special role in  "Partnership" is also not the best "approach," since it is seen  as a negative by other partner countries (owing to its  similarity to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). If their views are  disregarded and agreement is reached with the leading NATO  countries on this kind of role for Russia, then this would again  be a case of hypocrisy and disguised hegemonism unworthy of  great Russia and its proclaimed principles of living without any  elder or junior brothers.    Consequently we need to seek a solution which on the one  hand  would release Russia from what is, for it, an unacceptable  choice while on the other hand confirming its role and  importance in the world community through its ability to propose  formulas that are not only consonant with its prestige but are  shared by many countries.    The peoples of the world, not only now but always, are  united  not by vestiges of the past in the form of military blocs but on  a more noble basis, the essence of which continues to be trust,  cooperation, and security. Consequently the world community  needs not military blocs but more civilized mechanisms for  regulating their relations. Such mechanisms exist -- the United  Nations, the CSCE, and others. The CIS and its structures can  be listed among these organizations with certain provisos.    But, under the new conditions, all these organizations are  insufficiently effective in ensuring proper trust, harmony, and  security in the world. Thus, there is a need to reform and  improve both the world organization (the United Nations), and  regional organizations (the CSCE, the CIS, and so forth), while,  on the other hand, dismantling military blocs and transforming  them into peacekeeping military mechanisms as components of the  aforesaid political organizations.    This is the essence of the concept of nonbloc coexistence  among states.    And it should be Russia that proposes it, reaffirming its  genuine adherence to peace, equal rights, trust, cooperation,  and democracy and its desire to travel the road of reform, not  merely becoming part of the economic area of the leading  countries and sometimes a raw-material appendage, but also not  rejecting the opportunity for cooperation on an equal footing  with all countries.    Building this concept envisages the existence of a worldwide  (main) organization (the United Nations) and its derivatives --  regional structures. The worldwide organization would deal with  general and more important issues, while the regional structures  would deal with individual [chastnyye] issues -- economic,  environmental, social, and information matters, the safeguarding  of security, and so forth. Both would complement each other.  Since the world is still far from perfect, and security has not  been ensured in the world, these structures should include  military organizations and contingents of peacekeeping forces  which could be brought into action on the basis of UN decisions  or at the request of its regional structures at an early stage  of the emergence of possible conflicts, as well as forces  designed to help the population and to deliver humanitarian aid  during natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes.    It would be expedient to train these (coalition)  peacekeeping  contingents at special regional training centers under definite  programs (some for operations under tropical conditions, others  for operations in mountainous terrain or deserts, and so forth)  with equipment, command and control, and logistical systems  standardized as far as possible and developed under competitive  conditions. At the same time, armaments and military hardware  intended for national armies (not within the peacekeeping  forces) will be developed under state plans and programs, which  will ensure their competitiveness.    Depending on its place, role, and geostrategic position in  the world, the same country could be a member of one or several  regional organizations. In this connection Russia could be a  member of the CSCE, the CIS, an organization of Asia-Pacific  region states, the Association of Black Sea States, and, of  course, the United Nations. And the CIS would have a more  specific and clear-cut outline in both form and content.    This, in my view, could mark the establishment of a new  order  in the world, in which Russia would have the initiative by dint  of its worth and prestige, and military force would acquire new,  nonideologized guidelines and moral and legal supports....    The strengthening, let alone the expansion of the military  bloc would serve to create not a new world order based on a  single footing but a new world disorder, since the monopolar  system of organizing life has always been unstable. Naturally  the NATO bloc is not yet ready to be dismantled, but the idea of  gearing it to reform in the foreseeable future and to engaging  in peacekeeping missions -- perhaps within the CSCE framework --  could be shared by many states.    Today's politicians must not waste this chance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to Khieu Samphan, </F> chairman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea, dated 3 May --  read by announcer]    [Text] Excellency, I am honored to inform the party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] of the following:    1. Abiding by the most enthusiastic, unanimous demand of our  beloved compatriots, in my capacity as the king of the Kingdom  of Cambodia I would like to urgently beseech the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC] and Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF]  and the PDK and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] to  immediately accept my formal and solemn proposal for an  immediate, complete, and unconditional cease-fire and a  standstill of all current positions of both sides.    2. If this cease-fire proposal is already accepted by the  RGC and KRAF and the PDK and NADK, I invite the RGC and KRAF and  the PDK and NADK to immediately send me two generals of the KRAF  and two other generals of the NADK to form, under my  chairmanship, a cease-fire observation committee to oversee this  cease-fire throughout the Cambodian territory.    3. The roundtable proposal of which your excellency has  already been aware for the past few days will be held inside the  royal palace in Phnom Penh or at the Cambodian palace in  Pyongyang when the cease-fire throughout Cambodia becomes truly  effective and concretely secure.    Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen have  agreed with and given their full support to this proposal since  the afternoon of Monday, 2 May 1994. Presently, I am confident  that your excellency will make your answer to my above proposal  known to me.    Affectionately yours,    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 3 May 1994</p>

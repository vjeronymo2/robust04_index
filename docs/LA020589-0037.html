			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOW OR NO SHOW?  </P> <P> Re the Jan. 29 Pop Eye item about the fire marshals closing the Palomino Club  during a Joe Ely performance on Jan. 21:  </P> <P> Ely had played only six songs when the show was stopped. The Palomino refused  to give us our money back. "You got a Joe Ely show," they said.  </P> <P> Ely, to his credit, played a few songs for the crowd outside. It took some of  the sting out of the debacle, but it took none of the stink out of the  Palomino.  </P> <P> RONALD BOYD, Culver City; ELAINE COSSMAN, Los Angeles; BEVERLY BRUINS, Santa  Monica; PATRICK CURREN, Santa Monica; ROBERT CARTER, Canoga Park; BARBARA  THOMPSON, Culver City  </P></p>

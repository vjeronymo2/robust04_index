			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhi Shamov] </F>   [Text] Makhachkala 7 May TASS--The situation in Derbent is  normalizing thanks to negotiations of leaders of national  Lezghian and Azeri movements who agreed to hold no more rallies  and settle all problems through a dialogue. Their joint appeal  urged residents of Derbent and Dagestan to show restraint,  wisdom and not yield to nationalist provocations.    Lezghian and Azeri rallies were held in Derbent this week  under nationalist slogans. The rallies were accompanied by  local clashes and fire exchanges. No casualties were reported.  The police were sent to resume order.    A reason for the rallies was a quarrel between several  Lezghians and Azeris that resulted in a fight and a fire  exchange, when two Lezghians were killed and several people,  including those underaged, wounded. After that a hundred of  Lezghians blocked the way to the town.    A meeting of the Dagestan parliament presidium discussed the  situation in Derbent and sharply criticized the Derbent  authorities and the police. New heads of the city  administration and city interior department were nominated. A  special government commission is working.</p>

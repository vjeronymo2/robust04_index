			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "$150 Million Confiscated at SBG"] </F>   [Excerpts] In the so far biggest Swiss case of  money-laundering, about $150 million were seized at the Swiss  Banking Society (SBG). Criminal proceedings have been initiated  against a long-standing deputy director of the biggest Swiss  bank in Zurich, the responsible authorities have announced.    According to information released by Jacques Antenen, deputy  investigating judge of Waadt Canton, the seizure of $150 million  at the SBG took place in connection with investigations against  suspected money-launderers of the Colombian Medellin drug  cartel. The Zurich District Prosecutor's Office is convinced  that the approximately $150 million is dirty money, as District  Prosecutor Dieter Jann-Corrodi said upon inquiry. "I have not  heard of any bigger case anywhere in the world so far," he said.  <H5>  Investigations Since June 1993 </H5>   Since June 1993 the Waadt judiciary has been investigating  Colombian citizens who belong to a criminal organization located  in the Colombian town of Barranquilla and are linked with the  Medellin cartel. They are suspected of having violated the  regulations concerning money-laundering in the cantons of Waadt,  Neuenburg, and Geneva. According to Antenen, they invested  money in, among other things, a restaurant and other real estate  properties, but that was less than 1 million Swiss francs.  According to the Waadt investigating judge, investigations are  being carried out together with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency  and the authorities in Zurich and are also spread to the cantons  of Neuenburg and Geneva. On 23 February a Colombian woman was  arrested; she is still in detention pending trial. Within the  framework of the investigations, the Waadt judicial authorities  applied to the authorities in Zurich for legal aid to seize more  than $150 million at the SBG.  <H5>  SBG Deputy Director Claims He Knows Nothing </H5>   Criminal investigations have been initiated in Zurich  against  the SBG deputy director, who acted as a trustee. The Zurich  District Prosecutor's Office accused the deputy director of  having long known about the dirty origin of the money but not  having reacted when the penal law on money-laundering came into  force in August 1990. His temporary arrest was announced on 27  February.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Value boost for investors in Hungarian hotels group Three US institutions which bought into Hungary's Danubius Hotels on Friday in Budapest's biggest stock-market transaction doubled the paper value of their investment yesterday as share prices leapt forward. Kingdon Capital Market Corporation, Indian Harbor Holdings and an anonymous investment fund paid Dollars 23.6m for 29 per cent of Danubius, the hotel and spa group, which is being privatised by the state property agency. In hectic trading yesterday Danubius shares moved beyond the Ft1,000 transaction price to end the day on Ft2,200. However, Creditanstalt Securities, the lead manager to the deal, warned that in this volatile market the group's share price might ease. The closing price values the US investors' shareholdings at Dollars 50m and the whole of Danubius at Dollars 173m, giving the hotel group the second highest market capitalisation of the 28 companies listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange. Danubius's performance helped push the BSE index up 7.1 per cent to 1,942. Danubius was originally earmarked for sale in Hungary's first privatisation programme in September 1990 but the recession in central eastern Europe forced its delay. In 1991 a planned public offering was cancelled at the last minute and unprecedentedly generous incentives were needed to make a success of the 1992 sale of 25 per cent of the company to domestic investors. Danubius yesterday announced that preliminary pre-tax profits rose 7.7 per cent to Ft882m (Dollars 8.6m) in 1993, on revenue of Ft5.1bn. The rise in Danubius reflects the growing fashion for emerging markets and a central European stockmarket boom which began last year in Warsaw and has spread to Budapest, taking the index up 58 per cent in January alone.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Record quarter at Charles Schwab CHARLES Schwab, the biggest discount brokerage firm in the US, yesterday announced record first-quarter profits of Dollars 35.4m, up from Dollars 29.7m a year earlier. The company continues to benefit from a trend in which individual investors have moved money out of low-yielding assets and into the stock markets. Net revenues rose 7 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 236.3m, the highest in the firm's history. Revenues from brokerage commissions climbed 5 per cent to Dollars 143.5m, and earnings from mutual fund service fees jumped 54 per cent to Dollars 20.6m as customer assets in the company's funds more than doubled to Dollars 15.3bn. The total amount of assets in client accounts at Schwab soared 43 per cent to Dollars 73bn, with a record 183,000 new accounts opened during the three-month period. The company's total expenses rose 5 per cent to Dollars 174.9m in line with the increase in customer activity. Despite the record figures, shares in Schwab fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange as investors took profits in a wide range of brokerage stocks, which had risen sharply earlier in the week. Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, is opening an office in Shanghai, the financial capital of China, where it will advise local companies and investors in financings. Bear Stearns is the second US securities firm to open a Shanghai office.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pati, Central Java (JP) -- Golkar [Functional Group]  chairman Harmoko has dismissed allegations that there is a  growing rift between the ruling political organization and the  Armed Forces (ABRI).    "That's not true. Golkar and ABRI have been partners for a  long time," Harmoko said here on Monday.    He said the allegations were made by irresponsible parties  out to see Golkar lose votes in the 1997 general election.    "Golkar and ABRI are in complete cooperation in making our  national development a tremendous success. It is groundless to  say that there is a rift between the two," said Harmoko.    Harmoko is the first civilian to be appointed to head Golkar  since the group was founded with the help of the Army in 1964.  He is currently visiting Pati as part of his current Ramadan  tour.    He expressed optimism that in the 1997 election Golkar will  regain the votes it lost to the other two contestants, the  United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic  Party (PDI) in 1992.    Golkar has won all four elections held under the New Order  administration. Although the government-backed political  organization won the 1992 election with a comfortable 68 percent  of the total votes, this represented a decline from 73 percent  seen five years earlier.    Many within the party have blamed Lieutenant General (ret)  Wahono, then chairman for Golkar, for the decline in popularity.    Wahono was replaced as chairman by Harmoko last October.    Harmoko, who is also minister of information in President  Suharto's cabinet attributed the decline in Golkar votes in the  1992 election to a lack of information and communications among  the group's cadres.    "But I'm pretty sure that Golkar will not suffer another  setback in 1997," he said emphatically.    He asked all Golkar members to make every effort to maintain  the organization's image as an agent of reform that responds to  the wants and needs of the people.    "Golkar should be more involved in finding solutions to the  problems that are facing the people," he added.    Harmoko emphasized that there must be better communication  between Golkar's provincial counselors. He also stressed the  need for all Golkar cadres to exercise what he cryptically  referred to as 'social control.'    "Every Golkar cadre must do more than support the  implementation of national development," Harmoko said. "He or  she must also exercise social control in an effective manner."    Central Java was one of the areas where Golkar fared poorly  in the last general election and Harmoko in his speech blamed  this specifically on the cadres' for failing to mobilize support.    Harmoko also took time to meet with the executives of the  Nahdlatul Ulama [NU] [Association of Muslim Scholars] in  Semarang, Central Java, on Monday where he gave a donation of Rp  [Rupiah] 20 million. The Golkar chairman denied that he was  using the donation to influence NU votes in Golkar's favor.    NU with its estimated 30 million members in Indonesia,  represents a potential block vote at each of the general  elections.</p>

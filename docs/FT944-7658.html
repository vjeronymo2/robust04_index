			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Merck plans Dollars 2bn repurchase programme Merck, the biggest US pharmaceuticals group, announced plans to buy back up to Dollars 2bn of its shares. The repurchase programme would help repair some of the dilution to the company's earnings per share which stemmed from the acquisition of Medco Containment Services at the end of last year, writes Richard Waters in New York. A sales company with lower profit margins than Merck's drug making business, Medco held back Merck's earnings to 62 cents a share in the most recent quarter, the same level as a year ago. Merck has been an active buyer of its own stock in recent years, having completed Dollars 3.7bn of repurchases between 1985 and 1992. The company had bought a further Dollars 371m under another Dollars 1bn programme before the purchases were halted by the planned Medco deal. The programme was resumed in September of this year is currently near completion, the company said.</p>

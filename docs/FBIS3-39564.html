On 29 September the Commission presented a proposal, on the  initiative of Mr. Marin, for a negotiating mandate aimed at  concluding a new agreement to take the place of the more limited  cooperation agreement concluded in 1975 as part of the European  Community's overall Mediterranean policy.    This proposal reflected a desire to upgrade EC-Israel  relations to take account of new developments in international  relations: The single market, the treaty on European Union, the  creation of the European Economic Area [EEA] and the new  partnership agreements the community has proposed to the Maghreb  countries. This process was given fresh impetus by the signing  on 13 September of the declaration of principles between Israel  and the PLO.    On 21 December the Council of the European Union formally  approved the negotiating mandate which Mr. Marin has today  presented to the Israeli authorities.    Following the meeting on 17 February with Israeli Foreign  Minister Mr. Shimon Peres, Mr. Marin said: "The negotiations  that have got under way today mark a new departure which will  bolster the measures to bring about peace in the region and help  forge closer links between the European Union and Israel."    In the wake of Mr. Marin's visit the technical negotiations  on the new agreement between the two sides are to start with a  view to concluding it as soon as possible in 1994.    The salient points of the new negotiating mandate approved  by  the Council are:     -  protection of human rights and democracy  to be an essential element of the agreement;    -  extension of free  trade to services, making for a better balance of trade between  the Community and Israel;    -  liberalization of public procurement,  with reciprocal access;    -  the possibility of associating Israel  with the Community's framework research and development program,  an area in which cooperation has been under way since 1983 and  one of considerable interest to both sides;    -  community support  for cooperation projects involving Israel and other countries in  the region;    -  a wider and more structured political dialogue  between the European Union and Israel;    -  a raft of other  cooperation measures in areas such as energy, the environment  and curbing drug trafficking.    The new agreement with Israel is also important for the  contribution it will make to the union's backing for the Middle  East peace process. The Commission presented its new overall  approach on the Middle East in its communication of 8 September  1993.    A balanced approach by the Union to the countries of this  region will also be reflected in efforts to create conditions  for a satisfactory level of economic development in the Occupied  Territories and foster economic development in the region as a  whole. Support for regional cooperation between all partners in  the Middle East will be complemented by stepping up the dialogue  between the Union and each of the countries concerned.</p>

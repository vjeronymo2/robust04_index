			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: CS Holding lifts voting stake in CS First Boston CS Holding, the Swiss financial group whose interests include Credit Suisse, has lifted its voting stake in the investment bank CS First Boston to more than 75 per cent. The increase, from 68.5 per cent, takes the group closer to its objective of gaining outright ownership of the investment bank, which is in the middle of a worldwide reorganisation. However, a number of institutional investors, led by Metropolitan Life, the US insurer, has rejected an offer from CS for the remaining voting shares. CS said yesterday that it had bought the shares previously held by five of the investment bank's 12 institutional shareholders. The largest seller was Mitsui Trust and Banking, which had owned 1.8 per cent. Three of the others were Japanese life companies and the fifth was a European investment manager, CS said. The purchases lift the group's interest in the investment bank's voting shares to 75.7 per cent from 68.5 per cent, and in the non-voting shares to 63.2 per cent from 59.8 per cent. The Swiss group said that its intention generally was to own all of the shares in its subsidiaries, though it believed that it was beneficial for the employees of an investment bank to have an economic interest in their business. Employees of CS First Boston are thought to own around 19 per cent of the company's non-voting shares. The offer to buy out the remaining shares followed an approach from some of the institutional holders, who had expressed a desire to sell, CS said. Metropolitan Life, which owns 9.9 per cent of the voting stock, and Crescent Diversified, an investment vehicle which holds 5 per cent, were among those that turned down the offer, details of which were not released.</p>

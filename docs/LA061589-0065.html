			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE TRIMS BUDGET  </P> <P> By trimming expenditures in all departments studied so far, the Lawndale City  Council has cut about $180,775 from the city's proposed $7.8-million budget for  1989-90. Some of the savings will be offset by a council decision to allow 5%  cost-of-living increases for 15 to 20 part-time employees.  </P> <P> Still hanging in the balance are the jobs of six city employees targeted for  layoffs as the council seeks to raise $418,592 to pay for increased Sheriff's  Department services. The council will meet at 6 p.m. today to complete their  budget recommendations, and the layoffs probably will not be decided upon until  a 7 p.m. public hearing June 19.  </P> <P> At the council's third budget workshop Tuesday night, Blanche Cramer announced  that about 80 senior citizens at the city's Prairie Avenue Community Center  have signed petitions urging the council not to cut back on personnel or  programs there.  </P> <P> Cramer called the proposed layoffs of six workers, some with 12 to 17 years  with the city, "cruel and thoughtless," and said that if jobs and programs are  eliminated, seniors will fight back next April when three council members will  be up for reelection.  </P> <P> "You too can be replaced," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey (Disney Sunday at 9 p.m.): Through the  compassion and filmmaking skills of his son George Stevens Jr., the life and  work of director George Stevens make a compelling drama. His was a deeply  American life with a shadow of sadness over its last third and more that is as  moving as the best novels. (2:00)  </P> <P> I Walk the Line (Cinemax Monday at 11 a.m.): John Frankenheimer's underrated  1970 drama starring Gregory Peck as a rural sheriff who falls disastrously in  love with a moonshiner's daughter (Tuesday Weld). (1:35)  </P> <P> Shadow of a Doubt (TMC Thursday at 8 p.m.): Hitchcock's favorite among his  films, in which a nice Santa Rosa family is visited by a charming cousin  (Joseph Cotten) who beguiles the daughter of the family (Teresa Wright). A  subtle, gripping 1943 tale of small-town innocence menaced by a dangerous  outsider. (1:48)  </P> <P> Ground Zero (Showtime Saturday at 6:05 a.m., again at 3:05 p.m.): An  outstanding 1987 Australian political thriller suggesting that nuclear tests  had been done in Australia by Britain between 1953 and 1964 with a callous  disregard for Australian military personnel as well as countless nomadic  aborigines. (1:49)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Social Democrats Against the EU: </F> Welfare Policy at Risk"]    [Text] At a press conference in Oslo yesterday the Social  Democrats Against the EU [European Union] (SME) made public a  brochure containing their arguments against EU membership and  their vision of a social democratic Norway.    "It will be more difficult to realize the Labor Party's  program if we join the Union," former Minister Tove Strand  Gerhardsen said.    She said that the EU gives the highest priority to the fight  against rising prices, while any growth in the number of jobs is  to happen through the market. In the event of Norwegian EU  membership, the Norwegian authorities will not be able to make  use of public budgets in the fight against unemployment, she  said.    According to Strand Gerhardsen, it will also be more  difficult to carry on Norway's social welfare polices if we are  to make a contribution to the EU budget of between 13 and 17  billion kroner, in her estimate.    "We cannot take the initiative internationally -- build  bridges -- if we have not won approval for this in the Union,"  Strand Gerhardsen added. He said that if we remain outside the  EU, then Norway will be able to go its own way to a greater  extent and be a source of environmental inspiration, for example.    Strand Gerhardsen also has reservations about the  decisionmaking process in the EU, because it is not sufficiently  open or democratic. Finn Erik Thoresen said that the EU  represents a lack of freedom for the trade union movement.    In its brochure the SME stresses that its opposition to the  EU is the result of current circumstances -- against the  background of the Maastricht Treaty and today's EU. Strand  Gerhardsen was open to the idea of membership of a pan-European  EU, but said that such a community could not be built on the  Maastricht Treaty.</p>

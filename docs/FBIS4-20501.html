			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xie Liangjun] </F>   [Text] The first Sino-ROK joint venture in  telecommunications was sealed yesterday in Beijing, during a  week highlighted by Republic of Korea (ROK) President Kim Young  Sam's official visit to China.    The Beijing Telecommunications Administration and the Kohap  Group announced the formation of the Beijing Jing Koh Integrated  Telecommunications Equipment Company Limited at a ceremony in  Beijing.    The new- and high-tech joint venture project has an initial  investment of $2.1 million, with each side having a half-stake.    It will introduce technology from the Integrated Network  Corporation (INC) of the United States, called DDOV (Digital  Data Over Voice), to produce UDVM (Universal Data Voice  Multiplexing) equipment.    Company technicians said that by installing UDVM equipment  on  a public telephone line, phone users will have easy access to  public or private digital data networks such as Chinapac and DDN.    The equipment is expected to have a big market in China, as  the country's telephone system undergoes a spectacular  expansion. China has also been working hard to expand and  upgrade the national public packet-switching data network, known  as Chinapac, to speed up information exchange.    After joining the Chinapac network, computers across the  country can exchange information with other computers at home or  abroad.    Three ROK ministers of telecommunications, commerce and  industry, and science and technology also took part in yesterday  afternoon's launching ceremony. Also attending were Vice  Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Tian Jiyun,  Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa and Telecommunications  Vice-Minister Yang Xianzu.    Yang said that since China and ROK established diplomatic  relations in August, 1992, postal and telecommunications  co-operation has grown rapidly and has a promising future.    One example of close ties in this field between the two  countries is the fact that Chinese Telecommunications Minister  Wu Jichuan is Chairman of the Chinese Government reception  committee for President Kim's visit this week.</p>

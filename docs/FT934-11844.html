			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Dry run Skiers returning to London's City airport need not look far if they want to invest in their skills. A dry ski slope is for sale in east London, less than a mile from the end of the runway. The site, initially owned by the London Docklands Development Corporation, has had a chequered history. The original developers spent about Pounds 900,000 on it but the receiver to its present owner is seeking offers of about Pounds 350,000. Mr Robert Matusiewicz of BDO Binder Hamlyn believes it could generate revenue of about Pounds 300,000 a year and says there has already been interest in the development, built on reclaimed land.</p>

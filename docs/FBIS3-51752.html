The negotiations concluded successfully, Londono assured  PRENSA LATINA at the end of his visit to the island, which  lasted from 2 to 11 January.    Londono said the agreement signed with his Cuban  counterpart,  Julio Teja, could double the initial amount involved before the  end of the first half of 1994.    We predict that these purchases will double or triple within  the next two years, Londono added.    Although the minister gave no details, he suggested that  such  acquisitions of medicine and services could help Cuba pay its  debt to Colombia, which unofficial Colombian sources estimate at  about $45 million.    Londono pointed out that this form of payment would "give  way  to a revolution, to a debt-for-health swap, which I think would  be a major innovation in Latin America."    In addition to these purchases, Londono added, we also  reached agreements on exchange and technical assistance programs  by which Cuban specialists will cooperate in primary care  services, epidemiological programs, and medicine control.    The Colombian minister pointed out that his visit surpassed  his expectations because the host party was more willing to  negotiate and cooperate than he had expected.    Londono added that they identified a number of possible  joint  ventures that will create an aggressive and positive exchange  system.    The minister said he hopes the ties that were established  will prove durable and will lead Colombia to adopt the  advantages of the Cuban health system under conditions  applicable to that country.    As for the agreement that was signed, Londono emphasized  that  "he expects a successive link of strong trade relations in the  health sector, as well as in the economic, industrial, and  agricultural sectors."    The Colombian minister described his visit to Cuba as very  enriching for Colombian society because he acquired detailed  information about the operation of the local health system and  about the things that could be useful to his country.</p>

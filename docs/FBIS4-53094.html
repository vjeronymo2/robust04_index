			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan [BOJ] has  provided low-interest loans to the Norinchukin Bank in a secret  deal between the Finance and Farm Ministries to help farm  cooperative- affiliated financial institutions which gave huge  loans to housing loan companies, a major national daily reported  Sunday.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN said the central bank has provided from  tens of billions of yen to about 100 billion yen in loans to the  Norinchukin Bank under a memo exchanged between officials of the  Finance Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry in February of last year.    The memo also gives favorable treatment to farm  cooperative-affiliated financial institutions under the umbrella  of the Norinchukin Bank on the reduction and exemption of loan  interest to help them, the daily said. Such institutions  provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the housing loan  companies, it said.    The memo was exchanged for relief measures for Nippon  Housing  Loan Co., the nation's largest housing loan company, and later  applied to those for other housing loan companies, the daily  said.    The memo says the BOJ will provide necessary loans to the  Norinchukin Bank because it is difficult for farm cooperative-  affiliated financial institutions to reduce and redeem interest  on loans for housing loan companies.    The daily said seven housing loan companies are having  financial difficulties due to bad loans to realtors, with the  loans totaling 13.6 trillion yen.</p>

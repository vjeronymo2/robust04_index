			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Arab Banking sells 20% of HK unit ARAB Banking Corp, one of the Middle East's biggest banks, has announced an agreement to sell 20 per cent of its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary to a Chinese group, Reuter reports from Manama. ABC chief executive Mr Abdulla Saudi said that ABC also hoped soon to offer 25 per cent of the subsidiary, International Bank of Asia, to investors in Hong Kong. The 20 per cent stake will go to China Everbright Holdings, the Hong Kong arm of the Everbright group under the control of China's State Council, ABC said. The deal is subject to final approval from the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong. 'We are very soon going to offer 25 per cent on the Hong Kong stock market,' Mr Saudi said. 'This will hopefully take place in the very near future.' The sales form part of ABC's strategy of forming strategic alliances around the world while still maintaining a controlling interest in its subsidiaries. ABC was particularly keen to position itself to take advantage of China's fast growth, Saudi said, and this link-up will enable it to do so.</p>

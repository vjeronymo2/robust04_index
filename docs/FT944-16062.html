			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / General strike paralyses Italian cities Italy's big cities were paralysed yesterday by a four-hour general strike called by the trade unions to protest against cuts in pension and welfare benefits in the 1995 budget. The stoppage was accompanied by over 80 demonstrations, which the organisers said attracted 3m people including crowds of 200,000 in Florence, Milan and Rome. Union organisers, combined with tight police security, ensured there were no incidents. The peaceful nature of the protest and the prospect of more strikes to come last night looked likely to encourage the government to find a way of resuming a dialogue with the unions. Both Mr Giuseppe Tartaella, the deputy premier, and Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, hinted at this. The dialogue was broken off 2 1/2 weeks ago when the government decided to go ahead with its plans to find L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) to reduce the 1995 budget deficit, largely through spending cuts. The strike was called by the three main trade union confederations and had been preceded by a series of rolling stoppages over the previous two weeks in large factories. Similar general strikes were staged against the austerity budgets prepared by the two previous governments. But yesterday's stoppage was far more widespread and saw much bigger crowds of demonstrators in all the big cities. Civil servants, who are also at loggerheads with the government over a wage and work conditions contract, stayed away all day, and public transport stoppages were staged at different times in different parts of the country. Though the demonstrations were well behaved, their tone was angry. The demonstration banners were as much against the budget as against Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, in person. Mr Berlusconi himself was absent in Moscow signing a new friendship treaty with Russia. As a sign of changing times, Mr Berlusconi was the first foreign head of government staying inside the Kremlin - while workers were chanting anti-government slogans on the streets of Italy. The unions' leadership still hopes to prevent the shake-up in Italy's generous pay-as-you-go state pensions system hurting the weakest members. Even before yesterday's strike, some members of the government were concerned by the loss of popularity over handling of the pensions issue. Mr Mastella, whose ministry is in the front line of the issue, has pledged to remedy hardship cases and iron out anomalies. The populist Northern League, one of Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, has also said it will seek to soften the impact of the reform when the measures are discussed in parliament. 'I hope that as of this evening we can restart the dialogue,' Mr Mastella said in a radio interview. In contrast, the treasury has warned that any extra cost caused by changes in the pensions reform proposals would have to be made up elsewhere. The budget proposals involve an acceleration in raising the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women, reducing the rate at which pension rights accrue, raising the minimum period of contributions, and penalising early retirement.</p>

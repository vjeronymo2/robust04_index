			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Junk deal Joseph Perella's first big deal for Morgan Stanley is not proving harmonious. In June, the former First Boston and Wasserstein Perella takeover artist seemed to have pulled off Wall Street's fanciest bit of financial footwork of the year. The Dollars 2.7bn break-up bid for Kemper he conjured up on behalf of Morgan Stanley's client Conseco had everything - bank debt, junk bonds, even a little bit of equity. Unfortunately for Perella, the deal has been unravelling fast. Selling assets to bring down the debt has proved a problem, and forced a delay to the deal. Now Conseco chairman Stephen Hilbert has had to admit that his own shareholders won't back the transaction, forcing him to cut the value of his bid. Never mind. If Kemper ends up soliciting a higher offer from someone else, it will have to pay Conseco Dollars 100m. So maybe Perella has earned his keep after all.</p>

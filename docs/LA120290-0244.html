Bankroll: $1,4444  </P> <P> Saturday's Loss: $90  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,354  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bob Mieszerski lost $60 when his key exacta horse finished ninth in the fourth  race. Bob's bet for today is $100 to win on My Boy Adam in the fifth race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bob's Sat. Bankroll: $1,397.20  </P> <P> Saturday's Loss: $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,337.20  </P> <P> Both started with $2,000 bankrolls.  </P></p>

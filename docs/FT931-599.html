			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Software institute plans to exploit Europe's expertise A GROUP of leading computer companies and their customers are seeking to improve Europe's competitiveness by developing, through a new research institute, better ways to write computer software. Establishment of the institute in Bilbao, Spain, will be announced today. It will focus on software processes and the rules and procedures for writing effective software. The aim, according to Mr George Grunberg of France's Groupe Bull, acting chairman of the new institute's board, is to exploit Europe's software expertise: 'Modern industrial society relies more and more on the availability and quality of software systems of ever-increasing size and complexity,' he said. Difficulties in specifying and writing large software programmes are recognised as a barrier to the greater use of computerisation in business and industry. While a number of blueprints or methodologies for software construction have been created, no universal method of guaranteeing effective software development has yet been found. The members of the group include Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa of Spain, British Aerospace, Sema Group, Logica and Lloyds Register of the UK, Groupe Bull and Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Olivetti and Finsiel of Italy, and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany. Each has subscribed Ecu100,000 (Pounds 82,600) to launch the project. Membership is open to any company with European operations interested in software development. New members would pay significantly less a year than the founders, Mr Grunberg said, but would have access to all the research and results. A managing director is being sought for the institute, which is expected to begin work in the summer. The institute, which will operate on a non-profit basis, has the blessing of the European Commission although it is wholly an industry-led initiative. It is expected to employ up to 50 software experts when fully staffed. Bilbao was chosen after a number of European cities had expressed interest in hosting the institute. It has a well developed high-technology infrastructure and close links with US academic research in software development.</p>

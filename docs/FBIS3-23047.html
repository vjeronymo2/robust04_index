			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb 26 KYODO -- The Japanese Red Army, a  radical group based in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley, has sent a  document explaining their operations to supporters in Japan and  calling for more support, sources familar with the group said  Saturday [26 February].    The document, titled "Let's Become Guerrilla Warriors,"  tells  in detail about how the extremist group spend their daily lives  and engage in training as guerrillas. The document is about  140,000 words long.    The document was likely written before an agreement last  September between Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) on Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied  territories.    The Red Army has been working under the Popular Front for  the  Liberation of Palestine, a more militant arm of the PLO.    The paper describes the group's military training and daily  lives in camps where they said they can watch international  satellite news programs such as Cable News Network.    They wake up at 6:00 a.m. and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. and  when there is a holiday or a member has a birthday they make  Japanese traditional foods such as rice balls and  "kamaage-udon," the document said.    The extremists, always carrying handguns and wearing  military  uniforms mainly made in South Korea, live in block-like huts in  the summer and winter and live in tents the rest of the year.    The group calls for more support from Japan, saying "the day  will come when the world will be united as one. It depends on  us, and your way of life and strife."    Japanese authorities, noting there is a plan by supporters  in  Japan to publish the document as a book, said the paper was  written in a more gentle manner than previously done and that  the group aims to appeal to a larger audience.    The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series  of  hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972  massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / IMF, World Bank begin talks in Haiti this week A team from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will begin a visit to Haiti at the end of this week for talks which will mark the start of international efforts to rebuild an economy enfeebled by decades of dictatorial rule and three years of economic sanctions. Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's president who was reinstated last month after three years in exile, has indicated he is willing to implement a range of sweeping reforms to breathe life into the economy. Mr Smarck Michel, the prime minister nominated by Mr Aristide, is also reported to back the reforms. However, even among Mr Aristide's closest supporters, there is a view that the changes proposed are too radical and their unpopularity could disrupt the government's other work. The true indication of Mr Aristide's commitment will be known by the month-end. The letter of intent to the IMF, which should be prepared within 10 days of the visit of the joint team, will contain the economic targets to lay the ground for wider reforms. The mission will be led by the head of the InterAmerican Development Bank, Mr Enrique Iglesias, and include officials from the World Bank and the UN. The framework for the economic programme, which will not be completed in the remaining 15 months of President Aristide's term, was agreed by a group of donor countries and Mr Aristide's government-in-exile this year. It proposes extensive deregulation of the economy, the divestment of state enterprises to local and foreign investors and tariff reform. The bureaucracy is to be trimmed and institutions, such as the judiciary and police, rebuilt. Of the Dollars 770m needed for the programme over the next 15 months, World Bank officials said yesterday Dollars 80m will be required to clear arrears to foreign creditors. This will open the door to further bilateral and multilateral financial assistance. Political calm should also elicit an increase in two other sources of finance - funds for charities working in the country and remittances from Haitians overseas. Many Haitian businessmen believe the programme offers the best chance for economic revival. They say assembly industries (garments, electrical appliances, baseballs - all for the US market) will theoretically be easy to restart if stability is maintained. But some US suppliers may be less enthusiastic to renew contracts for the assembled products because of concerns about longer-term political stability. Furthermore, the US reimposed quotas recently on Haitian clothing imports.</p>

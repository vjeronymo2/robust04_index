			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Open to Blind Trust and </F> Federalism"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 11 -- Forza Italia leader Silvio  Berlusconi said on Monday [11 April] that he saw the American  so-called blind trust model as the best way to separate his  business interests from public duties and voiced his readiness  to accept federalism in Italy, if this is to mean  decentralization of power.    Also today, representatives from the Freedom Alliance which  won last month's elections -- Forza Italia, National Alliance  and Northern League -- began meetings to hammer out a consensus  for new speakers for the Senate and House, which will be seated  on Friday.    Speaking to an assembly of Forza Italia candidates elected  to  parliament, held in the spa town Fiuggi outside Rome, Berlusconi  said "I absolutely want to separate the private interests I have  as shareholder in Fininvest from the public activities I will  perform in the interests of all." Berlusconi and his family own  total control of his holding conglomerate Fininvest which has  interests in such areas as broadcasting and the printed media,  publishing, advertising, insurance, money management, insurance,  retail outlets and the first division soccer team AC Milan.    Answering press questions on the compatibility of his  business and public interests, Berlusconi replied "We have no  problems about examining this question. A law (already) exists  which deals with this problem very precisely, only no one has  brought it up, except for some members of the press." "We have  no problem reopening the question," the Forza Italia leader  continued, "but it is not easy, given that we are dealing with  40 thousand people, put together through a creative and business  effort of over 30 years. There can be no quick answers,"  Berlusconi added, "although one answer has already been given,  concerning the separation of my interests in the activities of  Fininvest, from which I have already stepped down. We are now  examining how to best offer guarantees for this matter."    After stating how experts in international law and antitrust  regulations had been given the task of finding a solution,  Berlusconi turned his attention to speculation that parts of his  empire were to be sold off. "There are certain areas of  Fininvest which could be sold if the opportune offer were made.  But one cannot make public the content of any such offer for  this would diminish."    The "blind trust" formula is practiced by American  businessmen who take public office. The subject declares all  his or her interests which are then placed in a trust fund to be  administered independently by an especially appointed board  which, while proposed by the subject, must be approved by  federal authorities.    Turning his attention to the issue of federalism, Berlusconi  recalled how "Before the elections we ascertained the need to  decentralize the state administration. After the elections, the  League exerted pressure on us to make a commitment to change the  constitution in the federal sense. From the start we have  voiced out openness on the question and have requested  information on it from the League. Our position has not changed  since then.... We are open to what is in the interests of the  nation."    Looking towards the next Italian government, Berlusconi was  careful to recall how a mandate must first be given by head of  State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and then stressed how the winning  alliance represented a break with the past, a break he would  personally guarantee if given the government mandate.    The man most seen as the next premier then went on to  reiterate how his would be a government which holds the central  ground of the political spectrum, which could see support from  the center-right but also the center-left.    The first step towards a new government will the election in  parliament, to be seated on Friday, for the speakers of the  Senate and Lower House and while Berlusconi was in Fiuggi, his  representative met with their counterparts from the winning  alliance to discuss candidates.    For the Senate, where the Forza Italia-led coalition does  not  hold an absolute majority, the current speaker, Giovanni  Spadolini, is considered by many to be the front-runner. His  candidacy, however, is opposed by the Northern League of Umberto  Bossi, which wants its outgoing Senate whip, Francesco Speroni,  to take the chair. Spadolini is considered by observers to be  an "institutional" solution, one which neither Forza Italia nor  the National Alliance oppose.    Coming out of today's meeting, Raffaele Costa of the  Centrist  Union told the press "We believe conditions exist for the  speakers of the House and Senate to be from the (government)  majority and decided upon on Saturday." Costa, the outgoing  transport minister and secretary of the Liberal Party, went on  to confirm Speroni's candidacy but would not rule out other  names.    For the House, Costa expressed his preference for fellow  Liberal Alfredo Biondi and reiterated how, in any case, the next  speaker would be from the winning alliance.    Political discussion today also looked at the possibility of  Radical Marco Pannella's group joining the future government  coalition and Pannella, who failed to win election, even being  appointed as foreign minister. His candidacy was not frowned  upon by the Northern League, with Number Two Roberto Maroni  recalling how the League had originally proposed Pannella as  foreign minister because of his staunch federalist views.    The idea of Pannella as foreign minister is opposed by the  National Alliance, with its leader, Gianfranco Fini, also taking  a dim view of the League taking over the Interior Ministry.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoria Andreyeva under the rubric "Viewpoint": </F> "Cuckoo, Cuckoo, How Long Will I Live?..."]    [Text] Something bad must be in the wind for the fate  of the newly elected parliament if Larisa Skoryk does not want  to subject herself to a repeat vote. Instead, she intends to try  to catch the pernicious bird.    Regarding the bird (the cuckoo, in particular)--this is a  quote from the angry verbiage unleashed by Larisa Pavlovna at a  postelection press conference in Lviv. As most of those who lost  personally, she is firmly convinced that elections were lost by  the democratic forces, completely and wholesale. And the party  at fault for this is the same, in the former deputy's opinion,  as the one that is always at fault for everything--Chornovil's  Rukh. With a far-reaching hint at behind-the-scenes intrigues,  she proposed to "figure out" who was the cuckoo who slipped an  egg into the friendly democratic nest, which later produced a  nasty chick who pushed everyone else out of the nest--the Rukh  Party...    The scandal continues in the electoral district where L.  Skoryk and A. Gudyma (a Rukh candidate) ran. As already  reported, the district electoral commission invalidated the  elections. The Central Electoral Commission [CEC] has not yet  handed down a decision. The Rukh oblast organization adopted a  statement of no confidence in the head of the district electoral  commission and is protesting against electing him as commission  chairman at the upcoming elections of local bodies of authority.  Meanwhile, Larisa Skoryk and the district commission insist that  propaganda in favor of the candidate and a put-down of his  opponent were conducted on television during pre-election  Saturday, and they are ready to defend this opinion in the  Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Gudyma has turned to the CBU  [Ukraine Security Service]: He says that during his absence  (attending the Rukh congress in Kiev), unknown persons called  his home and threatened him and his family.    The "burp" from the recent elections may add a few unsavory  details to the above. A claim has been filed in court against  People's Deputy Mikhail Kosiv. The same district commission of  the same district believes that he publicly accused it of  dishonesty. Thereby insulting its honor and dignity. The KUN  [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], meanwhile, is appealing to  the CEC, questioning the results of elections in another  district... Rukh's ill-fated television broadcast has brushed a  KUN candidate as well. The most interesting part is that there  actually is a winner in this district, and not just anybody, but  Rukh's deputy head Aleksandr Lavronovych.    Based on the above, it seems questionable that any real bloc  of more or less centrist, more or less democratic forces will be  fielded at the local elections. Nevertheless, right now the need  for this is being proclaimed rather loudly. People who have  tried so hard not to quarrel with extremists have finally  stooped to using phrases like "extreme right danger," and so on.  The local Rukh and oblast authorities said this. They said it  frankly. There are reasons, they said: imperial-communist,  national-democratic, and extreme right. And while in the eastern  part of Ukraine the situation is defined by the confrontation  between the first and the second, in the western part it is  between the second and the third. It has been said. Albeit a  little late...    The "heroes" of UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense], who acquired  legitimacy thanks to breaking into the deputy ranks, called up a  rally a few days ago. They exhorted the voters to come to the  local elections under the juicy slogan: "UNA to power, UNSO--go  storming, traitors to be impaled on a spike!" Rallies are not in  fashion today. So this one, much like the others, only featured  a gathering of a small group of, to put it mildly, customarily  unbalanced persons. But that is not the point. The authorities  of our fantastic state are still doing something  incomprehensible. For instance, law enforcement organs of  Zhitomir and Lviv in tandem whipped up a case: A year ago UNSO  member Pavlyuk knocked off some protruding parts from Lenin's  monument in a factory garden in Zhitomir. Now he is being  extradited with fanfare from Lviv to the site of commission of  the crime. Here he is, a ready hero-martyr so much needed by the  Bolshevik movement; here it is--a case one can milk emotionally  for a long time... The funny part is that numerous  transgressions by these goons that do indeed require punishment  have gone unpunished. While a semi-anecdotal, outdated both in  terms of timing and subject, is being blown out of proportion.  Complete stupidity? Or, on the contrary, design?    The local elections in Galicia promise to be tense. As to  the  second round of elections in three "open" Supreme Council  districts, there is one almost-sensation. At the aforementioned  press conference Larisa Skoryk suddenly said that she would not  run for a second time even if she were granted such right in the  event the elections in her district are deemed invalid. She is  so unhappy with those already elected that she decided to follow  the Bible: Blessed is he who does not go to the council of the  profane... There is a temptation to explain this away as a  woman's emotional outburst, but would such an explanation not be  too frivolous? Lady Larisa is a person who is extremely close to  presidential circles. Just yesterday she conducted her campaign  with energy and drive. What has changed? Has someone made the  decision that the new Supreme Council is stillborn anyway?...</p>

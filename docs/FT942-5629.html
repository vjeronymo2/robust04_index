			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Assurance on profit margins at Siebe Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in profitability and sought to allay concern that it was suffering margin pressure. The UK-based group increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 182m to Pounds 217m in the year to April 2, while sales grew by 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.62bn to Pounds 1.86bn. Currency translation boosted the profits figure by Pounds 13m and sales by Pounds 133m. Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive, said the group's return on sales had dipped from 14.7 to 14.3 per cent, but this was attributable to acquisitions made during the year. Underlying margins were slightly ahead, although the group was concentrating on increasing market share, rather than pushing up margins. Mr Yurko said the group had also adjusted intra-group pricing to take less profits in the US. Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said the final quarter of the year confirmed indications of a considerable improvement in certain markets, 'particularly in North and South America, Asia and, to a limited extent, in the UK and Australasia'. He added that although there had been signs of improved demand, Siebe continued to believe continental European and Japanese markets would remain subdued until the end of this calendar year, particularly as many customers relied heavily on domestic demand 'which is at present quiet in these areas'. Sales in the controls divisions, after excluding currency translation and acquisitions, increased by 5.9 per cent and were particularly strong in the second half. Mr Yurko said he was confident that these divisions would show real growth of 10 per cent in the current year. Operating cashflow rose to Pounds 126m from Pounds 95m, and gearing fell from 66 to 25 per cent. Shareholders' funds rose by Pounds 208m to Pounds 950m, thanks mainly to last November's Pounds 184m rights issue. The profits figure was struck after Pounds 17.3m of restructuring costs, down from Pounds 11.4m the previous year. Earnings per share rose by 19.4 per cent to 31.4p (26.3p). A final dividend of 7.34p gives a total of 11p (9.86p), an increase of 11.6 per cent. Lex, Page 18</p>

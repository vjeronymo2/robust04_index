			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Province" rubric: </F> "Federation Council Promises `Equal Rights' to Regions.  Associations Give Up State-Owned Status `Not To Expose  Themselves'"]    [Text] A protocol of intentions has been signed with  representatives of all eight Russian interregional associations  -- Central Russia, the North-West, the Chernozem zone, the  Siberian Accord, the Association of North Caucasian Krays and  Oblasts, the Greater Volga, the Urals Regional Association, and  the Far Eastern Association. According to Federation Council  Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko, "the country's leaders have paid  dearly for their misconception that authority is concentrated in  Moscow alone." Mr. Shumeyko reaffirmed that from now on the  federal authorities will see interregional associations as "an  equal subject of regional politics and a participant in all  talks."    The protocol that was signed calls for a cooperation treaty  to be negotiated between the federal parliament and the  associations, which, as the interregional association leaders  expect, will be followed by the adoption of "a law on  interregional cooperation" in which the associations will have a  key role to play. Moreover, Vladimir Shumeyko hinted at the  possibility of conferring "a state- legal status" on the  associations.    The discussion on substance was held in strict secrecy from  the press.    Aleksandr Danusiya, general director of the Central Russia  association, told your SEGODNYA correspondent that "most  association chiefs categorically opposed the proposal to finance  them from the budget." "First, because this would necessitate  accounting..." But the main reason for the interregional  association chiefs' reluctance to assume "state status,"  Aleksandr Danusiya acknowledged, is that "one should not rush  into the idea of enlarging the associations..." He is certain  that "the associations are a prototype of a future management  structure, but when they can become such -- in 10-15 years or in  two years -- will depend on the situation..."    However, even at this stage interregional association  leaders  call themselves "the sole body that can coordinate and actually  implement all decisions on the ground." For instance, according  to Anatoliy Dolgolaptev, coordinator of the Council of  Interregional Associations, "the adoption of the 1993  privatization program was delayed so long precisely because we  disagreed with it, and it was finally passed only after  appropriate amendments were made."    The Federation Council speaker is so far inclined to take a  fairly ironical view on the possible evolution of interregional  associations into government structures. If Federation  components are enlarged and the 89 components are merged into  eight (according to the current number of associations), then  the Federation Council will consist of only 16 members, and it  will be easier to work with them," [quotation marks as  published] Shumeyko joked at a news conference after the  protocol was signed, noting, however, that "this joke may have a  grain of truth in it."</p>

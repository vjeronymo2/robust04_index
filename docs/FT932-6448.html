			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Sunday trading bill to offer new option THE GOVERNMENT is expected to confirm today that it has added a fourth, 'middle ground' option to its draft bill on Sunday trading, which is due to be published in the next few weeks. The option is supported by some of the UK's largest retailers, including Marks and Spencer, Burton and Gateway. Home office minister Mr Peter Lloyd will tell the Commons that the bill will include proposals from the Retailers for Shops Act Reform group, which wants to remove Sunday opening curbs for food and convenience shops of less than 3,000 sq ft and for DIY shops and garden centres, with protection for workers who refuse to work on Sundays. Under the RSAR proposals large shops would be barred from opening on Sundays but all shops would be allowed to open for the last four days before Christmas. The inclusion of the reform group's proposals may exacerbate the rifts between retailers on Sunday trading. Sainsbury and Tesco have denounced the RSAR proposals as ignoring the wishes of customers. The bill was previously expected to offer only three options, including total deregulation.</p>

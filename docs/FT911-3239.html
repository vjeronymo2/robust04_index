			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour challenges tax figures - Local Taxation Reform LABOUR yesterday began a two-pronged attack on the government's council tax figures, both challenging their basis and saying that they showed average households would do better under Labour's plans for 'fair rates'. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment spokesman, said: 'These figures conclusively prove that most people will be better off under Labour's fair rate scheme.' At the same time, he recalled that the original estimates for average poll tax bills had been Pounds 178, later revised upwards to Pounds 278, while the average bill last year was Pounds 357. Similar revisions of council tax bill estimates, he added, would mean average household bills of Pounds 802. While such claims are a legitimate part of the numbers game being played by the main parties, they do not help in a comparison of the figures for average household bills under a council tax or rates. For politicians attacking each other's calculations, Labour and Tories share a surprising number of assumptions on their way to average household bills of Pounds 333 and Pounds 360 respectively. Both take as their basis the inclusion of the community charge reduction scheme with the revenue support grant (although Labour counts it as about Pounds 1bn while the Tories count it as Pounds 1.25bn); both assume that collection will be much better than for the poll tax (the Tories calculating on 100 per cent collection and Labour on 98 per cent - as it was under the rates); and both assume significant savings on collection costs (Labour of Pounds 400,000 and the Tories of Pounds 320,000). Both parties also compare the new system with headline poll tax figures this year given actual council spending, and no increase in the total from the business rate. Labour's attack on the figures will include sustained questioning of the valuation which formed the basis of the property profile given for each area. Party officials doubt that sampling will have been extensive and describe the exercise as 'pretty spurious'. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, ascribed the difference in average household figures to the fact that Labour was aiming to raise only Pounds 6.3bn from local taxes instead of the Pounds 6.8bn government figures represented. Tory officials also say the Pounds 400 average household figure is based on the median house price, reflecting the range of council tax bills to be paid. Labour's refusal to give details of distribution of bills under its proposals means that there is no directly comparable figure for the opposition's system. Labour offers a different explanation. It says the limit on top band contributions in the council tax and the 25 per cent discount for single-person households means that to compensate, the average household pays more than if the tax were fully progressive. It agrees, however, that it assumes greater savings from the higher collection rate than the government is doing - a point where independent experts thought they had overestimated by Pounds 600,000 - but adds that the same experts agreed with their conclusions of a Pounds 140 savings for an average household. Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local-government spokesman, said: 'Our figures are robust, real and verified by independent analysts. Their figures are a fairy tale without a happy ending.' The ending to both stories looks likely to come only after the general election.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION'S ROLE IN BATTLING TERRORISM  </P> <P> Mark A. Heller, in his Aug. 4 Op-Ed article, "A Bonanza for Hezbollah," sounds  much like the uncivilized cowards he tries to ignore. He is correct in labeling  his method for dealing with terrorists as callous. He is unrealistic in hoping  this nation will condone the hanging of our citizens by lawless, unjust  apostates (or, for the matter, anybody other than ourselves).  </P> <P> Ignoring our problems with the Hezbollah is not going to make them disappear.  We cannot expect the Hezbollah to one day become reasonable people willing to  negotiate; we should not expect the Iranians to suddenly become nice guys  willing to mediate for the release of U.S. hostages. Because "Government is  instituted among us to secure certain unalienable rights . . . ," which we  possess abroad as well as domestically, our government must respond to get back  our countrymen and protect these rights. Even though the various factions in  Lebanon are not officially recognized as legitimate political groups, we have  to actively respond to their endless murdering. Either overt or covert military  operations are now warranted as an effort to recover the hostages. The time for  talk is past.  </P> <P> BRIAN LIPPA  </P> <P> Sunnyvale  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam upon his return from Japan </F> and China at Seoul Airport -- live]    [Text] My dear fellow countrymen: I have just returned  home after concluding my six-night-and-seven-day visits to Japan  and China. With the encouragement of you, fellow countrymen, I  have returned after explaining to the people of the two  countries the vision of the ROK, which is leaping forward afresh  by making changes and reforms.    My just concluded visits have given the ROK an opportunity  to  open an Asian-Pacific era with Japan and China. I have opened a  new horizon in ROK-Japanese cooperation and ROK-Sino cooperation.    During my visits, I sincerely discussed with Japanese and  Chinese leaders security and prosperity in Northeast Asia, the  North Korean nuclear issue, and other practical matters  concerning common prosperity.    I tell you, my fellow countrymen, that as a result, I have  won much sympathy from those leaders.    I held two rounds of talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa in  Tokyo. We extensively discussed ways to expand bilateral  cooperation in a changing world. I presented the future of new  good-neighborly relations in a speech at a banquet hosted by the  Japanese emperor and speeches to the Japanese Diet and Waseda  University. I proposed opening an era of ROK-Japanese  cooperation to shape the future based on historical lessons and  mutual trust. I won absolute sympathy from them.    Looking toward the 21st century, ROK-Japanese relations have  entered an era of cooperation.    Following my visit to Japan, I visited China, one of our  three major trading partners. I held talks with Chinese  President Jiang Zemin and frankly discussed with him bilateral  cooperation, peace and prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region,  and the North Korean nuclear issue and other matters concerning  security and peace on the Korean peninsula.    President Jiang Zemin and I agreed that peace and security  on the Korean peninsula is a prerequisite, not only for the  interest of the two countries of the ROK and China, but also for  peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. We also agreed that  peace and security on the Korean peninsula will greatly  contribute to world peace without fail.    My visit to China further promoted the exchange of friendly  relations between the two countries. Moreover, it was an  opportunity for coexistence that provided a basis for active  economic cooperation. In particular, we agreed to carry out  active industrial cooperation in various fields, including the  automobile, electronic exchanger, airplane, and high definition  television industries. When considering the infinite potential  of the ROK and China, this kind of escalated cooperation will  indeed guarantee a bright future in the relations between the  two countries.    While making a speech at Beijing University, I emphasized  the  importance of mutual complementary cooperative relations between  the ROK and China. To achieve this, I stressed the fact that  establishing peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula are  very important for peace and prosperity in this region. The  professors and students of Beijing University expressed  consensus through enthusiastic applause on my speech. In Japan  and China, I was able to confirm an extensive consensus on our  reform.    Dear fellow countrymen: During my visits, I met with many  fellow countrymen living in Japan and China and our businessmen.  They had great pride in the fatherland's status, which was  further enhanced through change and reform. They were  overflowing with patriotic enthusiasm for the fatherland's  development and for internationalization.    When I visited the ROK provisional government building in  Shanghai, I felt all the more keenly the will of the patriotic  forefathers' spirit of independence and proud construction of  the fatherland.    During my visit to ROK businesses in the Tianjin  development zone this morning, I could keenly feel their resolve  to advance into the open Chinese continent and thus promote  ROK-PRC cooperation.    Fellow countrymen: We should all turn our eyes to the future  and the world without delay. We should all rise up to pioneer  the national fate.    During my visit I saw Japan, which is ahead of others, and  witnessed that China is about to burp [yongturimulhanun]. I  also actually felt that the world is rapidly changing and saw  countries striving to survive severe competition. They are all  heading toward the future with a determined resolve. In  particular, I saw the youth of China and Japan throwing off the  old and leaping forward to the future.    I desperately feel that to win the economic and technologic  war in an era of limitless competition, we should look directly  at the ROK's present situation and redouble our efforts. In the  current world, which is rapidly changing, stagnation means  self-destruction, not retreat.    If we do not change, we will remain as an eternal straggler.  The efforts for change, reforms, and internalization should be  continued without a hitch. We should not miss the opportunity  to reform. We cannot survive severe competition if we remain as  a frog in a narrow well.    We must start fresh with a new resolve toward a ROK that  stands proudly on the international arena. We must build a  great country. We must hand over a proud country to our sons and  daughters. Our fellow countrymen have the courage, latent  energy, and self- confidence to build such a country. Tomorrow  will be too late, we must start today.    Fellow countrymen: We should renew our march. Thank you.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Queen arrives in Russia Queen Elizabeth, the first reigning British monarch to visit Russia, inspects a guard of honour on her arrival in Moscow yesterday, She was greeted at Vnukovo 11 Airport by Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, as Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is on holiday. Later, the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, received a formal red carpet welcome from President Boris Yeltsin at St George's Hall in the Kremlin. However, the start of the historic four-day visit was marred by furore over the marital problems of her son and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales. John Major, the UK prime minister, dismissed as 'pretty far from the mark' reports that he was to advise the Queen that the prince and the Princess of Wales should divorce as soon possible. Close aides of the prime minister made clear that he continued to believe the monarchy was the cornerstone of the British constitution and must remain so. Joe Rogaly, Page 16; Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Japan penalises China's exports: Tokyo turns aggressor in anti-dump action against 100 companies JAPAN, often the victim of anti-dumping actions, has become the aggressor for the first time. It imposed penalties yesterday on more than 100 Chinese companies for alleged predatory pricing of their exports. Tokyo has been targeted so often in anti-dumping cases that it has led a campaign to review the regulations. As a result, it was a touch defensive yesterday in explaining the decision to impose duties, ranging from 4.5 to 27.2 per cent, on Chinese exports of ferrosilicon manganese, used in steel production. The sense of unease was heightened by Japan's own anger this week at being on Washington's hit-list of countries whose steel producers are allegedly dumping in the US. Government officials have variously described the US decision as 'unfair' and 'outrageous'. Last night it was China's turn to complain. A trade ministry official in Beijing regretted the Japanese decision: 'Since the Japanese government did not take into account factual materials, the relevant companies feel wronged.' The finding partly reflects changes in trading patterns. Japanese industries are now pressed by lower-cost Asian producers. A decade ago, the US and Europe were under similar pressure from Japan and resorted to anti-dumping regulations. Japanese officials insist the dumping investigation, begun in October 1991 after a complaint from local producers of ferrosilicon manganese, was conducted honourably. The government concluded that unfair pricing led to a leap in China's share of the Japanese market from 17 per cent in 1989 to 39 per cent last year. Mr Yoshiro Mori, minister for international trade and industry, said the decision was 'fair and transparent'. The government would 'remain careful about abusing anti-dumping measures when pressed by protectionist industry forces'. The trade and finance ministries also investigated producers from South Africa and Norway, but concluded they had not injured the Japanese industry. About 103 Chinese companies, most of them state-owned, will be subject to the duties from next Wednesday. Two others were given a reprieve after promising to lift export prices. Japanese investigators had difficulty in determining whether the companies independently set prices, as Beijing claimed, or whether the 25 per cent fall in the Chinese price since 1989 had received central approval. The Japanese government had previously threatened to impose dumping duties on South Korean knitwear exporters, but these companies reluctantly agreed to 'voluntary restraints' on their exports before the duties were formally imposed. Last year, Japanese cotton spinners warned they would launch a dumping action against Pakistani and Indonesian exporters. An executive at one Japanese textile company said the industry was in 'a similar situation to US carmakers'.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Passenger increase helps KLM return to the black A sharp rise in passenger traffic and continued cost-cutting enabled KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to swing back into profit for last year. The Dutch national carrier posted a net profit of Fl 103m (Dollars 55.7m) for the year ended March, reversing the previous year's heavy losses of Fl 562m. The improvement stemmed partly from a 17 per cent increase in passenger traffic. However, the continuing shift towards cheaper fares meant that turnover from passenger traffic increased by a more modest 8 per cent. Overall, turnover rose by 5 per cent, well ahead of the 1 per cent increase in costs. As KLM made clear earlier this year during its Fl 1.2bn global share offering, it will not pay a 1993-94 dividend. The strong recovery is also due to the fact that KLM no longer includes on its book the figures of Northwest Airlines, the US airline in which it owns a 20 per cent stake. In 1992-93, when KLM still carried Northwest's figures, the US airline accounted for much of that year's Fl 388m loss from holdings. Northwest has since moved back into profit. However, even at the operating level KLM's results improved strongly, moving back into a profit of Fl 86m from a loss of Fl 252m. Another reason for the improvement is the pension premiums holiday granted by KLM's pension funds in April 1993. Mr Pieter Bouw, president, said the airline would look into extending the holiday when it expires at the end of 1994. KLM, involved in last year's abortive attempt to create a global airline with Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines, remained interested in developing strategic alliances with other medium-sized European airlines, he said. Mr Bouw said further cost-cutting was needed even though KLM compared favourably with most European airlines. 'The airlines of the US and the Far East, which already operate at very competitive cost levels, are attempting to cut them still further.' He said KLM's search for greater flexibility was behind yesterday's announcement of the company's first operational lease for seven new Boeing 767-300s to replace its fleet of 10 Airbus 310s. The lease allows KLM to increase the number of aircraft and to adjust the length of the agreement. The longer range of the Boeing 767 also better fits KLM's profile as an airline with a high proportion of inter-continental flights. Until now KLM has used financial, but not operational, leases.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD LOOKS TO SPOIL WEEKEND FOR LOYOLA, PEPPERDINE  </P> <P> Virtually eliminated from the West Coast Athletic Conference regular season  championship, the University of San Diego men's basketball team tries to play  spoiler when it faces third-place Loyola Marymount tonight and first-place  Pepperdine Saturday at the USD Sports Center. Both games are at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Next week, USD (6-14, 1-7) plays its two-game series with second-place St.  Mary's (18-3, 6-2). The Toreros will be trying to build some needed confidence  before the WCAC tournament March 4-6 at San Francisco.  </P> <P> USD beat San Francisco, 69-64, for its only conference victory. The Toreros  lost six games by a combined 23 points before being beaten Saturday by NCAA  scoring leader Loyola, 139-104.  </P> <P> Last Friday against Pepperdine (15-8, 7-1), USD led, 62-60, with 4 1/2 minutes  remaining but lost, 68-65. USD outshot the Waves from the field (54%-45%) with  sophomore center Dondi Bell going seven for seven for a team-high 14 points.  But the Toreros were 13 of 24 from the free throw line.  </P> <P> Saturday against Loyola (13-8, 6-3), USD trailed, 28-25, with 10 minutes left  in the first half before Loyola went on a 35-4 run. Junior forward Craig  Cottrell led USD with 26 points and eight rebounds. Hank Gathers, NCAA scoring  and rebounding leader, led the Lions with 30 points, 14 rebounds and nine  assists.  </P> <P> The Toreros' 104 points was their third-highest total since they switched to  Division I in 1979-80 (they scored 126 in a loss last season to Loyola and 113  in a victory over U.S. International two seasons ago). Loyola's 139 points was  the second-highest opponent total (after last season's 141-126 loss to Loyola).  JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

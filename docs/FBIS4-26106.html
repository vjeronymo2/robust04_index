			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- The Beijing-based  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on  Friday [17 June] renewed its call for a high-level meeting with  its Taiwan counterpart to discuss ways to promote cross-strait  dialogue and rapprochement.    ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan faxed a message to C.F. Ku,  president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) early in  the morning suggesting that the two meet either in Taipei or a  third place to exchange views on matters of mutual concern and  on ways to boost cooperation between the two intermediary  organizations.    Wang said SEF and ARATS should work even closer and harder  to  promote cross-strait dialogue and various civilian exchanges in  the wake of the Qiandao Lake travel disaster, in which 24 Taiwan  tourists were killed.    This was the second time Wang has pushed for a meeting with  Ku this year. He also invited Ku to visit Beijing for  high-level talks earlier in the year, but Ku did not accept that  invitation.    Cross-strait relations have remained at a low ebb since the  March 31 tragedy on Qiandao Lake, which is in Zhejiang Province  in southeastern China.    Wang said in his latest letter that a high-level SEF-ARATS  meeting is needed to reaffirm their good will toward each other  and mend their differences over some cross-strait disputes.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Li Ching-ping said Wang's warm-  hearted overture is laudable, adding that Wang's message had  already been relayed to Ku, who is currently on a European tour.    Li said SEF will discuss with the Mainland Affairs Council,  which oversees SEF operations, how to respond to Wang's letter  after Ku returns.    Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first  time  to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements  were signed during the historic Ku-Wang meeting for  institutionalized bilateral contacts.    However, follow-up meetings between SEF and ARATS officials  failed to proceed as smoothly as expected.    SEF and ARATS are unofficial conduits for cross-strait  exchanges in the absence of official ties.</p>

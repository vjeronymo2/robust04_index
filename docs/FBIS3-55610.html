"Despite Bill Clinton's declarations in Brussels, the  Ukrainian side is not sure that the definitive version of the  accord on the fate of its nuclear weapons will be signed in  Moscow on January 14," Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sergeyev  said.    "If by that date the definitive version has not been worked  out, realised, the three-way summit (between Clinton, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk) in  Moscow will be purely consultative," Sergeyev told reporters.</p>

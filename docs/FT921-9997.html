			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Directors' Transactions IN December, the chairman and chief executive of Merchant Retail Group each sold 500,000 shares. The former received 34.5p per share; the latter 36.5p. On January 9, the company issued a profits warning and the shares weakened. Another director has also been dealing in the shares, this time buying 325,000 shares at prices between 17 and 18p, less than half the price at which his colleagues sold only weeks beforehand. Two directors in Haemocell, the bio-technology stock, each sold 150,000 shares at 144p. Both directors still retain sizeable holdings in Haemocell, where losses have risen over the last three years. In December Wharfedale, the loudspeaker manufacturer, announced a placing and open offer to raise approximately Pounds 2.25m. The terms of the deal allowed directors Sir Gordon Brunton and Peter Totte to subscribe for up to 8m shares at the placing price. Sir Gordon, new chairman of Wharfedale, has also bought further shares in the market, paying up to 19.25p. Directors of Berkeley Group, the housebuilder, bought shares at 210p in July 1990 and sold some at 343p last September. Now J D Farrer, the chairman, who is due to retire at the end of May, has sold 1m shares at 255p.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR                      OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               No of Company                Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allen                 125,160      155        1 Argyll Group          451,880    1,339        4* Berkeley Group      1,000,000    2,555        1 Bibby (J) &amp; Sons       47,922       87        1* Central TV              1,000       11        1 Chemring Group          4,623       37        1 Clyde Blowers         201,374      604        1 Elect Data Processg     3,400       13        1 Greenalls Group        27,472      107        2* Haemocell             300,000      432        2 Hammerson 'A'          30,000      149        1 Huntleigh Technlgy      4,000       12        1 Liberty (NV)           60,000      258        1* Marks &amp; Spencer       244,870      730        1* MMT Computing          48,751       38        1 Prestwick              60,000       38        1 RMC                     2,000       12        1 Sidlaw Group          200,000      500        1 Sphere Inv Tst Zero    87,770       59        1 Whatman                 7,500       31        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Beckman                50,000       33        1 BET                    30,000       47        2 Clyde Blowers         299,999      900        1 Explaura Holdings     100,000       16        2 Hartstone               4,469       12        2 Hazlewood Foods        50,000       61        1 Inchcape                4,667       20        1 MMT Computing          48,751       38        1 Richmond Oil &amp; Gas    825,000       56        1 Saville Gordon        275,000       96        1 Shaftesbury            65,000       33        2 Simpsons of Cornhill  200,000       55        1 Sphere Inv Tst inc    150,000       28        1 Trafford Park         700,000      364        1 Wharfedale            440,000       75        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Levchuk under the "Customs" rubric: "On </F> the Routes of `White Death'"--passages within slantlines  published in boldface]    [Text] /This sensation has not faded even on the  background of People's Deputy Lukashenko's speech in the Supreme  Soviet. The confiscation of a record amount of drugs by the  Brest custom-house (2,389 kg) brings a new sense to the word  "Mafia" and makes one think about the place of Belarus in the  international drug business./    "International cartels actively use the West European market  for drug sales, including such dangerous drugs as heroin and  cocaine." Such was the conclusion in a statement made by the  board for combating smuggling to the chairman of the State  Committee for Customs. "Belarus has been given a role of a  trans-shipment base with some drugs remaining on the spot." In  1992, there were 740 cases of crime related to drugs in Belarus;  the militia confiscated 800 kg of drug substances. In the first  half of 1993, there were 545 criminal cases and 500 kg of  confiscated drugs.    The State Committee for Customs' specialists for combating  smuggling assert that international drug cartels consider  Belarus to be a state with a more weaker customs regime than  those in the West. According to the data as of 20 December 1993,  Belarusian customs officers deterred 38 drug smuggling cases and  confiscated 2,645 kg of intoxicating substances. Formerly,  confiscated drugs were reprocessed at one Russian pharmaceutical  plant; now they are simply destroyed.    In the majority of cases, the deadly substances are shipped  to Germany; shipments to Poland are rare. Among the arrested  smugglers, Germans constitute 50 percent--they are immigrants  from Central Asia (mainly from Kazakhstan) which is a  traditional drug supplier. The age of the "pushers" averages  between 20 and 30 years. According to specialists, small drug  dealers can join vast Mafia structures.    Russian N., who was driving to Poland in his Volkswagen  "Passat," has been caught with 7,400 grams of drug substances  that were hidden under the car trunk as well as under the front  fenders. He asserted that he had planted hemp on the fields of  Prokhladnenskiy Rayon 40 km from Nalchik.    A student from Lvov was carrying with him 5,040 grams of  poppy straw in a St. Petersburg--Lvov train; according to his  statement, he stole it from one Lithuanian national who traveled  on the same train.    A question ensues: Given today's transparency of borders as  well as the deficiency of technical equipment for customs  control, are the detections of large drug shipments not  accidental? Are some other containers with drugs not "racing"  on Belarusian territory, as it happened with that shipment of  raisins, which contained 2,389 kg of marijuana? According to  the information from the board for combating smuggling,  detection of drugs are due only to the intuition of customs  officers. In prospect, the personnel of the board for combating  smuggling will be expanded, and special dogs will be trained to  detect drugs. Customs officers already have special tests to  identify drugs.    Argentina--Singapore--Pakistan--Afghanistan. Now we can add  Belarus to this traditional route.    "The point is not only in the fall of the Iron Curtain  and the Soviet Union," states G. Gribach, head of the board for  combating smuggling within the State Committee for Customs. "We  assume that Belarus has become the route for drug shipments from  the `Golden Crescent' countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran)  because of the closing of the Balkan route due to warfare there.  This assumption can be corroborated by a container with a large  shipment of drugs, which, before reaching Belarus, crossed the  `Termez' check point at the Afghan-Uzbekistani border and  traversed Kazakhstan and Russia. One more container with such a  load has been detained by the Polish customs service.    Recently, specialists of the board for combating smuggling  reached an agreement with their Russian counterparts on  reestablishing the old system of cooperation in combating  smuggling in order to block the route of the `white death.'"</p>

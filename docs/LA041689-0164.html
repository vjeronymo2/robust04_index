			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY CITIES JOIN IN PROPERTY TAX SUIT  </P> <P> El Segundo landowners will pay $49 million in property taxes in 1988-89, but  the city will collect only $2.2 million of it.  </P> <P> The town is not alone in its plight.  </P> <P> More than 250 cities statewide that levied low or no property taxes at the time  Proposition 13 was passed in 1978 now find themselves receiving a small share  or no share of the property tax pie under state legislation enacted to  implement the measure. In the South Bay, both El Segundo and Carson are  affected.  </P> <P> "Our position is we are being punished because prior to 13, we were a well-run  city," El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal said.  </P> <P> Temple City, which has never levied a property tax, receives nothing. "We were  excluded forever" from receiving benefits, City Manager Karl Koski said.  </P> <P> El Segundo, Carson, Compton, Rancho Cucamonga and Temple City have joined in  taking the issue to court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutional Issue  </P> <P> Charging that their residents are being taxed without receiving due benefits,  the cities filed a suit with the state Supreme Court challenging the  constitutionality of the present system of tax revenue distribution.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court declined without comment to hear the case, but John Sturgeon,  the attorney for the petitioners, filed the suit April 7 in San Bernardino  Superior Court. The suit was filed there because Rancho Cucamonga is the  biggest loser among the five cities under the present system.  </P> <P> The suit was originally filed with the state's highest court because it  involves a constitutional issue and the decision could shift millions of  dollars among city coffers statewide, Sturgeon said. He had urged the court to  act quickly because cities have to begin planning their 1989-90 budgets soon.  </P> <P> Temple City Councilman Ken Gillanders, who initiated the research leading to  the suit, was not perturbed by the Supreme Court's action.  </P> <P> "It'll just take a little longer to resolve, but the constitutional issues are  the same," he said. "It will ultimately find its way to the Supreme Court."  </P> <P> The cities want the court to invalidate legislation that was adopted to  implement the landmark tax-cutting initiative.  </P> <P> The suit charges that the legislation unfairly penalizes cities that levied low  property taxes, or none at all, before Proposition 13. If successful, it would  benefit 270 California cities, according to Sam Olivito, executive director of  the California Contract Cities Assn.  </P> <P> The organization, which supports the action, represents 65 California cities,  46 of them in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> However, not every city would gain.  </P> <P> For example, six cities in the San Gabriel Valley, including Pomona and  Pasadena, would stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. In  the South Bay, Hermosa Beach would lose more than $230,000 annually.  </P> <P> "It would have a negative impact and we're not a rich city," City Manager Kevin  Northcraft said.  </P> <P> Proposition 13 limits property taxes to 1% of the full cash value of the  property. The full cash value of real property existing when Proposition 13 was  enacted was rolled back to that shown the county assessor's 1975-76 tax bill.  Property developed or purchased since the passage of Proposition 13 is taxed at  1% of the appraised value at the time of construction or purchase. Tax  increases are limited to 2% annually.  </P> <P> "The Legislature's scheme allocates property taxes without regard to who paid  them," attorney Sturgeon stated in the suit. He said the "completely arbitrary"  formula punishes cities that had shown fiscal restraint before Proposition 13  by imposing low taxes, while rewarding those with high taxes.  </P> <P> The suit asks the court to order Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to  correct these inequities. The counties were named as respondents in the suit  because they collect property taxes and distribute them among cities and other  agencies.  </P> <P> The suit suggests that a fairer distribution system would rely on the total  value of properties in a city to determine what proportion of the tax-revenue  pie it should receive.  </P> <P> Temple City would have gained about $1.46 million in revenues in fiscal 1986-87  under the proposed system.  </P> <P> The biggest winner among the petitioners would be El Segundo, which would have  received $7 million more that year. The city had a property tax of 0.15% in  1987.  </P> <P> Pomona, which had a 2.56% property tax, would be hurt more than any other city  in the San Gabriel Valley, Olivito said. Under the proposed formula, it would  have received about $1 million less than it did in 1986-87.  </P> <P> Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, Sierra Madre and La Verne also would get  less.  </P> <P> Expressing disappointment that other cities are seeking a solution that would  penalize his city, Pomona City Manager A. J. Wilson said the larger picture of  who needs the money most should be examined. Each city's per capita spending  also needs to be considered, he said.  </P> <P> "We're not going to give away the resources of our community," Wilson promised,  adding that Pomona is exploring grounds for a countersuit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern Acknowledged  </P> <P> Pasadena City Manager Donald McIntyre acknowledged that the petitioning cities  have a legitimate concern but said it was their choice not to levy higher taxes  initially.  </P> <P> South Pasadena City Manager John Bernardi agreed: "I certainly feel for them,  but I don't know why South Pasadena should suffer for (their) not imposing a  property tax. We can't afford to lose any more than we've already lost."  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the current revenue allocation system violates a  provision in the state Constitution requiring that taxpayers directly benefit  from the taxes they are paying.  </P> <P> Cities with high pre-Proposition 13 tax rates receive more than their fair  share of revenues, violating another constitutional provision mandating uniform  taxation, the suit says.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, which had the county's highest property tax, 2.76%, in 1978, is  cited as profiting the most from the current system. The city received at least  $117 million more in property tax revenues than its residents paid in the  1986-87 fiscal year, said Rodney Smith, economic consultant for the  petitioners.  </P> <P> Los Angeles would bear 95% of the losses under the proposal, Smith said.  Besides the six San Gabriel Valley cities, Long Beach and Hermosa Beach would  be the only others in the county to suffer if the court agrees that changes  should be made.  </P> <P> Smith stressed that county tax revenues are in a separate pool from the cities'  revenue and would not be affected by the outcome.  </P> <P> Olivito said the petitioning cities have long felt that "something just wasn't  right" and have repeatedly approached the state Legislature about the problem.  </P> <P> "We've been trying to find a solution for the last 10 years, and we haven't  received a dollar," he said. "The issue just kept snowballing."  </P> <P> The lack of tax revenues has limited the services the petitioning cities have  been able to provide their residents, the suit alleges. For example:  </P> <P> Inadequate flood control facilities were a main reason that Rancho Cucamonga  was incorporated, yet the city has been unable to afford community-level flood  control projects.  </P> <P> Compton has been forced to put off several youth programs and cannot fund  Neighborhood Watch projects.  </P> <P> Carson cannot afford to rehabilitate four toxic chemical sites and 20 abandoned  landfills. The city, which incorporated in 1968, has no city property tax.  </P> <P> "I think it is primarily a fairness issue," Carson City Administrator Jack R.  Smith said. "Cities that did not have property taxes prior to 13 have been  unfairly put upon."  </P> <P> Temple City has postponed implementing a school drug-awareness program and  cannot afford a senior center. Law enforcement levels have not been increased  to keep up with growth since 1978.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Spending Our Money'  </P> <P> "We're struggling to keep our heads above water, and other cities are spending  our property tax money," said Temple City's Gillanders. As a property owner,  Gillanders is also a petitioner in the suit.  </P> <P> As mayor in 1984, Gillanders began consulting with Smith, also director of the  Lowe Institute of Political Economy at Claremont McKenna College, about the  validity of the allocation policy.  </P> <P> The following year, the City Council commissioned Smith to research the issue.  "In 1986 I discovered the constitutional flaws," said Smith, who now serves as  an independent consultant.  </P> <P> The other cities decided to join in the suit within the past year, Koski said.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Tim Waters contributed to this story.  </P> <P> ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE  </P> <P> A suit filed by five Southern California cities attacks the way that property  tax revenue is allocated to cities. Their suit challenges the constitutionality  of the distribution system that was enacted to implement Proposition 13. If  successful, the suit could shift millions of dollars among city coffers  statewide. The following is a breakdown of the tax revenue received by cities  in the South Bay under the existing system and the distribution under the  proposed reforms.  </P> <TABLE

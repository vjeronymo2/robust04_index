Elections to the Federal Assembly have been held, but  the political situation in Russia has heated up to boiling point  again. Numerous discussions, of which there have been so many in  this century, have been concentrated around ancient Russian  problems: "Why did `some' win and `others' lose?" "Who is to  blame?" And so forth. Understandably, historians and political  scientists will be able dispassionately to answer these and many  other questions much later, when the passions have died down,  and when the gaze of the observer, his personal evaluations  suspended, sees "only the facts." But both "then" and "now" it  is useful to know the social attitudes of the voters. And what  predetermined precisely this development of events in the  country.    Weekly public opinion polls conducted by the Institute of  Sociology of Parliamentarianism in Moscow over two years now  made it possible to note long before the present day many  sociopsychological peculiarities and tendencies in the  development of the current political situation. Some of them  were confirmed once again on the eve of the elections--as a  result of a comparative analysis of the figures from two  large-scale public opinion polls of the adult city and rural  population of Russia (the first poll was taken during 25-30  November, the second poll during 2-7 December). The polls were  conducted by the Institute according to a standard methodology  in all 12 of the country's main economic regions: Northern,  Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central-Chernozem, Volga,  Northern Caucasus, Ural, Western Siberian, Eastern Siberian, Far  Eastern, and Kaliningrad Oblast, including Moscow and St.  Petersburg. The samples--6,000 respondents each--reflect the  main sociodemographic characteristics of the general totality of  the country's adult population.    As the analysis showed, the results of the election to the  Federal Assembly depended on two polar and, seemingly, mutually  exclusive tendencies. On the one hand, in the society at the  level of mass consciousness and self-awareness there was a clear  uncertainty and instability of political preferences of the  voters. Many "were prepared to vote" but did not know "for whom"  and were "considering" right up until the last moment. All this  increased the significance and decisive role of persuasion and  preelection propaganda.    On the other hand, on the level of the mass subconscious,  the  behavior of the voters was influenced by a fairly rigid "system"  of sociopsychological principles that were already in place. And  this, in turn, threatened to neutralize the effectiveness of any  propaganda unless it corresponded to the expectations of the  audience. In other words, people were inclined to perceive only  that which corresponded to their views. Therefore the outcome of  the elections depended largely on the degree to which the  parties and blocs were able to take advantage of these and other  tendencies. Judge for yourselves.    Both the polls and the elections revealed a fairly high  degree of political activity on the part of the country's  voters. Incidentally, half of them (52 percent) simply intended  to participate in the voting, while another 12 percent were  inclined "to participate rather than not participate." The  problem, however, consisted in that even on the eve of the  elections public opinion was not sufficiently formed. At least  by 7 December, 65 percent of Russian voters (according to their  own self-assessments) had not made a final decision about whom  to vote for, and only 35 percent of the voters had already made  this decision. But even the voters who had decided to  participate in the elections and named their possible "elected  officials" during the poll did not have finally formed opinions  either. Approximately 50-70 percent of the supporters of one  party or bloc said that they had not finally decided who to vote  for.    Moreover, many voters did not understand the principal  differences in the party programs, and the set of campaign  promises for a "better life" among the majority of candidates  was fairly standard. It is not surprising that under these  conditions a decisive role began to be played not so much by  political programs and platforms as by the "acting mastery" of  the politicians.    It is curious that, according to the assessment of Moscow  voters at the end of November, the statements and political  advertising they remembered most were those of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (V. Zhirinovskiy)--indicated by 14  percent, the Russia's Choice bloc (Ye. Gaydar)--11 percent, and  the Democratic Party of Russia (N. Travkin)--9 percent. The  statements of other parties were remembered by many fewer.  Incidentally, according to the assessment of 17 percent, "they  did not remember anything," and 21 percent--out of principle  "did not look, did not listen, and did not read all that," and  21 percent--"found it difficult to determine their opinion."    Incidentally, many thought and still think that the ones  that  could win the election were those that have "money" (this is  what 28 percent of the Moscow voters thought), "press, radio,  and television" (23 percent), "power" (21 percent), and "the  support of B.N. Yeltsin" (20 percent) and not those "who defend  the interests of the people" (16 percent) or "who have more of  the truth" (9 percent).    But nonetheless, as life showed, "money," "propaganda,"  etc.,  with all their significance, were clearly inadequate factors.  The mechanism of social principles and social expectations of  the voters entered into the "fate" of the elections.    According to predictions of the Institute of the Sociology  of  Parliamentarianism, in the elections to the State Duma "in terms  of the party slates" the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia led,  and it was followed by the Russia's Choice bloc. The basis for  this assumption was, in particular, the fact that on the eve of  the elections to the State Duma (poll of 2-7 December) 17  percent of the voters who voted were inclined to cast their vote  for the LDPR, for Russia's Choice--16 percent, for the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc--13 percent, the Communist Party  of the Russian Federation--12 percent, the Democratic Party of  Russia--10 percent, Women of Russia--6 percent, the Agrarian  Party--5 percent, and the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord]--5 percent.    Let me remind you that according to the data of many  respected sociology colleagues, the success of the LDPR in terms  of the party slates did not significantly exceed the 5-percent  mark, and Russia's Choice received barely a third of the votes  from Russian voters. It is clear that this is not about the  arithmetic precision of the predictions but about tendencies  that were observed. And the attempt of the Institute of the  Sociology of Parliamentarianism ("Novosti," Ostankino 25  November) to draw the public's attention to the drop in the  rating of Russia's Choice met not only with a complete lack of  understanding but even attacks from certain upstart  "sociologists." Incidentally, now that our Institute's  prediction, according to the preliminary results of the voting,  was basically right, none of this is of interest any longer.    Something else is crucial: a comparative analysis of the  data  from the two all-Russian polls shows that even at the end of  November (the poll of 25-30 November) the level of support for  the LDPR from Russian voters was 16 percent of those that  intended to vote, and Russia's Choice--also 16 percent. And the  key to the analysis of the results of the election must be  sought not only in the "good television propaganda" of some and  the "poor propaganda" of others, but also in deeper processes in  the social psychology.    Thus the majority of Russians (75 percent) are dissatisfied  with their present life to one degree or another. Of these, 23  percent "are more dissatisfied" and 52 percent are simply  "dissatisfied" with it, while another 5 percent "find it  difficult to decide" and only 20 percent are satisfied with  their life to one degree or another: 8 percent--"satisfied," 12  percent--"more satisfied than dissatisfied."    The prolonged economic crisis and the growth of crime have  led to a situation where in the structure of the values of the  population of Russia there is a marked predominance of an  orientation toward a "high standard of living" (73 percent) and  "public law and order" (67 percent). Although values of material  well-being and order are traditional both for Russia and for the  Western countries, never before in recent years has the demand  for democracy and freedom of speech been expressed so weakly:  "Participation in the adoption of important political decisions"  was significant for only 4 percent of the Russian voters and  "openness and freedom of speech"--12 percent. I wish to  emphasize that all this by no means indicates that the citizens  of Russia are against democracy, openness, and freedom of  speech. The problem is that the existing living conditions are  forcing people to live at a level different from that of  elementary social needs.    The social situation in the country is becoming fairly  tense.  The majority of people are finding it difficult to adapt to the  current economic situation and feel socially and politically  defenseless and alienated. Therefore they frequently do not  perceive the changes that are taking place. Thus to the question  "can you say that your time has come now?" most of the country's  adult population (79 percent) answer "no," with 63 percent  saying simply "no," while 16 percent say "more no than yes," and  another 11 percent find it difficult to answer this question,  and only 10 percent think that now "their time has come" to one  degree or another.    It is worth paying attention to the fact that support for  the  LDPR was greater among the disenfranchised, those who, according  to their self-assessments, "cannot withstand the so-called  liberalization of prices." And there are a considerable number  of people who have been impoverished and cannot withstand the  "shock therapy" of reforms in present day Russia: 37 percent of  the adult population. Incidentally, 45 percent think that this  is "difficult but tolerable," for 10 percent--"not as terrible  as it seemed," 4 percent note that "this does not suit them,"  and 4 percent "found it difficult to determine" their opinion.</p>

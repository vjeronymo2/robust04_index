			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Auditors seek to limit liability Self-interest overcame fear of public criticism yesterday as the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales voted to support a campaign to limit auditors' liability. Council members voted by 41 to 13 to endorse a paper to be submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry calling for amendments to companies legislation. The move stems from the profession's concern about the rising level of litigation against auditors. The paper backs the campaign launched last week by the UK's largest eight accountancy firms to remove section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which forbids auditors to place a cap as a multiple of their fees on their liability if they are sued. In the longer term, the paper also calls for reform of the principle of joint and several liability, which means auditors can be made to pay all the costs of a legal claim even if they are only partly at fault. Several council members from smaller accountancy firms and those who are employed in industry argued during the debate that the case was purely one of self-interest, relevant only to the larger firms. But Mr Michael Chamberlain, institute president, rejected a call for a separate vote, which would have identified how many of those in favour of the campaign were partners in the big firms. Two members argued that shareholders would not be in a position to influence the negotiations between the auditors and the company over the cap on liability. Others criticised the quality of information presented with the paper and were sceptical over the seriousness of the litigation crisis.</p>

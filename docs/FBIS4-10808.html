			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Griselda Sierra Valencia] </F>   [Text] Leaders of the Coordinating Board of the Zapata  Lives National Liberation Campaign [Coordinadora de la Jornada  de Liberacion Nacional Zapata Vive] has announced that it has  opened talks with Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, but the  two side have not yet begun to discuss issues related to the  demands presented by the various peasant organizations.    During a news conference, the leaders of the organization  indicated that they are more than willing to continue the  dialogue. They also reported the existence of provocateurs who  have met with the Civilian Society Bureau [Mesa de la Sociedad  Civil] installed in Mexico City's Zocalo District to create  problems and thereby justify any aggression against the peasants  and Indians who are awaiting a reply from the government.    Genaro Dominguez, adviser to the National Coordinating Board  of United Indian People (CNPI), said, "Those of us here have  been angered by this situation, and yet no one will force us  into any provocation that would justify aggression against the  Indians and peasants."    Earlier, peasant leaders disclosed that today at 1200 they  would head to the Chamber of Deputies to present several  proposals aimed at reforming Article 27 of the Constitution.    They insisted that the camp they have erected in Zocalo will  remain there. They also indicated that they plan to wait until  Government Secretary Carpizo announces when panels will be  formed to discuss problems reported by the various peasant  organizations.    Meanwhile, Francisco Jimenez Pablo, representative of the  Chiapas State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations  (CEOIC), denied that property seizures are being organized by  ranchers and landowners themselves. He insisted that this is  just a rumor being spread by the state government "as an excuse  not to resolve the land problem."</p>

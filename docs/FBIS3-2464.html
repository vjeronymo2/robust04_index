That is, we plan to work hard  to basically solve the problem of food and clothes for the 80  million poor people in seven years. This is a significant  decision by the party Central Committee and State Council based  on our country's tremendous achievements in the poverty relief  scheme and development efforts.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Poverty is not socialism  and socialism wants to eliminate poverty. In the 40-odd years  since the founding of the PRC, led by the party and government,  people in our country of all nationalities have made arduous  efforts and scored world-renowned achievements in eliminating  poverty and winning national prosperity, wealth, and power. In  particular, following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, a range of rural reform polices, consisting  mainly of the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, launched the rural  economy on unprecedented development. Peasants' income rose  sharply. In some areas, peasants led the way toward a  comparatively well-off status, and most of the peasants now have  enough to eat and wear. The problem of poverty, one that has  long plagued rural areas, has been solved to a significant  extent.    The party and government have always been concerned about  production and living in poor areas and have viewed and pursued  poverty-relief work as a key task. Following reform and opening  up, they have adopted various measures to strengthen  poverty-relief work. They have increased capital inputs and  adjusted and reformed the traditional poverty-relief methods,  linking relief to developmental projects instead of keeping them  as pure welfare programs. As a result, extensive areas of  chronic poverty changed their outlook and poverty was reduced  significantly. This was an achievement of a historic nature,  one scored against the persistently high percentages of poor  populations and deteriorating poverty in the 1980's and fully  revealing the superiority of the socialist system.    However, ours is a big country where situations differ and  development varies in level. While the problem of having enough  to eat and wear is no longer a national problem, there are still  some areas where development remains slow and part of the  population still do not have enough to eat and wear. People in  a few extremely poor areas still lead a very hard life. The  implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult  Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" carries  great realistic and profound historical significance. Solving  the problem of having enough to eat and wear for 80 million  people by the end of this century means the solution of the  subsistence problem for one quarter of the world's population.  This will be a great event forever written on Chinese history  as well as a great act in the development of mankind. Poor  people account for only a minority of the country's rural  population, however most of them live in hilly areas, rocky  mountains, deserts, high-altitude mountains, loess plateaus,  areas of high epidemics, and reservoir areas in the mid-west.  Remoteness, inaccessibility, imbalanced ecology, slow economic  development, and backward culture and education mean harsh  living conditions. Therefore, seven years will be required to  solve the problem of having enough to eat and wear for  populations in these poor areas. The task is much more difficult  than the poverty-relief work in the early phase.    We are determined, confident, and capable of winning this  poverty-fighting battle. First, the party Central Committee and  the State Council are taking this task very seriously. The 14th  Party Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee convened last year, and the central rural work  conference and related documents all stressed the significance  of poverty relief and development work and put forward  objectives and requirements. The leading comrade of the party  Central Committee and State Council made many visits to poor  areas to conduct investigations and studies and organized  leadership there. These are the important guarantees for  winning the battle of tackling key problems in poverty-relief  work. Secondly, the vast number of cadres and people in poor  areas have a strong wish to rid themselves of poverty and  backwardness. There is enormous motivation among them to shed  poverty and attain wealth. This is the inner dynamism for  fighting this decisive battle against poverty. The fact that a  large number of models who rid themselves of poverty and  attained wealth with essential state help and their own  independent effort have emerged from previous poverty relief and  development, fully proves the point. Thirdly, further deepening  reforms, especially the gradual establishment of the socialist  market economic system, has brought unprecedented opportunity  and wide prospects for economic development in poor areas. For  instance, as a result of comprehensive opening up, large numbers  of remote borders and backward, quiet, and inland poor areas are  becoming outposts for opening up and key ports for border trade.  High-speed growth in coastal economically advanced areas have  created massive labor service markets and job opportunities for  the abundant labor supply in poor areas. As reforms in the  circulation sector gradually unfold and prices are deregulated,  poor areas may look forward to a real possibility of exchanging  their rich natural resources for goods and services of coastal,  economically advanced areas on parity and increases in their  income. Fourth, the state will increase, as it has done before,  inputs in poor areas and the effort at poverty relief and  development. The State Council has decided to, from now until  2000, annually increase 1 billion yuan worth of work-relief  programs and special interest-inclusive loans. Provinces,  cities, and autonomous regions will also increase input in  poverty relief and development. These are the material  guarantees for the effort to take on the most difficult problems  in poverty relief.    Strengthening leadership at all levels in poor areas is an  important condition for the battle to fight poverty. Policies,  capital, and projects are naturally important, but they require  a strong and combative leadership in order to be useful. Such a  strong leadership must have sustained and unflinching courage,  an enterprising spirit, readiness for long-term struggle,  concern for the masses, and a good, pragmatic, and down-to-earth  work style. Such leadership will unify party members, cadres,  and the masses to change poverty.    Tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief is  not  only an affair for poor areas, but also a common responsibility  for the whole society, and requires the effort of all members in  society. All professions, trades, departments, democratic  parties, and people's associations must look at poverty relief  as part of their duties, practice traditional Chinese ethics,  and give their hearts and contribute their efforts to the  poverty-fighting battle.    The implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult  Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" marks the  last decisive stage of poverty relief and development, which is  aimed at solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear in  rural areas. The realization of the scheme marks a new  historical stage in the economic and social development of poor  areas. Leading cadres must have a great sense of responsibility  and mission, and fight well the historically significant battle  of tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief. If  our ancient ancestors could feel "ashamed of getting pay while  there are beggars in town," should we not feel the same today?  We believe that, led by the Central Committee and State  Council, the people of all nationalities throughout the country  will be united in heart and mind, join in concerted effort, win  this hard battle, and march into the 21st century triumphantly.</p>

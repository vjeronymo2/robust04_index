			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ON DUFFY'S DECISION  </P> <P> I'm amazed by elected officials who fail to understand basic concepts of our  constitutional government.  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy complains about the media being big business. Of course the  newspaper and television companies are out to make money. We call it free  enterprise.  </P> <P> Government leaders open their lives to public scrutiny, that's a decision they  make when they run for office. When they excel, their performance makes good  reading. When they fail, their performance makes good reading -- the idea is to  have responsible leaders working hard in office to avoid the latter. The  concept is commonly referred to as free press.  </P> <P> When free enterprise and free press are taken together, we call it a free  society. Duffy should have known that.  </P> <P> THOMAS M. CONNOLLY  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian group pulls out of NZ Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport and healthcare group, is selling its 50 per cent interest in Freightways Group, the New Zealand-based transport venture, in a deal thought to be worth around ADollars 40m (USDollars 28.4m). The buyer is Freightways Holdings, the other half-owner of the company. Mayne did not put a price on the deal but said the total consideration was 'slightly in excess of the company's investment'. In its last accounts, at mid-1993, the book value was ADollars 37.2m. Freightways Group takes in 15 separate businesses including transportation operations New Zealand Couriers and Poste Haste, and the Armourguard Security, armoured transport business. The sale means the Australian company will have withdrawn from the New Zealand market, where it has been a force since the 1930s. Mayne stressed that this was not because of dissatisfaction with Freightways' performance, but reflected a desire to concentrate on markets with 'greater growth potential'.</p>

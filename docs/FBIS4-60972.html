			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shipping Season on River"] </F>   [Text] The first ships traveled down the Vyatka River 28  April, starting timber logging. Shipment of grain and  construction materials is next in line.    In the whole shipping season, the crews of the Vyatka River  Steamship Company have to ship around 2 million tonnes of  freight. That is considerably less than in past years.  Customers' inability to pay has robbed the enterprise of a  chance of procuring the full amount of fuel. Some of the fleet  will therefore be standing idle. However, passenger lines will  open in time as planned and in a day or two the first motor  ships will set out.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: 'Miracle on grass' as US beats sluggish Colombia 'I don't believe in miracles,' said US coach Bora Milutinovic after his team's stunning 2-1 victory over Colombia in Group A of the World Cup on Wednesday night. Milutinovic aside, anyone else involved in US soccer probably does believe in the miraculous after the national team trampled over one of the pre-tournament favourites at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The defeat of the Colombians ranks with 1980's 'Miracle on Ice' - the US ice hockey team's win over the Soviet Union in the Lake Placid Winter Olympics - as the most remarkable feat in US team sports history. History, however, will have to wait for now, because the greatest impact of the US triumph is that it virtually assures the team's progression into the second round. The Americans' present four-point tally looks sufficient to take them through, even with one game left (against Romania on Sunday). The tournament's organisers were jubilant at the US team's feat. Jim Trecker, spokesman for World Cup 1994, said yesterday: 'The World Cup's already been a great success, and the US reaching the second round can only add to that.' The 2-1 defeat of Colombia was extraordinary as much for its manner as for the result. Although the home team opened the scoring after 35 minutes courtesy of a freak own-goal by Colombian defender Andres Escobar, they dominated the rest of the match with sturdy, patient defending and lightning-quick attacks. One of these attacks produced the second and clinching goal in the 52nd minute when striker Ernie Stewart ran on to Tab Ramos's perfectly flighted pass to lift the ball past the on-coming (and already notorious) Colombian 'keeper, Oscar Cordoba. But the US were denied the perfect finale when Marcelo Balboa's spectacular overhead kick flew only inches wide with Cordoba frozen on his line.</p>

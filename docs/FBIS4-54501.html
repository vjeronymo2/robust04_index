			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Bohumir Gerinec, director of the </F> Defense and Security Affairs Department operating under the  Slovak Government Office, by Peter Sporer; place and date not  given: "Armex Has Not Become an Alternative to Omnipol in  Slovakia"]    [Text] [Sporer] The sale of weapons is often being written  and spoken about only in allusions in Slovakia. What does a  person think about this who, in his capacity as head of the  government commission that awards licenses for the export and  import of arms, should have a sufficient overview?    [Gerinec] Each businessman tries to find a buyer and, once  he finds him, he tries to keep his name a secret because many  possibilities exist to jeopardize a potential deal. The  producer or seller, let alone the buyer, therefore prefers not  to speak. I believe that it has been positive for Slovakia thus  far that one was talking less in this regard, and doing more.    [Sporer] Doing? On the basis of the small amounts of spare  parts produced in our arms factories (about 5 percent of the  original production volume from the time before conversion) to  which the factory managers admit, this "doing" could not involve  large-scale deals?    [Gerinec] I agree. Besides, the sales have been restricted  to excess equipment from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak  Republic, and these sales are gradually coming to an end, owing  to the available time frame, which is limited by international  agreements.    [Sporer] The state used to sell heavy weapons manufactured  in Slovakia through the Omnipol foreign trade company. This  company was and still is represented by people who now live in  the Czech Republic. These businessmen have contacts with  specific countries and, within these countries, with specific  customers. It is logical that, when an Arab client or another  customer used to conclude agreements on deliveries with someone  from Omnipol during a dinner, he will not turn to the prime  minister or the arms factory director with an order today, but  to the man with whom he once cooperated. Is the loss of Omnipol  a big loss?    [Gerinec] It represents not only a loss but, literally,  damage to Slovakia's interests. These people continue to work  for the benefit of those who pay them; their priority is to  conclude contracts for the benefit of their own  organization--that is, Omnipol. They trade in arms manufactured  in the Czech Republic, but, naturally, they also try to sell  weapons manufactured elsewhere. Business is business.  Naturally, they try to achieve the maximum financial profit for  Omnipol, also vis-a-vis our factories, for example. We are  trying to prevent this by means of the system we have created.  Only a Slovak firm or juridical person can trade in arms  commodities in Slovakia.    [Sporer] But cannot Omnipol still participate in business  transactions as a middleman?    [Gerinec] It could do so only through a Slovak firm that  would make the purchase for it. Omnipol could then sell the  merchandise to a third party.    [Sporer] The most ideal solution would perhaps be to enlist  people from Omnipol for a similar firm in Slovakia, or am I  wrong?    [Gerinec] Omnipol is a well-established organization. The  people working there have certain guarantees. Slovakia does not  avail itself of a similar organization that would be established  on world markets. Our businessmen who have acquired some  reputation in this branch tried to enlist them, in a way. But  the offer of something that could only be successful in the long  run was too little, compared with the guarantees they now have.    [Sporer] How do you evaluate, from this viewpoint, the  activity of Mr. Luhovy, for example, former minister of general  engineering and, before that, director general of the ZTS [Heavy  Engineering Works] economic production unit?    [Gerinec] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is involved in  business while being retired. He lives in Slovakia and wanted  to help Slovakia.    [Sporer] Was he rejected?    [Gerinec] No. Of course, the question is how such  assistance can be realized. I do not know how Mr. Luhovy is  doing. I am not in touch with him.    [Sporer] The Armex company was established in Slovakia  almost seven months ago, as an alternative to Omnipol. The  former government placed Vitazoslav Moric, honorary deputy  chairman of the Slovak National Party, at the head of this  company. Yet, to this day, Armex has not received a license  from your commission....    [Gerinec] It is difficult to comment on this issue because  Armex has not yet applied for a license. It apparently had a  reason not to apply.    [Sporer] What reason?    [Gerinec] The state retained 100-percent participation in  Armex. An organization made up of representatives of five  government departments was to be established, whose task was to  take upon itself trade issues and also to coordinate these  activities, if possible. The launching of Armex was linked to  the launching of production in arms factories. The problem is  that not even the basic prerequisites have been met--I am  thinking, among other things, of the experience and initiative  of the people involved--so this organization does not work. It  was perhaps exaggerated to expect more of the state officials  who were charged with this duty.    [Sporer] Is it within the government's jurisdiction to  resort in Armex to personnel changes, for example?    [Gerinec] Of course. The government established the  company, it appointed its director general, and it can even  dissolve Armex.    [Sporer] How many companies trade in arms in Slovakia?    [Gerinec] This question is difficult to answer because it is  a question of obtaining a permit [koncese] for sale, which is  awarded by the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic.  Once the ministry grants someone a permit to sell and purchase  arms commodities, he can ask the government's licensing  commission for a license to engage in this activity. However,  there are private businessmen who sell weapons only on the  territory of the Slovak Republic on the basis of a mere trade  license. If they restrict their sales to the territory of the  Slovak Republic, they need not be holders of a license from our  commission. I emphasize, however, that those who export or  import weapons must ask our commission for a license. Firms  trading in short hunting weapons make use of this possibility  most. However, a license can be requested even by a company  that mostly trades in other commodities and wants to engage in  arms trade as a supplementary activity.    [Sporer] People in the Martin and Dubnica arms factories  claim that, after conversion, Poles rushed into the territories  that have been vacated by Slovaks. Russians, too, are very  active. Moreover, the Czechs have set up the RDP [Research,  Development, Production] Group [holding of arms manufacturers]  and try to assert themselves with a modernized T-72 tank. What  chances are there for our heavy weaponry to return to its former  markets?    [Gerinec] It is true that the Poles, who have not carried  out any conversion, entered the vacated space. The Russians  have not stopped developing tanks and have already mastered the  production of tanks of the T-80 and T-90 ranges. Moreover, they  own a great mass of excess weaponry [that they must discard to  comply with international agreements]. It must be admitted that  we have never manufactured any new models, but well-established  models that we were able to "show," so to speak. That is also  true of the T-72 tank. If we want to be successful, someone  will therefore have to invest in development.    [Sporer] Which "someone"?    [Gerinec] A customer interested in the commencement of  production. It is customary abroad that this task is assumed by  the army of the country that owns arms production. The army  replaces its equipment, and trade with other countries gradually  receives a chance. The problem is that our Army's budget, no  matter how high it may seem in comparison with the budgets of  other government departments, simply does not allow the Army to  supplement its arsenal with new weaponry. Therefore, the Army  is not able to help set arms production in motion. It is a  different matter, of course, when a factory starts an innovation  program and reconstructs a tank turret, for example (which is  the case at the Dubnica arms factory), and finds for it  customers in armies equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the  managers of these arms factories to calculate whether such deals  are worthwhile.    [Sporer] There is talk about the state having lost tens of  billions of korunas as a result of conversion. Plainly  speaking, how can the arms factories cover this loss, in your  opinion?    [Gerinec] Their managements are in the best position to  answer this question. However, it would probably be  inappropriate for me to reply only that the annual turnover of  special production used to represent some 20 billion  Czechoslovak korunas. People from the Martin factory cite a  better example. They say that, when they produced and sold a  single tank, they made the same profit they make from the  production and sale of 40 tractors today.</p>

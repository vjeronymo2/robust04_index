			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Stage ready for stars to shine - Peter Berlin in New York wonders which of the world's great players will dominate the finals AMONG the tantalising prospects of the World Cup finals is the debut on a US stage next Tuesday of an unlikely character: Diego Maradona, missionary. North American newspapers and magazines have been packed with handy guides to the soccer basics. Often, these previews were decorated with pictures of Argentina's Maradona scoring by punching the ball over England's earth-bound goalkeeper Peter Shilton in the 1986 World Cup - helped, claimed the cheeky Argentine star, by the Hand of God. In the US, partly for the wrong reasons, Maradona is the world's best-known soccer player. Over the next four weeks, therefore, it is up to him to spread the faith among the unbelievers - starting (if he is picked) in Tuesday's match against Greece in Boston. As ever, the World Cup finals will provide an important measure of world soccer's health. They may also reveal something about the US. Is it closer culturally to its neighbours in South America, or to western Europe? Players and fans, superstitious as ever, are fretting for an answer. Western European teams have won seven of the eight World Cups held in western Europe but none of the six held in South America. When the trophy is hoisted into the air in Los Angeles on July 17, we will know whether it is easier to vault the Rio Grande than the Atlantic. In the last 20 years, South American World Cups have been better than those in Europe. The 1970 competition in Mexico drew its tone from the dazzling victors, Brazil. Argentina, the hosts, won with attacking play in 1978. Mexico, in 1986, was adorned by France, Denmark, the USSR, Brazil - and Argentina's Maradona at his peak. In Italy four years ago the style was set by the first and last matches, both of which produced more sendings-off than goals and in both of which defensive muscle triumphed over attacking skill. Cameroon, who won the opening match, and Argentina, who lost it, were the successes of the competition. More talented teams could not beat them. They were only undone by the number of players penalised by red and yellow cards. But Latin American World Cups are not always good. It might simply be that recent World Cups in South America have coincided with richer-than-usual crops of that most easily damaged commodity: the soccer star. In 1990, the tournament was almost devoid of new stars. This time, things could be much better. Alfio Basile, the Argentine coach, says that Maradona  -who has scored almost as many goals for his country as his team-mates combined - is in good form. This could be a bluff. But even unfit, Maradona is a useful psychological weapon, as he showed in Italy, and could be a decoy for Argentina's fresh attacking talent. While the troubles of the last few years may have damaged Maradona's waistline and psyche, the enforced rest will have given his tattered knees the chance to recuperate a little. Four years ago, Maradona was unable to shoot. That will be a test of his fitness in the US. Even if Maradona is unable to establish a place for soccer in the hearts of American sports fans, there are plenty of potential stars in the making. The most likely candidates are players, like Maradona in 1986, in their middle or late 20s who have been to the World Cup finals before. There is a gang of such players. If Tomas Brolin can reproduce his 1990 form, and if his Swedish team-mates play well around him, he will come to the fore. The same applies to Enzo Scifo of Belgium, who, at 28, is playing in his third World Cup, and the temperamental Gheorghe Hagi, 29, of Romania. Both played well in Italy. Now, both have better attackers in front of them to help make their creative work shine. Colombia's Carlos Valderrama, 32, is in the same position. In Italy his passing was often decorative rather than dangerous. This time he has the explosive Faustino Asprilla to pass to. Asprilla is one of a crop of bad-tempered strikers who will catch the eye one way or another in the US. Others include the Barcelona team-mates Romario of Brazil and Hristo Stoichkov of Bulgaria. If the Dutch are to match the glories of their past, Dennis Bergkamp will need to rediscover his best form. And, whatever Basile says about Maradona, Argentina's best hopes rest on the striking power of Gabriel Batistuta and the sinewy mid-field play of Fernando Redondo. Almost every team has potential stars. The question is whether they will be given a chance to shine. Four years ago, intimidating defenders generally held the upper hand over attackers - although, as Cameroon demonstrated, there is no reason why a team cannot defend thuggishly and attack artistically. Anyone who still cherishes illusions about the innocence of Cameroonian tactics should avert their gaze when they play Brazil in San Francisco next Friday. That match should indicate the direction of these World Cup finals. If the Brazilians are able to play at their best, it is difficult to imagine how American sports fans could fail to be captivated.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING WORKERS;  </P> <P> LABOR: A LANCASTER COUPLE ARE CHARGED WITH WITHHOLDING $170,000 IN WAGES ON TWO  PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.  </P> <P> A Lancaster electrical contractor and his wife were charged Wednesday with  misappropriating about $170,000 in wages from their employees on two public  works projects by paying illegally low wages to workers and falsifying  government records.  </P> <P> In what prosecutors described as rare criminal charges for such an offense,  James and Brenda Paxin were charged with defrauding employees during  subcontracting work at Lancaster City Hall and Canyon Country Park in Santa  Clarita during 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> The 21-count complaint against the Paxins, co-owners of Paxin Electric, was  filed by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in Lancaster based  on a nine-month inquiry by state labor investigators.  </P> <P> Authorities charged the Paxins with violating state labor laws against  diverting wages due to workers. James Paxin, 38, was also charged with  falsifying public documents submitted to city and state officials. He allegedly  forced workers to report that they worked fewer hours and received higher pay  than they actually had to make it appear that they received the prevailing wage  required on government contracts.  </P> <P> Seventeen workers were allegedly victimized on the $4.7-million City Hall  addition from February, 1988, to July, 1989. Paxin received a $560,000 contract  and illegally pocketed about $116,000, authorities said.  </P> <P> Thirteen employees were victimized on the $2.1-million park project, where  Paxin Electric performed $158,000 in wiring work as a subcontractor between May  and November, 1989, authorities said. The Paxins allegedly pocketed $53,000 on  that project.  </P> <P> Paxin and his wife, 40, surrendered in Antelope Valley Municipal Court on  Wednesday and were released on their own recognizance. Attorney Michael C.  Eberhardt, who appeared for the couple, said he knew little about the case.  </P> <P> But Eberhardt said: "Normally these cases are handled civilly. I have to see  why this case was taken to the criminal level."  </P> <P> Only about four or five such criminal cases are filed in Southern California  each year, said Roger Miller, regional manager of the enforcement bureau of the  state Division of Labor Standards. He said investigators filed charges against  the Paxins because the couple had been the subject of civil actions in the past  for similar violations and because employees came forward with testimony and  records.  </P> <P> The Paxins' scheme enabled them to circumvent established competitive bidding  procedures for government contracts, Miller said.  </P> <P> "That's the intent of the law, to make the process competitive," he said.  </P> <P> State officials are receiving an increasing number of complaints about  employers who misappropriate public works funds by demanding kickbacks from  employees, he said.  </P> <P> In court papers filed Wednesday, an investigator said Paxin "developed an  elaborate paper scheme to avoid proper payment of prevailing wages to his  employees." Workers were paid between $5 and $15 an hour for work that should  have earned $29.60 an hour under state-mandated wages for electricians,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Workers signed altered pay sheets because they "feared for their jobs if they  did not go along with the program," the report said.  </P> <P> Each of the 21 felony counts carries a penalty of 16 months to three years in  prison, authorities said.  </P> <P> The Division of Labor Standards is pursuing civil action that could also result  in fines, officials said.  </P></p>

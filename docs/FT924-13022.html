			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dunton cuts losses sharply to Pounds 803,000 Dunton Group reduced its loss significantly in the year ended May 31 1992, but reiterated that a return to profitability was only likely following a recovery in the economy and the property sector in particular. For the year the deficit came to Pounds 803,000 (Pounds 4.45m) and the loss per share to 1.01p (7.74p). Turnover of Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 3.24m) generated an operating surplus of Pounds 676,000 (loss Pounds 2.5m). Apart from property the group is interested in brick making. Those operations had been cash generative throughout the year although output was substantially less than full capacity, said the directors. In property the group continued to achieve sales at or above book value.</p>

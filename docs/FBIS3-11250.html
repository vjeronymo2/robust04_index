			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir has described the  possible approval of voluntary military service proposed by  President Carlos Roberto Reina as "total destruction" of the  Armed Forces. The military chief explained that Hondurans are  not ready for such a step because they do not have enough  education and culture, aside from the fact that it would weaken  the Armed Forces.    When asked if that meant he opposed the approval of the new  recruiting system, he reiterated that "it is the institution's  destruction," adding that not only the military but all  Hondurans are against it. He said it is necessary to change  recruitment practices and suggested that the Civil Registry  provide a list of citizens who are over 18 years of age. "There  are so many young people in the appropriate age bracket that we  would only need 3 to 4 percent of them," he said.    Concerning the privatization of the Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel) -- which is of great  interest to President Reina -- Gen. Discua said that "as general  commander of the Armed Forces, we must support him; otherwise,  we would be disloyal." This answer by the military chief is  contradictory inasmuch as he has voiced opposition to the new  recruitment system proposed by President Reina.    He explained that the Armed Forces do not have any direct  involvement in the administration of Hondutel with the exception  of the fact that it is managed by a military officer. Actually,  the company is governed by a board of directors chaired by the  communications, public works, and transportation minister,  Discua noted.    The military chief said that the money circulating in the  nation's drug market is far exceeds the national budget of a  country such as Honduras. He reported that the Police, Army,  Air Force, and Navy are conducting joint operations that have  led to the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of large  amounts of drugs. He added that efforts have been intensified,  particularly in Islas de la Bahia, which has become a key point  for drug contraband.    Discua said he could neither confirm nor deny charges by a  former judge that the traditional political parties paid for  their campaigns with drug money because he does not have any  information to that effect.    According to the high-ranking officer, Health Minister  Enrique Samayoa is very poorly informed when he says that the  Armed Forces' budget has been increased. "I think he has been  confused by a UN report that dates back to 1993 and which talks  about nonexistent amounts of money," Discua stated. "I do not  understand why the figures were handled in that way. Perhaps  they sought to confuse the public," he added.    The general, who arrived yesterday morning at the 105th  Military Brigade in San Pedro Sula to attend the seminar of the  Permanent Committee for Emergencies (Copeco), also referred to  the complicated issue of the whereabouts of the 7 million  lempiras received following Hurricane Gert. He said a  government-appointed commission is investigating the case.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Concern grows for future of troubled council insurer THE Department of Trade and Industry is closely watching the slow progress of rescue talks for Municipal Mutual Insurance, the troubled insurer owned by UK local authorities, amid concern about its survival prospect. The worries about MMI - the UK's ninth largest general insurer - have intensified since the circulation of a negative assessment by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and speculation that talks between MMI and its prospective partner, La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionaires (GMF), are foundering. The French insurer is part of the Eurosafe consortium of European insurance companies. Mr Brian Wright, who became MMI's chief executive in May, yesterday denied reports that the merger talks had collapsed. 'I am going to Paris this week to continue with these discussions,' he said. The talks were protracted because the transfer of MMI's business was complex. 'We have to ensure the transfer is effected in the best way to protect the interests of policyholders.' MMI ran into difficulties because claims by councils in 1990 and 1991 proved far greater than expected, partly because of a big rise in arson attacks on schools and a growing tendency among individuals to take legal action against local authorities. Its net assets declined from Pounds 287.9m at the end of 1990 to less than Pounds 5m at the end of 1991. The prospect of MMI's collapse, unless it quickly agrees a takeover, is viewed with concern by local councils. If the insurer foundered, it is unlikely that their claims would be met in full. MMI insures over 80 per cent of local authorities. Local authorities are not protected by the safety net of the Policyholders Protection Act, which safeguards policyholders in the event of an insurance company's default. MMI announced in July that it was in talks with GMF. The Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates insurers, said yesterday that it was premature to speculate what would happen if a merger was not agreed. 'We understand an agreement was reached in principle between MMI and GMF in July,' it said. 'The department has been closely in touch with negotiations ever since.' However, the report by Touche Ross, which was commissioned by the associations for county, metropolitan and district councils, is believed to say that the DTI will insist that the group ceases trading unless the takeover with GMF goes ahead quickly.</p>

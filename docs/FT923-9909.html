			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Bleak decade forecast for advertising THE advertising industry faces a bleak decade, according to a study published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management consultancy firm. Economic recovery will be modest, it says, which, with an increasing shift of competitive power from advertising agencies to their clients will be the main obstacle to a repetition of the boom years of the 1980s. Advertising revenue grew in nominal terms from some Pounds 2.5bn in 1980 to more than Pounds 7.5bn in 1990, with the top 10 agencies' revenues estimated to have grown annually by more than 13 per cent in nominal terms over the decade. In real terms, the sector grew by some 3 per cent annually. Nevertheless, the sector took a battering last year, with some estimates suggesting a real decline of 11 per cent. The report endorses the view that, given no real growth in the underlying economy this year, advertising agencies face the prospect of growth restricted to 2.8 per cent in real terms in 1992 and 4 per cent next year. The report criticises the 'extravagant image' that advertising developed in the last decade and gives a warning that 'the 1990s will see clients turn away from agencies maintaining such an image as they place increasing emphasis on qualities such as professionalism, communication and cost-effectiveness'. The study highlights several factors that it says might help to ensure that those agencies which have survived the last two years will profit from enduring slow economic growth. Agencies must: Re-evaluate their international options, ensuring that expensive overseas networks are set up only where rewards are certain to be commensurate with additional costs involved. Review their range of services. Reassess their pricing structure, with an emphasis on flexibility and value for money. Control their cost base and ensure their systems are capable of providing increasingly sophisticated information. The advertising industry: an examination.

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Gonzalez sends domestic message with choice of foreign minister THE APPOINTMENT of Mr Javier Solana as Spain's new foreign minister reveals a good deal more about the shifting power balance in the ruling Socialist party than any diplomatic initiatives planned by the Madrid government. A longstanding member of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's inner political circle and a physicist by profession, Mr Solana will be sworn in today to replace Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez who has retired on grounds of ill-health after seven years in the government. Mr Solana, who over the past decade has successively held the posts of minister of culture and minister of education, is the only genuine counterweight among Spain's top socialists to Mr Alfonso Guerra, the former deputy prime minister who as deputy leader of the party commands the party machinery. Like both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra, Mr Solana joined the then clandestine Socialist party as a student in the 1960s and together the three rapidly rose to the forefront of opposition politics at the tail end of the Franco dictatorship. Mr Solana was raised in Madrid where he attended elite schools before doing post-graduate research in the US. At Mr Guerra's instigation, Mr Solana, 50, was barred from the Socialist party's executive two years ago and he has since come to represent the more liberal wing of the party that opposes the so-called guerristas entrenched in the party headquarters. Mr Solana's promotion to the Foreign Ministry not only highlights the growing estrangement between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra. It also converts Mr Solana into a main contender to lead the government should Mr Gonzalez choose to stand down. By asking Mr Solana to take on the Foreign Ministry, Mr Gonzalez has clearly stated his preferences. The signal was made all the stronger by the prime minister's decision to replace Mr Solana with Mr Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the secretary of state for education, who is an outspoken guerrista opponent, and to keep Mr Carlos Solchaga, the main architect of the government's confrontation with the unions, as economy and finance minister. Mr Guerra's camp had hoped that the resignation of Mr Fernandez Ordonez would lead to a big cabinet reshuffle in which Mr Solchaga would leave the government. The appointments follow a weekend closed-door meeting at the Socialist headquarters in which Mr Gonzalez, as party leader, allegedly issued a stern warning against what he viewed as the narrow sectarianism of the party executive. Yesterday, Mr Solana said the thrust of Spanish diplomacy was well established and that 'a new foreign minister did not mean a new foreign policy'. In practise Mr Gonzalez, who over the years has increasingly relished his role as an international statesman, keeps a tight rein on policy. Mr Solana can nevertheless be expected to be tougher than Mr Fernandez Ordonez, his affable predecessor, when it comes to pursuing Spain's special interests in the EC. At the top of Spain's agenda for next weekend's Lisbon summit is the belief that the Community should be 'deepened' before it is 'widened' and that the cohesion funds agreed at the Maastricht summit last December should be honoured.</p>

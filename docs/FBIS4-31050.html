			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Doboj, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- After several days of  fighting on the Ozren-Vozuca front, the fiercest of which took  place yesterday, forces of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army  have been heavily defeated. Attacking from three directions in  the Vosuca area, the Muslims attempted to take control of the  Zavidovici-Banovici road, which passes through Vozuca, and in  this way link the Zenica and Tuzla regions. Their attacks were  repulsed by the defenders of Ozren and Vozuca, and the enemy  suffered heavy losses. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An ASAHI SHIMBUN opinion poll which surveyed 100  major companies has revealed that most business executives  regarded the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit on the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks as "unavoidable."  Meanwhile, concerning the voluntary market-opening package  aimed at cutting the trade surplus which the government will  formulate within this month, most executives noted a need to  formulate concrete measures to ease regulations and expand  domestic demand, including tax cuts and increased public  investment.    In reply to a question on the Japan-U.S. summit breakdown,  executives of 67 companies stated, "It was regrettable, but for  the sake of building new bilateral relations it could not have  been avoided." Only three answered, "It was only natural  because the U.S. demand was unreasonable." In the meanwhile,  only four executives answered that "Japan should have  compromised."    What is noteworthy is that as many as 26 executives gave  other answers, and most of them pointed out that the government  had failed to make sufficient efforts to establish a "mature  relationship." For example, several chemical company executives  said, "What the government should have done was not only to  reject U.S. demands but also to present alternative plans for  cutting the trade surplus while taking the other side's position  into consideration."    The results of the poll have revealed companies' strong  hopes  for the market-opening package now being formulated by the  government. A financial company's executive said, "It is  desirable that the government indicate definite measures to cut  the trade surplus." Executives of 81 companies requested that  "demand be expanded by taking such microeconomic measures as tax  cuts and increased public investment." Also, executives from 71  companies called on the government to include in the package  "concrete goals to achieve deregulation and to correct the gap  in prices between goods at home and abroad."</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN HILLS ANNEXATION OKD DESPITE PROTESTS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: OPPONENTS ARE TOLD TO TAKE THEIR FIGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL. THE  CITY PLANS TO USE THE SITE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County commission approved an annexation Wednesday that the city  of Hidden Hills sought to provide land for affordable housing, advising  residents who testified against the proposal to take their fight to the City  Council.  </P> <P> Members of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which makes annexation  recommendations to the county Board of Supervisors, said their function was to  rule only on the land annexation, not on development proposals for the site.  </P> <P> The City Council supports a plan calling for 46 units of lower-cost housing for  senior citizens. The project would be built on a portion of 25 acres the city  would annex on the southern edge of its current boundary.  </P> <P> "If the people don't like the annexation and what will happen with the  annexation, the point is that you have to use your influence with your City  Council to stop it," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, a  member of the panel.  </P> <P> LAFCO member James A. Van Horn Jr., from the Artesia City Council, told four  residents who spoke against the annexation: "The vast majority of what I've  heard from you are questions you have to determine at the ballot box."  </P> <P> Two residents, Howard Klein and David Stanley, said they plan to do exactly  that by running, along with a third candidate, for the council in the April 10  election.  </P> <P> The council has favored the lower-cost housing plan as a way to comply with  state law and settle a lawsuit that was brought because the city used a  redevelopment agency to help finance a flood-control project. State law  requires 20% of redevelopment funds to be spent on affordable housing and  requires cities to provide for affordable housing through its planning and  zoning laws.  </P> <P> Hidden Hills is a gated community of about 2,000 residents in estate-size  houses.  </P> <P> "This has been the most debated issue . . . in the history of Hidden Hills,"  said City Atty. Wayne K. Lemeiux. In an advisory poll conducted this month by  the council, about two-thirds of the participants objected to some form of the  council's affordable housing plan.  </P> <P> Outside the hearing room, Stanley told reporters that residents who oppose the  plan fear it will change the town's rural character.  </P> <P> "You don't have a bunch of people who are bigots or who hate old people,"  Stanley said.  </P> <P> Stanley and other residents told the commission that traffic and increased  demand for city services were among their primary concerns. But LAFCO Executive  Director Ruth Bennell earlier this month found that development of the area, as  described by the city in its annexation application, would not significantly  affect traffic or city services.  </P> <P> Annexation still requires approval of the Board of Supervisors, and the Hidden  Hills City Council still must hold public hearings on the issue of how the land  will be developed.  </P></p>

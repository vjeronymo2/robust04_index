			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OLSEN STILL CHASING RECORD AS FULLERTON FALLS TO TROY  </P> <P> D.C. Olsen would like to put the No. 13 in the back of his mind -- if anyone  would let him.  </P> <P> Olsen, Fullerton High School's catcher, is tied with Andy Ruscitto for the  Orange County single-season home run record with 12.  </P> <P> "I'm getting kind of tense about it," Olsen said after failing to get a home  run Tuesday in Fullerton's 4-2 loss to visiting Troy. "Even when I'm swinging  the bat on deck, somebody comes up behind me to tell me to go for the record."  </P> <P> Troy left-hander Guy Pinelli couldn't keep Olsen from extending his season-long  hitting streak to 24 games, but he did keep Olsen's drives inside Fullerton's  cozy ballpark. In doing so, Pinelli helped Troy clinch at least a tie for the  Freeway League title.  </P> <P> "Everybody came out to the game today to see D.C. get the record," Troy Coach  Dane Ilertsen said. "But they saw Pinelli instead."  </P> <P> Pinelli (8-2) used fastballs and sliders against Olsen, jamming them inside on  the Fullerton junior. It was only the second time in 24 games that Olsen has  failed to drive in a run.  </P> <P> Olsen was one for three, getting a sharp single through the left side of the  infield. He lined into a double play in the first inning and flied to deep  right field in the sixth.  </P> <P> The single gave Olsen 49 hits on the season -- only two behind Robbie  Katzaroff's 1985 county single-season mark of 51. Olsen's batting average  dropped to .613, still higher than the 10-year-old county record of .585 set by  Anaheim's Steve Evans.  </P> <P> But Olsen will have to wait until Thursday to break any of the three records,  when Fullerton travels to Troy for the Freeway League finale.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see him get the record," Ilertsen said. "As long as we win anyway.  These things don't happen too often."  </P> <P> Troy, led by Matt Carter's two-run homer in the first and Steve Friedrich's  solo shot in the fifth, improved to 14-8, 11-3 in league. Troy has won 10  consecutive games.  </P> <P> Fullerton dropped to 12-11-1, 6-8.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Sonora 5, Sunny Hills 2 -- Marcos Pando was two for four with two runs scored  and Tracy Kaufman was one for three with two RBIs for Sonora (12-11, 7-7) at  Sunny Hills (14-11, 9-5). Scott Oxarart (6-6) gave up two unearned runs in the  fourth and earned the complete-game victory.  </P> <P> La Habra 2, Buena Park 0 -- Scott Veeder (4-6) allowed four hits and struck out  five in the complete-game victory at Buena Park. Marc Patterson and Wendell  Wickersham each had two hits for La Habra.  </P></p>

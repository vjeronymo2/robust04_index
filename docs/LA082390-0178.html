			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY CONSIDERS ASSAULT CHARGE AGAINST  BRIDGES  </P> <P> A jury began its first full day of deliberations Wednesday in the assault  retrial of actor Todd Bridges, charged with shooting a drug dealer eight times  inside a cocaine rock house last year.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Superior Court jury received the case late Tuesday, but met for  only a few minutes and most likely did little more than select a foreman. The  panel recessed for the evening and returned to court Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> If convicted, Bridges, 24, a former child star of the television sitcoms  "Diff'rent Strokes" and "Fish," could be sentenced to up to four years in state  prison.  </P></p>

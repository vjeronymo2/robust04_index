			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 14 TASS -- A depot of aviation bombs  belonging to the Pacific Fleets's air wing exploded on Saturday  near the village of Novonezhino in the Russian Far Eastern  maritime territory.    According to the duty officer of the maritime territory  civil  defence headquarters, the explosion occurred at 15.40 local time  in the village which is located 100 kilometers north of the  territory's administrative centre Vladivostok. There have been  no immediate reports about damages or casualties.    Armored vehicles have been dispatched to the area to  evacuate  the inhabitants. A group of specialists of the federal  counterintelligence service and the commander of the Pacific  Fleet's air wing have departed for the area.    The effects of the explosion were felt in Vladivostok and  the  city of Artem as earthquake tremors. Alarmed people have been  phoning the Far Eastern regional rescue service to find out what  caused the tremors and what they should do in the situation.  Meanwhile the civil defence headquarters has reported that there  is no danger for the cities of Artem and Vladivostok.    The explosion occurred exactly two years after the Pacific  Fleet depot in Vladivostok exploded on May 14, 1992.    There were no nuclear or chemical weapons in the aviation  bomb depot of the Russian Pacific Fleet's air wing where a  shattering explosion occurred on Saturday afternoon, sources in  the Russian Federal Ministry of Emergencies told ITAR-TASS.  There was no immediate information about the causes and effects  of the explosion.    An electrical train has arrived at Novonezhino to evacuate  local inhabitants, and a special group from the Russian Defence  Ministry has left Moscow by plane en route to Vladivostok and  the site of the explosion.    As reported earlier, another explosion occurred two years  ago  today, on May 14, 1992 at the Pacific Fleet ammunition dump on  the outskirts of Vladivostok near the factories Izumrud  (Emerald) and Varyag (Varangian).    At that time a fire broke out through negligence of the  service personnel at the ammunition dump which held 2200  truckloads of ammunition. 122-mm and 100-mm artillery shells  and 120-mm mines kept exploding for several days with their  splinters sent hurling for miles around. Civil defence and army  units, the city militia, firefighters and ambulance cars were  brought out in force to combat the fire. Several people,  including military school cadets were killed and considerable  damage was done to the storage facilities of the Russian Pacific  Fleet in the region.    First Deputy Commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet Igor  Khmelnov flew to the site of the explosion at a Pacific Fleet  air wing ammunition dump, which occurred at 16.00 local time,  the Russian Defence Ministry's information and press department  told ITAR-TASS.    According to the same source, for the time being there is no  direct communication with the military settlement in which the  disaster occurred.    Forces and means of Pacific Fleet units have been dispatched  to the site to look into the situation and clean up the effects  of the explosion.    Interaction has been arranged between the Defence Ministry  and the specialists of the Russian Federal Ministry of  Emergencies.    The fire at the Pacific Fleet Air Wing's ammunition dump,  which resulted from today's explosion, is being localized,  according to the fleet's senior duty officer Vsevolod Fadeyev.    According to Fadeyev, groups of specialists, including  sappers, have arrived on the scene, where first deputy commander  of the Pacific Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov is in charge of  the clean- up operations.    The Pacific Fleet Commander Georgiy Gurinov is at the  fleet's  main command post, coordinating the activity of all the forces  involved. The fleet's structures are on the stand-by.    Fadeyev also said that fleet units and security forces are  controlling the situation in the disaster area, and the  evacuation of residents from Novonezhino is being managed  effectively.</p>

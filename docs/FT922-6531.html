			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Pricing for health care Sir, Mr Peter Reeves (Letters, May 18), in raising the question of restructuring the private health service, proposes a change to a pre-determined price for a full episode of treatment, so encouraging a more rapid embracing of short-stay technologies. In fact, the private sector already offers predetermined prices by way of fixed cost surgery, a system first introduced by Nuffield Hospitals. There is, however, a difficulty in making this pricing system more widely available. This lies in a varying length of hospital stay which is usually based on medical pre-conditions. The priority must be patients' well-being; it may not be in their best interests if hospitals have too great an incentive to 'turn round' patients quickly. The private health sector has pioneered the adoption of short-stay procedures such as keyhole surgery so as to embrace advances in technology while maintaining its commitment to high levels of medical care. We believe the uptake of such techniques is far greater in the private sector, perhaps because the private sector is naturally more accustomed to adapting rapidly to changes in consumer demand. David T Ervine, chief executive, Nuffield Hospitals, Nuffield House, 1-4 The Crescent, Surbiton, Surrey KT6 4BN</p>

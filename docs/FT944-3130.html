			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / IRA arms surrender 'not vital for start of peace talks' The British government will not insist on the surrender of IRA weapons as a precondition for allowing Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into talks on Northern Ireland's future. But, speaking on the eve of a meeting between the government and loyalist representatives, Mr John Major said he was determined to ensure paramilitary arsenals were 'no longer available for use in terrorist attacks'. In comments which may concern some unionists who are still suspicious about the IRA's intentions, the prime minister said he was 'not pedantic about whether those weapons are surrendered or whether those weapons are decommissioned, destroyed with some form of verification - I don't mind'. What was important was that a political party should not be able to 'go back to a nice little stockpile of weapons if something went against them and start using them again'. His remarks came as he unveiled Pounds 75m of private investment in the province in the textiles, telecommunications and automotive sectors. The package was the highlight of a buoyant Belfast International Investment conference, overshadowing a walkout by Sinn Fein representatives. The prime minister told the 300 delegates at Ulster's biggest business event since the troubles began 25 years ago that a 'virtuous circle' was taking shape. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity; prosperity in turn will consolidate peace,' he said. Setting out the province's stall to potential investors, Mr Major announced a new government work programme for the long-term unemployed. He said the programme would help 1,000 long-term jobless over two years and would be expanded 'substantially' if successful. The programme is under-stood to be the first stage of a two-pronged government initiative. The Northern Ireland Office's department of economic development is thought to be working on proposals to focus its aid effort more on areas of high unemployment, including politically sensitive west Belfast. After receiving a warm welcome from shoppers at Portadown, Mr Major dismissed Sinn Fein's walkout from yesterday's conference, saying: 'I think they have shot themselves in the foot rather badly.' IRA weapons are top of the government's agenda in its preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein, which will resume next week when the two sides attempt to draw up a more detailed agenda for discussions.

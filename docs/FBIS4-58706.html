			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Fayiz Abu-Rahmah, former head of Gaza </F> Bar Association, by Philippe Rochot in Gaza -- live, in English  with superimposed French translation ]    [Text] [Rochot] I have with me Dr. Fayiz Abu-Rahmah, who is  close to Yasir 'Arafat, who has fought here for the peace  agreements, and whom I am going to ask whether in the end he is  not disappointed to see that these agreements are taking a long  time to get implemented, in particular the arrival of the  Palestinian police that was expected today.    [Abu-Rahmah] No, it is a practical question, and we think  they will be here by next week.    [Rochot] You aren't worried because a lot of extremists want  to attack the peace process?    [Abu-Rahmah] No, we aren't afraid, we aren't worried. The  extremists have their opinions, and the others have theirs.  That is democracy.    [Rochot] How do you see your relations with the Israelis  after this agreement?    [Abu-Rahmah] They will be cordial relations, and we hope  this  peaceful coexistence will develop.    [Rochot] There are a lot of people without work here. There  are no jobs. How do you see the reconstruction of the Gaza  Strip?    [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, the unemployment problem is extremely  serious. We hope the Israelis will help to employ a certain  percentage of the population. Others will be a burden for the  Palestinian administration.    [Rochot] You are also expecting help from the European  Community, but you haven't received anything?    [Abu-Rahmah] Yes, we are expecting their help. We hope it  will be generous, because the Gaza Strip is a very poor place,  without resources. Its only resources are its people. We hope  its men and women will be able to be productive in one way or  another, and we hope that one day Gaza will become the Hong Kong  of the Middle East.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Renault sale sparks mixed union feelings: Battle lines forming in a high-profile privatisation struggle Mr Robert Hue, general secretary of the French Communist party, yesterday deployed all the symbolism he could muster in his attempt to put the brakes on the privatisation of Renault, star of the country's public sector and erstwhile stronghold of its workers' movement. Speaking at the now-disused Boulougne Billancourt plant in western Paris, near where the first Renault car was built at the end of last century, he condemned the proposal to sell the motor group. 'At the time when France is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its liberation, the government is undoing the work of De Gaulle,' he said, referring to the nationalisation of the car company after the second world war. 'We declare our total and resolute opposition to this project and will use all our force to stop it.' He warned of job losses and promised a campaign against privatisation after the holidays. Despite the symbolism, however, it is less clear how much substance lies behind the threat from the Communist party and some of France's trade unions. The influence of both has waned and, for most observers, the proposed privatisation is more likely to stand as a landmark in the government's withdrawal from a dirigiste economic tradition than a victory for union opponents. 'I don't think the unions will prevent privatisation,' says Mr Eric Michelis, motor industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris. 'Renault is already managed like a private sector company.' However, he believes the matter will need delicate handling. That message is not lost on Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. Displaying customary caution he has left his options wide open. Wary of the impact of an industrial dispute before next year's presidential election, but tempted by the prospect of a flagship privatisation and the FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) or so it could bring to a strained public purse, his centre-right government has moved gingerly to prepare for what it calls 'an opening of the capital' of the group. Another sale, that of the insurance company Assurances Generales de France, has been lined up and is ready to be launched should the government prefer to privatise Renault next year. 'No decision has been taken. We are following our strategy of having two irons in the fire,' says an economics ministry official. Which of the two companies will be offered first will be determined partly by the success of the government and Renault in ensuring employee support for the sale. While the Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail says it is 'categorically opposed to abandoning a national industrial asset', other unions at Renault have given a nuanced response. The more moderate Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail, which has combined with other unions to wrest control of Renault's central union committee from the CGT, says it is 'not systematically opposed to a partial privatisation'. Force Ouvriere says it wants more details about the impact of privatisation and guarantees that workers' rights at the plant will not be affected by the sale. The possibility for disruption remains. While the CGT has seen its influence eroded and union membership generally is only about 10 per cent, it remains relatively strong in certain areas of the company. 'They are present on the production lines and in the factories,' says one industry observer. 'So they can cause trouble if they want.' To prevent broader opposition, the government is likely to provide attractive terms to employees to back a privatisation. 'The government may offer employees very cheap shares in the company to involve them in the operation,' says Mr Michelis. A suggestion by the CFTC union that workers might be offered a bonus of FFr2,500 at the time of privatisation could, however, be too obvious a ploy.</p>

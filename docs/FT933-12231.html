			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UN base shelled in Serb assault SERB forces fired artillery rounds into a French-staffed United Nations base in Sarajevo yesterday, setting ablaze several vehicles but with no reported injuries. The incident occurred hours after the latest Bosnian ceasefire came into force. French Colonel Roger Duburg said 68 artillery rounds had slammed into the parking lot of the UN base, in what he told reporters was a deliberate attempt to intimidate the UN. The shells hit a satellite base of the UN force at the Zetra Olympic stadium in the besieged Bosnian capital. 'I believe this was a signal. Under the latest UN resolution we may have the option to send them a signal,' Col Duburg said, implying that the UN forces could retaliate. 'This was direct fire. It was not an accident.' he said. The UN has warned Serb forces it will use Nato aircraft to protect UN peacekeepers if they come under fire in the six enclaves proclaimed as 'safe areas', including Sarajevo. UN Commander Barry Frewer said both sides had ignored the ceasefire. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has said he would boycott peace talks in Geneva, postponed until Tuesday, if the Serbs maintain their offensive. Bosnian radio said at least 27 people were killed and 60 wounded yesterday in an all-out Serb tank and artillery attack on the northeastern town of Brcko. UN observers saw refugees streaming from the town, headed for Tuzla, the Bosnian government stronghold 40 miles to the south. The UN reports said they expected the fighting to intensify amid a build-up of Serbian tanks. 'The entire 65km front line is wrapped in flames and smoke. . . Bosnian homes are collapsing like houses of cards in the terrible explosions of Russian Volkov rockets,' said Sarajevo radio, calling yesterday 'the most difficult since the beginning of the war'. Belgrade radio confirmed the clashes between Serbs, on one side, and Moslems and Croats, on the other. It said a powerful counter-offensive has successfully pushed back the Moslem forces'. Serb forces seized control of Lipovac, Kolonija and Brod, villages on the outskirts of Brcko, reported SRNA, the Bosnian Serb news agency. Brcko has changed hands several times and been heavily damaged since the war erupted 16 months ago. The five-day offensive around Brcko follows a pattern established by the Bosnian Serb army in spring last year when they killed or expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia while international attention was focused on Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Two-day talks between the delegations of the  Russian joint stock company Gazprom and Ukraine's gas industry  and government officials ended on 4 June. A schedule for the  Ukrainian consumers to service their debt for Russian gas was  agreed. An accord was reached on creating favorable conditions  for contracts for gas deliveries to be concluded directly by  Ukraine's enterprises and Russia's Gazprom, as well as on  commercial firms participating in the settlement of the debt.  An agreement was signed on cooperation in expanding and  revamping transit gas pipelines in Ukraine. To that end, a  joint stock venture is to be set up by the end of this year.  Agreement was reached on the transfer of 15 to 30 percent of  the shares in Odessa's port works to the Russian joint stock  company Gazprom as authorized by Ukraine's State Property Fund.</p>

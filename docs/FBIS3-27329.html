For this reason,  this reporter interviewed Minister of Personnel Song Defu,  asking him to talk about the work in, and the idea behind,  expediting reform of the personnel system.    Song Defu gave a briefing on the situation and said that,  according to the needs of the socialist market economic system,  the general idea behind the future reform of the personnel  system in our country is: Increase the weight of the reform,  quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel  management system which corresponds to the socialist market  economic system. That is to say, establish a good personnel  system for managing different types of establishments, a  scientific and reasonable system to distribute wages, a  multifold social insurance system, a macropersonnel management  system, a system of personnel markets, and a system of personnel  regulations.    Building and implementing a public service system is the key  point in this year's reform of the personnel system. Song Defu  said that in 1994 we must create a good beginning for  implementing the public service system. This year also, on the  foundation of the reform of government organs, various  departments under the State Council and a majority of provincial  government departments and the government departments of the  separately listed cities, we must establish a rudimentary shape  for the public service system and change the current personnel  into public servants. Whether units carry out reform of organs  or not, when they hire nonleading personnel below the rank of a  presiding member of an administrative section, they must hold  open examinations, judge qualifications strictly, and hire the  best candidates.    Based on the: Needs of the market economy; nature,  functions, duties, and characteristics of the institutions; and  on the law of personnel growth, the reform of the personnel  system in institutions must follow the road of "cutting links,  dividing types, delegating power, and invigoration."    Based on the need to build a modern enterprise system, we  must expedite reform of the personnel system in enterprises and  develop steps to cancel the barriers between cadres and workers,  between cadres under different ownership systems, and between  cadres under different operational patterns within enterprises,  to form employment mechanisms wherein personnel can go up and  down and in and out, wherein choices are bilateral, and wherein  personnel flow in a rational manner. We must also develop and  groom a contingent of high quality and professional  entrepreneurs.    Building a sound, scientific, and rational wages system is  an  issue which attracts the people's attention. Song Defu pointed  out that we must further implement the principles of  distribution according to labor, giving priority to efficiency  and giving consideration to fairness. We must also introduce  competitive and stimulating mechanisms, break egalitarianism,  reasonably widen the gap, and establish corresponding wages  systems and normal wage growth mechanisms based on the inherent  characteristics of various government organs and institutions.  The CPC Central Committee and State Council are paying a great  deal of attention to this reform of the wages system and, under  the condition that the state has a relatively difficult  financial situation, they have done a great deal of work to  increase wages and considered as much as possible the interests  of the various quarters, enabling the new wages system to enter  its track and operate. Because there are many contradictions  which have been accumulated during distribution of wages, they  cannot be solved by a single reform and the key is to enable it  to get onto the track first and then gradually perfect it.    Building a social insurance system for government organs and  institutions is a rather difficult issue. When talking about  this, Song Defu said that because the funds in organs,  institutions, and enterprises are from different sources, the  ways of managing these funds are also different. Generally  speaking, when raising and using the funds, we must uphold the  principles of combining rights, obligations, and the compulsory  nature; of sharing by the state, units, and individuals; and of  social security administration being separate from social  insurance funds operations. We must actively carry out  experiments, implement the easier ones first, and reach targets  step by step. We must first establish a system of overall  planning for pension funds for contract workers in organs and  institutions and the old-age insurance system in institutions  should first be built in institutions which operate on their own  incomes and expenditures. At the same time, work must be done  to build a social insurance system for government organs,  especially for state public servants, while the work in building  an insurance system for the unemployed and disabled must also be  stepped up.    The building of a socialist market economic system has  increased the demand for capable personnel in society, so there  is an urgent need to build a sound personnel market system.  Song Defu said that building a personnel market system means  "five changes." That is, the change from idle personnel and  personnel shortages to market exchange, to regulation between  too much and too few personnel, and to rational distribution;  the change from ownership of personnel by units and organs to  ownership of personnel by society, to meeting each other's  needs, and to rational flow; the change from unilateral choices  to bilateral choices in the flow of personnel; the change from  "country markets" to "fixed markets" in the flow of personnel;  and the change from the personnel resources distribution model  characterized by "monopoly of supply and distribution," to the  one wherein the personnel market plays a basic functional role  in personnel resources distribution under the state's  macromanagement. We must gradually establish sound regulations  for personnel market operations and form a personnel market  which is flexible, open, efficient, orderly, and characterized  by fair competition; we must establish systems in areas such as  personnel flow, arbitration, and contracts, to protect the  legitimate rights of the units hiring personnel as well as those  of the individuals, to guide the flow of personnel, and to  control the volume and speed of flow, so that the personnel  market operates in an orderly manner and within the limits of  the law. We must also struggle to build, before 2000, a  nationwide personnel market system which can perform a complete  set of functions, has sound mechanisms, is supported by a legal  system, and which can provide timely guidance and good services.    On the issue of establishing a system of sound personnel  regulations, Song Defu said that 1994 will be a year of  legislation for personnel work and that we must formulate, as  soon as possible, regulations supporting the public service  system, such as the: "Procedures for Carrying Out Classification  of Positions of State Public Servants"; "Provisional Regulations  on Employing State Public Servants"; and the "Provisional  Regulations on Examinations for State Public Servants." We must  try to formulate temporary regulations on awards, training,  promotion and demotion, and on appointment or dismissal. We  must speed up the work in formulating regulations governing  personnel markets and regulations on arbitration of disputes in  the areas of personnel market management and personnel flow. In  the area of personnel regulations for enterprises and  institutions, we must formulate, as soon as possible, the  "Regulations on Personnel Management for State-Owned  Enterprises," the "Regulations on Personnel Management for  Joint-Venture Enterprises," and regulations on the old-age  insurance system and wages in institutions.    Song Defu said that building a market economic system has  brought many new problems to personnel work, requiring personnel  workers to seriously learn from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; seriously  study the laws of market economy; adhere to the reform  direction; and, when developing our excellent traditions, change  the way of thinking which we have inherited from the planned  economy, cast off the trammels of the old concepts which are not  in accordance with the actual conditions of contemporary China,  resolutely use the reform way of thinking to study the new  situation, and use the reform method to solve new problems.</p>

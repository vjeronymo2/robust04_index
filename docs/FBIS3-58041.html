			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Lubbers Happy With U.S.-European </F> Relations"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Washington, 6 Jan (ANP) -- Europe and the United  States are adopting the same attitude regarding the future of  NATO, said Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers following  talks with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher.    The U.S. Partnership for Peace plan, which will feature on  the agenda at next week's NATO summit meeting, will serve as the  basis for relations with East Europe, leading ultimately to an  expansion of NATO but without setting a date for this.    Lubbers, who is being accompanied by Foreign Minister  Kooijmans, said he was happy with the good U.S.-Netherlands  relations. The fact that President Clinton will visit Europe  three times this year makes it clear that these relations are  being given the greatest consideration.    In his talks with Mr. Christopher, Lubbers once again  emphasized that the conflict in Bosnia is one for which both  Europe and the United States bear some responsibility. The top  priority is to ensure that the parties involved in the conflict  must first reach an agreement themselves. However, there must  be a viable threat to stimulate its implementation -- i.e., NATO  -- which could implement the agreement by using force if  necessary. Lubbers compared the situation with a horse and a  cart: The parties involved in the conflict form the cart, while  NATO must serve as the cart horse. According to Mr. Lubbers,  Secretary of State Christopher said the United States is  prepared to participate in the implementation of any agreement  reached. This agreement is important in principle, said the  prime minister, although it is no blank check.    One complication for the United States is that they must  submit the control of troops on the ground to Congress. That is  no easy matter, whereby Lubbers claimed that it is important  that the U.S. Government brings its full weight to bear in this  respect.    The prime minister did not want to say whether the U.S.  Government acted prudently last spring, when it first threatened  to use force, only to do a U-turn when the Europeans expressed  their opposition. Lubbers said, however, that in the future a  stern approach would be better than muddling on.</p>

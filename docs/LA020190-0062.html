			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM PROMISES CLOSER CHECKS OF BUS DRIVERS;  </P> <P> SAFETY: LAIDLAW TRANSIT IS TAKING THE ACTION AFTER THE ARREST ON DRUNK-DRIVING  CHARGES OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO ALLEGEDLY USED AN ALIAS TO HIDE PREVIOUS ARRESTS.  </P> <P> The company that employed a school bus driver arrested at an Encino elementary  school last month on charges of driving while drunk has told school officials  it will do a better job of investigating job applicants.  </P> <P> The bus driver, Harold Keith Lone, was employed by Laidlaw Transit and  transported Los Angeles students under the company's contract with the Los  Angeles Unified School District. Lone used a license obtained under an alias  enabling him to conceal a long criminal history and a driving record that  included at least four convictions for drunk driving, state officials said.  </P> <P> Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw, reported to school  officials this week on his investigation of the incident in which Lone was  arrested with a blood-alcohol content triple that allowed under state law. Lone  had been seen driving erratically by another motorist Jan. 16 and was waiting  to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School when arrested.  </P> <P> In the most important procedural change, Daley said, Laidlaw will ask  applicants about the date their driver's license was issued and about any  previous driver's licenses they might have held, even in other states.  </P> <P> Such questions, Daley said, might have exposed Lone's ruse because the  California driving record he submitted with his application went back only two  years. He used a forged birth certificate to obtain a license under the name  Harold Keith Holmes after his legitimate license was suspended for an earlier  drunk driving conviction, state Department of Justice officials have said.  </P> <P> Had Lone's background been known, he would not have been hired last fall,  company officials said.  </P> <P> "If a person is lying to you, and pushing 40, like this guy was, and you make  them explain where they have been licensed to drive, then you're able to follow  up a little more on their background," Daley said.  </P> <P> "In all the things I saw from our procedures, that's the one, if . . . followed  up with by questions in the interview, it might have turned this situation  around," he said.  </P> <P> Rupert W. Dunevant, head of transportation for the school district, said he had  not seen Daley's report and would review it today. But he agreed that several  of the company's planned changes would be an improvement.  </P> <P> "It might avoid a Lone-Holmes situation, provided the information can be  obtained," Dunevant said. Dunevant said the company's plan to expand its  personal reference checks, especially of people claiming to be self-employed,  would also be welcome.  </P> <P> When Lone applied for a job with Laidlaw last July he told company officials  that he was a self-employed handyman. The company sent reference check forms to  two previous employers but got no response. Under Laidlaw's new procedures, the  company will ask applicants claiming to be self-employed for the names of three  customers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the state Department of Justice has completed fingerprint checks on  about half of the 620 bus drivers in the state who, like Lone, were driving  under temporary certificates issued by the California Highway Patrol. As a  result of the Lone incident, the department agreed to expedite its review of  those drivers' applications for permanent bus driver licenses.  </P> <P> No results of those reviews are yet available.  </P> <P> The Highway Patrol is also considering revamping its procedures for issuing  temporary certificates so that few, if any, drivers would need them. The  temporary certificates are issued prior to obtaining the results of a  fingerprint check.  </P> <P> In addition, school officials are continuing to investigate a report that a  parent had complained last fall that Lone arrived at a school late because he  stopped the bus at a liquor store and left students unattended.  </P></p>

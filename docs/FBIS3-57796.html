The party's national executive said in a statement issued in  this southern city that it would take part in legislative  elections due this year, and would work towards the election of  a monarchist president by the people.    The party however refused to pledge allegiance to Victor  Emmanuel of Savoy, the direct descendent of Italy's last king,  Umberto II, saying they only recognized the former's cousin  Amedee, Duke of Aoste. The party's leaders described themselves  as Savoy's loyalists.    Italy became a republic on June 10, 1946 after a referendum.  The vote ended the reign of the House of Savoy, whose kings had  ruled over Piedmont for nine centuries and as kings of Italy  from 1861.</p>

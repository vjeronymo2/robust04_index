			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / French purchase lifts Kalon GREATLY helped this time by its recent French acquisition rather than by its UK side, Kalon, the paints group, maintained the pattern of its growth with a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 8.73m in the six months to July 3. Group operating profits rose to Pounds 8.76m (Pounds 5.93m). Continuing operations - essentially the UK activities - were ahead 5 per cent to Pounds 6.3m on turnover of Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 50.5m), while Novodec, the French private-label paint maker acquired in February for Pounds 22m, pitched in Pounds 2.46m on turnover of Pounds 19.3m in its five months in the group. Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said the growth in the UK decorative paints division had come from additional volumes and that Kalon had lifted its market share in the UK retail and trade paints sectors, though margins had fallen. Prices had come under pressure as a result of the competitive cash-back incentives from the multinational branded paint makers - ICI and Crown  - and as competition between the DIY superstores - such as B&amp;Q, Texas and Do-It-All - hotted up. Mr Hennessy reckoned that, including the cash-back offers, paint prices fell 18 per cent year-on-year, and otherwise were down as much as 25 per cent. In response to this and a general recession-driven urge for customers to buy cheap, Kalon introduced a range of 'budget' products to pick up busin-ess at lower price points - 'fine-tuning to suit strategy to market conditions', said Mr Hennessy. On a six-monthly basis, Novodec had lifted its profits 40 per cent on turnover up 22 per cent, and that as 'a one-legged animal' in private-label retail paints. Soon to come are further legs - the introduction of Leyland trade paints into the Pounds 500m French trade paints market (the UK's market is Pounds 300m), and the launch of trade centres. The first will open in Lille at the turn of the year and up to four are planned by the end of 1994. The specialist products division, recently formed after Kalon bought Mangers in November 1992 and Chelec two months later, made Pounds 148,000 on turnover of Pounds 3m. Profits in the exports side fell 40 per cent to Pounds 197,000 on Pounds 2.47m turnover, though there should be an improvement in the second half. The Spanish operations reduced their losses and are expected to break even over the year. The interim dividend is lifted 30 per cent to 1.3p, payable from a 29 per cent rise in earnings per share to 4.46p (3.45p). COMMENT Having raced ahead in the past five years or so, UK paints activity, Kalon's core business, is now slowing down. There has been over-capacity and largely paints in the UK have been over-priced. With this in mind, the group's French move seems more impressive now than it did in February and is another feather in Mr Hennessy's cap. Production efficiencies and lower raw material costs may just be the tip of the iceberg in the French operation's medium-term growth potential. If Mr Hennessy and his team can replicate Kalon's operational formula in France, and the feeling is they can, then Mr Hennessy will again earn himself an enormous pay packet in his now famous triennial bonus scheme. Short term, forecasts for the year remain at Pounds 19m pre-tax, giving a multiple of about 17. The premium to the market still does not fully value the group.</p>

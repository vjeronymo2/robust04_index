			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas </F> Slezevicius by Ruta Grineviciute under the "Opinions" rubric;  place and date not given: "VAT -- Against S. Urniezius"]    [Text] [Grineviciute] For the second week running,  RESPUBLIKA has failed to receive a reply as to how much money  the VAT [value-added tax] will contribute to the state budget.  Finance Minister E. Vilkelis has said: "No one can say how  much budget revenues will increase." Maybe you know the answer?    [Slezevicius] While debating the budget law, the Seimas  [parliament] estimated budget revenues from the VAT at 967  million litai, or 25 percent.    The VAT is a long-term rather than a temporary economic  policy measure. This tax does not uphold the government's  popularity, because its introduction increases prices. On the  other hand, however, the VAT makes the collection of taxes more  effective and, thus, disciplines the community.    [Grineviciute] Prior to the VAT, you used to say that the  total of collected taxes accounted for about 30 percent. What  is the VAT ratio in this respect?    [Slezevicius] This should be assessed by experts. I myself  have not drafted such predictions. One can say, however, that  the collection of taxes in our state is ineffective, and that  there are many ways to evade them. The tax system that is being  projected now should improve the situation.    Another aspect of the same problem is responsibility for the  nonpayment of taxes. We are planning to rally a group of  lawyers who will draft specific laws on combating this  phenomenon. These documents will be of the same type as the law  on preventive detention.    [Grineviciute] Are you drawing a parallel between the  nonpayment of taxes and organized crime?    [Slezevicius] The latter are alike, according to the  importance, severity, and effectiveness of these measures.    [Grineviciute] However, if in cases of businessmen who do  not  pay taxes, we resort to measures similar to those that are  applied to organized criminals, we could jail all businessmen  after doing our best.    [Slezevicius] I suppose that there are quite a few companies  and firms (I have worked in business and I know this) that do  not engage in illegal trade. Every respectable businessman is  moving away from the shadow economy. Finally, we will apply  economic rather than physical (imprisonment -- R.G.) measures.    [Grineviciute] In your opinion, can these laws be  retroactive? Should they create conditions for law enforcement  institutions to inquire into the manner in which the capital  stock of firms was accumulated?    [Slezevicius] Certainly, we should choose the zero option  and  leave history intact.    [Grineviciute] How would you comment on the fact that over  the first days after the VAT introduction, contrary to the  predictions of government experts, gas and bread prices went up  by about 30 percent, while lines appeared on the border, because  customs services began to collect the VAT?    [Slezevicius] We have always said that this temporary price  hike is linked with the desire of separate commercial structures  to earn surplus profits over the short term. There are no  objective reasons for the price rise to exceed 18 percent (the  VAT). Traders will have to reduce their prices, otherwise,  their turnover will decline.    The rush at the border should not be explained by the  unpreparedness for the VAT introduction, but it should be  interpreted as the businessmen's great desire to bring goods  into our country before 1 May.    [Grineviciute] How do you plan to collect the VAT? Thus far,  this has depended on a person collecting the VAT, on his "price."    [Slezevicius] This tax is perfect because it does not allow  an official alone to decide whether or not to pay it. This tax  is paid in the entire "chain." One can receive compensation  from the budget only after paying everything. This system  forces one to pay.    [Grineviciute] Recently, S. Urniezius, "Duke Vilgaudas of  the Gediminaiciai" [leader of young people's patriotic  organization bearing the name of Lithuania's 13th-century Grand  Duke Gediminas], announced his plans to sell cheap alcohol. In  the opinion of experts, only contraband liquor could be so  cheap. How will you force Mr. Urniezius to pay taxes?    [Slezevicius] Measures that we are introducing now are  directed against such citizens as S. Urniezius -- he seems to  represent a noble family, but his actions can hardly be called  noble. He is trying to sell and promote contraband goods. This  demoralizes the community. We are preparing to toughen the  rules for applying excise bands. This will be done not at  customs warehouses, where one has the chance of leaving transit  goods illegally in our country, but at the producer's place.  When goods are imported to Lithuania, it must be clear where  they will be sold. We will apply the same requirements to local  producers. For example, "Philip Morris" exports production and  does not pay us any taxes, but its products "settle down" here.  We must look for an antidote! True, those who do not pay taxes  are looking for an "antidote" against them.    [Grineviciute] What is a VAT antidote?    [Slezevicius] Such recommendations are not my function. Let  us not discuss issues that are not the matter of our discussion.  Laws are binding on everyone.    [Grineviciute] Will the increased rate of inflation due to  the VAT require an adjustment in the litas-dollar exchange rate?    [Slezevicius] The increased rate of inflation is estimated  at  10 percent. We hope to compensate it by raising people's wages  and pensions.    [Grineviciute] In this case, however, the fixed exchange  rate  will be unreal.    [Slezevicius] There is a lot of mismanagement in production.  The consumption of energy and resources is overly large, and  technologies are imperfect (therefore, production costs are so  high). The difference in the level of inflation should be  offset by increased effectiveness of production. These reserves  will last us for a long time, and we will not have to talk about  the devaluation of the litas.    [Grineviciute] Recently, the government cancelled the  payment  of debts and taxes for a number of state-run enterprises. How  long will our state budget be used for the artificial sustenance  of bankrupt enterprises and reduction of unemployment?    [Slezevicius] Those enterprises were not exempt from taxes.  We wanted to separate the moribund ones from those which have  some chances of survival. Taxes were cancelled for the Alytus  refrigerator plant, some electronic enterprises, the cotton  mill, and others. These are enterprises which will survive, and  they should not be placed in an awkward situation.    [Grineviciute] How should business, which cannot get loans  or  their guarantees, to say nothing of the cancellation of taxes,  survive under the conditions when government support is extended  only to state-run firms?    [Slezevicius] The shortage and costliness of credit  resources  is one of our key economic problems. The Currencies Council and  the Law on Commercial Banks should increase possibilities to  receive loans and reduce their prices. The government does not  distribute credits any longer. This is accomplished through  commercial banks. It is the latter that will decide to whom  credits should be extended.</p>

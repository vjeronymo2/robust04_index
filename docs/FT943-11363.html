			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong demand lifts Sapporo Beer Profits at Sapporo Beer, the Japanese brewer, rose sharply for the first six months to June due to a rise in demand and a decline in operational costs. Non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 41.2 per cent from a year earlier to Y6.9bn (Dollars 66.4m) on a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y267.4bn. After-tax profits rose 8.9 per cent to Y3.2bn. Sales of the company's mainstay beer rose 3 per cent to Y238.1bn, with sales volume increasing 1 per cent. Operating profits rose 51 per cent to Y11.2bn due to a Y5bn cut in material, distribution, and advertising costs. The company expects full-year pre-tax profits to rise 4 per cent to Y11.5bn on a 9 per cent increase in sales to Y620bn.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Policies 'promote business start-ups' BOTH THE UK and Germany have experienced substantial growth in self-employment but the increase has been most dynamic in the UK, according to a report from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society, a charitable group. In its report, the group, which seeks to promote closer understanding between the UK and Germany, compares the phenomenon of self-employment in both countries and examines common characteristics and differences. The report says the economic and policy climate in the UK promotes business start-ups, while the climate in Germany favours maintaining those who are already self-employed. The authors conclude that the increasing importance of self-employment in the labour market indicates a growing need for policymakers to understand the implications of self-employment for the labour market. The report says: 'These questions are particularly relevant within the context of the newly emerging market economies of eastern Europe - not least in the former German Democratic Republic - where the development of self-employment and entrepreneurship is frequently seen as a mechanism for stimulating the transition to a market economy and for absorbing some of the unemployment involved in such a transition.' The report says that before the 1980s, commentators on the labour market typically ignored self-employment as a transitory stage at best for emerging enterprises towards becoming fully fledged small businesses.

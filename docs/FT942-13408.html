			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Markets: Why the European Union will enlarge eastwards, slowly - Economic Eye At the Copenhagen summit in 1993, the European Council 'agreed that the associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union. Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required.' So will inclusion at least of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia (the Visegrad-4) and Slovenia have occurred by the end of the century? Probably not is the answer. Their membership is more likely to take two decades. The question is what to do in the meantime. This matters because the present higgledy-piggledy array of agreements with - and between - the countries of central and eastern Europe, shown in the chart, is quite unsatisfactory. These points are the heart of a splendid new book by Richard Baldwin, an American trade economist, now Professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.* In addition to a discussion of enlargement, however, the book contains an excellent survey of recent theory on the links between trade and economic activity and an analysis of the possible effects on European trade patterns of changes in central and eastern Europe. Under fairly conservative assumptions about economic growth, argues Prof Baldwin, the volume of exports from the present EU to central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union could grow at annual average rates of 10 per cent or more. Still more significant are the political benefits of integration: healing the post-war division of Europe, stabilising the politics of central and eastern Europe and embedding unified Germany more firmly. For all that, insists Prof Baldwin, full membership will not happen soon. 'The main difficulties,' he points out, 'concern EU agriculture and structural spending programmes, EU decision-making mechanisms, trade in sensitive products and migration'. In particular, the Visegrad-4, though among the most advanced economies in central and eastern Europe, are 'two and a half times more agricultural and less than one third as rich as the EU-12'. Prof Baldwin cites one study which concludes that adding only the Visegrad-4 to the common agricultural policy would double its budgetary cost. Since these countries would also be entitled to substantial sums from the EU's structural funds, Prof Baldwin finds that the net budget cost of this enlargement would be close to 70 per cent of the projected 1999 budget of the EU. Even on very optimistic assumptions about economic growth, it would take 10-15 years before entry of eastern countries might be neutral for the EU's budget. If present rules were followed, a move from the EU of 12 to one that included the EFTA applicants (less Norway), plus the Visegrad-4, would also raise the number of council votes from 76 to 109 and the blocking minority from 23 to 32. With all possible members, votes could increase to 134, with a blocking minority of 39. Meanwhile, the share in population of the four big countries would fall from 77 per cent to 56 per cent, but their share in the votes would decline from 53 to just 30 per cent. Not only would the weight of small countries be increased, so would the weight of poor countries with an interest in greater transfers. What is to be done? One option - desirable whatever is done with the leading candidates, given the large number that will remain outside for a long time  -would be to systematise and liberalise the association agreements. At present, these restrict the potential for trade among the countries of central and eastern Europe, which must encourage firms wishing to supply both these markets and the EU to locate within the latter. Prof Baldwin's suggestion is an Association of Association Agreements (AAA), the aim being to regionalise the trade and investment liberalisation in the Europe Agreements. A second option would be to make some of the countries of central and eastern Europe second class members of the EU, excluded from the CAP, structural spending programmes and labour mobility, too. But they would then probably have to be deprived of votes, since 'unpleasantness is unavoidable when second-class ticket holders have a say in what the first-class passengers are going to have for dinner'. They would instead become even less privileged than participants in the European Economic Area, whose current members are trying to join the EU. This creates a third option, which would be to offer more advanced eastern applicants membership of something similar to the EEA, probably without free labour mobility. Prof Baldwin calls for an Organisation for European Integration (OEI), largely to oversee inclusion of central and eastern European countries within the single market as they become ready. The AAA and OEI would make sense under almost any circumstances. But the whole problem could be greatly simplified by adopting a fourth option, one so radical that Prof Baldwin hardly dares mention it. Scrap the CAP; abandon the mistaken idea that poor countries need large transfers to catch up with richer ones and eliminate the overweighting of small countries in EU voting. Then the EU could be enlarged relatively expeditiously. It is all quite simple, really. *Richard Baldwin, Towards an Integrated Europe (London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, 1994).</p>

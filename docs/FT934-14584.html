			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sun Micro hits peak with Dollars 16.6m in first quarter SUN Microsystems reported record first-quarter revenues but the computer workstation manufacturer failed to live up to earnings expectations. Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 16.6m, or 16 cents a share, including a credit of about Dollars 6m from tax changes. This compares with net income of Dollars 4.8m, or 5 cents in the same period last year. Wall Street analysts had been projecting income of about 26 cents per share. Revenues rose 12 per cent to Dollars 960.5m from Dollars 855.9m in the first quarter of the last fiscal year. Strong growth in the US market as well as reduced costs helped to mitigate continued weakness in several European markets, said Mr Kevin Melia, Sun's chief financial officer. 'For the fourth consecutive quarter we have driven down our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues compared with the year-ago period,' said Mr Melia. 'For the second consecutive quarter this decrease in expenses more than offset the expected decline in the gross margin percentage, and enabled us to again grow operating income faster than revenues,' he said. Earlier this week, top executives at Sun took a self-imposed pay cut of about 30 per cent, saying that their compensation should be more closely linked to the company's performance through stock options. Sun's results were issued after the close of trading yesterday. On Wall Street, Sun shares closed at Dollars 23, up from Wednesday's Dollars 21 5/8.</p>

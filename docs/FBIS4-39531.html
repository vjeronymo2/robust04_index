			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "After Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel's visit to Moldova, the draft law on  spectral juridical status for the districts densely inhabited by  Gagauzians has not been changed," stated to BASA Victor  Greben-scicov, presidential counselor. According to him, the  Turkish president gave no directives to the Comrat leaders in  this regard. "The Comrat leaders had previously received several  foreign delegations at a quite high level which, in my opinion,  were useful for all sides," added Grebenscicov. He noted that  the Turkish president insisted on preservation of Moldova's  integrity. "I do not share the opinion of those who say that  the law on status for the districts densely inhabited by  Gagauzians would lead to Moldova's federalization," specified  Grebenscicov. He pointed out that the draft law supposes  decentralization. "This implies a broad autonomy and not a  republic," he said.</p>

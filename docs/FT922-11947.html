			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Keating and Suharto play down E Timor row AUSTRALIA and Indonesia yesterday signed three economic and political agreements and tried to play down a clash over East Timor. The agreements on fisheries, double taxation and extradition were signed on the second day of the visit to Indonesia by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister. They represented, Mr Keating said, evidence of Australia's determination to look towards Asia for its economic future. Both countries sought to defuse any 'misunderstanding' about statements by President Suharto at a banquet the previous night that Indonesia would not accept foreign interference in its domestic affairs. Earlier, at a meeting with Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, Mr Keating had suggested that East Timor, the former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976, should be given special territory status. He also expressed concern at the prosecution of East Timorese nationalists. Mr Alatas said yesterday that President Suharto's remarks had been misinterpreted. 'What he (President Suharto) was trying to say was, 'Don't misunderstand us. We do accept criticism, we do accept friendly advice.' Mr Keating told the Indonesian Foreign Policy Forum yesterday that said East Timor had received 'disproportionate attention'. 'Australia is actively and unequivocally committed to this region and to developing, in particular, a relationship with Indonesia,' he said. Officials from the two countries agreed, however, that their future relationship was unlikely to be smooth. Mr Alatas said: 'Let's face it. We have differences .. in the political system, economic system, differences in culture.' Pacific trade bloc, Page 8</p>

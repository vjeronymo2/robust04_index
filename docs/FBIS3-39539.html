The  project is valued at ECU12 million ($13.6 million) and over the  next three years will retrain 16,000 officers of the Russian  Army in various aspects of Western management and marketing.    Russian authorities officially requested assistance from the  European Commission to retrain military personnel in mid-1992.  According to figures presented to the Russian Government at the  time, the number of officers to be discharged from the Armed  Forces between 1992 and 1995 would number in the region of  50,000 annually. This does not include a total of over 30,000  men returning from Germany by 1994.    To help the officers adjust to civilian life, a  comprehensive  training project was developed following detailed consultations  with the Russian recipients. The principal aim of the project  is to upgrade the qualifications of teachers who will work in 15  training centers established in various regions. Four hundred  teachers will receive training in general management and  marketing, including principles of the market economy and modern  teaching methods. Of these, half will undergo additional  training in more specialized areas such as management as it is  applied to small and medium enterprises.    One of the most important aspects of the training is that  the  teachers should become self-sufficient in the development of  curricula to suit the needs of the local economies. Thirty-two  teachers will specialize in this field, while a similar number  will be trained as employment counselors.    The intention is that by the time the project nears  completion, the training centers will be able to retrain the  16,000 officers targeted by the projects. They should also be  able to provide training in areas which meet the developing  manpower needs existing in any particular region.    Russian bodies involved in the project include the state  committee of higher education and the Defense Ministry. The  consortium of European companies chosen to implement the project  is led by Elea-Olivetti, the Italian company's training branch,  and includes other firms from various EU countries, such as GOPA  [Company for Organization, Planning, and Education] for  (Germany), ISVOR (Italy) and SODETEG [Company of Technical  Studies and General Operations] (France).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 13 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Berov today  submitted in parliament the intentions of his cabinet till the  end of 1994 which are to be realized by a new government team.  The intentions, received at BTA, fall into three stages --  May-June, July-September and October-December. The prime  minister warned that the government would resign if parliament  fails to pass a package of important laws by the end of June.    The government will observe its agreements with the  international financial institutions on anti-inflation and  monetary restrictions but this would not suffice to create  conditions for economic recovery. That is why the government  intends to use market mechanisms in encouraging entrepreneurship  while a more active investment policy for encouraging individual  productions could be provided for in the draft budget for 1995.    According to the prime minister, the annual inflation in  1994  will be lower than that in 1993. Adhering to the principles set  forth in its programme declaration of December 30, 1992 (when it  was elected), the government will continue its strict  restrictive policy to curb inflation.    The measures which the government will take against  speculative pricing eating away the incomes of the population  will include confiscation of proven speculative profit in favour  of the national budget.    By the end of May the government shall adopt measures to  protect local producers against dumping imports from some  countries as well as a stand for its tariff negotiations with  Turkey, the United States, Canada and other countries.    By the end of June the government shall adopt a national  programme for combating crime which, however, will come into  force after the passing of a Judiciary Act. At the same time  the Council of Ministers will support temporary restoration of  capital punishment or its alternative.    The Council of Ministers will also move in parliament a  simplified design of a state coat of arms strictly conforming  with the respective text in the Constitution and without any  monarchist symbols.    Following the inflation processes, the government will  continue to implement its decrees on cost of living adjustments  concerning minimum wages, pensions, minimum incomes for public  relief and compensation of wage funds in enterprises of majority  state holding. The Council of Ministers will continue its  cooperation with its social partners in the Tripartite Council.    The negotiations with the European Union on the loan for  financing Bulgaria's balance of payments and with the World Bank  should be held by June 15. Together with the National Bank of  Bulgaria (BNB) the government shall draft the foreign debt deal  and a special unit shall be set up to manage the national debt.  Negotiations with the IMF on additional funding of the debt deal  are forthcoming.    By the end of May the Finance Ministry will establish strict  control over the worst loss-makers. It will introduce a system  sharply increasing the amount of collected budget revenues.    The Industry Ministry will adopt and assess the programmes  for financial rehabilitation and restructuring of state-owned  enterprises, after which they will be divided into three groups:  profitable units, loss-makers and enterprises which must be put  into liquidation. Thirty-four state-owned industrial  enterprises will be wound up.    By mid-June the cabinet will be approving the action plans  of  the largest enterprises, which cannot be privatized as yet, such  as the Neftokhim oil refinery, the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical  Works, Bulgargas, etc. The cabinet will require their  managements to make progress reports. Eleven enterprises  subordinated to the Council of Ministers are expected to be  privatized by the end of June.    By May 15 the minister of labour and social affairs will  have to submit to the cabinet a report on the goals of the  reform in social insurance. The Ministry of Labour and Social  Affairs will give priority to the drawing up of projects for  adjusting incomes to inflation.    The Transport Ministry will carry through a deal for the  privatization of the SO MAT international road haulier according  to a cabinet-approved scheme, and will continue work on the  privatization of 68 more transport enterprises and 12 units.  Talks will continue with potential investors in the  privatization of the national air carrier Balkan Airlines.  Projects will be drawn up for the border checkpoints in Vidin,  Ruse, Kulata and Gyueshevo, financed by the PHARE [Economic and  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and the  governments of the United States and Sweden. Tenders will be  organized for the construction of a tunnel under the Shipka  Peak, as well as for the development of the ports of Burgas (on  the Black Sea) and Ruse (on the Danube). Deals for the  privatization of nine enterprises are expected to be completed.  150 km of road will be renewed between July and September and  the construction of a railway link between Bulgaria and  Macedonia [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  will start.    The cabinet will propose to the parliamentary groups  supporting it to sign a framework agreement on the passage of  urgently needed legislation. The Council of Ministers will do  its best for parliament to pass, by the end of June, amendments  to the Privatization Act; a Scheme of Composition Act; a  Bankruptcy Act; to approve the final structure of the foreign  debt deal with a view to the ratification of the signed deal and  agreements on balance-of- payments financing and financing for  the foreign debt deal.    Unless this legislation passes by the fixed time limit, it  will be impossible for the government to carry on and it will  resign.    The government will seek to finalize agreements on  additional  financing for the foreign debt deal between July and September.  Budget utilization will be analyzed during this period and  amendments are to be expected while the parameters of the  projected budget deficit will remain unchanged, the document  says. Additional funds will be appropriated to certain  departments, giving priority to the army, should the collected  budget revenues allow this, Prof. Berov said.    A list of 500 enterprises due for mass privatization will be  published upon the passage of amendments to the Privatization  Act. Privatization vouchers will be printed by July 17, and  subscription for them will end on August 18, the cabinet says in  its programme.    Between July and September the Trade Ministry should carry  out its duties under the law on the settlement of non-performing  loans contracted by December 31, 1990. The Industry Ministry  should adopt a programme for company rehabilitation and  restructuring. During that period a second group of loss-making  state-owned enterprises will be proposed for liquidation.    The government will be implementing the land reform by a new  flexible system combining land lease and cooperatives in view of  the unwillingness of many owners to cultivate the land, the  document says. The government will seek ways to provide support  to part of the farmers from internal bank resources and from the  expected U.S. financing to the amount of $50 million. 60  percent of the land claimed by its owners has been returned in  real boundaries and through land distribution plans, the  document says. 300 more plans for the distribution of 430,000  hectares of land will be approved in the second quarter. Over  72 percent of the land will be returned to its owners by the  year's end, the document says.    The Health Ministry will have to carry through the  restructuring of the network of health care establishments.    The Defence Ministry is to put off until September personnel  and structural changes among senior officers in view of the  critical situation in the Balkans.    The government attaches great importance to the performance  of the Finance Ministry in the last quarter of 1994. It is  assigned to draft a 1995 agreement with the International  Monetary Fund.    The Privatization Agency is expected to conclude 70 deals  worth 5,000 million leva by the year's end.    Foreign investment to the amount of 2,700 million leva is  expected to be channeled into the country through joint ventures  subordinated to the Industry Ministry. Twenty-six privatization  deals are expected to yield some 400 million leva in proceeds.  If the Industry Ministry accomplishes its programme, industrial  output can be expected to rise 2-3 percentage points from 1993  at comparable prices.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) R&hyph;401C. R&hyph;401C, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioners. HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;124 contribute to ozone depletion. The production of HCFC&hyph;22 will be phased out according to the accelerated phaseout schedule. The GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 is somewhat higher than other alternatives for this end-use. Experimental data indicate that HCFC&hyph;22 may leak through flexible hosing in mobile air conditioners at a high rate. In order to preserve the blend's composition and to reduce its contribution to global warming, EPA strongly recommends using barrier hoses when hose assemblies need to be replaced during a retrofit procedure. The GWPs of the other components are low. Although this blend does contain one flammable constituent, the blend itself is not flammable. In addition, this blend is a near azeotrope, meaning it does not change composition during evaporation and compression. Finally, although testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (35) CFC&hyph;12 Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, New. (a) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new motor vehicle air conditioners. HFC&hyph;134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC&hyph;134a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, HFC&hyph;134a's contribution to global warming could be significant in leaky end-uses such as MVACS. EPA has determined that the use of HFC&hyph;134a in these applications is acceptable because industry continues to develop technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC&hyph;134a is not flammable and its toxicity is low. While HFC&hyph;134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used rather than mineral oils. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) R&hyph;401C.

Evaporative cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners using CFC&hyph;12. Evaporative cooling does not contribute to ozone depletion or global warming and has the potential to be more energy efficient than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Evaporative cooling uses no chemicals, but relies instead on water evaporation as a means of cooling. It is in widespread use in transit buses in the western U.S. Recent design improvements have greatly expanded its applicability to other regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cooling. CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cooling systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners using CFC&hyph;12. CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  systems for motor vehicle air conditioning are currently under development. EPA believes that with continued development, such systems could be available within 5 years, and thus they are potentially available substitutes. CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was historically used in refrigeration systems. It is a well-known, nontoxic, nonflammable gas. Its GWP is defined as 1, and all other GWPs are indexed to it. Since it is readily available as a waste gas, no additional chemical will need to be produced. Thus, the use of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a refrigerant will not contribute to global warming. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to motor vehicle air conditioners using CFC&hyph;12. A full scale Stirling cycle motor vehicle air conditioning system has been built. Further development is necessary to facilitate practical implementation. For further information see the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (36) Heat transfer. Although EPA did not originally intend to review this end-use, the Agency reconsidered after reexamining the potential size of annual sales of substitutes. Thus, EPA is currently reviewing submissions for the use of PFCs in heat transfer systems. EPA anticipates including its final determination in the first SNAP update. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Unacceptable substitutes. (1) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b/CFC&hyph;12 blend.

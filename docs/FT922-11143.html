			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / G7 places onus of improved world growth on Japan JAPAN rather than Germany has become the focus of efforts by other industrial countries to boost world growth, it emerged at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington. Japanese objections to pressure from the US and others for easier Japanese fiscal policy and lower interest rates delayed the end of the meeting on Sunday by about two hours as Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, and Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, fought to keep hostile language out of the communique. As is usual when the G7 has differed over policy, the finance ministers of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada summed up their talks in an elliptical text. In the latest case they omitted to mention member countries by name when outlining desirable policies. The only country for which the G7 proposed particular policy moves was Russia, which was given detailed instructions on how to reform its economy in a separate statement issued after the 11-hour meeting. Reading between the lines of the G7 economic communique, it was clear that Japan's partners thought Tokyo should do more to boost world growth. They noted that 'the decline of the yen since their last meeting (in January) was not contributing to the adjustment process'. In an obvious reference to Japanese fiscal policy, they said policy makers in 'countries with large surpluses and declining growth. . . should be mindful of the possibilities of strengthening domestic demand'. This advice fell on unreceptive ears, however. Mr Hata said 'additional Japanese measures are not necessary at this juncture and if anything they would become harmful' by fostering inflationary pressures. Mr Mieno said there was no need for Japan to ease credit. After publicly trading complaints about each other's fiscal policies in the days ahead of the meeting, there was surprisingly little squabbling between Germany and the US in the talks. 'We did not feel under attack or on the defensive,' said a beaming Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, after the meeting. To some extent, the arguments about Germany's high fiscal deficits had been fully rehearsed ahead of the meeting. In addition, some participants felt it was 'bad form' to attack Germany when the government was accepting strike action as the price for resisting high public-sector pay claims. Mr Waigel also has made clear that Germany will clamp down on public spending in the years ahead. When asked whether Germany would accelerate its fiscal policy actions, Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, said: 'I think that they have. . . They have announced policies that do just that.' A renewed emphasis on the need for governments to reduce their fiscal deficits was one of the main elements of Sunday's G7 communique. The ministers said it was important 'to reduce government demands on private savings to facilitate needed capital spending'. They underlined 'the need to reduce fiscal deficits in all countries with large budgetary imbalances through credible medium-term consolidation strategies'. In a sentence that applied respectively to the US and Germany, they said deficit reduction was 'important both for countries with long-lasting fiscal imbalances and for countries experiencing exceptional adjustment challenges'. In an obvious reference to Germany, they said: 'Those countries with large fiscal deficits, relatively high inflation, excessive wage developments and tight monetary policy should follow a balanced policy approach to facilitate improved growth.' None of the past week's suggestions from the US and International Monetary Fund that Germany should accelerate fiscal consolidation survived in the G7 text. In a passage that could apply to the UK, the US or Italy, ministers said: 'Certain other countries with large deficits that have experienced weak growth should avoid actions that would jeopardise medium-term efforts to consolidate budget positions.' Using words that could apply to France, the G7 said 'appropriate measures should be pursued to enhance medium-term growth prospects while maintaining public expenditures under control' in countries where fiscal balances have been contained and recession avoided. Correct fiscal policies were cited together with control of inflation and a successful curbing of wage pressures as necessary for lower interest rates. The G7 held back from telling any central bank to alter its monetary policy, however. The final text also registered a slight increase in G7 optimism about global economic growth prospects. After their previous meeting in Garden City, Long Island, the G7 ministers had put their concern that economic activity had weakened higher up in the final text than a list of those factors that would foster world economic growth. This time the order was reversed. The ministers 'noted that additional signs of recovery had emerged in some of their countries'. However, they were still 'concerned that aggregate G7 economic activity this year would be below potential and growth would be inadequate to achieve a reduction in unemployment'. On leaving the meeting, ministers insisted that Sunday's talks built on an existing strategy for strengthening the world economy. 'We re-asserted the positions that we took back in January where there would be concerted and positive action taken on the part of all the member countries to promote growth,' Mr Mazankowski said. However, it remains to be seen how far these words will be translated into more growth in the world economy.</p>

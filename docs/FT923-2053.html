			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Papers leak 'could have damaged BCCI probe' THE SERIOUS Fraud Office's investigation into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International could have been gravely damaged by the leaking of confidential documents to a suspect's solicitor, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Chris Dickson, an SFO assistant director in overall charge of the BCCI inquiry, told the court evidence might have been destroyed, witnesses interfered with and the SFO's reputation with the US Justice Department and the Bank of England damaged. Mr Mark Braley, a former Coopers and Lybrand accountant seconded to the SFO for the inquiry, and Mr Bernard Lynch, a freelance accountant, both deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The prosecution alleges the two men plotted to supply confidential information from the inquiry to Mr Michael Barrett, a solicitor acting for Mr Syed Akbar, the former head of BCCI's treasury division. Mr Barrett notified police of the plan. Mr Akbar, now living in France, is under arrest and the subject of extradition proceedings in both the UK and the US. Mr Dickson, a prosecution witness, said the documents would have disclosed the extent of the SFO's knowledge and the lines of its inquiries. 'The fraud involving the treasury division alone was a massive fraud,' he said. Possible targets of the SFO inquiry might have destroyed evidence and left the UK, he said. Information-sharing with the US authorities could have been hampered and the Bank of England may have been concerned about the SFO's ability to look after sensitive documents. Publication of the documents would also have hindered attempts to persuade people in the Middle East to co-operate with the SFO, he said. The trial continues.</p>

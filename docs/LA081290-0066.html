			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WRITER BORED WITH HIS WRITING;  </P> <P> THE FOLKS THAT LIVE ON THE HILL BY KINGSLEY AMIS (SUMMIT BOOKS: $18.95; 246  PP.;0-671-70816-3)  </P> <P> Each new novel by Kingsley Amis -- and this must be at least his 20th --  generates an automatic shock wave among outraged leftists, a predictable round  of ovations from conservatives and their fellow-travelers, and murmurs of  grudging respect from brow-beaten soi-disant liberals whose literary standards  are evidently so debased that Amis' bumbling, heavy-handed ironies look like  rapier thrusts of wit to them.  </P> <P> To leftists (and, more recently, to feminists), Amis' curmudgeonly, xenophobic,  homophobic, misogynistic views are simply anathema. Cultural and political  conservatives either agree openly with these attitudes or take the more  discreet tack of commending Amis for his refreshing ability to cut through  "cant" (cant, as used by this persuasion, invariably means left-wing -- as  distinguished from right-wing -- twaddle). One feels sorriest in all this for  the befuddled middle-of-the-road reviewers, who feel vaguely uncomfortable  about Amis' attitudes, but constrained to admit that he is a very good writer  all the same, a great wit, an elegant stylist, and a scathing critic of modern  mores.  </P> <P> Precisely how Amis has achieved his current reputation as a writer to be  reckoned with is an intriguing subject it would take too long to tackle within  the limited scope of a book review. Some day, perhaps, someone will undertake a  serious re-evaluation of his whole novelistic career, from "Lucky Jim" (1954)  on, and find him, I would suspect, one of the most overrated writers of the  postwar period. But this is a task that requires more fortitude and stamina and  greater tolerance for undiluted tedium than this reviewer had left by the time  she had dragged herself through the final pages of this not-very-long but quite  interminable-seeming book.  </P> <P> "The Folks That Live on the Hill" introduces us to the little world of Harry  Caldecote, a retired librarian, who lives in the "Shepherd's Hill" section of  London. Harry is surrounded by a cast of distantly related misfits who serve as  outlets for his patronizing concern and barn-door-sized targets for Amis'  shafts of thick-skulled wit.  </P> <P> Harry lives with his sister Clare, a sensible, understanding woman who puts up  with him as neither of his ex-wives has been able to do. Clare is intended as  an exemplary woman: Even when she permits herself to tell Harry the occasional  home-truth, she still defers to him, as his wives did not.  </P> <P> Harry's brother Freddie is a pathetic, watered-down version of Harry, wedded to  an oppressively devoted woman called Desiree. Shielding Freddie from Desiree's  constant attentions is one of Harry's helpful hobbies. Harry has a  ne'er-do-well son called Piers, who's always extracting money from friends and  relatives. And, though his wives have abandoned him, his first wife's niece  Fiona, an alcoholic nymphomaniac, is on hand, in dire need of continual rescue,  and his second wife's daughter Bunty also is around to provide a certain amount  of drama as her ex-husband Desmond and current lesbian lover Popsy vie for her  favor.  </P> <P> Feminists may breathe a sigh of relief, if they like. The dreadful Desiree is  shown to have at least a tiny glimmer of decency in her concern for Freddie;  and although Popsy is a nasty caricature of a "butch" lesbian, Amis -- and  Harry -- view Bunty's lesbianism as an acceptable life style. What's truly  repellent about this novel is not so much its political outlook as its sheer  insufferability as a piece of fiction.  </P> <P> Plowing through pages of sloppily written prose, the reader will search in vain  for any trace of the much-vaunted style that supposedly compensates for the  disagreeable subject matter. A random sampling yields passages such as this:  </P> <P> "He had remembered as a boy reading in an encyclopedia where it had said that  for every word in the Bible a million other words had been written on the  subject -- on that of the Bible as a whole or in some part, presumably, rather  than on each successive word of its text. A tough one to shoot down, had been  an early thought of his on the point, followed not so many years later by a  supplementary to the effect that in the human or material sphere the nearest  comparable disparity was between the number of words that women said and the  number that would have to have been said about what they had said in order to  produce a full or clear or straight account of any matter."  </P> <P> The sheer dead weight of verbiage in these two sentences is symptomatic of  padding on a much larger scale. The story line is nothing more than a series of  set-piece scenes in which Harry and/or his sister Clare cope with the  predictable nuisances in their lives.  </P> <P> The gallery of lovable and not-so-lovable misfit relatives is a lifeless  collection of characters without character. The humor, mostly at the expense of  "pretension" (which for Mr. Amis means preferring pate to Bovril),consists of  limp squibs delivered in a relentlessly jaunty manner best described as a kind  of petit bourgeois aping of aristocratic complacency.  </P> <P> A key to what's wrong with this novel is, ironically enough, presented in a  scene in which the alcoholic Fiona tells of how she tried to write a story  called "Getting Nowhere," only to find that there was nothing she had to say:  "Not nearly enough for a book, unless you filled it up with all falling  downstairs and stealing and getting arrested. Padding," she muses -- an all-too  apt description of the novel in which she finds herself.  </P> <P> One has the dismaying sense as one reads that there's no point at all to this  novel; it is merely another piece of hack work churned out on the assembly line  of one of Britain's last exporting cottage industries. Harry's brother Freddie  recalls a sad admission made decades ago by their father when he was still  alive: It was not that the book he was reading was boring -- he had become, he  admitted, a bore himself. But the writer bored with his writing is even more  likely to produce a boring book than the reader bored with his reading.  Kingsley Amis is, quite evidently, a bored writer.  </P></p>

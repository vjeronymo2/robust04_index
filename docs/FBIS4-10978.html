			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report for PRENSA LATINA by Tomas A. Granados </F> -- "Hemispheric Summit: Now it is Clinton's Turn"]    [Text] [no dateline as received] U.S. President Bill  Clinton hopes to meet with hemispheric leaders in Miami at the  end of the year to discuss profiles of what the White House  defines as "a new era in Inter-American Relations."    In the 1960's, President John F. Kennedy implemented his  Alliance for Progress. George Bush tried to do something  similar with his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. Now it  is Clinton's turn.    "We want to consider two broad issues: The first is how to  strengthen our democracies, defend them collectively, and  improve our administration. The second is how to promote  economic growth while maintaining a sustained development  strategy that protects the environment and reduces poverty,"  Clinton said during the formal announcement of the summit during  a brief ceremony on 11 March at the White House.    From his offices in Boston, Henry Raymont, a U.S. expert on  Latin American affairs, said that the scheduled Miami summit  could help bury old doctrines of open intervention and  interference applied by Washington to defend its interests in  the region.    Times have changed and now President Clinton is preparing to  defend those same interests with new political practices that  will secure Latin American and Caribbean cooperation within the  framework of a hemispheric initiative based on strengthening  democracy, hemispheric security, good government, and economic  development.    Nevertheless, Cold War prejudices linger on. In distributing  invitations to governments approved by Washington as democratic,  the Clinton administration left Cuba out because of its old  ideological differences with Havana authorities.    "If Cuba is ignored, the meeting's meaning could be  questioned," said Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat from  New York and a leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.    "The U.S. Government talks about holding a summit with the  leaders of all the democracies in the Americas. I ask myself:  What is true democracy... I think that the best way to have a  dialogue in this part of the world is to include everyone,  regardless of their philosophy of government," he added.    According to the Clinton administration, Miami was chosen to  host this summit because of the city's dynamic interaction with  Latin America and the Caribbean. But there could be another  reason.    One reason is that many of the governments invited to this  meeting have normal relations with Havana and do not agree with  the U.S. policy of maintaining the economic blockade on Cuba.    Washington knows this, and maybe that is why the meeting  will  be in Miami, the stronghold of radical Cuban immigrant groups.  These are the same groups that insulted the famous Mexican  actress Veronica Castro for traveling to Havana, impeded the  election of Mario Baeza as under secretary of state for  Hemispheric affairs, and, more recently, threatened to boycott  Colombian products if Bogota dares sell petroleum to Cuba.    It appears that Washington chose Miami as the ideal place so  that anyone interested in avoiding a conflict with that  influential radical sector will not even think of mentioning a  lifting of the Cuban blockade, much less suggesting the need for  a negotiated solution of differences between Washington and  Havana.    Contrary to previous meetings of U.S. presidents with their  colleagues in the hemisphere, such as the one in Panama in 1956  and in Punta del Este, Uruguay in 1967, Clinton has preferred to  hold this summit outside OAS auspices as if he were trying to  avoid similarities.    The idea of a hemispheric summit received a definite boost  at  the end of January when Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of  state for inter-American affairs, returned to Washington after a  visit to Peru with the opinion that "everything is going very  well in Latin America and the Caribbean.    Governments in the region had responded not just "well" but  "very well" to the three basic objectives of U.S. foreign  policy; that is; national security, economic growth, and the  expansion of democracy throughout the world.    This positive response has promoted the so-called theory on  "Hemispheric Convergence," explained by Michael Skol, Watson's  assistant at the State Department, on 23 February during a  conference in Miami.    In his speech, Skol did not supply enough data to indicate  whether the national interests of Latin American and Caribbean  countries were included in this convergence. To avoid mistrust  in the region, he assured that Washington now intends to  establish "a relationship in which consultations and reciprocity  are stressed rather than unilateral action."    Watson, in one of his recent appearances before the House of  Representatives subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs,  explained the idea even further when referring to the White  House's intention to create "a new hemispheric association."  Watson said that the Clinton administration intends to outline  at the Miami summit the future course of what he labelled a  "Convergence of Interests."    In Washington's opinion, one of the characteristics that  should be included in that convergence refers to "the collective  defense of democracy" in the region. A State Department  official in Washington explained that this does not mean the  creation of blocs against a foreign enemy.    "What the (Clinton) administration proposes is a society for  peace that will contribute to the solution of border problems,  cooperation during catastrophes, and, above all, cooperation in  the fight against drugs," the official said under the condition  that he remain anonymous.    These issues were discussed at the OAS conference on  hemispheric security in March in Buenos Aires. A consensus on  the issue is expected when the summit is held.    For the time being, there are proposals for the OAS to have  its own version of the UN "blue helmets" in a new world where  worrisome theories of "humanitarian intervention" and "limited  sovereignty" circulate.    According to Assistant Secretary Watson, "the waters are not  completely calm" in Latin America and the Caribbean. He said,  however, that the fault lies in poverty and in the inefficiency  of some governments.    According to SELA [Latin American Economic System] and ECLAC  [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean], by  the year 2000, 200-270 million people in Latin America will be  poverty stricken, and at least $200 billion will be needed to  fight poverty. That is almost half of the foreign debt still  being paid.    One of the great expectations opened by the proclaimed  hemispheric summit is the possibility of gradual incorporation  into NAFTA, formed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico.    It remains to be seen how the majority of the region's  countries, with their vulnerable economies, lack of advanced  technology, and incompetent productive organization can maintain  fraternal coexistence with the U.S. industrial power.    Maybe he is not being cynical at all, but Skol has invited  the Latin America and Caribbean nations -- the majority of which  are adversely affected by social despair, the effect of  neoliberal policies -- to take advantage of the opportunity to  "become, together with the United States, First World nations."    For the time being, the foreign ministers of the 13 member  nations of the Rio Group have already begun consultations with  other regional associations, which Washington labels of a  protectionist character, to voice a conceptual consensus on  America's role in the new international system being outlined.    Among Washington's Latin American diplomatic circles, there  is the feeling that Clinton's summit could be an opportunity to  achieve better understanding between their countries and the  United States.    Vice President Gore announced at the end of 1993 the  intention to hold a hemispheric summit, and some believe he  insinuated that Latin America will have to leave some of its  aspirations behind. Gore made the announcement during a visit  to Mexico, the site of the first Ibero-American summit that  brought the nations of the region together without a U.S.  presence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- A South-North Korean  summit is likely to be held in the near future as South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam accepted North Korean President Kim  Il-song's proposal to that effect.    Kim Il-song conveyed his willingness to meet Kim Yong-sam in  the not-too-distant future without any conditions through former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived in Seoul Saturday after  a four- day visit to Pyongyang.    Presidential press secretary Chu Ton-sik said that President  Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to "meet  President Kim Yong-sam at any time, anywhere without conditions  at an early date," told Carter that he would accept the offer  "without any hesitation."    Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message while briefing  the South Korean president on the results of his visit to  Pyongyang.    As to Kim Il-song's suggestion that "the earlier the summit  came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam expressed his assent,  saying, "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit would  be better the earlier it came." Kim asked Carter to convey his  position to Kim Il-song, Chu said.    Barring any unexpected developments, a South-North summit is  likely to occur in the near future for the first time in the  half-century of national division, now that the two top leaders  have said they were willing to hold an "unconditional summit  meeting at any time and at any place."    The meeting could take place either in Seoul, Pyongyang or  at  a third location.    Once a summit was materialized, the nuclear and other major  issues pending between the two sides could be discussed and  epochal momentum provided to progress in South-North relations.    South and North Korea are expected to have working-level  contacts soon to discuss details related to a summit meeting.    "There will be working-level contacts as President Kim  Yong-sam has given an express reply to President Kim Il-song's  proposal by saying he would meet the Northern leader at any time  and at any place," spokesman Chu said.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Profits at Lafarge Coppee tumble 44% to FFr1.2bn LAFARGE Coppee, the world's leading construction materials group, yesterday announced a 44 per cent decline in annual profits, its first downturn for eight years. Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, attributed the setback to the deep recession in the US construction industry, competition from allegedly dumped imports into Spain, and a collapse in plasterboard prices across Europe. Group net profits fell from FFr2.19bn (Dollars 390m) in 1990 to FFr1.23bn, on turnover down by 2.7 per cent to FFr31.6bn. Adjusting for exchange-rate changes and acquisitions, sales fell by an underlying 4.6 per cent, said Mr Collomb. 'Clearly, it has been a bad year,' he said. The chances of a recovery this year depended on a pick-up in the US and Canada, where Lafarge lost the equivalent of FFr650m last year. Mr Collomb believed the US market touched bottom last year, with a 9 per cent decline in sales. However, Lafarge's order books there had not yet shown any real sign of a pick-up. Spain added a FFr240m loss, where prices have been hit by cut-price imports from Romania, Turkey and Tunisia, currently the subject of a European Commission anti-dumping investigation. Meanwhile, Lafarge's plasterboard division, which accounts for 8 per cent of group sales, lost FFr210m because of fierce price competition with Britain's BPB Industries - the European market leader  - and Knauf of Germany. The trio hold more than 90 per cent of European plasterboard sales. Mr Collomb estimated that French plasterboard prices fell 28 per cent last year, and that the European plasterboard industry had around 20 per cent overcapacity, the equivalent of four or five years' growth. Lafarge Coppee would continue to defend its 25 per cent market share and believed that prices could recover this year. However, sales and profits held up well in French and Moroccan cement sales, new materials - Lafarge's fastest growing business  - and biochemicals. The group continued with acquisitions, spending FFr1.9bn on eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and south-east Asia. This left debts slightly up, at FFr9.1bn, where they represented 37 per cent of shareholders' funds by the end of year, against 33 per cent. Gearing was 'reasonable and prudent' and Lafarge planned to keep it at around that level for the foreseeable future.</p>

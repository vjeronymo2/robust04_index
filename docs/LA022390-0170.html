			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SIHANOUK RETURNS TO CAMBODIA  </P> <P> Cambodian guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk returned today to live in  his former kingdom for the first time in 10 years, taking up residence in a  jungle clearing near the border.  </P> <P> Speaking in a small jungle glade that he said is on Cambodian soil, Sihanouk  described his presence as a spur to his fighters to overrun provinces held by  the Vietnamese-backed government.  </P> <P> "I am 68 years old," he said. "I fear I could die on foreign soil, like in  China or North Korea or France. But I want to have the possibility to die here  on Khmer soil and for my army to see that their father is with them."  </P></p>

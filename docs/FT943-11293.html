			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Books: A dip into the well of Tory inspiration - Patience is needed to draw on the true values of life THE TORY VIEW OF LANDSCAPE by Nigel Everett Yale University Press Pounds 35, 248 pages I am a real Tory. I was brought up on Henty, John Buchan and Jane's Fighting Ships. I believe, not assertively but in a relaxed and natural way that my country is the best, the most congenial place to live, the land whose preservation is worth any sacrifice. This attitude, and the sense of decorum that goes with it, was devastated by the Great War. It survived into the 1930s (when at the age of six I read my first 'book' - in popular parlance the term now denotes a soft-bound comic - King Solomon's Mines) only in reflex, and was all but demolished by the great Labour landslide of 1945. The Conservative Party did not just 'adapt'; it changed practically everything except its name. Through Macmillan's soft-optioneering, Heath's balance-sheet corporatism to Thatcher's 'market' brutality. So what are we? We can always buy an 'image', I suppose, from a good PR firm. And keep them on a retainer to tune and burnish it. But with loss of identity comes loss of confidence, then loss of nerve (and if you do not believe this just watch what happens to the Labour Party over the next couple of years). Yet now a wonderful book has appeared, which illuminates our Party from an unusual angle. There is barely one word of politics in the text - but the combination of history, aesthetics and scholarship provide a deep well from which real Tories can draw inspiration. The essential theme is a recurrent one. With England seen as a noble estate, and the landed interest in general as its ancient defenders, the image of a country house amid old plantations and well managed farms easily comes to convey a wide range of sentimental and political meaning. It seems to represent the real England, besieged by ugly, alien and inhuman forces of change. The traditional country house can be portrayed as an ancient centre of order, cultivation and disinterestedness. Nigel Everett illustrates this thesis by drawing on the writings - fiction as well as records and surveys - of successive periods as well as the art, the paintings, the architecture and the gardens. He never proselytises. Indeed, it is not always certain which 'side' he is on. All the better. The reader has to think, make his own judgments, which in the very nature of things, alter as the evidence accumulates. There is a permanent tension, between the ancient traditions and their benign stability, and the ever present threat of degradation. Human greed, 'short-termism', the strong exploiting the weak beyond endurance, are pollutants every bit as damaging as an overdose of nitrates. Take this verity: 'Old England - slow, dignified, shaded, and beautiful with the public wandering freely through a variety of landscapes - has given way to the modern world of assertive privacy, ugliness and tension'. How true this is of practically anywhere in the south-east today. 'Modern World'? You mean nose-to-tail traffic, Wimpy bars, police sirens, ghetto-blasters, farm shops selling 'early' potatoes flown in from Cyprus? Well, no. This passage is a commentary on Humphrey Repton's illustrated notebook, published in 1792, when we were congratulating ourselves that the social harmony of our own kingdom was preserving us from the horrors of the jacquerie. And there are other precursors. Here is Adam Smith (but I doubt if the wording is either familiar or congenial to the existing membership of that 'institute' which bears his name): 'A profitable speculation is presented as a public good because growth will stimulate demand, and everywhere diffuse comfort and improvement. No patriot or man of feeling could therefore oppose it (But) the nature of this growth, in opposition, for example to older ideas such as cultivation, is that it is at once undirected and infinitely self-generating in the endless demand for all the useless things in the world . . .' As early as 1830 Cobbett was remarking that the (peasant) labourer was ' . . . more comfortable where there are woods, forests and wild places, hedges commons and grassy lanes. His situation is at its worst where there are areas of high fertility devoted almost entirely to corn'. There are dark passages, it is true, in the history of Conservative magistracy. And none more terrible than the Highland clearances whose evidence in Sutherland, even to this day, can be seen in the pleasing homesteads, idyllically situated at the water's edge, burned by fire often started when the crofters' families were still inside, by the Dukes' militia. But in the main our country was uniquely favoured in the temperate nature of its climate, its constitution, its manners, and its agriculturally based wealth. Comfort coincided with virtue, beauty, liberty, and easy social relations. Tories (real Tories) can still draw encouragement from this. It remains a basic truth, deeply implanted in the subconscious of very many of our people. But if we are to draw full advantage therefrom we do need at times great patience - mirroring that of Nature herself.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: GEC A profits warning is hardly the ideal end to the good run which GEC's shares have enjoyed over the past year. Some of the mix of reasons offered are perhaps understandable - particularly poor conditions in the cables market and difficulties with customised chips. Others, such as cost overruns on development projects, are hardly the kind of problem normally associated with Lord Weinstock. Still, in the longer term there are grounds for optimism. With projects like the European Fighter Aircraft in development, defence margins are being squeezed now but may recover, despite shorter production runs and potential postponements. In power systems, technology may also allow contracts to be won at higher margins than in the past, particularly with strong worldwide demand for gas turbines and fast trains. The UK government's oft-repeated assertion that it wants private help with infrastructure projects may also finally start to move now that Sir Alastair Morton is starting to shove. Since GEC seems keen to use part of its cash, projects like the Channel tunnel rail link might well be attractive. Forming a structure which would encourage the company to fund the refurbishment of the West Coast main line might be harder, even if an order for GEC Alsthom trains were to follow. Meanwhile, steering the company through the world recession towards such prospects is a task equal to the management's traditional talents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Large-scale highway  construction has benefitted economic development in China's  land-locked Qinghai Province.    Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in northwest China,  Qinghai has 85 percent of its land at over 3,000 m above the sea  level. In the past the local economy was greatly retarded by  its backward transportation facilities.    With the help of the state, the province has worked out a  development strategy based on the construction of more highways.    In recent years it has built and improved several trunk  highway lines, including those from Xining to Zhangye, Qinghai  to Xinjiang, Liuyuan to Golmud, Qinghai to Tibet and Wutongling  to Henan county.    More than one billion yuan has been invested in highway  construction to add over 2,000 km of road in the province since  1985.    Between 1991 and 1993 the province built or improved over  1,000 km of highways, and 21 big and medium-sized bridges.    Now, some 97 percent of the townships in Qinghai have access  to highway transportation.    The total length of highways in the province is now 16,732  km.    The highways help the province in commodity exchange, by  carrying local products such as potash fertilizer, salt,  asbestos, oil, ferrosilicon, meat, wool and leather to the  outside, and bring in grain, vegetable, fruit and machinery.</p>

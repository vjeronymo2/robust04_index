			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY ADD TO THE HOUSING SHORTAGE?  </P> <P> Eighteen months ago the Los Angeles City Council, confronted with a rising  problem of abandoned homes serving as crack houses, passed an ordinance  allowing the city to demolish uninhabitable properties without delay. That  prompted Mayor Bradley to launch Operation Knockdown, which took dead aim at  derelict buildings that served as havens for drug users and street gangs. While  the goal of the program -- to rid orderly neighborhoods of dangerous  nuisances-was well-intentioned, the policy has been applied too broadly.  </P> <P> During the last year, according to Times writer Jill Stewart, Operation  Knockdown has resulted, directly or indirectly, in the loss of more than 215  houses. More than 50 houses, primarily in the poor neighborhoods of  South-Central Los Angeles, were bulldozed by the city. And more than 150 houses  were leveled with the consent of the owners, who, lacking either the will or  the money to make substantial repairs, paid for the demolition to get rid of  their problem.  </P> <P> Despite all the good intentions, this scorched-earth policy comes at the wrong  time. The region faces a severe housing crisis. Public policy should encourage  housing preservation, not demolition.  </P> <P> Demolition is warranted only in extreme situations. The ordinance targets crack  houses, but the city is also bulldozing ramshackle, unsecured and rat-infested  houses in need of major repair. Some of that housing -- including abandoned  houses where homeless people congregate -- should be salvaged.  </P> <P> In response to The Times article, Mayor Bradley, in a letter to the editor  published today, has instructed the Department of Building and Safety to "take  extra steps" to make absolutely certain that any candidate for demolition is  utterly and hopelessly beyond repair. He has also directed the city to provide  information on housing rehabilitation grants to owners who want to save their  houses. And the mayor has instructed the city's new housing coordinator,  Michael Bodaken, to conduct a complete review of Operation Knockdown, as well  as to make new proposals for constructing affordable housing on city-owned  vacant lots.  </P> <P> The mayor's moves are most welcome. So would be a temporary halt to all  bulldozing. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has proposed one for 60 days. Good idea.  A moratorium would give the city time to come up with some answers to such  questions as: What is the impact of Operation Knockdown on affordable housing  and homelessness? What are the alternatives? Housing should be torn down only  as a last resort.  </P></p>

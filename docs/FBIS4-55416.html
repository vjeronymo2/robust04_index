			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bernard Estrade] </F>   [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 15 (AFP) -- The main  hotel in the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla was hit late Sunday  by a large-caliber artillery shell fired from Serb positions,  but there were no casualties. The shell hit the Hotel Tuzla at  10:15 p.m. (2015 GMT), heavily damaging a room on the building's  fourth floor and part of the third floor. Two other shells  landed near the hotel. An expert from the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR), inspecting the damage, told AFP the 122mm howitzer  shell had been fired from Serb positions in the south-east.    The area around Tuzla, a mainly Moslem enclave in  northeastern Bosnia, has been the scene of heavy fighting in  recent days. The hotel, which is housing foreign journalists  covering the fighting, lies right next to the headquarters of  the Moslem-dominated Bosnian Government Army's Second Corps in  charge of operations in the sector. The hotel was also occupied  by visiting men's and women's basketball teams, in town to  dispute the Bosnia Cup despite the fighting.    The army headquarters had been the scene Sunday afternoon of  a special ceremony in which the corp's commander-in-chief, Hazim  Cadic, distributed diplomas to local "patriotic personalities"  to commemorate the May 15 start of hostilities in Tuzla two  years ago. Firing began right after local television broadcast  the ceremony, and one shell landed near the television offices.    Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have been accusing each other of  preparing large-scale offensives with massive reinforcements in  this strategic area. On Wednesday, shelling killed two people  and seriously wounded four in the old sector of the town, not  far from the hotel. The UN Protection Force spokesman for the  northeast sector of the Bosnian conflict, Captain Jens Kirk,  told AFP here earlier Sunday that 196 shells hit the nearby  Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian  Government Army, on Saturday and a further eight shells were  fired on the town early Sunday.    Vares lies aboud 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla and  straddles a maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo  and the Dalmatian coast. A further 100 shells rained down  Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of Tuzla, and a UN armoured  patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms fire on both  Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said. Bosnian Government forces  managed over the weekend to take control of Serb positions at  Vijenac Hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla.    Bosnian Colonel Ekrem Advic, head of the press service of  the  Bosnian Army's Second Corps, told AFP "some of the shells  hitting our villages and Tuzla had been fired" from those  positions. The capture by the Bosnian Army of "some 10 square  kilometres" (four square miles) of land in the sector was  confirmed by sources close to UNPROFOR, who linked the Bosnian  offensive and the shelling of Tuzla Wednesday.</p>

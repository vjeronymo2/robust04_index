			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers seek protection against Canadian pasta wheat THE INTERNATIONAL grain subsidy war has taken a strange twist with US farmers pressing for action against Canada's fast-rising share of the US domestic market for durum wheat. Several US senators have threatened retaliatory action against Canada after a bilateral panel set up under the 1989 free trade agreement ruled this week that pricing methods used by the Canadian Wheat Board were acceptable pending review by an independent auditor. Senator Max Baucus of Montana has introduced a Bill that would give Washington authority to impose special tariffs on Canadian wheat and require extra paperwork from importers. US imports of durum from Canada soared to 225,000 tonnes in the final four months of last year, making it Canada's second biggest customer after India. Canada exported virtually no durum, which is used mainly for pasta, to the US before 1990; now it has about a quarter of the market. The cut-throat price war in offshore markets has made the unsubsidised US domestic market one of the most lucrative for Canadian exporters. For example, Washington last year provided a USDollars 40 per tonne bonus under its Export Enhancement Program for a shipment to Algeria, which has traditionally been among Canada's biggest durum customers. The Algerians paid about Dollars 110 per tonne fob, compared with the US domestic price of Dollars 150. A Canadian Wheat Board spokesman yesterday ascribed Canada's success in the US market largely to 'a very good quality product, which mills consistently from shipment to shipment.' In addition, pasta's fast-growing popularity has raised per-capita consumption. The free-trade panel urged the creation of a joint working group to oversee regular audits of Canadian durum shipments to the US.</p>

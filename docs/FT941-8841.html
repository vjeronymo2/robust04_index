			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut hopes lift gilts as continental prices fall UK gilts were the only European government bonds to post gains yesterday. They were boosted by a raft of economic data which indicated that the UK recovery was slowing while inflation pressured remain subdued. 'People are now gearing up for further rate cuts,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'I've heard some people say that the authorities should have waited (until yesterday) and cut the base rate by 1/2 point,' he said in reference to last Tuesday's  1/4 -point cut. However, weakness in bond markets across Europe put a lid on the gilts' gains. 'I would guess that the good data we've seen in the last three days would normally put about three points on the gilt market,' said Mr Briscoe. However, because of weak markets elsewhere, the gilt rally stalled after 1/2 point. Nevertheless, he noted that recent high volatility appeared to have eased off in recent days, and this week's 'unambiguously good data might just have given the market the lift the Bank needs ahead of next week's gilt auction'. Elsewhere, markets continued to weaken as participants grew increasingly gloomy on the chances of a cut in German interest rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting. Bunds broke technical resistance early, clawed back some losses during the day, but then dropped back sharply towards the close. 'Ironically, bunds are being hurt by the bearish sentiment in other markets regarding the prospect of unchanged German rates,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group. Late in the day, the March bund futures contract on Liffe traded at 98.65, down 0.39 point from Tuesday. French bonds ended only slightly lower on the day, with early losses recouped by late short-covering. However, traders warned that prices were likely to fall further if the Bundesbank leaves interest rates unchanged. The notional bond futures contract on Matif fell 0.02 point to 128.64. The higher-yielding markets took another pounding, with the Italian bond future down more than a point in the morning. According to Mr Marco Pianelli, southern Europe economist at Nomura Research Institute, these markets have suffered from heavy switching into German bonds, or into cash, amid the prevailing interest-rate uncertainty, and because of their currencies' weakness against the D-Mark. He said political jitters ahead of next month's Italian elections were less of a factor in the sell-off. If the Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged today, the high-yielders are likely to fall further, said Mr Pianelli. However, he suggested that 'a further sell-off would provide a good buying opportunity', with the Italian 10-year benchmark offering value at between 8.90 and 9 per cent yield. After posting strong gains on Monday and Tuesday, Japanese government bonds fell back as the yen weakened, the stock market stabilised, and supply was boosted by large corporate bond issuance. 'With little data out for the rest of the week, the focus will be on the degree to which the seasonal increase in corporate supply can be absorbed - creating minor downside risk,' said analysts at Yamaichi International. Longer-dated US Treasury prices drifted lower in light trading yesterday as dealers and investors awaited today's inflation news. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 easier at 97 9/32 , with the yield inching ahead to 6.452 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99-7/32, to carry a yield of 4.404 per cent. The day's only economic news - a 17.6 per cent decline in January housing starts - had little impact. This was because the data were distorted by the impact of the harsh winter storms that hit large parts of the US during the month. The lack of a reaction also reflected cautiousness ahead of the release of the January consumer prices index this morning. Analysts were expecting a 0.3 per cent rise in the CPI, but investors feared that a significantly larger figure could lead the Federal Reserve to put up short-term interest rates again.</p>

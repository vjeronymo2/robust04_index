			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] The Russian Federation has submitted a note to the  Turkish Embassy in Moscow on the statutes and regulations of the  straits that will go into effect on 1 July, saying that they are  not in line with the Montreux Treaty and that the traffic  regulations of the straits should be solved at the international  level.    The response that was conveyed to the Russian Foreign  Ministry today states that it is Turkey's most natural right to  regulate the maritime traffic in the straits in a way that will  ensure maritime safety and protect the environment. According  to information released by the Foreign Ministry, the note, whose  contents were made public by the Russian Federation's foreign  affairs spokesman, states that Russia shares Turkey's concern  regarding the maritime safety of the straits but that this issue  should be solved at the international level.    The Foreign Ministry announcement adds that the reply  message  conveyed to the Russian Federation expresses the following views:    We welcome the fact that the Russian Federation shares our  concern regarding traffic safety in the Turkish straits and that  it accepts the fact of the existence of an urgent and serious  problem that needs to be solved. We, however, do not agree with  the views that the statutes and regulations are in contravention  of the Montreux Treaty and that they may be implemented  arbitrarily. We believe that these views constitute a biased  approach to technical regulations which we have not even begun  to implement. The reply message further recalls that for the  past 58 years, Turkey has been meticulously implementing the  Montreux Treaty, adding that concerns regarding this issue are  invalid. The message adds that the Turkish Government has no  intention of unilaterally changing the Montreux Treaty and that  the changes in the statute are nothing more than the reflection  of international rules and regulations on domestic law.</p>

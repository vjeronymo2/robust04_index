			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Insolvency ruling could spark 'crippling' claims Accountancy firms could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn from people who have lost their jobs over the past seven years, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday. This follows a recent Appeal Court ruling which suggested that administrators were deemed to have adopted the contractual employment obligations of a company after 14 days. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said claims could arise in cases where it was eventually found impossible to keep companies afloat. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, moved quickly after the ruling because accountants acting as receivers said they could not produce a rescue package within 14 days and would be forced to sack everyone in all cases to avoid claims. Emergency legislation to clarify the employment obligations of companies in receivership is due to go through the House of Commons today. It will state that if there have been no new employment contracts agreed after 14 days of the receivership or administration of a company, only wages, salaries and pensions contributions will rank as secured creditors. The CBI warned yesterday that unless the changes in the Insolvency Act were made retrospective accountancy firms could be put out of business as a result of claims made on them. Mr Davies said: 'Claims are most likely from directors and senior management. The directors of Olympia &amp; York (developers of Canary Wharf) are already reported to have lodged claims totalling Pounds 10m.' Mr Davies said many businesses depended on the availability of services from medium-sized accountancy firms. He added: 'It is of great concern that such firms now face the possibility of crippling claims and of going under themselves.'</p>

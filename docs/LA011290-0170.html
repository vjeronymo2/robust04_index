			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> COLD HANDS USUALLY NOT DANGER SIGN  </P> <P> Are your hands always cold? It's a fairly common but rarely serious condition,  says Dr. Thomas Shook, a cardiologist who directs the coronary care unit at the  Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> People with cold hands often have a normal body temperature but lower skin  temperature, says Shook, who suspects that cold-handed people might simply be  more sensitive to temperature changes.  </P> <P> Cold hands are not usually a sign of an underlying problem, such as abnormal  circulation, Shook says. But rarely, cold hands can be a symptom of Raynaud's  phenomenon, a condition in which the hands turn white, then blue, then red.  </P> <P> "Raynaud's by itself is not serious," Shook says. "But it can be associated  with more troublesome conditions like scleroderma, a skin disorder, or drug  allergies."  </P> <P> Short of gloves and hand warmers, there's not much for cold-handed people to  do, Shook says. Except maybe find solace in the old "cold hands, warm heart"  theory. By KATHLEEN DOHENY Youngsters in preschool through high school are  invited to participate in a one-day "mail art" show to be presented March 3 at  the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. Any subject is acceptable, but all works must  be two-dimensional and postcard-size (about 4 by 6 inches). Each entry must  include the artist's name, age and address (the student's name must also be  printed on the image side of the entry), and all work received will become the  property of the museum. Mail entries by Feb. 26 to the Bowers Museum Office of  Education, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana, CA 92706. For further information, call  (714) 972-1900. Wendy Bargiel, 17, of El Toro has been selected as a regional  semifinalist in TEEN Magazine's Great Model Search. She was one of 240  candidates selected from an estimated 24,000 entries. Her photo is appearing in  the January issue of the magazine. The winner will appear on the cover of the  October issue. The winner will also receive a $5,000 cash award, a trip for two  to a resort and a wardrobe of gowns. California State Summer School for the  Arts is conducting a statewide search to identify the most talented high school  artists. Those teen-age artists who are selected will attend one of the  country's premier summer art institutes at Mills College in Oakland. Brochures  describing the school's visual and performing arts programs, and the  application process, are currently available through local high schools,  libraries and arts councils. Those interested should contact their local arts  councils or the CSSSA at (916) 323-9614. "Talk is cheap because supply exceeds  demand." -- Unknown  </P></p>

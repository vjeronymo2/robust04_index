			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Standard allowance for mortgage tax relief would be fairer to all Sir, As a chartered quantity surveyor I do not pretend to have a full knowledge of the problems facing borrowers, lending institutions and government in the current housing crisis, but would offer the following for consideration. The present system of tax relief on interest paid appears to be a universal benefit, but is it fair? For example, take three individuals: 'A' buys a house on a 20-year mortgage and enjoys the benefit of Pounds 600,000 tax relief compounded allowance. 'B' buys and sells several houses over a period of 40 years and enjoys Pounds 1.2m tax relief compounded allowance. 'C' does not buy at all and therefore receives nil tax relief compounded allowance. Perhaps, therefore, the government should consider a standard tax relief compounded allowance per person (say Pounds 750,000) with the flexibility of use left to the individual counselled by his/her lending institution. For example Pounds 75,000 tax relief for a period of 10 years and nil tax relief for the remaining years they choose to have a mortgage (or series of mortgages). The system of salary multiples which determines the borrowing limit should be maintained to prevent abuse of the system. Those individuals who opt not to buy could be allowed an enhanced pension on retirement or the opportunity to sell their 'benefit' to others. This would not necessarily cost the government more than the present system but has the advantage that it could be adjusted every so often to boost or dampen the domestic housing market irrespective of interest rate movement. Furthermore, the government would probably have a better estimate of the cost to the Treasury of mortgage interest tax relief than it can possibly have at present. This system could be of immediate benefit to those borrowers teetering on the brink of 'the repossession route'. It may also prove attractive to others who are keen to buy their own property or move to larger property, but are reluctant or have limited resources through family commitments at this juncture. Finally, if practicable it could be applied retrospectively to those already in 'the repossession route' but not yet homeless, or those who find themselves in the unfortunate position of having a mortgage in excess of their property's value. In the last circumstance, if the borrower cannot hold out then perhaps he or she could surrender their 'benefit' or part of it to raise sufficient funds to make good the shortfall.

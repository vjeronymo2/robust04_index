			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Liaoning Province is launching an environmental protection  campaign to increase its residents' awareness of pollution  problems.    The province, one of the major heavy industrial centers in  China, has been plagued by industrial pollution for a long time.  Shenyang, capital of the province, and Anshan, a steel city,  and other large and medium-sized cites were once  pollution-ridden and are now still facing serious problems of  pollution.    To reduce pollution and better protect the environment, the  province is now taking every possible measure to make its  residents aware of pollution problems.    Children in schools all over the province are given books on  environmental protection which explain in simple and clear  language the relationship between nature and human beings, and  between environmental pollution and disease.    Two special primary schools have been established, where  students are examined on the subject of environmental protection  as well as other subjects.    Government officials are also required to stay abreast of  problems of pollution. They are given lectures on the basics of  environmental protection and its relationship with economic  development.    Factories are now paying attention to environmental  protection as well as to safety in the workplace. Newspapers  give prominent space and radio and TV use prime time to cover  stories on environmental protection.    The chief of the provincial bureau of environmental  protection has even hosted radio phone-in programs on  environmental protection.</p>

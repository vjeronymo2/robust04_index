			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> FDA WANTS DIET PILL TAKEN OFF MARKET  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said it wants Cal-Ban 3000 diet tablets and  capsules taken off the market because they can cause throat obstructions and  their weight-loss claims are unproven. The FDA sent a letter to Health Care  Products Inc. of Lutz, Fla., saying the agency would take legal action if the  company does not stop distribution of the product, whose main ingredient is  guar gum, which swells with water and creates a sense of fullness when eaten.  The agency cited reports of 17 cases in which people experienced throat  obstruction after using the product.  </P></p>

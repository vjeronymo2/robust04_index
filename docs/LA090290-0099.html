			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK MARK;  </P> <P> A NATIONAL PARK AS PROFITABLE RESORT: EXPLOITING NATURE FOR ECONOMIC GAIN;  </P> <P> YOSEMITE: A NEW BOOK TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE AGE-OLD AND CONTINUING FIGHT  BETWEEN PRESERVATIONISTS AND DEVELOPERS IN A MAGNIFICENT SIERRA SETTING.  </P> <P> Any resource open to everyone is eventually destroyed. So in 1968 Garrett  Hardin, a professor of human ecology at the University of California, Santa  Barbara, addressed thefutility of pleading for voluntary self-restraint to  protect the environment. Such appeals, he noted, impress those individuals with  a real sense of social responsibility but fail to sway anyone intent on  maximizing personal gain. The result is the tragedy of the commons, the  inevitable overexploitation of collectively held resources in the relentless  pursuit of economic self-interest.  </P> <P> Extending that thesis to Yosemite, Hardin argued that perhaps access should be  denied to anyone unwilling to walk the prerequisite distance for ensuring that  the park would not be overused or overdeveloped. Although labeled as elitist,  the idea did have broad appeal, especially among preservationists, who  considered resource conservation to be the only legitimate purpose of national  parks.  </P> <P> Development in any form was therefore illegitimate, if only for the reason that  structures, roads and everyday services were commonplace throughout America,  whereas Yosemite was one of a kind. There had evolved, in either case, the  unwritten standard that whatever Americans could do elsewhere in the country  should not become common practice in national parks.  </P> <P> Once more the issue hinged on the fundamental duality in park legislation,  legal sanctions that provided, in effect, that Yosemite be managed for both  private profit and resource conservation. Self-interest and the public interest  (however defined) went hand in hand. But was coexistence realistic?  </P> <P> Historically, the behavior of park concessionaires especially had suggested the  many possibilities for serious contradictions. Regulated or not,  concessionaires as a group had put profit ahead of preservation. As  businessmen, they sought expansion, not only of facilities but also of saleable  visitor services. Amusements were labeled "needs" and not merely luxuries. More  often than not the subterfuge worked, allowing concessionaires to distance  themselves from their own intensive campaigns for increased park development.  </P> <P> The hostility of preservationists was all the more reason not to label the  profit motive for what it was but instead, feigning concern for the  environment, to plead again that meeting the demands of expansion was done only  with considerable reluctance and, to re-emphasize, at the insistence of the  public.  </P> <P> If any single commodity ever sold in Yosemite cast doubt on the sincerity of  that argument, most certainly that commodity was alcohol. Hardly had the first  tourists begun arriving in the valley when tent saloons started popping up  alongside popular overlooks and trails.  </P> <P> National Prohibition, imposed in 1919 by the 18th Amendment to the  Constitution, effectively sealed the debate for the next decade and a half.  With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, there was an opportunity to review, at  the very least, the advisability of resuming the sale of alcoholic beverages in  public parks and refuges. Yet the question had hardly been asked when the ban  on sales was lifted. Although obviously pleased, concessionaires once more  found it expedient to hide their support behind the standard words of  subterfuge, insisting again that public demand was the chief source of  persuasion.  </P> <P> It remained for Donald B. Tresidder, the president of Yosemite Park &amp; Curry  Co., to lift that legerdemain to new heights in a lengthy memorandum dated June  20, 1934. "We wish to state emphatically," he began, "that this company is not  going into the liquor business with the intention of developing a trade that  will be as profitable as possible." The remainder of his two-page document  continually underscored that promise, indicating that although Prohibition in  national parks had just been repealed, his company intended to forbid anything  suggestive of promoting alcohol consumption. To the contrary, the sale of  alcoholic beverages would be kept strictly low-key and tastefully conservative.  </P> <P> As of 1988 there were 35 outlets in Yosemite National Park selling beer, wine  or liquor, 23 of those outlets on the valley floor alone. Yosemite Park &amp;  Curry Co. further promoted sales through modern bars, expansive shelf displays  and various types of advertising, including using company-operated buses and  tours to point out the location of lounge facilities. Quite obviously, sometime  in the 50 years following Tresidder's memo, his promise had been completely  scuttled.  </P> <P> For those in the postwar era who considered visitation itself a threat to  Yosemite's scenic and biological resources, the park's first moment of truth  came on Dec. 31, 1954, when total visitation for the preceding calendar year  stood at 1,008,031 people. It was but a few months short of a century since  James Mason Hutchings had brought the first party of tourists to Yosemite  Valley in 1855. Yet just 13 years later, in 1967, the figure stood at 2 million  and was rapidly climbing. Only 20 more years were needed to top 3 million  visitors annually; the estimate in 1987 was more than 3.2 million.  </P> <P> The lingering reaction among preservationists was one of vindication mixed with  deep regret. Protection's first outspoken prophet, Frederick Law Olmsted, had  predicted, in 1865, precisely the future that Yosemite was now experiencing.  Ansel Adams added to Olmsted's interpretation. "When there was a vast reservoir  of wilderness," he wrote to David Brower, "when areas such as Yosemite were  difficult of access, there was a different kind of visitor; he came primarily  for the experience of the place" and, even more significant, "was willing to  sacrifice certain comforts and undergo considerable difficulties to gain this  experience."  </P> <P> Suddenly development in Yosemite National Park attracted every kind of  individual, not just people resigned to discomfort in the best interest of  preservation. So-called services had also become "more general" as the  character of visitors had changed. Among those "services" were more and more  "entertainments" intended by park operators "to cover a wide and often  unjustified range" of public whims and desires. The result, Adams concluded,  was "a 'resort' enterprise to which people are attracted for other reasons than  the simple experience of the natural scene."  </P> <P> What 1 million visitors foretold for Yosemite was the difficulty of  substituting logic for historical self-interest. To be sure, Ansel Adams  himself was part of the complex entanglement that affected every rationale for  resisting decisive changes in the park's management or infrastructure. Simply,  tradition was not that easy to erase.  </P> <P> "I may be guilty of a contradiction of my own principles," he finally  confessed, "in continuing to support the Christmas Bracebridge Dinner at the  Ahwahnee Hotel." Writing years later in his autobiography, he still had no  illusions that the event had not originated in pursuit of the profit motive.  </P> <P> "The winter season was always slow for the concessionaires; tourists were  almost non-existent. To increase visitation Don Tresidder . . . began a program  of winter sports." In 1927 Tresidder further "suggested a theatrical Christmas  dinner at the Ahwahnee as a key focus for family winter vacations." Two years  later he asked Adams to direct the entire affair, with the help of an  architect, Jeannette Spencer. Adams agreed, "provided we could make it  professional in concept and performance." The result was a Yuletide pageant,  "an account of an English squire's Christmas entertainment," modeled after  Washington Irving's "Christmas at Bracebridge Hall."  </P> <P> Clearly, no importation into Yosemite Valley could have been more foreign or  artificial. The point was that this particular display of artificiality was  Ansel Adams' own. "I plead guilty to this," he further confessed to David  Brower. He nonetheless still excused himself. "Elements of art can be logically  associated with the elements of the Natural experience -- both concern the  spirit and the emotions."  </P> <P> Here was the critic himself making a case for his opponents, arguing that not  all development was necessarily intrusive or inappropriate. "As long as the  Ahwahnee exists," he wrote, further conceding that point, "it offers the  opportunity to express certain events of a definite spiritual character." Put  another way, without the Ahwahnee there would be no special meaning to the  Bracebridge Dinner, no grand stage on which Adams' proud creation could be  played out to the fullest. The Ahwahnee "also, unfortunately, supports  evidences of advanced urbanism which create a dichotomy in the Yosemite scene,"  Adams immediately added, still obviously wrestling with his original concern.  </P> <P> In microcosm, the emotional tug-of-war of such a dedicated and outspoken  preservationist was very telling evidence of the power of inconsistency. Faced  with the thought of losing a Yosemite tradition so dear to his heart, Ansel  Adams too was forced into rationalizing why he had diminished his lifetime  scale of values. That very lapse in fortitude was precisely what Frederick Law  Olmsted had had in mind when he wrote in 1865 of the need to adopt strict rules  of conduct that would, without compromise, govern every park visitor. Ever  since Olmsted, the search for those proper rules of conduct had been Yosemite's  historic and endlessly debated challenge. Finally affected by the presence of  Olmsted's predicted "millions," that search had indeed become all the more  difficult. Ansel Adams was just another example of the futility of asking for  commitment without effective coercion.  </P> <P> Olsmsted's admonishment was to treat everything as impositions, unless  something had originally been part of the natural scene. Otherwise the danger  arose of accepting development itself as natural, further imposing layer upon  layer of artificiality over the landscape.  </P> <P> Garrett Hardin said it differently, but his conclusion was much the same. The  acceptance of change need not be total; it need simply be present. The only way  out of the tragedy of the commons was universal coercion. Everyone must accept  the same standard, or the standard would fall.  </P> <P> Excerpted with permission of  </P> <P> University of Nebraska Press. 1990.  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW: "Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness," is reviewed on Page 1 of  today's Book Review.  </P></p>

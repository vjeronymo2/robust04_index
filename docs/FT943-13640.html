			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Tighter checks on societies urged British banks yesterday called for improvements in building societies' accountability to their members following the government's decision to allow societies to diversify into new activities such as unsecured commercial lending. The British Bankers' Association said societies should have to obey rules on consulting shareholders and seeking approval for significant acquisitions similar to those imposed on listed companies under Stock Exchange rules. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the association, said that it appeared 'unsatisfactory that organisations are allowed greater freedom of operation, which means greater risk, without levels of accountability being improved'. Sir Nicholas' remarks, at the association's monthly press briefing, follow the disclosure of the first stage of a review of the 1986 Building Societies Act which will allow societies to broaden their funding base and activities. Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, said at the announcement of the liberalisation earlier this month that the government intended to require society boards to inform members of non-confidential takeover offers. Sir Nicholas said, however, that takeovers were not the main issue. Societies should be required to consult and notify members on broader changes in strategy. He said: 'It does not seem to us to be right that a mutual can find itself involved in new forms of business that affect the state of the undertaking without shareholders being adequately informed.' He suggested that societies should send copies of annual reports to members, as well as having to seek their approval for acquisitions of a size greater than 25 per cent of their existing assets.</p>

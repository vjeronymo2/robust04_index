			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Firmly Combat Drought To Ensure Summer </F> Sowing and Harvest, Then Strive for Autumn Bumper Harvest"]    [Text] The province has basically completed its summer  harvest, and the total wheat output is estimated at 20 billion  kg, another record high. However, ravages of drought are  developing quickly in the province at present, which will bring  about tremendous difficulties for summer sowing and autumn  seedling management in various localities. According to the  present estimates conducted in various localities on 14 June,  some 70 million mu of fields were afflicted with drought, and of  this, 30 million mu were severely afflicted. Due to the  drought, dead seedlings resulted in 850,000 mu of corn and  peasant fields sown in spring and summer. Seedlings were unable  to emerge normally on 1.5 million mu of summer-sown cropfields.  And nearly 20 million mu of summer-sowing cropfields were  unable to be sown on time due to the drought.    A department concerned, maintains that if there are no heavy  rains in the near future, the province will be threatened by the  difficulties in sowing seedlings, ensuring sound growth of  seedlings, and providing drinking water for people and animals.  According to the weather forecast by the provincial  meteorological department, far from promising obvious rainfalls  in the near future, the province will experience high  temperatures in succession. At the moment, the situation of  combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer harvest is  extremely grim. Therefore, all localities should cool off from  the joy of bumper harvest and should rapidly set off a mighty  movement of combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer  harvesting throughout the province. As demanded by the  emergency notice of the provincial government, all localities  should lose no time and concentrate energies on sowing and  managing summer crops. By overcoming the fear of difficulty,  the mood of worry, and the idea of waiting for rains at the  mercy of the elements, all localities should make full use of  all water sources and water areas to combat drought with a view  to ensuring sowing and sound growth of seedlings. Meanwhile,  attention should be paid to resolving problems in providing  drinking water for people and animals. The areas now harvesting  wheat should make appropriate arrangements for simultaneously  harvesting, sowing, and managing crops and for ensuring both  wheat harvest and drought combat with a view to winning the last  victory in summer sowing and harvest through drought combat and  to reaping an even greater bumper harvest in autumn crops.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: State property sale nearer THE SALE of the portfolio of property assets in the hands of the Italian state came a stage closer yesterday with the establishment of Immobiliare Italia, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The company, with an initial L7bn (Dollars 4.8m) capital, will manage the valuation and sale of those property assets deemed worth selling. The Ministry of Finance has so far examined 10,000 of the 16,000 potential properties. Of these, roughly half could be sold, with an approximate value of L1,000bn. Immobiliare will begin with public sector shareholders or those financial institutions with a state stake.</p>

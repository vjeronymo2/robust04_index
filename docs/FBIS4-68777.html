			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kuzmishchev, scientific </F> associate of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of  Comparative Political Studies and candidate in historical  sciences: "Latin America, Which We Are Losing"]    [Text] Back in the time when the Russian MFA [Ministry of  Foreign Affairs] was making its first efforts to formulate our  country's foreign political doctrine (end of 1992), its  leadership held a series of scientific-practical seminars on  regional--including Latin American--problems. Representatives of  the community and scientific circles were invited to these  seminars. As a participant in this measure, I can bear witness  to the fact that, at the general conference summarizing these  seminars, the words "Latin America" were never once pronounced.    They generally appear in the speeches of our country's  politicians and leading officials only for comparison with the  situation in Russia. Either these are examples of the fruits of  authoritarianism, which are so attractive to certain proponents  of "Democratic Russia," or they are passionate assurances of the  fact that our country is not some kind of "banana" republic.  This image is especially popular among the national-patriots and  communists. For the sake of fairness, I will note that similar  motifs slip through from time to time also in the speeches of  rather highly placed officials, evoking puzzlement among Latin  American diplomats.    Recalling all the official actions of the Russian Federation  in regard to Latin America for the period since August of 1991,  it is easy to note that they have in fact been disavowed by life  itself. I am referring to the visits by Vice President A. V.  Rutskoy to a number of South American countries, and the trip of  the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] delegates  along the same route. As well as the Supreme Soviet's creation  of groups for developing policy in regard to several of the  leading Latin American states.    Rutskoy is currently in Lefortov. Former MVES Minister S. A.  Glazev has fallen into disgrace. The Supreme Soviet has been  disbanded. As for Russian-Latin American relations, they have  never gotten off the ground. We might add, how many months has  Russia not had an ambassador to Mexico? And how long have our  ambassadors to Equador and Argentina not been appointed?    It seems that they do not give much thought to this in the  "heights" on Smolensk Square. The foreign political course of  its masters rests on two supports, one of which is the strategic  cooperation with the USA, and the other--the geopolitical  position of Russia with the "nuances" (Europe? Asia? Eurasia?  Of, perhaps, Asiope?) We are being pulled into the "common  European house." We long to become the eighth in the "big  seven." We are bewitched by the Asia-Pacific region. And we  cannot avoid the problems of the "near abroad."    However, Realpolitik dictates to Russia its place in the  current world. It is not so much that we are going to the  "common European house" as Eastern Europe is drifting toward  NATO. The Soviet legacy in Asia and Africa is confidently being  picked up by the PCR [People's Republic of China], assuming the  role of patron of the belittled and the insulted. Especially in  the Arab East. In general, the collapse of the Soviet Union as a  super power has created an unfavorable moral climate for Russia  everywhere in the Old World. The reasons for this are varied. In  some places they are happy about the removal of a potentially  powerful competitor. There is also an abundance of small  predators, ready to grab from us anything that is not nailed  down. There are also those who accuse the "Russians" of  traitorship.    Today only in Latin America the word "Russian," which was  always synonymous with "Soviet," does not evoke the reaction of  detachment either in the mass consciousness or among the local  ruling circles. The fact is that, first of all, in the political  culture of the countries in this region, the role of the "bad  boy" has historically belonged to Washington. Secondly, the  Soviet period of our country's history gave Moscow the image of  an antagonist of the United States, which we are shedding with  such difficulty. We might add that many countries do not want us  to depart from it. No myths, nor, we might add, the realities of  the times of the Comintern [Communist International], the Cold  War, the arms race, etc., can hide the fact that the Latin  American establishment has always been ready to cooperate with  the Kremlin over the ideological barriers, even the infamous  Pinochet's Chile. With the beginning of perestroyka, the  de-ideologization of Soviet foreign policy has only strengthened  this tendency. An unpleasant surprise, and not only for the  local communists, was Gorbachev's implementation of the  little-understood course in regard to Latin America. This was  particularly manifested in the course of his official visit to  Cuba in 1988 (Mikhail Sergeyevich personally reaped the fruits  of such a policy during his scandalously failed lecture visit to  Argentina and Chile and 1993).    The Latin Americans certainly did not write off our hasty  "divorce" from Havana as a trait of the famous unfathomable  nature of the Russian soul. And Shevardnadze's anti-Sandinista  passes had zero success, since the masters of Managua at that  time knew perfectly well about the content of the  Soviet-American talks in London on the Nicaragua problem. They  bravely undertook the fulfillment of all that we had promised  the U.S. State Department, since... they intended to do nothing.  And that is just what they did. It was 1989, and the  international department of the CPSU Central Committee had grown  tired of explaining to our "friends" that the "lean times" had  arrived...    However, despite all this, the reserve of good deeds  accumulated during the Soviet era was so great that even  Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, these two great dilettantes, could  not exhaust them. Many thousands of Latin Americans, who had  received their education in our country in their better youthful  years, had taken with them forever in their hearts not only  their love for their first Russian girl, but also similar,  although more complex, feelings for our homeland. In the last 30  years, these former students became the backbone of the local  elite, became leading millionaire-entrepreneurs, well-known  leaders in science and culture, ministers and ambassadors. And  they are returning to us, sent by their governments or guided by  business interests, but never having lost their deep personal  sympathies for our country.    This is but one of the factors favoring Russian  Latin-American policy which cannot be overlooked.    Naturally, there are also other, more material factors. They  are well known. Latin America remains a solvent market for our  industrial production. Many light industry goods from the Latin  American countries are quite suitable for the Russian consumer,  not to mention the so-called colonial goods (coffee, cocoa,  citrus fruits, etc.).    Russia as a resource donor has not only competitive  relations  with the states of Latin America in this sphere, but also common  interests. In general, we must admit that in the "North-South"  dialogue the place of Russian hyperboreans is next to the Latin  Americans. On one hand, they identify themselves with the values  of Christian civilization. On the other, they clearly feel like  outsiders in the world arena and strive to overcome this. But  they do not have that colonial experience of Asia and Africa  which presupposes the non-acceptance of the "white man" as such.  Even the Cuban soldiers and specialists in Angola, Ethiopia and  other African countries (not to mention Asia, and specifically  South Yemen), despite the racial closeness, were considered by  the local population to be kind people, but nevertheless  outsiders, "colonialists." It is rather characteristic that the  former clientele of the CPSU in Latin America is more  successfully being "picked up" not by the Chinese, but by the  Arabs from the Near East (for example, Iraq and Libya--through  the Palestinian movement--in Central America, Columbia and  Peru). The Levantine ethno-cultural amalgam, like any other, is  functional.    The foreign policy of any state depends not only on its  material capacities and needs, but also on the presence of  domestic decisiveness, as well as a favorable moral climate in  that country or region where it intends to implement its  political line. So far, I have tried to prove that it is  specifically Latin America which is of particular interest to  Russia, since there is clearly a mutual material interest and a  favorable moral climate for our country's diplomacy. As for  domestic decisiveness, here things are somewhat more complex. We  must say, it is quite significant that we possess a great  intellectual potential as specialists in Latin American studies.  First of all, there is the Latin America Institute of the  Russian Academy of Sciences, which after a short period of  vegetation and fruitless efforts to "enter the market" changed  over to the study of the region from the point of view of  Russian interests. The journal, LATINSKAYA AMERIKA, has also  been retained--almost the only one of the academic analogs, and  has become standard reference reading in many foreign embassies  in Moscow. The RAS Institute of General History has an operating  Latin American Center, whose works are better known abroad than  they are in our country. Latin America specialists from the  academic Institute of Archeology are world renowned. And now I  would like to explain what relation our Latin American studies  have to Russian foreign policy.    At one time long ago, toward the end of the middle ages,  first the merchant and missionary went to open new horizons for  their homeland, and then the warrior. In our time, the state,  which must once again open up the world for itself, needs a  different triad. First must come the highly skilled scientist,  whose in-depth knowledge of the country where he is sent is one  form of respect shown toward it, as well as an invitation to  dialogue. Then it is the diplomat's turn, who gives the dialogue  a constant character and facilitates the creation of a favorable  climate, without which business people would have to break  through thousands of obstacles.    Obviously, there is no need to explain all this to the  Russian Latin America specialists. But if suddenly this article  falls into the hands of those who make the decisions, it would  be useful for them to learn how this is already today being done  in France. For Paris, Latin America today, when there is a  struggle going on for supremacy in the European union, is a new  horizon, representing a desire to strengthen its positions in  the Old World by means of extending the Latin American  "shoulder" of French diplomacy.    The first step toward this was made in France by increasing  the financing of the appropriate research centers and by  attracting young people to them.    In our country, as we know, it is almost impossible to  retain  already trained cadres. Therefore, we must especially value the  heroic efforts of MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International  Relations], which developed its Latin America Center for the  training of new generations of professionals. A good initiative  has been the allocation by the International Fund "New  World--500" (whose president is Moscow Mayor Yu. M. Luzhkov) of  a prize in the form of an increased 6-month stipend for the best  MGIMO student engaged in the study of Latin American  problematics.    We would like to believe that certain changes are also  taking  place in our MFA in its approach to Latin America. In any case,  the recently held meeting of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs  G. S. Mamedov with Russian entrepreneurs and representatives of  public organizations operating in the Latin American direction  instills some hope. The high-ranking Russian official asked his  fellow citizens, simply and openly, how his department can help  their endeavors in the more distant abroad. You must agree, we  do not often hear this from the authorities.    The only thing that jarred us a bit was the reference to  U.S.  President Bill Clinton as some kind of standard: He too,  protects "his own," they said. And once again we recalled the  two pillars of our foreign policy... And also about those Latin  American entrepreneurs who begin business negotiations with  statements to the effect that they want to force out of their  markets the North American goods which enslave them, and  therefore are ready to buy Russian products of the same quality,  but... for next to nothing. Moreover, they are sure that we, as  before, will take the ideological bait.    But while we can understand these Latin American merchants  who have not yet recognized the changes in the direction of  common sense which have taken place in our country, some of  their fellow countrymen I simply refuse to understand. First one  of them writes that Washington has turned its back on Latin  America. And this at a moment when, thanks to the signing of the  Free Trade Agreement, the words "United States of America" first  begin to take on real content. Then another places his signature  under the development of the "Gorbachev Fund" on the prospects  of Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific region, where Latin  America has been long forgotten. True, this forgetfulness is  explained in the footnotes. But why is it that neither Japan,  nor South Korea, nor Taiwan, nor the PRC suffer from it.  Instead, they become ever more stubbornly involved in that very  same Mexico, even as it is pulled ever more strongly into and  ground up by the integration within the framework of the North  American free trade zone. Not to mention Chile and the other  Latin American countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean. Or even  those not bordering it. Those who have been to Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela can tell us much about this.    It is even more difficult to understand such opinions  expressed by our country's specialists when we familiarize  ourselves with the speeches of the U.S. President, filled with  the pathos of unification, during his meeting with the heads of  state and governments of Central America and the Caribbean, or  those of Vice President Gore in Mexico.    We would like to conclude these somewhat confused notes with  some general arguments. The author is not so naive that he does  not notice the real state of affairs in our homeland. "No  money," the British said at one time, and tried to forget that  they do not have the power for a policy not only "to the east of  Suez," but much more west of that. There does not exist in  nature that main link which, if we pull it, we can pull out from  the quagmire the entire load of Russian problems, either in the  economy, or in domestic policy, or in foreign. And if someone  has decided that an active Latin American course pursued by  Moscow can be such a link, then he has wasted precious time in  reading this article. However, complete elimination of the Latin  American component from Russian foreign policy would mean the  creation of an initially detrimental foreign political facade of  the Russian Federation.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola wins India consent COCA-COLA, the US soft drinks company, said last night it had received formal approval from the Indian government for a joint venture business that will allow the US company to return to the Indian beverage market for the first time since 1977, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Under the the deal, Coca-Cola's south-Asia subsidiary will own 40 per cent of a Hong Kong investment vehicle called JMRPCO Ltd; this in turn is 60 per cent owned by Mr JM Rajan Pillai, a non-resident Indian entrepreneur who is chairman of the Britannia Group, an Indian company.</p>

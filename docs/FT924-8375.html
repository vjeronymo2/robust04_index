			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook shareholders urged to reject tender offer THE BOARD of Etonbrook, the property developer which is in dispute with its largest shareholder over a capital restructuring, has written to investors urging them to reject a tender offer for 13.4 per cent of the company. The letter warned shareholders that the offer of 73p per share would bring the stake held by Mr Andrew Perloff and companies associated with him to 29.9 per cent. 'He will have achieved a disproportionate degree of control over Etonbrook without having made a full bid,' the letter states. The letter further claimed the offer compared unfavourably with the stated net asset value per share of more than 100p. The group said that following the disposal of a London property, Etonbrook had cash balances of 61p per share and no debt - or 34p after repayment of Pounds 1.2m in preference shares. Mr Perloff has consistently objected to a capital restructuring which would allow full repayment of the preference shares and payment of dividends. His objections were supported at an extraordinary meeting in September, although he failed in his attempt to win a seat on the board.</p>

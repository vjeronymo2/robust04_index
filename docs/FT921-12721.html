			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Tiny's hand is frozen FT-SE Index: 2,525.3 (+3.3) Lonrho's full year figures are so startlingly bad as to raise the question of whether some kind of denouement is finally at hand. In his recent choice of chairman, Mr Rowland demonstrated that he could not provide a successor. It now appears that he cannot provide adequate profits and dividends either. The cut in the final payment may have been half expected, but not the 40 per cent slump in second half profits and the passing of this year's first interim. At last night's unofficial close of 120p, Lonrho has a market value of under Pounds 800m and is heading out of the FT-SE. If the institutions want change, they had better get on with it. As always with Lonrho, the snag lies in assessing what Mr Rowland would leave behind him. Its assets - the mines, the hotels, the newspapers and so forth - seem solid enough. But so does the net debt of Pounds 1.1bn. Granted, the figure is unchanged since the interim statement, while net interest is apparently twice covered. But this makes the action on dividends the more puzzling, particularly since there has been no obvious pressure from the banks. A held annual total would have been only 90 per cent covered, but Lonrho paid an 83 per cent covered dividend in 1982. Without knowing what Lonrho is so worried about, valuation of the shares is impossible. The market's working assumption is of 10p in total dividends this year against 16p last, making for an 11 per cent yield at 120p. But until the annual report is published, there is no telling what fresh horrors are to come. Lonrho shareholders cannot say they were not warned. The trouble is that they were not warned by Lonrho.</p>

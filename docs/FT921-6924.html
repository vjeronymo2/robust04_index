			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar retraces early gains THE DOLLAR retraced early gains yesterday, after touching important technical barriers against the yen and D-Mark. The US currency reached a high of DM 1.6647 early in the day, up from a London opening of DM 1.6610. But it failed to breach the DM 1.6650 barrier, and fell back to close in London at DM 1.6510. In New York it edged up to end at DM 1.6525. Against the yen, the dollar pushed upwards through the important Y 129 level in Asian trading. The final impetus came from a Dollars 2bn purchase by a big Japanese player deliberately aimed at breaching the Y 129 level, market sources said. The US unit had ended in New York on Friday at Y 128.95. By the London opening it had reached Y 129.45, but had dropped back to Y 129.15 by the close. In New York it finished still at Y 129.15. One influence was a comment to Reuters by a Bank of Japan official that the dollar might face strong market resistance at around Y 130. Coming after last week's intervention by Japan, this was seen as a heavy hint of official opposition to a Y 130 rate. In spite of such comments, the dollar's weakening was 'largely a technical correction', argued Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank, 'not a panic caused by fears of central bank intervention'. Market participants had been reminiscing during the day about the last large-scale concerted intervention a year ago, he said. On that occasion, central banks failed to hold down the dollar for more than a week or so. Such recollections now, he added, were 'perhaps a sign that the market is turning still more bullish'. Sterling was caught in the dollar backwash, trading at Dollars 1.7350 in the morning (compared with Friday's Dollars 1.7460) but closing at Dollars 1.7485. Against the D-Mark, the pound rose from Friday's DM 2.8822 and an opening rate of DM 2.8847 to touch DM 2.8852 before closing at DM 2.8835. Sterling tracked its floor against the peseta for much of the day, rarely rising enough above it to encourage hopes of a green light for an easing in UK interest rates. The market noted weekend comments by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, which pointed out that the room for manoeuvre on peseta interest rates was limited by the actions of other EMS countries. Mr Solchaga said: 'It might be possible, if wages are fixed in accord with inflation goals, to lower rates a little and therefore not have the peseta near its upper limits, although I fear the currency markets will not easily let us do it.' He added that if the UK cut interest rates in view of the coming elections, the effect on Spanish rates might depend on the size of the British cut. 'If it is a small drop, perhaps we would not need to change ours.' Interpretations of these comments varied: London dealers were reading it as an indication that Spain would be unlikely to cut rates before the UK did. But share prices in Madrid moved higher in anticipation of an interest rate cut.</p>

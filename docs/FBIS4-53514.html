			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Countdown for Resumption of Stalled </F> Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks"]    [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks were broken  off during the February Japan-U.S. summit meeting after the two  countries failed to reach an agreement on "objective criteria"  designed to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The  stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are likely to resume  prior to another round of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for  July following informal contacts between the two countries.  Recently, the U.S. Government has conspicuously softened its  tough trade stand on Japan. If both Japan and the United States  agree to formally resume the stalled framework talks after  ending a "cooling-off period," this could generate a sense of  optimism currently lacking in the minority Hata government,  whose future remains uncertain.    A top Foreign Ministry official, known for his cautious  comments, said on the evening of 12 May: "There has been no  fundamental change in the U.S. stand on trade with Japan, but it  is seeking to reach agreement with Japan on resuming the stalled  framework talks." He also did not deny that the climate  surrounding Japan-U.S. relations has taken a favorable turn.    He made the comments because the two countries have  confirmed  the need to try to formally resume the stalled framework talks  prior to the G-7 talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July.  Efforts so far include a telephone conversation between Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Clinton, and a meeting  between Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Ambassador to  Japan Mondale.    The situation in the United States has changed the climate  surrounding the framework talks. Government officials in charge  of the framework talks point out that the United States needs  coordinated action from Japan to help stabilize U.S. financial  and stock markets.    In the United States, prices for the dollar, bonds, and  stocks have plummeted. Fearing a crash in the international  value of the dollar, Washington has asked Japan and European  nations to intervene in foreign exchange markets to halt a  further slide in the dollar's value. Through financial policy  coordination with Japan and Europe, the United States has  managed to avert a financial crisis. Some government officials  now say: "For the time being, the United States will not take  any steps to further appreciate the yen." The reason, they say,  is the fear that appreciation of the yen could spark inflation  in the United States and fresh economic friction with Japan.    And there is also growing criticism of the Clinton  administration's Asia policy in the United States and this must  not be overlooked. An incumbent assistant secretary of state  has made remarks linking criticism of China's human rights  record to the issue of renewing China's favorable trade status,  the Clinton administration has mishandled a caning incident  involving an American youth in Singapore, and it has taken a  tough trade stand against Japan in the framework talks. These  issues are each targets of the criticism.    The administration has been harshly criticised for its less  than adroit handling of diplomacy toward Asian nations and  disarray has surfaced within the administration over its Asia  policy. Government agencies have been complaining that the U.S.  Trade Representative, in charge of handling trade matters, has  taken unilateral action without regard for the importance of  bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, thereby  worsening relations with Japan.    A government source says that, as the November, off-year  elections draw closer, "The Clinton administration sees it a  good policy to proclaim victory in the economic dispute with  Japan."    Foreign Minister Kakizawa has said: "Our immediate  diplomatic task is to patch up sour Japan-U.S. relations." The  Japanese Government intends follow this line and capitalize on  the softened U.S. trade stand on Japan.</p>

The revision will allow Federal agencies to reimburse non-profit organizations for interest on debt used to finance the purchase of buildings and equipment, when purchasing using debt financing is less costly than leasing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on this proposal should be in writing and must be received by November 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Financial Management, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Room 6025, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.

Interest, fund raising, and investment management costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Interest on debt is unallowable unless: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The non-profit organization performs a lease/purchase analysis in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' and OMB Circular A&hyph;94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' sections 5a, 8(c)(2), and 13, which shows that purchasing through debt financing is less costly to the Federal Government than leasing. Discount rates used should be equal to the grantee's borrowing rates, to be consistent with Circular A&hyph;94's intent to reflect the entity's cost of financing. The financial analysis must include a comparison of the present value of the projected total cash flows of both alternatives over the period the asset is expected to be used by the non-profit organization in carrying out federally sponsored activities. The cash flows associated with purchasing the asset must include the purchase price, anticipated operating and maintenance costs (including property taxes, if applicable) not included in the debt financing, less any estimated asset salvage value at the end of the period defined above. Projected rental costs should be based on the anticipated cost of renting comparable facilities or equipment at fair market rates over the period defined above, and any expected maintenance costs and property taxes to be borne by the non-profit organization directly or as part of the lease arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Financing is provided at an interest rate no higher than the fair market rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Investment earnings, including interest, on bond or loan principal, pending payment of the construction or acquisition costs, are used to offset allowable interest cost. Arbitrage earnings reportable to the Internal Revenue Service are not required to be offset against allowable interest costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Where the Federal Government's reimbursement is expected to equal or exceed 51 percent of an asset's cost, the non-profit organization conducts an assessment that demonstrates the need for the asset in the conduct of federally sponsored activities. For assets costing in excess of $10 million, the needs assessment must be approved in advance by the cognizant Federal agency as a prerequisite to the allowability of depreciation and interest on debt related to the facility. For assets costing less than $10 million, the needs assessment must be maintained on file for review by the Federal Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Interest on debt issued to finance or refinance assets acquired before or reacquired after the effective date of this policy is not allowable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Federal cognizant agencies shall require non-profit organizations to compute interest on the excess of the depreciation and interest reimbursement over the bond principal and interest payments, and that the organizations treat the computed interest as a reduction in the interest expense to be reimbursed by the Federal Government. This provision is not applicable in instances where the non-profit organization makes an initial equity contribution of 25 percent or more to purchase the asset(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Substantial relocation of federally sponsored activities from a facility financed by indebtedness, the cost of which was funded in whole or part through Federal reimbursements, to another facility prior to the expiration of the useful life of the facility requires Federal cognizant agency approval. The extent of the relocation, the amount of the Federal participation in the financing, and the depreciation charged to date may require negotiation of space charges for Federal programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22997 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3110&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

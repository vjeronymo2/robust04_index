			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Electronics market forecast to fall 2% THE UK market for electrical and electronic equipment is likely to contract by as much as 2 per cent this year, Mr Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of the UK subsidiary of Siemens of Germany, predicted yesterday. He said it would be the first time in more than a decade that the Pounds 37bn market had failed to grow. His prediction casts further doubt on the prospect of a consumer-led economic recovery this year. Mr Gehrels said the market had grown consistently by up to 8 per cent a year over the past 10 years but was generally flat in 1992. The UK company, however, which includes Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems and a 40 per cent stake in GPT Holdings, increased revenues by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 881.3m last year and expects to break the Pounds 1bn barrier this year. Mr Gehrels said the company was profitable overall, but if the contribution from the GPT telecommunications joint venture with GEC were excluded, it was in loss. He agreed, however, that the company had paid too much for its share of the joint bid with GEC for Plessey in 1988 and that the cost increases as a consequence of devaluation on goods imported to the UK were a 'tremendous problem'. Last year Siemens UK had exports of Pounds 186m against imports estimated at Pounds 170m. Siemens spent Pounds 137m on research and development in the UK last year, equal to 16 per cent of Siemens UK turnover. 'The UK has a great resource of talented engineers and physicists,' Mr Gehrels said: 'That is one of the main reasons for Siemens' involvement in the UK.' The British workforce was less skilled than the German, he said, but this was not a significant handicap.</p>

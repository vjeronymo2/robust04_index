			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: Trade-distorting rules 'still holding Indonesia back' SUCCESSIVE trade policy reforms since the mid-1980s have made Indonesia more competitive on world markets, but a range of trade-distorting measures remain in force, with the most difficult areas still to be tackled. This is the broad conclusion of Gatt's first review of Indonesian trade policy, as part of its series of country reports. It shows the extent of the challenge facing a typical developing country opting for trade reform, but urges it to persist, as trade is the key to its economic growth. Indonesia began a series of trade reforms after the debt shock and the oil price fall of the mid-1980s. Successive trade reforms since then have reduced impediments to structural change. But Gatt suggests the changes have been too gradual and selective, concentrating on manufacturing activities with the least resistance to reform. Competitive pressures led to reform being reversed in some areas. Some industries such as steel, clothing and transportation remain sheltered from international competition. 'A more uniform assistance structure would reduce distortions, induce more efficient allocation of resources and help combat inflation by making the economy more flexible.' Many policy instruments criticised by Gatt are common to the developing world, including import licensing and surcharges, local content requirements, countertrade obligations and increasing curbs on exports of unprocessed primary materials. Indonesia's trade suffers from substantial 'tariff escalation', where tariffs on consumer goods are on average over double those applied to capital and intermediate goods. Import surcharges of up to 40 per cent accentuate this problem, so that consumer goods account for less than 5 per cent of total imports. Gatt notes 'bound' or fixed tariff rates apply to under 10 per cent of import items. Sometimes the bound tariff level is exceeded by imposition of an import surcharge. But Indonesia pledges a large rise in tariff bindings, especially on textiles in the context of the Uruguay Round. Import surcharges to protect domestic industries from fluctuating world prices are common, but are 'largely informal, lack public scrutiny, and have no legal procedures available to grieved parties,' it says. Indonesia is considering limiting all import surcharges to one year and has announced plans to scrap about 75 per cent of them this September. Meanwhile, Gatt says the close relations between the government and licensed importers create uncertainty for suppliers and 'promote a system that may be vulnerable to manipulation'. State-trading enterprises dominate several designated strategic manufacturing industries, such as shipbuilding, steel, aerospace, cement, fertilisers and aluminium. Certain of these sectors are subject to local content requirements, with rules on government procurement requiring foreign suppliers to offer counter-purchase arrangements. Gatt questions the curbs on Indonesia's exports of natural-resource-based products such as logs, raw hides and cement. These depress domestic prices by an estimated 20 per cent for logs bought by local plywood producers, and have a similar effect to a subsidy, it adds. 'Whether Indonesia benefits in the long term from such policies depends on its ability to develop export-competitive processing industries not dependent on continued support through depressed input prices.'</p>

They also denied press reports that the author of a relevant  report in the BKA had been transferred against his will by  Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union). The  spokesman of the Interior Ministry reported that Kanther and  Schelter, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, neither  expressed the wish nor gave the instruction to transfer the  official. According to the BKA statement, the authors of the  report saying that the informer was probably a "leading member"  of the RAF had themselves evaluated the paper as unfit to be  used by a court. This means that it is unsuited for  investigating files of the public prosecutor, but it is an  assessment. However, the authors had never been urged by  superiors or external authorities to change or withdraw the  report. The contents of the report has been taken into account  in the current investigations, also regarding Steinmetz, and  were sent to the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office on 26  October 1993. The internal transfer of the head of the section  for terrorism was carried out in the BKA alone and with the  agreement of the official, it was stated. Meanwhile, the BKA  has tried to find out who might have passed on the controversial  information to the press. Since the beginning of last week, the  prosecuting authority is carrying out investigations in the BKA  because of the suspicion that official secrets were disclosed.</p>

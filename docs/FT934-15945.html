			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Battle for Australian dairy group hots up THE BATTLE for control of Associated Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy products company, intensfied yesterday, with Queensland's QUF Industries saying it was prepared to improve its offer to ADollars 2.97 a share. It had previously offered ADollars 2.95, valuing its target at ADollars 72m (USDollars 46.4m) QUF said its move followed advice that Australian Co-Operative Foods, a rival suitor, was increasing its bid to ADollars 2.96 from ADollars 2.85. QUF also said it had held further talks with the Trade Practices Commission, and expects a favourable recommendation next week. The takeover battle follows a spate of consolidations in Australia's dairy industry. Estimates suggest QUF will control about 24.5 per cent of the dairy market nationally if it gains control of Associated Dairies, against 27 per cent for National Foods which recently won control of United Dairies. Australian Co-operative has a 22 per cent market share. Applications for shares in Austoft Holdings, the sugar cane manufacturer being floated on the Australian stock market by its UK-based parent, BM Group, have closed early, the issue being oversubscribed. BM Group, the engineering company engaged in a programme of disposals and debt reduction measures, announced plans to float off Austoft at the start of September. Lists for the 39.7m Austoft shares on offer opened three weeks ago, and were due to close on October 15. Austoft shares are being sold at ADollars 1 each, raising almost ADollars 40m. George Weston Foods, the bakeries and biscuits company which is part of the Associated British Foods group, yesterday reported an after-tax proft of ADollars 52.4m for the year ended July, compared with a ADollars 49.7m surplus last time. Sales rose from ADollars 969.5m to ADollars 1.026bn. Weston said that the bread industry had remained very competitive in the second half of the year, but that profits in this division, as in the cakes and biscuits, had been helped by new products.</p>

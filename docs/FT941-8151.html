			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Few fears over other link-ups Fears that the breakdown of Rover's relationship with Honda could harm other Anglo-Japanese joint ventures were played down yesterday by one of the few other companies to enjoy a cross-shareholding in a Japanese corporation. Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, said it did not expect the Rover affair to have a significant affect on its links with Suntory, Japan's largest whisky distiller and one of the country's biggest private companies. Since 1989, Allied-Lyons has been able to take advantage of a 1 per cent holding in the privately-owned company to distribute its alcohol products in the fiercely competitive Japanese market. In turn, Suntory has taken a 4.3 per stake in Allied Lyons - worth about Pounds 230m at yesterday's market price. Under the 40-year joint venture agreement, signed in 1989, the two groups agreed to set up distribution and marketing companies in Japan. Allied-Lyons owns 51 per cent of the distribution group and 49 per cent of the marketing company, with Suntory holding the remainder. The Osaka-based group sells Allied-Lyons' products in its home market, while the UK company distributes some Suntory products in North America. Such links are rare because Japanese companies have usually opted for outright control in the UK, often starting from greenfield sites. Toyota and Nissan have built their own car plants, for example. These investors may feel vindicated after the treatment meted out to Honda but fears of a backlash against Japanese investment in the UK seems unlikely given the Japanese preference for local ownership. Most importantly they regard the UK as a vital manufacturing base to break into European markets. It is unthinkable, therefore, that they might run away at the first hint of trouble. The priority given by Japanese companies to employee and trading relationships with component suppliers has meant that a lot of time and money has been committed during the last decade to establishing a large presence in the UK. In fact, the commitment in many areas is deepening as Japanese manufacturers have gone beyond seeing the UK simply as a cheap production country and a way to avoid trade friction when selling into European Union markets. Komatsu, the construction equipment producer, manufactures hydraulic excavators for the European market from its factory in Birtley, near Newcastle. When the plant began production in 1987 it was producing machines to Japanese designs. It now has its own UK design team, making Birtley the first Komatsu overseas plant to manufacture non-Japanese designed models. Yamazaki, the world's largest producer of computer controlled machine tools, also began manufacturing in the UK in 1987, supplying European markets. The range of products built at the Worcester plant is now being expanded to serve world markets instead of just Europe. An example of 'high yen effect' is NSK Bearings in Peterlee, County Durham, which recently secured its first orders from east Asia supplying bearings to white goods manufacturers in China and Indonesia. These previously had been supplied by NSK's parent in Japan. Japanese property and construction companies, which also established wholly owned operations in the UK, have fared less well. Companies like Kumagai which bought expensively at the peak of the property market in the late 1980 are now seeking to retrench. But this is for reasons other than a breakdown of relationships with British partners, as in the case of Honda and Rover.</p>

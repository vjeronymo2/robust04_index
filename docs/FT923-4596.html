			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: Old dog with a zest for life - The Bottom Line A ROLL CALL of Reckitt &amp; Colman's brands sounds like a recitation of the shopping lists of consumers all around the world. Many of the names would have been on the lists of housewives in former generations - Woolite detergent, Robin starch, Colman's mustard, Robinson's barley water. Others - like Down to Earth in the UK, Maison Verte in France and Casa Verde in Spain  -are newcomers to the supermarket shelves. None of the group's leading brands costs more than a few pounds and all are, more or less, daily necessities. As such, Reckitt's looks a safe bet in a recession. And, on Thursday, the company proved its merits with half-year profits ahead, if not by much, and trading margins higher yet again. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 134.2m (Pounds 127.6m) and trading margins 16.2 per cent (14.8 per cent). Few companies supplying the volume-driven supermarkets have been able to increase their own margins in the present hostile trading climate. And even selling into 120 different countries around the world, most of Reckitt's important markets are in recession. So, the margin improvement is creditable, although much of it came from the disposal of lower-margin businesses such as its US spice and seasoning subsidiary and its South African food activities. Underneath the bushel of what look fairly unexciting figures, however, Reckitt is hiding a light. The group has pursued productivity and efficiency gains ruthlessly, more than offsetting a rise in marketing costs. These costs have been increasing as a proportion of sales for some years now and Vernon Sankey, the chief executive, says the group aims to continue heavy investment in its brands to keep up their profiles and push their market shares forward. But he reckons this heavy investment can be financed from ever greater efficiencies, The secret to making those, says finance director Iain Dobbie, is never to think you have finished. The group has, for example, been re-organising its European manufacturing activities. Rather than make the range of products in factories throughout the Continent, the aim has been to focus production of one group of products in one place. This has already produced savings and more are expected. The strategy of investing in existing brands, adding new ones in the same categories, or extending ranges (such as adding Dettox disinfectant cleaner to the Dettol antiseptic range) or launching established brands in new countries (like the launch of Lemsip, the cold treatment, in Australia) is a change from the one the company pursued in the 1980s. Sankey explains that, in the past decade, the group's plan was to make acquisitions which gave it critical mass in its chosen product and geographical areas. These deals included the Pounds 165m purchase of Airwick, the air fresheners' business, in 1984; the acquisition of Durkee Famous Foods for Pounds 80m in 1986; and, most importantly, the Dollars 1.25bn purchase of Boyle-Midway of the US in 1990. A number of disposals have been made recently, bringing in more than Pounds 150m in cash; and at the time of the Boyle-Midway deal, the group raised Pounds 200m through an issue of convertible capital bonds (which are regarded as equity since there is no facility for redemption in cash only through conversion to shares). Even so, the level of debt - which was Pounds 338m net at the end of 1991; 47 per cent of shareholders' funds - is still high. Gearing would look much worse but for the inclusion on the balance sheet of Pounds 587m worth of acquired brands. But if the big acquisitions are a thing of the past, the group may now be able to cut borrowings through good cash generation. The high marketing costs are not capitalised, and the group does not revalue the brands in its balance sheet upwards. Reckitt is unfortunate in being placed in the health and household sector, where most of the companies are big drug groups such as Glaxo and Wellcome. Were it included in the food manufacturing sector - like them, it sells most of its products to the food retailers - its performance would look better.</p>

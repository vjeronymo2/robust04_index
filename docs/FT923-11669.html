			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Consumer demand remains weak WEAK consumer demand has been underlined by government figures published yesterday showing that retail sales volumes fell 0.2 per cent last month compared with May. The seasonally adjusted figures show that people are still refraining from large increases in shop spending, a factor holding back recovery. On an underlying basis, retail sales have shown a small increase since earlier this year after a flat period between the third quarter of 1991 and the first quarter of this year. With shop sales accounting for about a quarter of the economy, though, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, needs a much bigger increase if anything other than a fragile upturn is to develop in coming months. Retail sales volumes in the second quarter were 0.6 per cent up on the first quarter. They showed a 1.3 per cent rise on the corres-ponding period last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, food retailing showed a 0.7 per cent rise in the April - June period, while non-food businesses increased sales volumes by 0.2 per cent. Shops selling clothing and footwear showed a 2 per cent increase in the second quarter compared with the first, and retailers in household goods saw a 1 per cent fall. The small decrease in sales volumes for the retail sector last month compared with May contrasted with market expectations of a 1 per cent increase. It came after a revised 0.4 per cent rise in sales volumes between April and May. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said June had been 'difficult' for most retailers. One bright spot had been good sales of fruit and vegetables, and food and drink generally. Sales of furniture and carpets had been depressed because of the flat housing market.</p>

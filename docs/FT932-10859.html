			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): Decisive factor is performance - Home or away? Philip Coggan on options for investment managers DOES it matter where a pension fund manager is based? Can an international portfolio be managed successfully from London or does the manager need offices in the countries concerned? There is one powerful argument in favour of each viewpoint. The London-based managers would argue distance lends perspective; that they can be more objective about trends in an overseas market, whereas local managers can be 'carried away' with prevailing bullish or bearish sentiment. Local managers would retort the London-based managers cannot back up their claims. Figures from Combined Actuarial Performance Services Limited show that, if managers matched the indices, they should have achieved a cumulative return on overseas equities of 16.9 per cent per annum between 1982 and 1991. In fact, they earned just 14.6 per cent per annum over the period. The argument from locally-based groups is that only by being in the country concerned can managers be alive to the trends. Colin Lever, senior partner at actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'My gut feeling is that you do better in your own market than you do in other people's. 'Property in particular,' he says, 'is something that people think is the same in other countries as it is in their own.' This, according to Mr Lever, is where they are led astray. 'British investors have had disasters investing in Brussels property in the 1970s and in the US in the late 1980s. The Swedes and the Japanese were buying UK property at inflated prices in 1987-9.' According to actuaries, there is insufficient statistical evidence to prove the case one way or the other. Julia Hobart, senior consultant at Mercer Fraser, says the firm has done some work on this question. 'It is a little inconclusive but there seems to be some mild evidence that there is merit in hiring a company which is based locally.' But, warns Ms Hobart, 'performance may depend on the nature of the local market, particularly whether small cap stocks are outperforming large-cap stocks. You would expect the local manager to be better able to pick small stocks. The local manager is also more likely to outperform in a less efficient market.' Gordon J Clark, of actuaries Clay and Partners, says: 'Locally-based investment managers may be able to trade more efficiently and quickly. Market timing and use of broker facilities may be evaluated more effectively.' These points are underlined as far as the US stock market is concerned by Mr Jim Conzleman, who is vice-president of Fleming Capital Management in New York, part of the London-based Robert Fleming group. 'As far as large cap managers go in the US equity market the London-based manager is not at a great disadvantage to the locally-based adviser,' he says. 'Broker coverage is thorough and this is a pretty efficient area of the market.' But with small company stocks it is different. 'The more companies one can research first hand and get to know the better off one will be,' Mr Conzleman says. There are also dealing pitfalls. 'One is better served by having one's own trader acting on the spot than by leaving open orders from London, only to come in next morning and find that the deal was put through at the least advantageous price of the day.' However, Mr Lever warns it might not be sensible to compare the international manager's performance with the local index. 'If a UK pension fund invests in Australia, it might well underperform the local index. But it is probably going to Australia to gain exposure to stocks which are not available in the UK, particularly natural resources companies. If that part of the market did badly, you would underperform.' One UK fund manager says overseas managers have had a good chance to outperform in Japan. 'Straightforward value techniques have knocked the pants off the index over the past few years and the index has knocked the pants off the local managers. Quantitative techniques can easily be applied outside the country concerned. The more complex the market, the better it is to be standing at a distance.' It is a debate which is likely to continue for some years. The question is inevitably bound up with the issue of whether managers employ a general manager or specialists for the separate sections of their portfolios. Ms Hobart says those who follow the specialist route tend to favour local managers. Mr Clark says: 'The use of locally-based investment managers necessitates a strong, centrally-based asset allocation decision-making process. If not, there is a danger that there is no overall perspective of global relative market valuation levels.' He adds: 'Thematic approaches arising from the asset allocation process tend to become blurred through the use of local managers.' UK-based managers retain a strong position - indeed they have been quite successful in marketing themselves to US pension funds as managers for the global element of portfolios. Overseas fund managers will increasingly come to the UK to claim their shares of the UK pension fund market. Meanwhile, UK management companies may well use a global network of offices, if they have one, as a key selling point in their services. But, says Mr Lever, 'most trustees would regard the proof of the pudding as in the eating. The question is: has the network done them any good?' In the end, it is performance, not rhetoric, which will settle the debate.</p>

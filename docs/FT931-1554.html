			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / ITV output worries few in poll on violence THE RESULTS of an Independent Television Commission survey of attitudes to commercial network television indicate that people are not increasingly taking offence at the amount of sex, bad language and violence on television. The survey questioned 1,239 people aged 16 and over and was conducted last year as part of the commission's statutory obligations. Seventy per cent said they found nothing offensive on commercial network television. That compares with 72 per cent in 1991, 70 per cent in 1990 and 65 per cent in 1989. Nothing offensive was found on BBC1 by 74 per cent (75 per cent in 1991); BBC2 scored 80 per cent (the same as 1991); and Channel 4 registered 72 per cent (73 per cent in 1991). Among cable and satellite TV viewers - surveyed for the first time - 93 per cent were not offended by satellite film channels. Of the 1,603 people asked about cable and satellite TV, only 4 per cent cited violence as a source of offence. Television: the Public's View.

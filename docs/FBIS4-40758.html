			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin's senior economic adviser  Aleksandr Lifshits said, in Saturday's interview with Interfax,  that the next stage of the government's privatization scheme  must be presented to the people as a federal law.    All decisions on further privatization must be made by joint  effort, Lifshits said. He predicted that Moscow and the  provinces would debate the right to sell formerly state-owned  property and said there would be problems with the division of  revenues and different views of who was to control the stocks  which had fallen into the government's lap.    The Russian legislature was to decide whether the Russian  government or the State Property Committee would be entitled to  sell the country's major industrial enterprises.    In Lifshits' view, it would be very difficult to pass  appropriate legislation, "more difficult, in fact, than have a  national budget approved by the Federal Assembly". But, he  said, Federal legislation must underlie moves for more  privatization, or else there would be a collision of different  views. Lifshits hoped, however, that different approaches would  be discussed "in a civilized manner" without hindering work for  civic accord.</p>

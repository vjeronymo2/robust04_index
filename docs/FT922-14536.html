			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / The European Market: Bananas put Community's honour at stake  -Brussels faces one of its toughest quota decisions tomorrow THE EC's Single Market will be incomplete without them. A Uruguay Round trade deal looks even less likely without them. The honour of the Community is at stake because of them. As a result of this, they are the object of one of the most intense lobbying operations the EC has witnessed. So there are things you may not have suspected about bananas - not the fruit of choice of the European Commission at the moment. For after four years of circular argument, the 17 commissioners are supposed tomorrow to make up their minds whether to make bananas grown in the EC's outlying territories and former colonies subject to increasing competition from much cheaper bananas from Central America. The Commission is divided, as are the 12 member states. So the fruit, as one official punned, may not be ripe for decision and slip off the agenda for a third time in a month. The EC faces a genuine and serious conflict of obligations. Brussels is also all too aware of the potential for headline ridicule if it falls out publicly on how to reconcile these obligations. The Community gets three out of every five of the 3.4m tonnes of bananas it consumes from Central America, Colombia and Ecuador, marketed principally by multinationals such as Chiquita and United Brands. These large plantation bananas, from the so-called dollar zone, are produced at around half the price of Eurobananas, which share the rest of the market. The latter come mostly from smallholders in hilly overseas territories such as France's Martinique and Guadeloupe, former colonies like the four Windward Islands (where two out of three bananas eaten in the UK come from), or offshore island provinces like Spain's Canary Islands, Portugal's Madeira, or Greece's Crete. They enter duty-free, whereas dollar bananas in most EC member states face quotas, as well as a 20 per cent tariff everywhere except Germany, where the fruit is accordingly cheaper, and over a third of Community imports are consumed. The EC has to try to reconcile itself to creating an open market in bananas from next January, while ensuring its own and Caribbean producers are not wiped out by dollar bananas with which they cannot compete, and yet at the same time meeting its commitments to Gatt, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As part of the five-year old Uruguay Round, Gatt requires all farm products to have import tariffs, which would be gradually lowered over the next six years if an overall deal on trade liberalisation is reached by the Easter deadline it has set. Yet the EC has prior treaty obligations. Under the Lome Convention, a trade and development agreement with 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, a special banana protocol says the EC will not place ACP producers 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or present'. The Canaries and Madeira are protected by the accession treaties for Spain and Portugal. And should the EC decide on tariffs for dollar bananas, it has to get around the original banana protocol, to the Treaty of Rome itself, which guaranteed unimpeded access for a Germany starved of its favourite fruit during the war and post-war years. A sizeable minority of the Commission wants to set tariffs on dollar bananas, while a narrow majority wants to seek exemption from Gatt rules and set quotas. Two or three commissioners appear undecided, but if tariffs win the day, France, Spain, Portugal, maybe Greece and Italy, and possibly even the UK, could combine to overturn the decision once it reaches the member states. The tariff-iers want a hefty duty of Ecu353 (Pounds 253) a tonne - the difference between the highest import price for Eurobananas and the lowest import price from the dollar zone in 1986-88 - on top of the standard 20 per cent tariff. This would apply to dollar zone imports over 1.4m tonnes. In addition, the tariff proponents would seek aid to help EC banana producers restructure their economies, and safeguard clauses within Gatt. Seeking exemptions from Gatt will, they argue, unravel the Uruguay Round package so far assembled, leading Japan to take out its rice, and the US to seek waivers for milk, sugar, cotton and peanuts. The quota defenders, led by Commission president Jacques Delors, believe that even high tariffs will not protect the banana producers adequately, and that EC standing will be more damaged if it dishonours treaty obligations than if it seeks flexibility within commitments it has yet formally to assume within Gatt. A compromise is being floated for an 'unbound' tariff - meaning the EC would have discretion to vary it. But while its proponents believe this may be acceptable to Gatt, it is unlikely to be acceptable to the US, unless the EC makes other costly concessions. In the EC Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Mermaz, the influential French agriculture minister, warned last week that the issue was 'not a question of liberalisation but of the right to live'. Hordes of lobbyists for the Caribbean producers, many of which earn up to three-quarters of their hard currency from bananas, warn of Haiti-like breakdown in these countries, making them easy prey for drug traffickers using the western seaboard into the US. The dollar zone producers, they say, have the whole US market, and will have all of eastern Europe, as well as three-fifths of the west European market. They disbelieve Commission assurances that EC competition rules will prevent the dollar zone multinationals from concentrating their fire within individual member states to drive ACP producers out. Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, said last month in Brussels and London that tarification could not protect their industry. 'If we lost the industry, we would lose the country,' she predicted. 'It would be the beginning of despair.' Under these circumstances, no formula the Commission decides on is likely to be neat, or safe from criticism.</p>

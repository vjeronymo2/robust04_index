Von Weizsaecker also said Germany attaches great importance  to China's consistent support for his country's struggle to  overcome national separation.    Qiao expressed his appreciation on the one China stance,  saying that this is the major reason why the relations between  China and Germany can be developed smoothly.    Von Weizsaecker said Germany is in an important position in  Europe while China is an important country in Asia.    "It is a very good development that the relationship between  our two countries becomes closer and closer," he added.    Qiao expressed the hope that following its reunification,  Germany will play a more positive role in Europe and the rest of  the world.    During the meeting, the president reaffirmed Germany's  support for the restoration of China's status as a signatory  party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which  was also appreciated by Qiao.

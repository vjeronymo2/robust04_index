			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] According to a XIZANG RIBAO report, Tibet made  headway in improving its infrastructure last year, focusing on  energy and communications construction. Investments in fixed  assets were up 15 percent from 1992 to reach 1.59 billion yuan,  guaranteeing a sustained and healthy development of the regional  economy.    Judging from a comprehensive analysis of the situation last  year, remarkable achievements were made in the capital  construction of telecommunications in Tibet. In communications,  achievements were made mainly in upgrading the existing highways  and ensuring their traffic. Investments in energy were focused  on the construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power  stations. As Tibet's electricity is mostly generated by  hydroelectric power plants, the region paid particular attention  to ensure power supply during winter drought season for the next  two years. In transport, the annual plan for renovating major  highways was completed on schedule. Last year the region  invested 300 million yuan in highway capital construction.  Maintenance and construction proceeded relatively smoothly on  the Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, the  three major national highways in which the Ministry of  Communications invested and are covered by the state's Eighth  Five-Year Plan and the 10-Year Program. The reconstruction of  the (?Xigaze-Gonggar) highway, a key regional construction  project, was started last October. After completion, the  highway will improve the traffic condition between Lhasa and  Shannan. In aviation construction, expansion of the Gonggar  Airport was completed and put into operation. The project to  upgrade the main runway of the (?Baingoin) Airport was basically  completed.    Last year, construction of the (Yanghu) and (Chalong) power  stations, two key regional projects, overfulfilled the annual  construction plan with good quality. An investment of 240  million yuan was made in the construction of the (Yanghu)  water-pumping and pumped storage station; and the station's  first generating unit is expected to generate electricity on  schedule at the end of 1995. At that time, the problem of power  supply for production and everyday life in Lhasa will be solved  once and for all. The (Chalong) power station in Nagqu was  throttled last year ahead of schedule. The whole project is  expected to be completed and put into operation in 1996. To  alleviate the current power shortage, the Lhasa thermal power  plant, in which 14 million yuan was invested to upgrade its  technology, was put into operation last December. The total  investment scale in 1994 will reach 2.05 billion yuan, and most  of the investment will be spent on projects related to  infrastructure.</p>

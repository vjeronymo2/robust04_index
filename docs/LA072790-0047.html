			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON URGED TO BAN NORTHROP AS A CONTRACTOR  </P> <P> The Justice Department has recommended that the Pentagon bar Northrop Corp.  from future defense contracts as a result of the firm's guilty plea to criminal  fraud for faking tests on a nuclear cruise missile program. Moreover, the  weapon now appears to have more serious problems than previously believed.  </P> <P> Justice Department attorneys argued to the Air Force that the gravity of  Northrop's felonies in the case "should give rise" to a prohibition on new  Pentagon business for the entire corporation. Such a penalty would mark the  first time that a major defense contractor has been locked out of the Pentagon.  In the past, divisions or subsidiaries of major defense contractors have been  temporarily suspended, but a ban on new business -- known as a debarment -- can  be permanent.  </P> <P> However, Air Force officials have argued for a relatively weak settlement that  would allow the Los Angeles firm to resume normal business and bear only a  minor share of the costs of the government's investigation. A final decision on  debarment is now being considered by an Air Force panel. In the meantime, the  Northrop division involved in the cruise missile fraud has been under  indefinite suspension for a year.  </P> <P> The position of Air Force officials toward Northrop appears to fit a pattern in  which the Pentagon has attempted to protect Northrop from criminal liability,  according to documents and testimony by several witnesses that will be  introduced at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing today.  </P> <P> After allegations surfaced in 1987 that Northrop's Western Services Department  in Pomona, Calif., had been systematically falsifying tests on a guidance  system for the Air Force's air-launched cruise missile and for a stabilization  system for the Marine Corps Harrier jet, the services moved to waive certain  requirements that were not being met, according to Justice Department  officials. Those actions undercut the Justice Department's efforts to prosecute  Northrop, according to the officials.  </P> <P> Although Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 felony counts of improper  testing and paid a $17-million criminal fine, the Justice Department dismissed  a part of its indictment that charged two Northrop executives with felonies.  Now, Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey, who is chief of the public corruption  and government fraud section of the Justice Department's Los Angeles office, is  arguing strongly for a debarment of Northrop.  </P> <P> "We are not aware of a more significant prosecution (than against Northrop),"  Fahey said in an internal Justice Department memo sent in March. "This is the  first time we are aware that a major defense contractor has been convicted of  failing to conduct critical tests on a nuclear weapon system. If any case cries  out for debarment, this is the case. If ever the American people deserve to be  protected from the type of reckless and potentially life-threatening conduct,  this is it."  </P> <P> The issue of debarment is being considered by the Air Force Suspension and  Debarment Board, a high-level panel in the Pentagon. The board was about to  sign a settlement with Northrop in March when Fahey intervened and objected to  the lax terms proposed by Air Force attorneys.  </P> <P> Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio noted that Fahey himself had moved in court  earlier this year to dismiss the charges against the two Northrop executives,  Joseph Yamron and Leopold Engler, citing "the interest of justice and based  upon the government's assessment of the case."  </P> <P> Cantafio added: "They dismissed the charges inside the courtroom and now they  are trying to have a trial outside the courtroom -- in whose interests I don't  know."  </P> <P> The charges dismissed against the two executives involved allegations that  Northrop knowingly used a type of damping fluid in a gyroscope for the cruise  missile's flight data transmitter that would freeze at temperatures under which  it was required by contract to operate.  </P> <P> The contract called for the gyroscope to operate at minus 65 degrees  Fahrenheit, but the damping fluid used by Northrop freezes at that temperature.  An internal Northrop report dating to the early 1980s and delivered to Yamron  clearly states that the fluid did not meet contractual requirements.  </P> <P> After the Justice Department began its investigation into the issue, however,  the Air Force stepped in. It agreed to modify a test of the gyroscope's ability  to meet the cold temperature requirement so that the test conformed to  Northrop's "theory" of how it should be conducted. That "theory" limited the  duration of the gyroscope's exposure to minus 65 degrees, permitting the device  to avoid freezing.  </P> <P> That key concession "was a severe blow" the the Justice Department  investigation, according to Mark M. Richard, deputy assistant attorney general  for the criminal division.  </P> <P> Since that decision, Northrop and the Air Force have argued that the flight  data transmitter is working and that it has caused no operational problems for  the cruise missile. But congressional investigators say that the Air Force has  avoided failures by carefully not subjecting the missile to the low  temperatures normally experienced in operations.  </P> <P> Moreover, an internal Justice Department memo earlier this year accused the Air  Force of knowingly withholding documents that showed that the Northrop  deficiencies had severely affected the cruise missile's performance.  </P> <P> According to one letter from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, the Air  Force knew that the cruise missiles were failing when subjected to temperatures  that commonly occur at altitudes above 30,000 feet.  </P> <P> Air Force officials denied that the missile has performance problems.  </P> <P> "The air-launched cruise missile is a reliable and fully mission-capable weapon  system in which we have complete confidence," an Air Force spokesman said  Thursday. "It has been subjected to rigorous and redundant testing. The Air  Force has conducted 74 air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) test missions and our  data has never indicated a problem with the flight data transmitter freezing.  The average test mission subjects the missile to a five-hour subzero . . .  temperature test prior to launch. As far as we can determine, the alleged  testing improprieties have not had an impact on the operational capability of  the ALCM or any of its subcomponents."  </P> <P> But the Air Force statement leaves unclear whether the cruise missiles  currently meet the minus-65-degree requirement. The statement notes that the  missile is subjected to subzero temperatures for five hours, but not whether  those are below minus 65 Fahrenheit. In addition, the statement indicates that  the missile has never failed a "test mission," but it does not address aborted  test missions or test flights themselves.  </P> <P> An Air Force spokesman said late Thursday that the service could not elaborate.  </P> <P> Investigators for Claremont, Calif., attorney Herbert Hafif, who represents  former Northrop employees who brought the original cruise missile allegations  under a False Claims Act suit, said that the Air Force's own field reports of  such test missions often note that tests were aborted for "inclement weather."  </P> <P> "What it amounts to is that they get tested at warmer temperatures," Hafif  said. "So, then they can say the cold temperature will not affect performance.  They never freeze them down to where the damping fluid really had a chance to  freeze."  </P> <P> The cruise missiles are deployed on the wings of B-52 bombers, which loiter for  hours in flight in the Arctic at altitudes above 35,000 feet. Temperatures can  easily drop below minus 65 degrees.  </P> <P> An investigation into the entire problem was prepared by Boeing, the cruise  missile's prime contractor. The Boeing investigation report, a copy of which  was obtained by The Times, said Boeing's concern was raised by a large number  of failures of the Northrop device at Air Force depots. But Boeing concluded  that the Air Force depots' test was not proper.  </P> <P> Overall, the Boeing investigation found, "The demonstrated reliability of the  FDT (flight data transmitter) has been found to not degrade the missile  performance."  </P> <P> But the Boeing study cites a failure of three flight data transmitters in 125  tests conducted up to Feb. 16, 1988, in which the missile was mounted on a wing  and flown but not launched. That represents a failure rate of 2.4% for a single  part of the missile, which investigators consider unacceptable because there  are hundreds of such parts that can fail.  </P> <P> It was unclear why Boeing reported three flight data transmitters failures, but  the Air Force reported none.  </P> <P> Hafif severely faults the Justice Department for dropping the issue, saying  that the Air Force's actions in reducing the test requirements did not absolve  Northrop.  </P> <P> Northrop's Cantafio said: "Those actions (falsifying tests) took place in a  30-person satellite operation in Pomona. This company acted in a responsible  way by closing the plant, firing the plant manager and three other employees.  We did what any responsible company would do when the matter came to our  attention."  </P> <P> The hearing today was called by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the  House Energy and Commerce Committee. Pentagon and Justice Department officials,  as well as a former Northrop controller, are expected to testify.  </P></p>

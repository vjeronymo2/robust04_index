According to the minister, Denmark gives priority to relations  with the Baltic States.    "We will continue to support Lithuania politically, morally  and economically," said the Danish official at a press  conference in Vilnius on November 25.    The Danes have already rendered assistance to the Lithuanian  economy totalling around 20 million Danish krones. This week  they brought a package of new projects to Vilnius. Lithuanian  Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas called the latest program  a new impulse in Denmark's determination to co-operate with  Lithuania.    The current visit of the Danish Energy Minister is aimed at  environmental protection, energy saving and efficiency programs.  Lithuania is interested in studying the Danish experience in  supplying and saving heating energy.    On November 27, Mr. Sjursen visited the Ignalina Nuclear  Power Plant and the Moletai region, where a boiler-house, using  local timber waste, is about to be assembled. The modern  boiler-house was donated by the Danish government.</p>

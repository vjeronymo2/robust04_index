			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Iran denies exile claim of explosion AN IRANIAN exile office claimed last night that the home of Iran's spiritual leader, Seyed Ali Khamenei, had been rocked by an explosion, but the claim was immediately denied in Iran, agencies report. The French office of exiled Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr claimed several people were killed in the blast yesterday afternoon. An official of the Iranian newsagency IRNA denied there had been any explosion at Khamenei's home. A statement from the Tehran Times said: 'This story has no base, no truth.' Khamenei became Iran's spiritual leader after the death in 1989 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the country's Islamic fundamentalist revolution a decade earlier. Mr Bani-Sadr was the Ayatollah's first president but went into exile in 1980 after falling out with the regime. The report comes a day after an Iranian opposition figure was shot dead in a Rome street.</p>

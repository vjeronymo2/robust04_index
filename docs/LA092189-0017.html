			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PRIVATIZATION' IS A BLUNT WEAPON AGAINST MINORITIES  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court majority, which has been unsympathetic to the historic  aspirations of racial minorities, is not the only "uncivil" legacy of the  Reagan Administration. Another right-wing obsession, the "privatization" of  public-service jobs, is also having a pernicious impact on what had been, until  the Reagan years, a dramatic expansion of the minority middle class.  </P> <P> With a singular determination and fervor, the conservative majority of the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors is following the Reagan policy by  attempting to place virtually every county service, from hospitals to airports,  in the world of private profit.  </P> <P> With 80,000 workers, the Board of Supervisors is the single largest employer in  the county. Minorities make up 60% of the county work force. Of the total  county work force 30%, or 20,000, are black; 18%, or about 13,000, are Latino,  and nearly 26,000 are minority women.  </P> <P> Black and Latino workers, confronted by private-sector discrimination, have  traditionally found an avenue of escape from economic circumscription through  government employment. Equal opportunity and affirmative-action gains in the  '60s and '70s brought more hiring and advancement opportunities for minorities  in public employment. Collective-bargaining agreements helped ensure  wage-and-benefit packages higher than those generally accessible to minority  workers. Public employment has been, and remains, a principal engine of  minority economic progress.  </P> <P> This progress is being derailed. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have  provided new opportunities for employers to discriminate. And "The Widening  Divide," a recent study by UCLA, has found that the cost of being a minority  worker has increased over the past two decades. Even after accounting for  education and experience, black men earn 30% less than white men. The gap  between Chicano men and white men has grown from less than 10% in 1970 to about  20% in 1987. Not surprisingly, black family income has stagnated for 20 years;  Chicano family income is declining.  </P> <P> Against this backdrop, privatization and the subsequent conversion of  decent-paying public jobs to low-wage private jobs must be viewed, at best, as  studied indifference to equal-employment opportunity and also as a contributor  to the suppression of black and Latino income. To date, the Board of  Supervisors has contracted out 4,000 jobs, with thousands more scheduled to be  privatized within the next two years.  </P> <P> About 5,000 clerical jobs, largely held by black and Latino women, will soon be  privatized, too. This summer, nearly 50 such jobs were "sold" to a private  vendor, who will pay his new workers up to $700 less per month than the county,  which pays $1,900.  </P> <P> Thousands of temporary contract workers, the fastest-growing segment of the  county work force, are replacing full-time workers. The vast majority are paid  $4 to $6 per hour and receive no benefits, constituting a new "working poor,"  who must turn to public agencies and private charities for health care, food  stamps and other necessities. Ironically, money that taxpayers are allegedly  saved by contracting out services will likely be more than offset by the  increased cost of publicly financed income subsidies.  </P> <P> If minority and other public-sector workers lose, do minority and small  businesses at least gain from this county budget pork-barrel? They do not. The  county has no affirmative action or small business "set-asides," and small  business entrepreneurs cannot afford to underbid industry giants.  </P> <P> Privatization does not even meet its short-term objectives of efficiency and  cost effectiveness.  </P> <P> In this year's review of the state budget, California's chief legislative  analyst held the privatization plans at least 50% responsible for the loss of  $22 million in revenue to the state, $3 million to Los Angeles County and $25  million to poor families who would have received support had services been  adequately performed.  </P> <P> In fairness, it must be added that privatization horror stories concern not  just Los Angeles County. The local media recently reported on the "hellish"  road trips of prisoners transported by private guards. In one incident, a woman  prisoner filed a lawsuit claiming one of the guards had raped her. The same  company recently got an exclusive contract with the California Department of  Corrections to transport prisoners to state institutions.  </P> <P> Privatization is bad economics. In the short run, there is evidence that it is  more costly and less efficient. In the long run, the ultimate, and not so  hidden, cost is the slow impoverishment of minority workers and their  communities. Until now, the privatization discussion has been dominated by its  proponents' questionable claims of cheaper public services. Against the  landscape of deepening economic troubles for minority and all middle- and  low-income workers, the real issues must be the quality of those services and  the role of government in furthering economic and social justice.  </P></p>

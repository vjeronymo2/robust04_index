			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: 5 groups bid for Israeli tunnel Five groups of Israeli and international companies have been selected for the final stage of an international tender to construct a Dollars 150m highway tunnel and toll road near the Israeli city of Haifa. The Haifa or 'Carmel' tunnel, expected to be completed by the year 2000, is the first infrastructure project in Israel to be submitted to international tender and the first in which all stages of production will be carried out by private contractors. The highway will be the first toll road in Israel and if successful the project could pave the way for the private sector into a vast array of infrastructure projects in transport, water and communications. The groups picked for the 5km Carmel tunnel are international companies specialising in tunnelling and electronic traffic control systems to operate toll roads. Among companies included in the groups are Astaldi of Italy, Fougerolle International of France, Dragados Construcciones of Spain, Autostrade of Italy, Parsons Brinckerhoff of the US, Abay TS of France and LK Comstock, a US subsidiary of Spie Batignoles of France.</p>

			<p>Less     than two weeks after normalizing relations with Paris,  Beijing appears to be rewarding France for its recent pledge not  to authorize the sale of arms to Taiwan.  According to Beijing's  English-language paper China Daily, a French transportation  engineering firm recently "clinched" a "$5 million plus"  consulting contract to help "supervise and manage" the  construction of the new Guangzhou subway (24 January).  When  relations between Beijing and Paris had soured after France  agreed in November 1992 to sell 60 Mirage 2000 jet fighters to  Taiwan, Guangzhou Mayor Li Zilin told the PRC-owned Hong Kong  daily Wen Wei Po that he had been "ordered" to halt cooperation  with France in the construction of the city's subway and "revoke"  the eligibility of French companies to "participate in and bid"  on the project (29 December 1992).  More recently, the well-  connected independent Hong Kong journal Ming Pao reported that  Chinese authorities had decided not "to allow France to take part  in the first-phase construction of the Guangzhou subway" because  of "the political factor of France's selling fighters to Taiwan"  (23 May 1993).

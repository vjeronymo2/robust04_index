			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ISN'T COPING WITH DIVERSITY  </P> <P> Orange County is not doing a good job of handling diversity in its  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> One reason is the coverage given to minorities often slants toward bad  elements. The positive contributions that minorities like the De Silvas  ("Vandals Leave Signs of Race Hatred," Nov. 20) bring are overlooked.  </P> <P> It is hard for warped, bigoted minds to grasp the idea that the minority come  in all glorious colors. They are the law-abiding, true Americans. The superior  attitudes often rampant in the county brings the criminal element crawling out  like vermin.  </P> <P> VERA JACKSON, Corona  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Golden triangle Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are currently in South America. At 12,000ft up in the Andes, where the Incas once preserved the mummified remains of their nobility, we found a golden triangle of ski resorts glistening beneath the Chilean sun. Not long ago, the mummified body of an Inca child was found on the lower slope of El Plomo (17,810ft). Today, this peak towers above the twin valleys in which three of South America's best ski resorts are found within a mile or so of each other: La Parva, Valle Nevado and El Colorado. Each is a significant ski area in its own right. Together, they form the biggest and most exciting ski area in South America, less than 40 miles from Santiago. They are very different in style and terrain. La Parva, where the well-to-do of Santiago have second or even third homes, has some of the most challenging and varied skiing. It has no hotel, but one is planned. Valle Nevado is an upmarket, expensive French-owned resort with excellent open-bowl skiing. The resort complex is built above the Valle del Cepo, a vast snowy ravine, which is not part of the ski area. Nevertheless, skiers occasionally stray into the valley by mistake, and the resort maintains a refuge stocked with basic rations to provide shelter until a third party can reach them. El Colorado, arguably Chile's biggest ski area, mainly attracts day-trippers. It has some sublime off-piste skiing, with the steep powder-fields of Santa Teresita stretching more than two miles down to the road that snakes its way up to Valle Nevado. But you need to arrange transport back, and preferably a guide (ours was Orlando Diaz, head of the ski patrol). Between them the three areas have more than 100km of skiing and more than 40 lifts. They are linked but as yet do not have a simple Three-Valleys-style lift ticket. Although it is easy to ski from Valle Nevado - which attracts an international clientele - to each of the other two, direct access between La Parva and El Colorado is not so clear cut, partly because of rivalry: both are vying for local skiers from Santiago. No other capital city in the world has so much skiing on its doorstep as Santiago. Not much further afield is Portillo right on the Argentine border and the Trans-Andean (Uspallata) pass which provides access via Mendoza to Las Lenas and some of the best skiing in Argentina.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (7): Time may be right for freedom - Karen Fossli sees signs of recovery among Norway's commercial banks NORWAY'S ailing commercial bank sector has at last begun to show signs of recovery, to judge by this year's first-quarter results. The improvement has persuaded the government that the time may be right to embark on a reprivatisation programme. The first target next year is likely to be the Christiania Bank (CBK), the country's second biggest, in which the state owns about 98.8 per cent of the share capital. The state also controls about 70 per cent of the share capital of Den norske Bank, the country's biggest commercial bank, while Fokus Bank, the third biggest commercial bank, is wholly state-owned. More than NKr27bn has been pumped into the bank sector over the past five years through state-backed bank guarantee and investment funds and by the banks' own guarantee funds. Financial deregulation is at the heart of the banking crisis. It fuelled competition but led to less-than-prudent domestic and foreign expansion. After Norway's oil-dependent economy plunged into recession in 1986 world crude oil prices fell to below Dollars 6 a barrel. This culminated in the banks' collapse nearly two years ago According to London-based Davis International Banking Consultants, appointed by the government earlier this year to study capacity in the domestic banking sector, annual lending growth by commercial and savings banks - which had been running at about 15 per cent in the early 1980s - shot up to about 30 per cent between 1984 and 1988. Between 1980 and 1989 the commercial banks' loan-deposit ratio to non-bank sectors nearly doubled from 86 to more than 150 per cent, making them dangerously dependent on wholesale and international deposits. The ratio fell to about 122 per cent by the end of 1992 and to 116 per cent in this year's first quarter. For the savings banks, the non-bank loan/liability ratio rose from 72 to 117 per cent before declining to 111 per cent by the end of last year. In the first quarter of this year, there was a 2.5 per cent rise in the loan volume of the savings banks, at the expense of the commercial banks. The biggest savings bank, Sparebanken Nor, which is also the third biggest bank in Norway, is moving aggressively to boost its share of the corporate lending market. DIBC estimates these four banks have a total of 100,000 corporate clients, about 40 per cent of the 240,000 companies in Norway. Households contribute 75 per cent of funds available to financial institutions and account for 60 per cent of overall loans. The commercial banks have only about 30 per cent of retail deposits (compared with 60 per cent of corporate deposits) and 25 per cent of retail loans. With the onset of recession the banks found themselves holding bulging, non-performing loan portfolios. To make matters worse property, which serves as collateral for loans, plunged in value by an estimated 30 per cent. There are recent signs that property values have bottomed out and may even be on the upturn in some parts of Norway. Credit losses were more than halved to NKr8.7bn last year from a peak of NKr22bn in 1991. In the first quarter of 1993 CBK returned a net profit of NKr209m, against a loss of NKr86m in the same period last year while DnB cut net losses to NKr138m from NKr601m. Fokus Bank achieved a first quarter net profit of NKr36.7m, against a net loss of NKr137.6m. The improvement was due primarily to gains in shares and bonds, and to foreign currency gains. The banks were also granted subsidised loans by the central bank and ordered by the state to reduce their balance sheets and cut costs. They were helped by 12 cuts in the central bank's key overnight lending rate, currently 7.5 per cent. DIBC believes that by the end of this year Norway will have the lowest branch density among its Nordic peers and the lowest number of bank staff per inhabitants. The Association of Bank Employees estimates that some 10,000 jobs in the sector have been lost in the past five years, but that may not be the end. Both CBK and DnB warn that the high level of non-performing loans makes it far too early to call an end to the six-year banking crisis. There is growing concern about declining loan volume owing to a prolonged lack of corporate interest in investing in Norway. As the commercial banks struggle to regain profitability - there is a target return on equity of 15 to 20 per cent - they are meeting increasing competition from the savings banks and mortgage companies which have been transformed into banks. They can take some comfort from DIBC's prediction that when the European Economic Area is implemented later this year - to give banks from other European Free Trade Association countries and the European Community the right to open branches in Norway - there will be no immediate impact on the retail market. In fact, foreign banks have shown little interest in expanding to Norway and recently a couple of foreign banks closed up shop. However, DIBC forecasts that with little or no net growth in revenue, it will be necessary to make continuing cuts in branch and staff numbers to pay salary increases and achieve adequate levels of profits. 'The capacity needed for retail banking is likely to decrease by 2-3 per cent per annum for the foreseeable future,' it says. DIBC warns that the authorities could damage the banking system - and therefore the economy as a whole - by insisting on substantial cuts in capacity, particularly at commercial banks, as a short-term response to the banking crisis. 'Such a knee-jerk reaction may not be justified in relation to the banks' long-term prospects.' In Tokyo earlier this year, Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, told Japanese bankers that structural adjustments would be necessary to strengthen the financial sector. 'In our view there is still excess capacity in the banking sector,' he said. Later this year, Mr Johnsen is due to announce measures to curb capacity.</p>

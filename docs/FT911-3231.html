			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Accountancy Column: Caparo chief finds himself in the lions' den ON WEDNESDAY night last week, Daniel paid a visit to the lions' den. Daniel was Mr James Leek, chief executive of the Caparo Group. The den was Chartered Accountants' Hall, packed full for the inaugural meeting of the London Practitioner Board of the London Society of Chartered Accountants. The Caparo Group, a quoted industrial holdings company, is less well known for its products than for the legal decision that bears its name. Indeed, the Caparo decision which was taken in the House of Lords in January last year has become a landmark case for the profession. The essence of last year's decision was that a company's auditors do not owe a duty of care to potential investors in the company or to the company's individual shareholders. That decision sharply circumscribed the responsibilities of the auditing profession to third-party users of accounts. As a Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte booklet puts it: 'An investor or shareholder who relies on the company's statutory accounts when deciding to purchase shares in the company has no claim against the auditors if the accounts are negligently prepared.' The decision followed a long battle with Touche Ross over the latter's audit of Fidelity, an electronics company bought by Caparo in November 1985 in a Pounds 13.5m hostile takeover bid. Soon afterwards it became clear that all was not well with the stock or the level of reported profits, and the business was shut down and the Fidelity brand name sold. Caparo then took legal action against Touche and against Messrs Stephen and Robert Dickman, directors of the company. The Dickman brothers were found guilty of fraud in February this year. The original battle with Touche was fought over the technical legal point of whether that firm could owe a duty of care to Caparo. Caparo has recently launched a new legal action against Touche alleging negligence. Accountants were quick to welcome last year's decision, which in reducing their responsibilities also reduced their exposure to potential liabilities. After years of mounting litigation against the profession, that initial reaction was understandable; but more recently euphoria has given way to concern. Industry has always resented paying for the audit, which is, after all, a statutory obligation rather than a business necessity. The Caparo decision has exacerbated widespread disillusion about the purpose of an audit. Why have one at all if the auditors cannot be sued by third parties even if their work is negligent? Mr Leek, a chartered accountant himself, observed that the profession did not know how to react to the decision. Many accountants recognised that public confidence in the profession was at stake, he said, but others were content to hide behind the letter of the newly defined law. He complained that there had been no public statement of any significance on Caparo from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 'They have set up an auditing committee to examine the issues of the so-called expectation gap (between what the public thinks auditors are doing and what they themselves believe to be their duties), but the committee's terms of reference read rather like a PR protection exercise for our own profession, and in particular there is no mention of the Caparo case itself.' He accused the profession of sheltering behind two fine legal distinctions, saying either 'a shareholder who loses money as a result of my negligent auditing cannot sue me, but the client company can', or 'you can sue me on a prospectus (in which auditors explicitly accept liability for their audit reports) but not on a set of audited accounts'. Mr Leek had his own suggestions for the reform of the audit law. Here are the 'Caparo Five'. Auditors should be made liable for their negligence to those users of accounts who suffer loss after taking decisions based on those accounts. That would require a legislative change. Auditors should have a better defence against the increased liability which the first reform would bring about. 'That defence is the abolition of the present three-line 'true and fair' audit report,' Mr Leek argued. 'It has become meaningless and leaves so much unsaid.' Auditors should be encouraged to use qualified audit reports more frequently, where there is reasonable ground for discomfort on either the accuracy or presentation of the figures. Auditors should be encouraged to make available to shareholders a summary of their report to management - a report comprising an auditor's statement of accounting and control deficiencies and the client's response to them. 'This would enable shareholders to judge the quality and standard of accounting and control in their company.' Mr Leek argued: 'The relationship between auditors and their clients should be made less cosy. To reinforce the auditor's independence there should, for publicly quoted companies, be a limit to the number of years for which an auditor may be reappointed, and the amount of fee income from services other than audit and taxation. It would also be helpful to find a better mechanism for shareholders' involvement in the actual appointment and selection of auditors. At present they are merely a rubber stamp for the directors' recommendation.' There should be an independent review body to hear cases of auditors' negligence. The new Auditing Practices Board, successor to the Auditing Practices Committee, will not fulfil this role, although a greater number of non-accountants will be involved in setting auditing standards. Mr Leek made clear that the process of reform could not, indeed should not, be left to the accountancy profession alone. He said it could only arrive as a result of consensus between institutions, private shareholders, the government, companies - and the profession itself. Given the difficulties that the various branches of the accountancy profession have in agreeing with themselves on anything, such a consensus is unlikely. Nevertheless, Mr Leek's speech was a rare, constructive contribution to the expectation gap debate. Coming from the company whose actions prompted the debate in the first place, his suggestions are all the more welcome. An eerie calm had descended on Chartered Accountants' Hall by the time Mr Leek sat down. Only one person dared challenge him. The others appeared struck dumb by the wisdom of what the Caparo chief executive had had to say  -Daniel had silenced the lions.</p>

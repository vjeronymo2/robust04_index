			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the months following the publication of the ANPRM (55 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32218) and the associated public hearing (on September 26, 1990),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA explored the feasibility and appropriateness of applying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory negotiation procedures (under the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 583 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990) to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of this rule. Interviews and meetings were held with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives of a variety of affected industry groups and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental organizations, to assess their interest and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> willingness to participate in potential negotiations. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process indicated that there was insufficient support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory negotiation among a number of key parties. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional rulemaking procedure was then followed to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following publication of the proposed rule, EPA held a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing on May 28, 1992, and accepted comments until June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30, 1992. Public response on the NPRM included five oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentations at the hearing and the subsequent submission of 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written comments. EPA also received 13 written comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues discussed in the Notice of Reopening of Comment Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (referred to as the ``Reopening Notice'' in later portions of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document). A transcript of both public hearings and copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all written comments are available in public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A discussion of comments received since the NPRM and EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses are included in the ``Summary and Analysis of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations,'' which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is available in the public docket referenced above. All public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentary was carefully considered in developing this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Major areas of comment are described in the relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Additional Information on the Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of this rule is May 27, 1994. EPA notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the general requirement (under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), that publication or service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a substantive rule be made not less than 30 days before its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date, does not apply here. Under 5 U.S.C. 559, the APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that a subsequent statute does not supersede or modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APA except to the extent that it does so expressly. CAA section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 307(d)(1)(E) specifically applies to the promulgation or revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any regulation pertaining to any fuel or fuel additive under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA section 211. CAA section 307(d)(1) further provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``[t]he provisions of sections 533 through 557 and section 706 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title VI shall not, except as expressly provided in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsection, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nowhere does subsection 307(d) expressly provide that section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 553(d) of title 5 applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, CAA section 211(e)(2) expressly provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time period for providing the ``requisite information'' under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(e)(2) is based on the ``date of promulgation'' of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Therefore, the requirements under CAA section 211(e)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are effective on May 27, 1994. Additionally, even if section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 553(d) were to apply to the portion of the rule promulgated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the authority of section 211(b) of the CAA, there is good cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to provide less than 30 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice following publication in order to simplify implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the rule by establishing one effective date for the rule's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. As discussed in the following sections, this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides a six year time period for completing Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, commencing on May 27, 1994. EPA believes this to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient for the regulated industry to comply with the rule and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, given this compliance schedule, a reasonable amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice is provided for this type of information-gathering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. Finally, EPA has taken steps to provide notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final action to the regulated industry upon signature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that establishing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date as May 27, 1994 is reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The circular says technical secondary schools and colleges  and universities should implement on a trial basis the system of  working eight hours a day and 44 hours a week from March 1.    Schools in the same localities must use a unified  working-hour system, which may also be worked out by provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions and prefectures, or cities.</p>

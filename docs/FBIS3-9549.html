While he would ensure that continuity was maintained in  Slovak foreign policy, the existing problems should be solved  fairly quickly, said Kukan, former Czechoslovak and later Slovak  ambassador to the U.N.    The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik intended to meet  the  conditions set by the Council of Europe (CE) concerning national  minorities, he said. He himself wanted to press for bilingual  road signs in the south of Slovakia where 600,000 Hungarians  live, but said the decision would ultimately be parliament's.  (Slovak-Hungarian road signs were banned by the Meciar  government.)    Kukan also attached great importance to relations with  Austria, adding that the only thing he was "not very optimistic"  about was the problems concerning Slovak nuclear power stations.  Asked if Austria's attempts to prevent the financing of the  Mochovce nuclear power station by the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) could worsen relations  between the two countries, Kukan said he thought the  consequences would be "not at all good."    Slovakia had not yet managed to persuade the Austrians that  Mochovce would not represent a threat to the environment, he  said. "We have no choice but to hold further scientific talks,"  he added. With regard to Austrian offers to provide  supplementary electricity instead, the foreign minister said  that he did not have detailed information yet, but nonetheless  "these things should be seriously looked into one more time."    Kukan said he knew of no specific date for the integration  of  Slovakia into the European Union (EU), but could imagine it  happening "within several years." He said the change of Slovak  Government had shown that Slovakia was a democratic country,  because it had all happened without problems. The Visegrad  countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary)  would enter the EU separately, Visegrad being only "a very free  union," the foreign minister said at the end of the interview.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi by </F> Nobuaki Hanaoka, chief of SANKEI SHIMBUN political department;  place and date not given]    [Text] Details of an interview with Keigo Ouchi, chairman  of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and health and welfare  minister are as follows.    [Hanaoka] Do you feel any aftereffects from the aborted  cabinet reshuffle?    [Ouchi] If a decision had been made to reshuffle the  cabinet, it would have been split into a bloc led by the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the DSP, and a group  composed of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. The  coalition's centripetal force would have been weakened too. The  prime minister's decision to give it up was the right one.    [Hanaoka] What do you think of moves by Shinseito and the  Japan New Party [JNP] to form a joint parliamentary group?    [Ouchi] Shinseito is probably trying to make rapid advances  on the JNP with the argument that it is better that they  cooperate with the JNP and create a fresh image than form a bloc  with Komeito. I have a feeling that the prime minister is  willing to cooperate with Sinseito.    [Hanaoka] What is the SDPJ going to do about that?    [Ouchi] There will be a freshness and the necessary  organizational backup if the JNP, Sakigake [Harbinger], and the  DSP form a core group. I think this is the best way as far as  the people are concerned. However, I am not certain if we will  move in that direction following the possible breaking of a  pledge the JNP made to Sakigake and the differences in opinion  within the JNP. It is not an issue for our party alone. The  important thing is to deepen discussions.    [Hanaoka] Would you accept an offer to join Shinseito and  the JNP if they ask you to?    [Ouchi] I never thought about it. The issue of forming a  joint parliamentary group is linked to reorganization of the  political world. It is not a simple matter of having everybody  join the group. We would like to make a decision after making  it sure what other parties' intentions are.    [Hanaoka] Are you going to meet Shinseito leader Tsutomu  Hata and representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa?    [Ouchi] It is possible, of course. I, as a chairman of the  DSP, have to make a decision at the final stage.    [Hanaoka] The phrase -- union of "liberal SDPJ and DSP" --  sounds good. However, I think there are considerable  ideological differences between the two parties.    [Ouchi] The SDPJ has to renew itself, change its fundamental  policies, and get rid of the leftist line if it wants to play a  central role in reorganization of the political world. The top  leaders of the SDPJ know that the party will be isolated unless  they change. The party has a potential to change.    [Hanaoka] Do you think a joint parliamentary group or a new  new party [shin shinto] will be formed?    [Ouchi] It is certain we will have an upper house election  next year, but I think a there will be a lower house election  before that. As upper house election candidates start  campaigning up to one year before the elections, we will be  forced to make a decision this summer on the formation of any  new organization. We have to appeal to voters to find out what  sort of political forces candidates will have as their support  bases. We have to find the direction of our political  reorganization before the summer. The standard tactic is to  form a party and clarify party policies rather than trying to  get eight coalition parties cooperate in elections through the  nomination of joint candidates. However, it is not a matter of  our party alone. The next best way is to cooperate with each  other to put up joint candidates.    [Hanaoka] Differences in tactics will be fatal to a grand  union [daido danketsu].    [Ouchi] It will be a dictatorship if such a union allowed  one  particular person to freely steer the government in the way he  or she wanted. Mr. Ozawa has explained to each coalition party  that he will not allow that to happen. We need to talk about  this point very carefully.    [Hanaoka] Some people think Mr. Ozawa's power is necessary  to  settle pending issues.    [Ouchi] I do not think so. I think we were able to create  the centripetal force needed to maintain the Hosokawa  administration because the SDPJ has compromised by accepting  things that they never had previously, and also because the  eight coalition parties exercised self-restraint.    [Hanaoka] What do you think of the current Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]?    [Ouchi] Reorganization of the political world is an issue  that faces all political forces, including the LDP. I think the  LDP will split if there is a major change. The DSP is primarily  a democratic party. It is close to the LDP, therefore, and  there is a foundation from which we can promote dialogue between  ourselves. On the other hand, we are far from the SDPJ. We are  not returning to the LDP's side, even if support for the  Hosokawa administration drops. The LDP has lost  self-confidence. I think the LDP is trying to somehow outgrow  its former self.    [Hanaoka] It seems that the LDP tactically trying to take  the budget hostage.    [Ouchi] President Yohei Kono's Diet question was a de facto  declaration of his intention to recapture power. The LDP will,  in all probability, take a tough line and try to prevent us from  holding budget committee meetings. This tactic will have a  major impact on the future organization of the political world.  The scene for the political realignment will change completely  if the Hosokawa administration makes mistakes. The LDP is, in  particular, pursuing the issue of the prime minister's 100  million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin. There is no knowing what  they will do.    [Hanaoka] What do you think will happen in next year's Tokyo  gubernatorial election? Do you think Governor Suzuki will win a  fifth term?    [Ouchi] We should not allow that to happen, though I cannot  predict how the election will turn out.</p>

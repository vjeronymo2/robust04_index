			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: HK Stock Exchange to vote on rule changes THE Hong Kong Stock Exchange has called an extraordinary general meeting of its members on May 6 to vote on a proposed capital reduction and change to its rules. The meeting is a milestone in the reform of the exchange and follows an agreement reached by the exchange with the Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's financial markets watchdog, late last year over the governance of the stock market. Members of the exchange will be asked to approve a capital reduction whereby 943 shares in the exchange worth HKDollars 100,000 (USDollars 12,930) each will be reduced to HKDollars 1 and the remaining HKDollars 99,999 remitted to shareholders. Members will also be asked to approve the reintroduction of 'block voting'. A member who votes in elections for the stock exchange council must cast all the votes to which he is entitled if his vote is to be regarded as valid. Exchange members will also be asked to vote their assent to a High Court ruling of last October which found that several general meetings of the exchange were invalidly called.</p>

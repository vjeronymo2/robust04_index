			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Groping for the right numbers Critics in the US who cite Japan's closed market and Tokyo's refusal to accept numerical indicators in the framework trade negotiations could find it difficult to support their arguments with statistics. Obtaining accurate import and export figures can be almost as difficult as attempting to interpret them. The US commerce department, which tabulates data collected by the US census bureau from shipping statements, is only able to provide figures for a broad product grouping which includes not only cellular telephone handsets, but cellular base units and certain other devices, including citizen band (CB) radios. These are the only readily available figures. The leading industry trade association in the US, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, does not record or file statistics on exports to Japan, and spokesmen at half a dozen other cellular industry organisations said that they could not easily arrive at a figure. Motorola, which is the largest US seller of cellular equipment in Japan, declined to release any sales figures. The commerce department statistics demonstrate a progressive increase in the dollar amount of US cellular equipment being exported to Japan from 1984 to 1991, when the exports totalled more than Dollars 50m. Sales dropped sharply to Dollars 14.8m in 1992, before climbing back to nearly Dollars 49.5m last year.</p>

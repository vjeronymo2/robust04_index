			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): A classic case of risk and reward Investors have traditionally fared well in UK privatisations. There have been a few notable exceptions, as shareholders in British Steel can testify, but the vast majority of companies sold off by the state in the past 10 years have seen their shares outperform the market, some by a considerable margin. What, then, should investors make of the opportunity that will soon arise to invest in the UK coal industry when it is privatised later this year? British Coal is no ordinary privatisation. The government has conducted most sell-offs by putting a price on the assets and then floating the company, complete with management, on the stock market at an appropriate price. Coal is being sold differently, in part because it is seen as being a risky business. Ministers thought asking institutions and small investors to subscribe might lead to trouble and decided instead on a 'trade sale' to existing companies. Last month, RJB Mining emerged as the government's preferred choice for the three English regions of British Coal. These comprise 15 of the 16 remaining operating deep mines and account for more than 85 per cent of UK coal production. RJB is, however, a relatively small company. Whereas it is capitalised on the stock exchange at less than Pounds 160m, it needs to raise up to Pounds 1.05bn to finance its Pounds 914m bid. Outside investors will be able to take part because RJB, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, plans to raise up to Pounds 425m through issuing shares. Institutional investors, including pension funds, will be the prime target but RJB is planning to set aside 5 per cent of shares for an offer for sale in which retail (private) investors will be asked to subscribe. This will rise to 15 per cent if demand is high enough. Investors should not expect an advertising campaign along the lines of the 'Tell Sid' strategy which accompanied British Gas's move into the private sector. RJB's share offer will be for the 'sophisticated' investor - often, a euphemism for the rich. Stockbrokers are likely to advise clients that no one should put their last pennies and pounds into RJB. The company, led by chief executive Richard Budge, has a good track record in spite of its association with AF Budge, the engineering company from which it emerged two years ago shortly before that company went into receivership. RJB is well respected in the mining industry, where it made its name largely as an opencast operator. Its problem - or potential problem - is the speed of its growth. Last year was its first year as a quoted company and it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m on turnover of Pounds 75m. Assuming it completes its British Coal acquisitions, RJB expects to be making Pounds 220m annually on sales of Pounds 1.2bn by the end of the century. It is this confidence that enabled the company to offer at least 50 per cent more than the nearest rival for the English coal regions. But some analysts and quite a few executives in both the coal and electricity sectors believe RJB has over-stretched itself. RJB's assumptions on the size of future coal markets, and the prices at which it can sell, are at the top of industry expectations. Even its 'conservative case' calculations are regarded as ambitious by coal analysts, including McCloskey Coal Information. RJB is offering handsome rewards for shareholders who are prepared to wait a few years. The expected dividend yield starts at 4.5 per cent in the first year, about the market average, but RJB is promising a policy of rapid dividend growth with 'substantial increases' after debt is reduced. The company expects virtually all debt to be paid off by 1998. But with up to Pounds 528m of borrowings needed, the company's critics think that is far too optimistic. Some are predicting RJB could get into financial trouble. Potential investors will have a chance to make their own minds up when the pathfinder prospectus for the share issue comes out in the next few days. It will be a classic case of deciding whether the rich rewards on offer are worth the perceived risk of investing.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RJB'S ENLARGED BUSINESS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Enlarged RJB                                English coal**    (estimated)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of units Collieries: operating                  15            19 Collieries: needing maintenance         2             2 Opencast sites                         14            22 Prospective opencast sites             24            24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Production (million tons) Collieries                             25            27 Opencast sites                          6             7 Total:                                 31*           34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Coal reserves (million tons) Collieries                            387           402 Operating opencast                     23            24 Prospective opencast                   20            20 Total reserves                        430??         446??

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Bogus adverts lure workers to Hong Kong JOBLESS UK construction workers are being lured to Hong Kong under false pretences to work on the new airport, the territory's government has warned. Advertisements offering lists of prospective employers for sale to 'English-speaking manpower' in all categories of labour have been published in The Sun, Today and the Daily Express. Some workers have travelled to Hong Kong in vain. Mr Ranjit Peiris of the Hong Kong government office in London said that only highly skilled professional staff were being sought to work on the multi-billion-pound project. A list of contractors for the airport project is published by the Hong Kong government and is available free. He said he had written to 'most of the daily newspapers' to warn them against the rogue advertisements. News International said it had received 20 letters of complaint after an advertisement was published in The Sun. The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld complaints against one of the advertisers, Maurice Walker Marketing of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. It was 'extremely concerned that the advertisements had failed to provide any evidence that employment was likely to be available'. It noted that there had been a similar spate of advertisements at the end of the Gulf war 20 months ago. Mr Dick Livingston, head of the London office of Hong Kong's Provisional Airport Authority, said that typical UK wages for basic jobs were too high. Workers would be recruited from Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the Philippines. 'They are very industrious in the Far East, the training is good and they already have the skills,' he said. 'But professionals will be recruited increasingly from Europe.' Several of Britain's hard-pressed construction companies have won contracts for Hong Kong's airport, the most ambitious single infrastructure project ever undertaken in Asia. They include Costain and Trafalgar House which, with Mitsui of Japan, won a Pounds 600m contract earlier this year to build a suspension bridge between Chek Lap Kok, the island where the airport is to be built, and the Hong Kong mainland. UK consulting firms have also done well in bidding for consultancy contracts for the airport programme.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / EU and UN streamline humanitarian aid The European Union signed an agreement with the United Nations yesterday to streamline humanitarian aid operations and approved about Dollars 130m (Pounds 87.2m) in aid, most of it for ex-Yugoslavia, AP reports from Brussels. 'The agreement is an important step forward,' said Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It would allow the two organisations to avoid costly overlap and speed up operations. On Monday, the European Commission approved Ecu59m (Pounds 45m) in emergency aid for Bosnia, which will be spent in co-ordination with the UNHCR. The Commission also approved aid to the other republics, bringing overall aid to Ecu86m. David Gardner adds: According to EU diplomats in Brussels, a number of foreign ministers from the 12 member states were last night and today due to go to different parts of ex-Yugoslavia to prepare the ground for peace talks planned for Brussels on December 22. The diplomats said the decision was taken at yesterday's EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. They said Germany had floated the idea at last weekend's EU heads of government summit of using the influence that different member states had with contenders in the Bosnian war to try to achieve peace terms. The EU insists Serbia give up a portion of the land that it has conquered in Bosnia. Diplomats said it was likely the Netherlands would send its foreign minister to Sarajevo, that Bonn would send its foreign minister to Zagreb - where Germany wields influence  - and that several foreign ministers would intercede with Belgrade. Among the latter group Greece and possibly the UK and France were likely to send representatives.</p>

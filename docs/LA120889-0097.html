			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Bogus Bogie Coat: Christie's East, the New York auction house, has withdrawn an  item listed as the raincoat Humphrey Bogart wore in "Casablanca" from next  week's sale of Hollywood memorabilia. It turns out that Bogart didn't really  wear the trench coat in "Casablanca," only in a promotion for the movie.  Christie's experts had been expecting the coat to bring as much as $20,000.

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / MPs hit at City over pensions regulation THE CITY'S system of self-regulation over pension funds will bear the brunt of fierce criticism by a cross-party Commons committee next week over its failure to prevent the disappearance of several hundred millions of pounds from companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. In particular, the Select Committee on Social Security is expected to single out the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) for allowing Mr Maxwell to control a fund management company that gave him personal access to his employees' pension funds. The MPs are expected to recommend radical changes in UK pension law. They may possibly call for pensions to be run by trustees employed by independent companies unrelated to the employer, rather than the present system where employers often select trustees. MPs contend that, in its testimony to the committee, Imro had failed to persuade them that it had exercised good judgment in authorising Mr Maxwell's companies to operate as fund managers or that it had supervised them properly. The comments come as Imro's latest report to its members reveal that 66 members - roughly 5 per cent of the total - are under investigation because investors' money may be at risk. Maxwell company pensioners have targeted Imro's failure to spot the Maxwell abuses in a fresh campaign to win compensation from the government. The Maxwell Communication Pension Plan Consultative Committee is urging all members to write to their local MPs citing Imro's decision to authorise Mr Maxwell's Bishopsgate Investment Management as a 'fit and proper body'. The report will also criticise some City bodies, particularly actuarial firms, for failing to take sufficient responsibility over the affair. The Commons committee's report had been scheduled for publication on Thursday but the volume of additions sought by MPs and the time spent yesterday debating its broad thrust has forced a delay until Monday. The committee, which will meet again tomorrow, is hoping to make its conclusions more powerful by agreeing as much as possible without dissent among members. The pensions industry, shaken by the revelations about the Maxwell affair, is supporting calls by politicians for reform. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), the industry's largest trade association, has called for changes in the composition of boards of trustees and changes in rules over custodianship. During weeks of testimony, actuaries, accountants, lawyers and former pension fund trustees told the committee that they did not know the true state of the pension funds' finances or their investment policies. They also said they had no responsibility for investigating further. The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the trade association representing those who invest pension funds, has endorsed the NAPF proposals. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries last week called for a review of pension law, saying that the current trust law governing pension funds may no longer be sufficient. Mr Roy Brimblecombe of Clay and Partners and chairman of the institute, said: 'One of the problems with trust law is its absence of teeth.' MPs on the committee have yet to decide whether the role played by banks in some of the share transactions involved was sufficiently culpable to merit a wider attack on the City. The committee is also understood to be considering calling for a compensation scheme for pensioners. In addition, the committee will report to the Commons on the failure of Mr Ian Maxwell and his brother Kevin to reply to a questionnaire sent by the committee to the pension trustees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The man most likely to succeed Dr. Banda, as the  current pattern of results continues, is the UDF [United  Democratic Front] candidate Bakili Muluzi. On the line to  Blantyre last night, I asked Mr. Muluzi whether he now expected  to be Malawi's next president.    [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Well, I think so, from the look  of  the things. From the results that have already been counted,  definitely yes. For your information, I had already a call from  the vice president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] conveying  congratulations from Dr. Banda and conceding defeat.    [Unidentified reporter] And what about in the parliamentary  results. Do you also expect to hold a majority in parliament?    [Muluzi] Well, yes, we might just make it. You know that we  actually have got most of the seats in the southern region and  some seats in the central region; and definitely we might just  make it for majority in parliament.    [Reporter] With things still not quite over yet, there is  still a way to go. If it does emerge that you don't quite have  enough of a majority in parliament, is it possible you would  consider a coalition, and if so, who do you think that is likely  to be with?    [Muluzi] Well, we haven't given a thought to that one, but  if  that comes to that kind of thing, we wouldn't mind talking to  the other opposition parties. In this case, we are talking  about Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. I have not had any word  with our good friend, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, but if it comws to  that, we will definitely be talking to them. After all, we  fought this campaign, particularly the referendum, together.  So, we definitely, would not mind talking to them at all.    [Reporter] So, in other words, would you rule out altogether  any kind of a deal with MCP?    [Muluzi] Well, yes. Mind you, although it wasn't a fight as  such, but I think we are fighting a system and that system was  the Malawi Congress Party system. We definitely have not even  thought about talking to Malawi Congress Party at all. The  opposition that is leading at the moment, apart from the UDF, is  Aford, and perhaps one would be more comfortable talking to  Aford than MCP.    [Reporter] So, Mr. Muluzi, has your success in this election  come as something of a surprise to you or not?    [Muluzi] I wouldn't say as a surprise. I think our party has  been very popular. From the beginning, it was one of those  parties which was well organized, and we had support in a quite  a number of areas in our country. So, yes, a surprise, but not  a lot of surprise. I think we definitely expected some kind of  change. Let me just mention again that, I think, the mood in  Malawi has been for change. I think people have been looking  for a change for a long time. I think it is just time that  people wanted change.    [Reporter] So, finally at this time, do you have any message  for the man who is still, after all, the incumbent president in  Malawi, President Banda?    [Muluzi] Well, let me just mention one thing to you -- that  we definitely recognize the role that Dr. Banda played, you  know, during the time he has been president. I mean, he has  been president of Malawi for the last 30 years. Definitely, one  perhaps would say, look, let him retire in peace. I personally  had nothing personal to Dr. Banda [sentence as heard]. I think  we are fighting his system of government. So, what I would like  to say is that, you know, let him have a peaceful retirement. I  would definitely want to thank him for whatever contribution he  made to Malawi. I think it is just human to say that. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Doing business grandfather's way  -Spain's March family reviewing its investments The March family, one of the wealthiest in Spain, sits down every 15 to 20 years to think about where it is and where it is going. As its latest strategic review draws to a close, the family has announced the sale of Banco de Progreso, its merchant bank subsidiary. The disposal will bring the family's war chest for new investments up to more than Pta70bn (Dollars 687m). Some hurdles remain on the way to the rich new pastures the March clan is seeking. The family is still stuck with Uralita, a loss-making industrial holding. It also has to mould Banco Urquijo, a middle-sized and unexciting retail bank that it owns, into the vehicle for corporate business that Progreso has become. The present minders of the family fortune are the brothers Juan and Carlos March, the grandchildren of the legendary Juan March, who gave financial backing to General Franco in the Spanish Civil War. The brothers refer constantly to 'the way grandfather did things'. 'Grandfather' taught them the value of having money in their pockets, which means they remain traders of companies rather than long-term, committed investors. They make a distinction between 'real' cash-flow, meaning money they can walk away with, and 'false' cash-flow, funds that are locked into an asset. The value of diversification to spread the risk was another lesson he taught them. The sale of Progreso to the Barcelona savings bank, La Caixa - in which it will buy the 70 per cent the family owns and launch a formal takeover for the rest - will raise the family some Pta12bn. There was a similar return three months ago when it disposed of a 15.5 per cent stake in Signet Corporation, its financial arm in the US. Further boosting the war chest this year, the family has sold an electricity utility to Endesa, the state-run power group, for Pta40bn, and it has realised a further Pta14bn with the sale of its interests in the San Miguel brewery to the French BSN group. The scale of the disposal programme is equivalent to the one undertaken by the two brothers in the mid-1970s. Well-schooled by their grandfather to run the family empire following the early death of their father, Juan and Carlos March then pulled out of capital-intensive industries, including nuclear power stations, and sold Transmediterranea, a large shipping firm. Because they were able to skip so nimbly in front of other investors and ahead of recession in the 1970s the brothers' new strategy for the 1990s is being watched closely by would-be peers in Spain. There are, however, no real surprises in the investments being eyed. The four main sectors are distribution, communications, environment - specifically waste management - and leisure. These are exactly the targets that Spain's large banking and industrial conglomerates, such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banesto, have within their sights. Where the March group scores, in addition to its 'real' cash-flow and its tight family ethos, is that it is already well-positioned in these sectors. Two months ago, using Corporacion Alba, the publicly-quoted holding that it controls, the family partnered the French Carrefour corporation in a Pta25bn capital increase for Pryca, a large domestic distribution chain that the March group set up with Carrefour on the back of the 1970s disposals. The brothers also intend to increase the family's 15 per cent stake in Canal Plus, a subscriber television network which they view as a magnificent business. The environment and leisure interest are at present centred on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, the birthplace of grandfather Juan March and the home of Banca March, a small banking subsidiary that the brothers term their only 'sentimental asset'. The family could increase its minority partnership in a hotel interest that controls 10,000 beds on the island, and they are bidding for waste disposal concessions that will keep the waters clean and the tourists coming. The main thorn in the brothers' side is Uralita, the family-controlled construction and chemical group which began to haemorrhage badly last year when its posted losses of Pta521m against 1990 profits of Pta5.9bn. Uralita, which has been badly hit by the reduced earnings of its PVC manufacturer, Aiscondel, is the sort of business that the brothers increasingly dislike. They get nervous about cyclical losses that cannot be blamed on management and they are averse to 'false', or locked-in, cash-flows. Unfortunately for the brothers, potential buyers of their industrial holding are likely to feel the same way.</p>

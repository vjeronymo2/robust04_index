			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Right gains in Germany and Spain: Kohl's party scores surprising win in Euro poll - Gonzalez's Socialists defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats scored a surprising victory in the German leg of yesterday's European parliament elections. In Spain, the Socialist party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez suffered defeat at the hands of the opposition conservative Popular party. In preliminary results among the other six countries that went to the polls yesterday, governing parties suffered setbacks in Portugal but maintained their positions in Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg. In the UK, where voting took place on Thursday, sharp divisions in the ruling Conservative party over Europe and Mr John Major's leadership emerged again last night as the government prepared to face its worst defeat in a national election since the second world war. Amid predictions that the Conservatives would hold on to at most half of their 32 seats in the European parliament, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, signalled the start of a concerted cabinet operation to shore up Mr Major's premiership. The shift to the right in Germany and Spain was expected to be offset by gains by leftwing parties elsewhere in the European Union, leading to a small overall increase in the Socialist representation in the 567-seat, 12-nation parliament in Strasbourg. The combined total of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, was forecast to rise to 40.5 per cent from 37.7 per cent in the previous Euro election of 1989, according to an exit poll carried out for the ZDF television station. In contrast, the opposition Sociali Democratic (SPD) party was projected to slump to its worst result since direct European elections began, down from 37.3 in 1989 to just 33 per cent. The ZDF forecast that the CDU/CSU could take 48 of Germany's 99 seats in the Strasbourg parliament, against 39 for the SPD and 12 for the Greens. The liberal Free Democratic party, junior partner in Mr Kohl's coalition government in Bonn, looked set to lose its place in Strasbourg, along with the far-right Republicans. The Republicans, the feared bogeymen of Germany's far right, also seemed to have suffered a dramatic setback. The poll suggested a halving of support from 7.1 per cent in 1989 to 3.5 per cent. In Spain, exit polls put the Popular party's result at between 38-40 per cent and 40 per cent of the vote, giving it between 26 and 28 of Spain's 64 seats. Mr Gonzalez' Socialists were projected as gaining only 29-31 per cent of the vote. Polls also predicted that Spain's Socialists would lose their absolute majority in the regional parliament in Andalusia in elections held in parallel with the European poll. In Portugal, the opposition Socialists appeared to be heading for victory with 35-39 per cent. But Greece's governing Socialist Panhellenic Socialist Movement looked set to win that country's vote, with exit polls giving it 38-42 per cent of the vote. Early projections put the Socialist grouping's strength in the new Strasbourg assembly at 203 plus a further nine allies from France, compared with 197 in the old parliament. Rightwing parties' showing in the parliament was expected to be more fragmented compared with 1989.</p>

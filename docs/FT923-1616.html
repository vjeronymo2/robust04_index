			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Gaidar gives monetary policy pledge RUSSIA'S acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, yesterday promised that the government would tighten monetary policy over the next six months. Speaking to a group of pro-reform deputies, Mr Gaidar admitted the budget deficit was now 'very bad' after a sharp drop in revenues and a rise in payments during the summer. The deficit is estimated to be running at around 17 per cent of GDP for the first six months, with inflation at about 25 per cent a month and production falling sharply. Mr Gaidar will have to defend this record, and call for renewed monetary discipline to a sceptical parliament which opens today. He seems certain to face calls for his resignation from hard line deputies. Both Mr Ivan Rybkin, co-ordinator of the Communists of Russia faction and Mr Vladimir Isakov, head of Russian Unity, were quoted yesterday by Interfax as calling for his dismissal. The prime minister echoed some government colleagues in blaming Mr Victor Gerashchenko, acting head of the Russian Central Bank, for loosening the floodgates of credit. Mr Gaidar said: 'He is responsible for the stability of the financial system.' Elections of a new parliament and president in Estonia have produced a parliament with a right-nationalist party as biggest group and an inconclusive result on the president. The Fatherland Alliance won just over 20 per cent of the vote, making it the largest party with 28 seats. However, Mr Lennart Meri, leader of the party, came second to Mr Arnold Ruutel, the present parliamentary chairman, in the presidential vote - with 28.8 per cent to 42.7 per cent. Parliament must now choose between them. Carrots and sticks, Page 18</p>

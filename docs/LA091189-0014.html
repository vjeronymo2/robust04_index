			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARDINALS SHOOT DOWN LIONS ON DEL GRECO KICK  </P> <P> Detroit's new run-and-shoot offense was mostly run, thanks to an impressive  debut by Barry Sanders, last season's Heisman Trophy winner. But it wasn't  enough.  </P> <P> Al Del Greco's 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds left Sunday gave the Phoenix  Cardinals a 16-13 victory over the Lions.  </P> <P> Sanders, the former Oklahoma State star who held out until Thursday because of  a salary dispute, rushed for 71 yards on nine carries after entering the game  late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "It just felt good to be out and running and playing football," he said. "I  thought I ran pretty good, considering. I thought we were going to win the  game. I guess it wasn't enough."  </P> <P> Phoenix quarterback Gary Hogeboom completed 21 of 35 passes for 264 yards,  including a 15-yard strike to Roy Green for the Cardinals' only touchdown.  Hogeboom hooked up with J.T. Smith 10 times for 121 yards.  </P> <P> "If they're going to go one on one with J.T. and Roy, sooner or later I'm going  to get the ball in their hands," Hogeboom said. "We came out and did what we  wanted to do. Everyone was running crisp routes and I felt pretty comfortable."  </P> <P> The Silverdome crowd of 36,735 roared when Sanders ran onto the field with 5:34  remaining in the third period and Lions at their own 44.  </P> <P> Detroit gained 27 yards on the next play when Michael Zordich was called for  pass interference on Jason Phillips. Sanders took over from there, carrying  four consecutive times for 18, three, five, and three yards, breaking a tackle  by Zordich on the final play for a touchdown that gave the Lions a 10-6 lead.  </P> <P> Sanders also had a 26-yard run in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "This young man will restore the roar," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said. "He's  everything we thought he was. Everyone knew he was going to carry the ball and  he still did what he did. Hopefully, he'll make me a great coach.  </P> <P> "This offense is a big-play offense, and it will get better with Barry."  </P> <P> Del Greco's winning kick was his third field goal of the game. He also made  them from 29 and 23 yards in the second quarter. Detroit's Eddie Murray kicked  field goals of 30 and 23 yards.  </P> <P> Lion quarterback Bob Gagliano, a Glendale product who got the start when Rodney  Peete was injured during the preseason, completed only seven of 20 passes for  116 yards. Phoenix out-gained Detroit in total yardage, 329-258.  </P></p>

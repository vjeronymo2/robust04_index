Menem arrived at the local airport at 1915 (2115 Argentine  time) [0015 GMT 14 June]. After a brief contact with  journalists, he headed for the Hilton Hotel where he will stay  together with the other heads of state attending the meeting.    Menem reiterated that he is willing to meet Cuban leader  Fidel Castro "if he" asks for a meeting.    Regarding the Cuban situation Menem said "for years  Argentina  respected the blockade" imposed by the United States. The  Argentine president made clear, however, that Argentina "has  good relations" with the island and is "constantly monitoring"  the situation.    "The possibilities for integration are enormous if Cuba  becomes democratic," Menem stressed.    The Argentine president was accompanied by Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella.    Menem also mentioned the world soccer tournament and  reiterated that the championship will be won by either  Argentina, Germany, Brazil, Colombia, or Italy.</p>

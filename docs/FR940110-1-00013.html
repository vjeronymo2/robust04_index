			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The level of cost-share assistance as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;701.110, in effect for practices in all years of a long-term agreement shall be the level in effect at the beginning year of the agreement. The rate of cost-share assistance for payment purposes for such practice shall be based on the average cost of performing the practice at the time the practice is performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) A long-term agreement may be canceled for failure to fully comply with the terms of the agreement if, after consulting with the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS, the State or COC determines that the seriousness of the irregularities warrant such action. If the agreement is canceled, the parties to the agreement are jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments under the agreement. In such a case, no other refund or forfeiture provisions of these regulations apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) A long-term agreement may be revised according to instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator by mutual agreement between the parties to the agreement and the COC based on approved changes in the CPO's for the farm or ranch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An otherwise eligible person who acquires control of land under an approved agreement may elect to become a successor in interest under such agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) An agreement will be terminated with respect to land for which loss of control has occurred and where the person acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest under the agreement. If the loss of control is for reasons beyond the control of the parties to the agreement, the COC will determine whether any cost-share assistance previously paid shall be refunded; however, in no event shall the refund be greater than would be required in cases where loss of control is voluntary. If the loss of control is voluntary on the part of the signatories to the agreement, the signatories will be jointly and severally responsible for refunding all cost shares paid and will forfeit all rights to further payments, with respect to the land for which control is lost. However, a refund will not be required for cost shares where the COC or the STC determine, after consulting with a representative of the SCS, that failure to perform the remaining practices in the agreement will not impair the effectiveness of the practices which have been performed and that the completed practices have provided conservation benefits consistent with the cost shares which have been paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) An agreement may be terminated by the COC, after considering the recommendation of the Soil Conservation District or comparable district board or if none exists with a representative of the SCS if such action is in the public interest. The COC will determine the amount of cost shares previously paid that shall be refunded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) An agreement may be terminated by the COC upon the written request of the participant to a long-term agreement where no cost-share assistance has been paid for any of the scheduled practices and where the participant does not intend to perform any of the scheduled practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;701.114  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Replacement, enlargement, or restoration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment or installation of a practice, for the purposes of the program shall be deemed to include the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of a practice for which cost-share assistance has been allowed if the practice has served its normal lifespan or if all of the following conditions exist:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is needed to solve the related conservation or environmental problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The failure of the original practice was not due to the lack of proper maintenance by the current operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The COC believes that the replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice merits consideration to an equal extent with other practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The replacement, enlargement, or restoration of the practice is not being performed because the producer has increased his operation to where these measures are needed to solve the increased conservation or environmental problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;701.115  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pooling agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligible persons in any local area may agree in writing with the approval of the COC to perform designated practices which will solve a mutual conservation, pollution, or other environmental problem on the land of the participants.

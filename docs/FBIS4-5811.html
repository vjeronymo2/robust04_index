			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's wholesale prices  fell 0.2 percent in March from the previous month for the second  straight monthly drop and 2.9 percent from a year before, the  Bank of Japan reported Thursday [14 April].    The overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was 93.3 against the  base of 100 for 1990.    In February, the WPI fell 0.5 percent on a monthly basis.    The wholesale price index also fell 3.2 percent in the  business year ended March 31, 1994, for the third consecutive  yearly decline.    Domestic wholesale prices in March inched down 0.2 percent  from February and declined 2.0 percent from the year before.    Export prices gained 0.1 percent from February on a contract  currency basis, falling 0.4 percent in terms of yen.    Import prices rose 0.6 percent from the month before on a  contract currency basis but decreased 0.3 percent in terms of  yen.    The U.S. dollar averaged 105.13 yen against the Japanese  currency, down 1.1 yen from February and down 10.2 yen from the  same month a year before.    A Bank of Japan official said lower iron and steel prices  accounted for about a third of the monthly drop of the domestic  WPI. Sluggish demand in the construction and auto industries and  inventory liquidation at the fiscal year-end helped push down  iron and steel prices, he said.    Lower prices for oil products amid softer crude oil value  and  a price drop in electric appliances also led to softening the  domestic WPI, he said.    Nevertheless, the stability of domestic WPI remains  unchanged, he said.    Export WPI gained on a contract currency basis on higher  prices in machineries, but dropped in terms of yen, reflecting  the appreciation of the yen against major currencies.    Import WPI gained ground on higher metal and textile prices  on a contract currency basis despite lower crude oil values.    Rice prices gained 0.1 percent from February, the official  said.    Domestic WPI for fiscal 1993 shed 1.8 percent, slipping for  the second successive year. The Bank of Japan said it was due  to lower prices of iron and steel, oil products and electric  appliances.    Export WPI in terms of yen retreated 8.1 percent to mark the  biggest drop since the 13.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a  contract currency basis, the stronger yen and the resultant rise  of automobile prices boosted the index by 2.9 percent.    In fiscal 1993, the dollar averaged at 107.85 yen, jumping  13.6 percent from the year before.    Import WPI in terms of yen fell 12.4 percent, posting the  largest decline since 37.3 percent of fiscal 1986. On a  contract currency basis, lower oil and natural gas prices  contributed to bringing down the index by 1.0 percent.</p>

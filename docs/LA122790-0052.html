			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: RICE CAN BE COOKED IN A MICROWAVE  </P> <P> Since rice takes as long to microwave as to cook the old-fashioned way, you may  wonder, "Why bother?"  </P> <P> Three good reasons: The rice needn't be started in boiling water, it won't  stick to the pan or scorch, and it will steam to perfection in a microwave. For  best results, follow these guidelines:  </P> <P> * To prevent boil-over, use a casserole three times the volume of the rice and  water placed into it.  </P> <P> * To hasten cooking, use the hottest tap water available.  </P> <P> * To reduce evaporation and keep the rice fluffy-moist, use a tight lid.  </P> <P> * If the rice is to cook evenly, don't add salt until after the rice is done,  unless you dissolve it completely in the cooking liquid before adding the rice.  </P> <P> * To avoid breaking the individual grains of rice, stir the rice once only.  </P> <P> * To hold microwaved rice 10 to 15 minutes before you serve it, keep it tightly  covered.  </P> <P> BASIC STEAMED  </P> <P> LONG-GRAIN OR  </P> <P> CONVERTED RICE  </P> <P> 1 cup long-grain or converted rice  </P> <P> 2 cups water, beef or chicken broth  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Mix rice and liquid in microwave-safe casserole 3 times volume of combined  ingredients. Cover with tight lid and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 4 to 6  minutes until small bubbles appear around edge.  </P> <P> Stir once. Re-cover and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 9 to 10 minutes,  without stirring, until rice is al dente. Rice will seem dry on surface but  some liquid will remain in bottom of casserole. This will be absorbed as rice  stands.  </P> <P> Let rice stand, tightly covered, 5 minutes. Add salt to taste and fluff lightly  with fork. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Variation:  </P> <P> Basic Steamed Brown Rice: Prepare as directed but substitute converted brown  rice for white rice and increase microwave time on MEDIUM (50% power) to 22 to  25 minutes. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> 10 QUICK WAYS  </P> <P> TO JAZZ UP RICE  </P> <P> (All amounts based on 1 cup uncooked rice. Always adjust salt to taste. All  make 4 to 6 servings.)  </P> <P> Onion-Mushroom Rice: Microwave 1/2 cup minced onion in 1 tablespoon butter or  margarine in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe casserole on HIGH (100% power) 3  minutes before adding rice and liquid. Proceed as directed, adding 1 cup thinly  sliced or coarsely chopped mushrooms before microwaving on MEDIUM (50% power).  </P> <P> Curried Rice: Add 1 tablespoon butter or margarine and 2 teaspoons curry powder  to chicken broth and uncooked rice, then microwave as directed.  </P> <P> Saffron Rice: Blend 1/8 teaspoon powdered saffron with cooking liquid before  adding rice, then microwave as directed.  </P> <P> Garlic-Sour Cream Rice: Microwave 1 minced garlic clove along with rice. After  standing time, fork in 3/4 cup room-temperature sour cream and 2 tablespoons  minced chives. Cover with lid and microwave on MEDIUM 2 minutes to warm and  blend flavors.  </P> <P> Green Rice: Add 1/2 cup minced green onions (include some green tops) and 1  tablespoon butter to chicken broth and uncooked rice. Microwave as directed,  then stir in 1 cup minced parsley just before serving.  </P> <P> Herbed Rice: Mix 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil, dill, chives or parsley or 1  tablespoon minced fresh sage or thyme with 2 tablespoons melted butter or  margarine and fork into cooked rice before standing time. If fresh herbs are  unavailable, substitute 1 teaspoon each dried, but crumble well first. Stir  again lightly and serve.  </P> <P> Cheddar Rice: Before rice stands, add (but do not mix in) 1/2 to 2/3 cup  shredded sharp Cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella or Jack cheese. Mix in lightly just  before serving.  </P> <P> Mandarin Orange Rice: Microwave rice in half-and-half mixture of orange juice  and chicken broth. Before serving, mix in 1 tablespoon butter or margarine, 2  teaspoons finely grated orange zest and 2 tablespoons minced parsley. Garnish  with mandarin orange segments.  </P> <P> Fruit Rice: Toss seasoned, cooked rice with 1/3 cup seedless raisins or dried  currants, diced dried apricots, pitted prunes or dates, figs or apples.  </P> <P> Nut Rice: Toss 1/3 cup coarsely chopped nuts (any kind) and 2 tablespoons  melted butter with cooked rice.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

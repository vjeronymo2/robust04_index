			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Direct debits more efficient Sir, Mr T J Walsh (Letters, November 25) describes the giro payment system available in Switzerland and suggests that British banks should be taking similar steps to reduce cheque volumes. He misses the point. Most households in the UK already use an even more efficient way of paying their regular bills: the direct debit scheme. Once a direct debit instruction has been signed, no further action at all is required by the customer and, even if he is abroad or otherwise unable to attend to his affairs, the bills still get paid on time. His peace of mind is further enhanced by the provision of a money-back guarantee in the very rare event that an error occurs. The scheme is actively promoted by UK banks and building societies and, indeed, more than 1bn direct debit payments will be made in 1993.

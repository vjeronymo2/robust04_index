			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cashing in on sales data The ever-decreasing cost of the latest computer technology has enabled IBM to develop a point-of-sale till aimed squarely at even the smallest retailer. For less than Pounds 5,000 the retailer will be able to buy the IBM 4694 hardware and software plus installation and support. Because the till uses PC technology, the diskettes can be transferred to a PC in the evening and the sales data gathered during the day used in spreadsheet applications. Alternatively, a screen can be attached to the till and the IBM 4694 doubles as a PC. IBM: UK, 0705 321212.</p>

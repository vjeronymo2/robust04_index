			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN STUDENTS PROTEST GRADUATION AT BOWL  </P> <P> About 90 Cal State Northridge students on Wednesday angrily demanded that the  university drop its plans to hold this year's graduation in the Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> The students said they were upset that graduating seniors will not be allowed  to bring more than three guests to the May 26 ceremony. They also said they  were angry that university officials may not be able to shake the hand of each  graduating senior at the event, as has been customary in past ceremonies. And  they charged that students were not consulted in planning for the graduation,  which has been the subject of heated debate on campus since plans were  announced Feb. 22.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have been here four or more years and it would be nice to get  some kind of personal recognition for our accomplishments," said 21-year-old  LeAnne Ferry, a graduating senior who is majoring in finance.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, students persuaded administrators to back away from plans to  hold the event at 7 a.m. at the bowl. The starting time was changed to 11 a.m.,  but the controversy over other aspects of the ceremony has not died down.  </P> <P> CSUN Vice President Edmund P. Peckham, who attended the noon protest in front  of the university's administration building, said the graduation must take  place off campus because construction has closed the campus area in front of  the library normally used for the ceremony. Administrators limited the number  of guests to prevent overcrowding at the bowl, which holds 17,960 people and  has parking for 3,500 cars, university spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said.  </P> <P> Students who attended the protest at times shouted in anger at Peckham, who  attempted to defend the university's handling of the matter.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of what's going on" at the graduation, one protester  shouted. "It's how the administration is treating us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Student Vote Asked  </P> <P> Janice Morris, an Associated Students senator, said she has two petitions with  a total of 900 signatures opposing the graduation plan. Protesters proposed a  special ballot to determine how many graduating seniors oppose the plan.  </P> <P> Salisbury said graduation probably will be held on campus again next year. She  said a campus athletic field used for last year's ceremony could not be used  again this year because the university does not have enough money to rent  bleachers. Last year, bleachers were paid for by a one-time, $80,000 grant from  the California State University system chancellor's office. The total cost of  last year's graduation was about $120,000, compared to $50,000 for this year's  event, Salisbury said.  </P> <P> Peckham said seniors probably will receive some form of individual recognition  at the ceremony. But the Hollywood Bowl's design prevents students from  marching on stage and shaking President James W. Cleary's hand, Peckham said.  </P> <P> The graduates will be recognized individually at receptions given by academic  departments on campus after the ceremony, Peckham said.  </P> <P> Salisbury said 3,900 bachelor's degrees and 750 master's degrees will be  awarded at the graduation, the largest in the university's history.  </P></p>

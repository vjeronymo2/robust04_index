			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS U.S. TEAM IS DEPLETED, NOT DEFEATED;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: AFTER LOSING ITS STARTERS FROM THE SEOUL GAMES, THE AMERICAN  NATIONAL TEAM APPEARS TO HAVE A BUMPY ROAD AHEAD. STILL, ITS YOUNG PLAYERS  REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.  </P> <P> Scott Fortune played only a small role when the U.S. volleyball team won its  second consecutive gold medal at Seoul last year.  </P> <P> But since then, Fortune has assumed a new role on a team in transition. Seven  of the United States' 12 Olympic members left after Seoul, and two more say  they will leave in November.  </P> <P> As a result, U.S. Coach Bill Neville said he will rely on Fortune, a middle  blocker, and outside hitters Troy Tanner and Jon Root to guide the program  through the next three years, which might be rough after the team's enormous  success. All three were substitutes in 1988.  </P> <P> "Guys like Fortune have to grow up quickly," Neville said. "There's no time for  that adolescent stage for them to develop. They have to go out and do it right  now."  </P> <P> That may be difficult.  </P> <P> The team's biggest void came last July, when outside hitter Karch Kiraly and  middle blocker Steve Timmons, who led the United States to two gold medals,  joined the pro beach circuit. They are regarded as two of the world's best  players.  </P> <P> At the time, their departure left the team with only two returning starters  from 1988 -- setter Jeff Stork and outside hitter Bob Ctvrtlik.  </P> <P> But Stork and Ctvrtlik plan to leave after the World Cup in November to play  professionally in Italy. Two other starters, Craig Buck and Doug Partie, joined  the Italian leagues after the Olympics.  </P> <P> The three returning players, along with a patchwork lineup of promising  collegians who are inexperienced at the international level, are trying to  maintain the United States' No. 1 ranking.  </P> <P> "I'm upset with a lot of those guys who have left," said Fortune, 23. "They're  still young enough to play. They've left the program in a difficult situation.  We're a few years behind and we need to catch up.  </P> <P> "It's a learning experience with the younger guys." He said they looked to  Stork and Ctvrtlik "to smooth things over."  </P> <P> Stork, formerly a standout at Pepperdine, said winning the gold medal in Seoul  satisfied his amateur goals, and he is ready to move on.  </P> <P> "I can't say I made a terrible decision leaving the team," Stork said. "I've  been with the team for five years and I've helped the younger players as much  as I can.  </P> <P> "It's time to explore new avenues. It's the culmination of my (amateur) career  and it's time to have fun now. It's also a chance to make a little money."  </P> <P> Stork will earn $500,000 for playing the next two years in Italy.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Volleyball Assn. can't offer the players the money to stay around,"  Stork said. "(It) pays for living expenses, but it's not enough. There are a  few guys on the team who are making $100 a month. There are some who don't even  own a car."  </P> <P> Neville said he doesn't blame Stork and Ctvrtlik for going to Italy. He  compared the U.S. team's situation to that of the Clippers, who recently lost  Danny Ferry to the Italian basketball league.  </P> <P> "What it all comes down to is that the Italians can ante up and pay for the  players," Neville said. "The Italians have deep pockets -- ones that reach all  the way to their toes.  </P> <P> "It's a tempting offer for young players -- a six-figure salary to play seven  months and work out two or three times a week. Then they can come back and play  on the beach tour and make more money."  </P> <P> With the loss of nine players from the 1988 team, Neville has searched  California universities for talent. He said the U.S. team's future rests on the  newcomers such as Bryan Ivie of USC, Chris Braun of Stanford and Mark Arnold of  Pepperdine.  </P> <P> "Losing Bob and Jeff has had a big effect on the team," Neville said. "I would  be a liar if I said it didn't. It's something I try not to think about.  </P> <P> "But the younger guys know their day in the sun is coming. It's just coming a  little sooner than expected."  </P> <P> Fortune said the U.S. team is undergoing a transition similar to the one when  Kiraly and Timmons joined the team eight years ago.  </P> <P> The United States was weak in international volleyball when Kiraly and Timmons  arrived in 1981. The Americans weren't much better in 1982, when they finished  13th at the world championships.  </P> <P> Success did not come until after the world championships, when the U.S. team  restructured its program and brought in a new coach.  </P> <P> By the time the team was preparing for Seoul, it was a well-tuned machine.  </P> <P> "All (former coach Marv Dunphy) had to do was roll the ball out there and let  us go at it," Fortune said. "That was what practices were like then. Now the  coaches spend a lot more time teaching.  </P> <P> "We realize we're going to have to play a lot harder. We can't walk over teams  since Karch and Steve left."  </P> <P> The team's first major test will be at the World Cup. The United States won the  last one in 1985.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're the favorites," Stork said. "The Cubans and the Soviets  look good. We might be in the top four."  </P> <P> As a warmup to the World Cup, the Americans are playing the Japanese national  team in an eight-city exhibition tour in the United States and Japan.  </P> <P> The United States is 5-2 without Kiraly and Timmons. Before the tour against  Japan, the U.S. team split two games against the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Neville used the tour to give the younger players experience. Stork sat out the  three games in Japan so setter Javier Gaspar could play.  </P> <P> With new players, Neville juggles the lineup to find the best combinations.  </P> <P> "It's hard to discipline myself as the coach sometimes," he said. "When we get  into the fray, my instinct is to go with the best six players. But my  assistants keep reminding me that I have to get the younger guys some playing  time. I've had to do a lot of experimenting."  </P> <P> Fortune, who played at Stanford and Laguna Beach High School, said playing with  the young team is challenging.  </P> <P> "We're trying to prove ourselves," he said. "Everyone is saying we can't do it  without Karch and Steve. Hey, they were great and I looked up to them when they  were on the team, but now I realize they're gone and we have to go on without  them."  </P></p>

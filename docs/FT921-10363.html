			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Market distorted by use of company cars as perks COMPANY cars, particularly when given wholly or partly as a perk, distort the UK car market, the commission says. 'We consider that they have been a factor in leading to a generally higher level of specification in the UK within model ranges and that this has been reflected in prices.' The report says that in the company-car sector, big fleet purchasers can secure fleet and volume discounts not available to others - and particularly not to private consumers. It concludes that this has raised the prices paid by private buyers. It adds, however, that UK cars are much more richly equipped than equivalent models in continental markets. The report says the present system of company-car provision puts the private buyer at a disadvantage. It says: 'The higher prices paid by the private consumer finance the discounts given to company car buyers, since the major suppliers have to retrieve from other buyers the revenues forgone by offering extra discounts on these substantial sales if they are to keep their UK operations viable over time.' The commission accepts that recent increases in the level of taxation of the benefit of private use of company cars have reduced their attractiveness. It says the higher tax level and the introduction in 1992-93 of employers' liability for national insurance contributions on company-car benefits may reduce the number of company cars. It adds: 'Company cars, however, still offer substantial private-use benefits and we recognise that the company-car culture and current attitudes cannot easily be changed even if tax neutrality were attained.' The commission suggests that banding the tax-scale charges by original market value and engine capacity has caused a clustering of highly specified cars at particular thresholds. It recommends that banding should be replaced by expressing the scale charge as a percentage of the car list price or cost. That would remove discrimination against those buying cheaper cars in the band.</p>

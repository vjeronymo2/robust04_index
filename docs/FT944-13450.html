			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: UTC ahead 24% in third quarter United Technologies, the diversified US manufacturer, reported double-digit profit increases in four of its five divisions in the third quarter, but further profit falls in parts of its aerospace business. Net earnings for the group were up 24 per cent at Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, and chief executive officer Mr George David said the company was still on track to increase annual earnings by more than 30 per cent, or by Dollars 1 a share. The Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines division improved operating profits by 90 per cent to Dollars 110m, on a 4 per cent decline in sales. The company said 'the benefits derived from aggressive restructuring and cost reduction programmes, including lower research and development spending, continue to offset weakness in the aerospace industry'. However, profits from the flight systems division, which includes Hamilton Standard flight controls and Sikorsky helicopters, were 37 per cent lower at Dollars 57m, on sales down 14 per cent. The company said Hamilton reached break-even in the quarter and was expected to be in profit for the rest of the year. Operating profit in the Otis lift business was up 11 per cent at a record Dollars 111m. The Carrier air conditioning and heating division increased profits by 11 per cent, to a record Dollars 127m, underpinned by strong demand in the US and a recovery in Europe. Profits in the automotive division were up 20 per cent at Dollars 31m.</p>

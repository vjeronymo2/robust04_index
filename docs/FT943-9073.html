			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tantalising the taste buds Sir, I read your article on the ever-increasing pretentiousness of today's cuisine served by modern-day caterers with sympathy and horror ('Awful lapse in taste', August 8). It is true that dishes are now becoming more and more complicated, with a myriad of ingredients fighting for first place in the 'guess what you're eating' competition. However, certain continental cuisine - especially Italian - concentrates on allowing one flavour to tantalise the taste buds rather than bombarding them with hot, cold, sweet and sour all in one go. The fresh taste of basil comes shining through in the simple yet delicious Ligurian dish of Tagliatelle alla Pesto Genovese, although some philistines do distort the recipe to include parsley and potatoes] Other sauces, like pastasciutta, again focus on one main ingredient such as the mighty mushroom, the esoteric artichoke or the unassuming olive and, stirred into some freshly cooked pasta, create a delicious and unpretentious dinner. Perhaps seeking out genuine Italian dishes is the secret of a happy, hearty meal . . .? Clare David, Sacla UK, Park House, High Street, Colnbrook, Berkshire SL3 0LX</p>

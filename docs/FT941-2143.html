			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact talks begin The International Coffee Organisation embarked yesterday on a 10-day meeting that could decide its future existence. The 56-member body is due to agree a new international coffee pact to replace the 1983 accord, which has been extended four times. But the 40 coffee-producing countries disagree with the 16 importing members about whether the new pact should contain the option to re-introduce measures to regulate the market, such as export quotas. Such 'economic' mechanisms were dropped from the old agreement in 1989 and coffee consuming countries want the new pact to remain merely administrative, providing a data base and research on the coffee market. If the ICO council cannot agree a new pact, it may meet again shortly, to extend the current one yet again or to abolish it, said an official. The producer and consumer sides were discussing their respective positions yesterday and an outcome on the pact is not expected until towards the end of the meeting on March 30. Producers, basking in the success of their export retention scheme in buoying prices, would like the new accord to enable the council to implement economic measures.</p>

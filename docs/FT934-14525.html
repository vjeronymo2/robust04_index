			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bombay tax row near end A DISPUTE between Bombay brokers and Indian income tax officers which halted trading on big bourses for three days is close to resolution. The tax authorities agreed yesterday after extended talks over two days to unfreeze parcels of shares issued by nine companies, including Reliance Industries and ACC, the country's largest cement producer. Tax inspectors last month froze dealings in the share parcels during an investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal. Brokers at the Bombay Stock Exchange, went on strike on Wednesday over the investigation's disruptive effect.</p>

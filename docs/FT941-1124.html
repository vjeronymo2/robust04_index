			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Losses at INI widen as Iberia slumps Losses at Spain's state holding group Instituto Nacional de Industria soared by 69 per cent last year to Pta125bn (Dollars 893m), reflecting deteriorating results in steel and shipbuilding and a sharply increased deficit at Iberia, the national airline group. However, Mr Javier Salas, chairman, expressed cautious optimism for an improvement this year and said the group had to become 'smaller and much stronger' in the next few years. Group borrowing at the end of last year was Pta2,300bn, roughly the same as annual turnover. INI's shareholdings in steel production accounted for half the total loss. Losses at Iberia and its subsidiaries doubled to Pta69bn, weighed down by the company's interests in Latin America. These include Aerolneas Argentinas, where Iberia has just reached agreement on increasing its stake from 30 per cent to 85 per cent through conversion of debt. Other heavy losers were the Inespal aluminium company and arms manufacturer Santa Barbara. The latter is due to shed two-thirds of its 3,000-strong workforce with the closure of five of its nine manufacturing sites. The group's more successful interests, brought together under Grupo Teneo and excluding INI's holdings in mining, defence, steel and shipbuilding, remained in profit but with net earnings sharply reduced to Pta3bn from Pta21bn, mainly reflecting the losses at Iberia. Capital goods subsidiaries and the aerospace company CASA moved into profit. However, the group continued to rely heavily on earnings from Endesa, the partly-privatised electrical utility, which rose about 10 per cent to Pta117bn. A further 10 per cent of Endesa, in which Grupo Teneo now holds 75 per cent, is due to be sold off shortly.</p>

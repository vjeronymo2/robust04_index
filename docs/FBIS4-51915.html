			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Farm market brokers  continued to strike against the new law on farm produce  distribution and price stabilization for the second straight day  Wednesday, paralyzing major agricultural markets across the  country.    The new law prevents them from engaging in retail and  wholesale business, among other things, causing an outpouring of  anger.    In a meeting held Wednesday, the brokers resolved to  continue  their "work-to-rule struggle" until the government amends the  law.    The government, meanwhile, flatly rejected their demand  Wednesday by deciding not to revise the law. A senior  presidential aide said, "there is no such thing as the principle  of the law, which has been pushed for in the perspective of  reform, to be retracted or re- amended. The brokers' act can by  no means be accepted from the viewpoint of either the producers  or consumers."    He said, "the government should, on the contrary, see to it  that this incident be used as an opportunity for a structural  reform of distribution of farm and fishery products to be  facilitated."    Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok instructed  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Choe In-ki to  relieve the farm market paralysis created by the brokers' strike.    Should the brokers continue to strike, the government will  accuse them of "group egoism" and take punitive steps including  investigation of their account books for heavy taxation,  officials said.</p>

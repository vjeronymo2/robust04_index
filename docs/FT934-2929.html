			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / EIB finance for Polish railways The European Investment Bank (EIB) has agreed an Ecu200m (Dollars 228m) loan to finance modernisation of Poland's 630km section of the Berlin-Warsaw railway line, the main east-west rail-link. The EIB, the long-term finance institution of the European Union, is also providing an Ecu50m loan to the Polish Development Bank for the financing of smaller industrial projects in Poland. The loan to the Polish state railways, PKP, will partially finance an Ecu487m modernisation plan to upgrade and relay track, improve stations and install new fibre optic signals, telecommunication and power systems. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also expected to help fund the project which will upgrade the main passenger and freight link between the European Union and the Polish capital when completed by 1997. The latest loans bring total EIB lending to Poland upto Ecu553m. Poland is seeking further funds for its planned development of a 2,000km north-south and east-west motorway network. This will form a key link in the projected north-south motorway link from the Baltic states to the Mediterranean and a similar east-west link from Berlin to the Belarus and Ukrainian frontiers. Poland's reliance on finance from the international financial institutions like the EIB and the World Bank is greater than other central European states which still have access to commercial credits. But Poland's debt negotiators resumed talks with commercial bank creditors this week to seek an end to the impasse over the country's demand for a 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 13bn commercial debt. An agreement would open the way for both commercial bank and equity finance.</p>

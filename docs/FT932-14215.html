			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / ABF ahead 7.3 per cent to Pounds 161m on accounting change ASSOCIATED British Foods increased interim pre-tax profits by 7.3 per cent to Pounds 161m, but non-trading items caused the rise. Operating profits fell 9.7 per cent to Pounds 131m as the squeeze on milling and baking margins continued and there was a reduction in retail profits. However, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said 'we anticipate that the full year's profit figure will show some growth over that reported last year.' The 1992 pre-tax figure was Pounds 267m, restated from Pounds 297m. He said there were opportunities for recovery in areas which were down and growth in businesses which were ahead. The rise in prices as the green pound devaluation was passed on would be beneficial in the second half. The interim dividend was unchanged at 8.5p and any increase in dividends for the year would be included in the second interim payment. The figures were distorted by a change in the period end from mid-March to the end of February and a switch to FRS 3. The 1992 interim profit was restated from Pounds 175.2m for six months to Pounds 150m for 26 weeks. The shares fell 16p to 479p on the results. Group turnover rose 8.1 per cent to Pounds 2.04bn. UK manufacturing operating profits fell Pounds 6m to Pounds 100m, although within that British Sugar's profits increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 75m. Mr Weston said that in milling and baking margins were 'very, very tight'. A recent bread price increase had been accepted and 'the outlook is not so grim'. The group's retail businesses, which include Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices in the Irish Republic, increased sales 17 per cent to Pounds 593m but profits fell from Pounds 23m to Pounds 13m as a price war raged. Investment income rose by Pounds 10m to Pounds 45m and interest payable fell from Pounds 19m to Pounds 15m. Mr Weston said the group's investments had been well positioned for Black Wednesday, but the return in the second half would be closer to current interest rates. Net cash at the half year end was Pounds 282m (up from Pounds 206m). A Pounds 15m rise in the value of AB Foods' stake in Berisford International, the food and property group, was not included in profits. The comparable period did include an Pounds 11m fall in the stake's value. Earnings per share rose 12.7 per cent to 23.9p (from 21.2p). Lex, Page 24</p>

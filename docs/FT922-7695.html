			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Hospital talk - Radio IT MAY prove a handicap to Radio 4's new eight-part Thursday-morning documentary The Hospital that its characters are real people - David Loughton the actual Chief Executive, a real Sister, Maggie Kitchen, real Dr Juan Valle, even a real patient Clara Johnson. Life in hospitals has become almost as popular in our entertainment as football, but The Hospital cannot attach adventures to Mr Loughton, Sister Kitchen and so on, like people in The Archers (though 85-year-old Ms Johnson did have a fit on her way her X-ray). The Hospital, an in-depth study of Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry, is strictly realistic. Some staff even wear tiny tape-recorders to record the daily talk. The Chief Executive explained why the hospital has opted out; later we heard some opposition shouting in a debate. Sister Kitchen was the unhappy individual to sort out the shortage of beds. The first programmes chiefly introduced some of the staff, but if Nurse A loves Doctor B, we shall not know; such things are not for this series. Work was only lightly dealt with. The patients are less sympathetic than the staff, who seem optimistically caring, even when they must deal with people like the businessman who said that he always felt out of breath when under stress, even if he weren't really. I was on the side of the young women who read out some of the standards they were expected to maintain. 'I wish we could do all this,' one of them said. Nothing about the hospital broadcasting system, if they have one. By ten o'clock last Sunday evening, the patients should all have been asleep, so they would have missed the unexpectedly fascinating Radio 2 Arts Programme, celebrating the 150th anniversary of Arthur Sullivan, the one associated with WS Gilbert. Naturally it included some choice G&amp;S bits; but it also gave parts at least of the In Memoriam overture, the Tempest suite, the cello concerto, Pineapple Poll, Thespis, a piano transcription of the wedding march for the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), and of course (this was Radio 2]) The Lost Chord. The cello concerto and the Tempest music (more completely) were also in Radio 3's morning Composer of the Week. There we had bits of Cox and Box, Trial by Jury, Pinafore, Iolanthe and Ruddigore too - and some of those bits are first-class music. I am specially glad, though, not to have missed Radio 2's actual Sullivan reminiscences. If Sullivan is a great classical composer, why not Alan Ayckbourn as a great English playwright? In 1956 I heard his Mr Whatnot, where half the dialogue is in mime; 'They'll all write it off,' said that clever critic Philip Hope-Wallace, 'but there's something there.' On Sunday Radio 3 gave us Man of the Moment, a sad, sensitive story written as if for farce, with very much there. Briefly, bank-clerk Douglas (Jon Strickland) had, 17 years ago, attacked Vic (Peter Vaughan), who was robbing the bank; and Vic shot Nerys, a pretty girl colleague to whom Douglas was hopelessly devoted. Vic served nine years in gaol, then became a television star, successful and arrogant. Meanwhile Douglas had married Nerys, her face badly marred by the shot. A television feature, Their Paths Crossed, brings them together in Vic's smart Spanish villa. The intolerable Vic so insults his children's nanny Sharon that she tries to drown herself in his pool; makes no effort to save her, but his decent wife Trudy has inflamed Douglas just enough to prompt him to push him in, and Sharon drowns him. The rest of the play shows how, under the director Jill (Lia Williams, splendid), the fatal events are so reorganised, televisionwise, that all ends without trouble. Gordon House was the director.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG GAME / MIRA MESA-POINT LOMA;  </P> <P> LOSER LIKELY TO LEAVE CITY EASTERN PICTURE  </P> <P> It's only the first week of league play, but it's already rush hour in the City  Eastern League. Three teams are in a bottleneck jockeying to take the lead, and  one will give ground today when the annual Point Loma-Mira Mesa rivalry resumes  at Point Loma (3 p.m.).  </P> <P> Both teams are undefeated -- Mira Mesa is 5-0, Point Loma 4-0 -- as is Morse  (5-0).  </P> <P> Morse, ranked No. 1 in the county, plays at 2-A Kearny tonight and is favored  to win. For Mira Mesa, ranked No. 2, or Point Loma, No. 3, a victory today is a  prerequisite for winning the league title.  </P> <P> Last year, Point Loma pulled out a 27-24 victory when quarterback Danny White  converted on fourth-and-10 to sustain a scoring drive late in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> White is gone, and so too is most of the offense at Point Loma. The Pointers  have scored only 60 points, averaging 15 per game. But their defense has  recorded two shutouts (against Lincoln and El Camino) and allowed only seven  points each to No. 4 Helix and No. 5 Rancho Buena Vista.  </P> <P> "So far, our defense has out-shown our offense," Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens  said. "We have good speed (on defense), we hit hard and have some outstanding  football players."  </P> <P> Two stand out. They are defensive ends and brothers, LaRoi (6-feet-2, 265  pounds) and Darcel Glover (6-2, 220). They are the reason teams can't run  against the Point Loma defense.  </P> <P> Today, the Pointers will attempt to stop the two-pronged attack of Wayne  Pittman (71 carries, 884 yards) and Robby Edwards (52 carries, 493 yards).  </P> <P> And despite his team's success against the run, Edens said he remains concerned  with these two, especially Pittman.  </P> <P> "He's a Division I running back," Edens said. "If you're going to stop him, you  better play good defense, have strong pursuit and a lot of people in the area."  </P> <P> But if Pittman breaks through for even one touchdown, it could put the game out  of reach for Point Loma. That's because Point Loma's young offense will  continue its learning process against the No. 1-ranked defense in the county.  Mira Mesa has allowed only 10 points in five games and recorded three shutouts.  </P> <P> The rub against Mira Mesa is that it has yet to play a ranked team. Until  today.  </P></p>

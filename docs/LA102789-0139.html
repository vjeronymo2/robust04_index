			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DELAY IN LINCOLN'S SEIZURE CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> HEARINGS: OFFICIALS SAID THE DELAY LET IRVINE-BASED THRIFT RUN UP HUGE DEBTS.  THE S&amp;L MAY HAVE EAVESDROPPED ON STATE AUDITORS WITH LISTENING DEVICE.  </P> <P> Two federal officials from California charged Thursday that M. Danny Wall, the  nation's chief savings and loan regulator, "shot them in the back" and blocked  a timely seizure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan that could have  saved taxpayers as much as $2 billion.  </P> <P> In separate testimony, state officials disclosed that an electronic listening  device was discovered in Lincoln's offices in Irvine that could have been used  to monitor conversations of state examiners as they called superiors about  their audit of the troubled S&amp;L.  </P> <P> The two federal regulators, who had raised red flags about Lincoln two years  before the government finally acted, told the House Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs Committee that a similar financial disaster could occur again "because  the same folks are still in charge of regulating thrifts."  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Texas) immediately suggested that Wall  step down or take temporary leave from his position as director of the Office  of Thrift Supervision until the hearings into the Lincoln case are concluded.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Wall's agency issued a statement saying that Thursday's  session presented a one-sided story because two witnesses from its Washington  office did not get a chance to testify.  </P> <P> "Therefore, it is inappropriate for members of the committee to request . . .  Wall to step aside permanently or until the hearings are completed," the  statement said.  </P> <P> Leonard Bickwit, a Washington lawyer for Lincoln's parent company, American  Continental Corp., said that the panel's hearings were "riddled from the start  with factual inaccuracies." But Bickwit provided no specific denials to the  allegations presented Thursday.  </P> <P> The testimony of Michael Patriarca, director of the Office of Thrift  Supervision's district office in San Francisco, and William K. Black, the  district counsel, provided additional evidence that regional regulators had  been stymied in their efforts to call attention to Lincoln's financial  problems.  </P> <P> Lincoln was seized by federal regulators on April 14, 1989, the day after its  parent company filed for bankruptcy. The cost of cleaning up the institution  has been put at as high as $2 billion, which would make it the most expensive  thrift failure in history.  </P> <P> In addition to the losses to the government's thrift deposit insurance fund,  which ultimately will be absorbed by taxpayers, an estimated 22,000 individuals  are expected to lose more than $200 million that they had invested in bonds  issued by Lincoln's parent company.  </P> <P> Wall, who was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board before it was  replaced by the Office of Thrift Supervision, and Charles H. Keating Jr., the  flamboyant owner of Lincoln's parent company, have been subpoenaed to appear  Nov. 7 before the House committee.  </P> <P> The committee is investigating the two-year delay that preceded the  government's seizure of Lincoln and the actions of five U.S. senators,  including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who intervened with federal regulators on  behalf of the institution.  </P> <P> Wall rejected a recommendation by the regional regulators that the government  seize Lincoln in 1987, and he stripped the San Francisco office of its  supervisory responsibility for the savings and loan.  </P> <P> The allegations made by Patriarca and Black, the San Francisco regulators, were  underscored at Thursday's hearing by H. Joe Selby, former director of  regulatory affairs at the bank board's Dallas office.  </P> <P> "The problems (at Lincoln) were loud and clear as early as 1986," Selby  testified. "Supervisory control should have been in place by late 1987."  </P> <P> Black and Patriarca said that Lincoln used political influence with the five  senators and got Wall's agency to make a series of "inexplicable" concessions  that staved off appointment of a receiver to safeguard Lincoln's assets until  last April.  </P> <P> Wall, who has acknowledged having a series of meetings with Keating while the  investigation was under way, has previously challenged the competence and  objectivity of his agency's San Francisco office.  </P> <P> In their first public reply, Black and Patriarca accused Wall and others in the  bank board's Washington office of undercutting enforcement actions despite  strong evidence of Lincoln's misconduct and unusually risky investments.  </P> <P> "Chairman Wall's instructions . . . to achieve a 'peaceful' resolution with  Lincoln assured the outcome," Black said. "All that remained was to negotiate  the terms of the bank board's surrender."  </P> <P> Black said that Lincoln was given effective veto power over which government  official would be named to negotiate with the savings and loan, which  government accountants would audit its books and which officials would  supervise its day-to-day activities.  </P> <P> A May 20, 1988, "memorandum of understanding" between the bank board and  Lincoln was drafted by Lincoln's attorneys in cooperation with Rosemary  Stewart, head of the bank board's enforcement office in Washington, Black said.  </P> <P> It was ridiculed by regional regulators as "Rosemary's Baby" because it allowed  Lincoln to increase its high-risk investments and violate other thrift  regulations during the year before the firm finally was seized, Black  contended.  </P> <P> In addition, Stewart signed a secret letter to Lincoln stating that the bank  board would not refer anything found during its investigation to other  government agencies for possible prosecution or enforcement actions.  </P> <P> Wall demoted William Robertson, a career bank board official who had  recommended that the government place Lincoln in receivership in July, 1987,  and blocked a field examination of Lincoln by the San Francisco office in  September, 1987, the California regulators said.  </P> <P> Patriarca charged that Keating tried to pack the bank board with his  hand-picked agents. He said that Keating was able to obtain a temporary  appointment for Lee Henkel, who had borrowed $60 million from Lincoln.  </P> <P> Shortly after he was named to the bank board in November, 1986, with the  support of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then-White House Chief of Staff  Donald T. Regan, Henkel proposed a rule that would have directly benefited  Lincoln, Patriarca said.  </P> <P> Henkel resigned after the Office of Government Ethics referred the entire  matter to the Justice Department for investigation, the committee was told.  </P> <P> Lincoln's consultant on direct investment, George J. Benston, almost was  confirmed as a bank board member but withdrew his name from consideration for  personal reasons, Patriarca said.  </P> <P> Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, also was criticized  by the federal regulators for his 1985 work as a paid consultant for Lincoln.  Greenspan said in a Feb. 12, 1985, report that Lincoln was a "strong  institution that poses no foreseeable risk" to the savings and loan deposit  insurance fund.  </P> <P> Black told the committee that Greenspan had an "abysmal" record of endorsing as  healthy thrift institutions that were in fact headed for failure.  </P> <P> The discovery of the listening device at Lincoln's offices in Irvine was  disclosed to the committee by California Savings and Loan Commissioner William  J. Crawford and his deputy, William Davis.  </P> <P> The state regulators reported that the device was found after the government  seized control of the institution in April. They said they did not know for  certain if it was used to monitor telephone conversations by state examiners  who were poring over Lincoln's records.  </P> <P> Long before the device was discovered, the regulators said, they had suspected  that Lincoln was gathering intelligence on the audit, and they had cautioned  their examiners to use a pay telephone if they had any confidential material to  discuss.  </P> <P> Bickwit, the American Continental attorney, said that the company never  authorized or took part in any bugging activity.  </P> <P> Staff writer James S. Granelli in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

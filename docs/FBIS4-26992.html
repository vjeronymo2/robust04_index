			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, 27 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A few days  ago, at a conference of all the city's cadres at or above the  departmental level, Shenzhen City Mayor Li Youwei conveyed Jiang  Zemin's comments made on a visit to the city on six aspects of  Shenzhen's relations with Hong Kong.    They are: One, utilization: utilize Hong Kong to help  develop the city; two, reliance: rely on Hong Kong in moving  toward the international community; three, taking reference:  learn to do things according to Hong Kong and international  conventions; four, making ties: establishing ties with Hong  Kong and branching out in the hinterland; five, making  distinctions: distinguishing between Hong Kong and one country,  two systems; and six, convergence: converging with Hong Kong for  mutual benefits.    Li Youwei said: As the "1997" Hong Kong's transition is  drawing closer, Shenzhen will play an important role in ensuring  a stable transition, smooth return, and long-term prosperity for  Hong Kong Shenzhen is a socialist special economic zone, and at  no time is it an extension or expansion of Hong Kong. We must  be clear-headed and have a clear understanding of this.</p>

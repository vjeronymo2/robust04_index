			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Gestetner sale talks abandoned GESTETNER Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor, yesterday said the sale of its Vivitar and Hanimex camera distribution businesses had fallen through. Concord Camera Corporation of the US and Gestetner jointly called off the talks after Concord failed to put together the necessary financing. Mr Andrew Adams, Gestetner projects manager, said talks between the two groups were continuing and he was still hopeful an agreement could be reached. The sale would have further focused Gestetner on its core office equipment markets after what has been an unhappy diversification into the photographic supply business. When the proposed sale was announced last September, Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner chairman, said one reason the group was withdrawing was that there was no follow-on market in camera distribution, as there was in office supplies. The deal would have involved the sale of the camera business apart from Hanimex Australia. In the year to October, the camera business reported trading profits of Pounds 1.1m on sales of Pounds 81.4m. The collapse of talks with Concord is unlikely to be seen as particularly bad news for Gestetner's finances. The Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m) cash and 1.3m Concord shares which it would have received in payment would have had little impact on a balance sheet that appears to be relatively lowly geared for a distribution company. But equally, the failed sale will do little to dispel the bid speculation that has surrounded Gestetner since last year. Since the Australian group, Chiltern Capital - then called AFP Investments - took management control of Gestetner in 1986, the revitalised company has never really fulfilled its early promise. Hanimex was one the group's first diversifications in 1989 after two successful years in which cost were cut and its manufacturing culture was replaced successfully with a more market-driven approach. Two years ago Ricoh, the Japanese photocopier group, bought a 24 per cent stake in Gestetner from AFP in a deal that valued Gestetner at about Pounds 500m. At yesterday's close of 151p, the group is worth barely half that.</p>

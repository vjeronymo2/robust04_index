Two separate projects are detailed below for judicial training and public defender training. USIA is particularly seeking projects linking American legal institutions and specialists with partners in Africa. Interested organizations are welcome to submit proposals for one or both projects; if submitting for both, each project should have a separate proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> BACKGROUND: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Many African countries are striving to create and institutionalize more democratic polities by establishing multi-party systems, writing new constitutions, holding free elections, creating new legal systems and making a variety of political and economic reforms. The highest priority of U.S. Missions in Africa is supporting democratization, of which one crucial aspect is the growth of strong legal systems and legal institutions firmly committed to the rule of law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The two projects described in this announcement are intended to engage American legal professionals, particularly judges, public defenders and training institutions, in working with African counterparts to enhance the professionalism and efficiency of the judiciary and to create or greatly expand public defender and legal aid services in the target countries. The projects should also promote long-term linkages between American and African institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested applicants are urged to read the complete  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals.

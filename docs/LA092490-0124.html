Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ATLANTA STAGES OLYMPIC PARADE  </P> <P> Olympic fever was rampant in the Georgia capital today as Atlanta staged its  first ticker-tape parade to celebrate its designation as host of the 1996  Summer Games.  </P> <P> Thousands of spectators lined the parade route, pelting Mayor Maynard Jackson  and other dignitaries with confetti and streamers as they rode by.  </P> <P> "I'm the guy who's got to clean this stuff up," Jackson laughed as he and his  wife, Valerie, tried to brush the paper from their hair.  </P> <P> Police estimated that 50,000 people had gathered for the parade by 11:30 a.m.  EDT. Atlanta schools excused children from class to attend, with parental  approval.  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann buys 47% stake in car parts group SOGEFI, the stock market quoted auto components group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company, has sold its 47.97 per cent stake in Boge, the German car parts group, to Mannesmann for L120bn (Dollars 95.79m). Sogefi, which is 60 per cent owned by Cir, bought an initial 25 per cent stake in Boge in 1989 and subsequently raised its holding in stages to the present level. Boge, which has sales of about DM750m, specialises in shock absorbers and suspension systems for vehicles, and is a European leader in research into electronic suspensions. The sale, which will give Sogefi an extraordinary gain of about L19bn, means Mannesmann now owns virtually all the shares in Boge, having bought out VDO and Commerzbank, the two main German shareholders, last August. Mannesmann subsequently went on to buy VDO, an auto electronics group, last October. Mannesmann's arrival on the scene put an end to any ambitions Sogefi may have cherished of eventually gaining control of Boge, some members of whose management had voiced misgivings about its intentions. Sogefi is already active in shock absorber production through Rejna, an Italian company it bought in 1986. Shortly afterwards, it consolidated its European position by buying shock absorber makers in France and Belgium. A Cir official denied yesterday that Sogefi had ever nursed plans to take over Boge, on the grounds that such a move would have been blocked by the German cartel authorities. Sogefi, which has grown rapidly in recent years through a string of acquisitions, specialises in auto filters and suspension systems. Sogefi said the sale to Mannesmann could be followed by co-operation in distributing spare parts for cars in Europe and in developing integrated sub-systems. Sales for Sogefi group rose by almost 9 per cent to L620bn while net profits amounted to L22.6bn in 1990, the last year for which figures are available.</p>

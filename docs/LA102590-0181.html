			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND HOME SALES HIT 3-YEAR LOW;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE 23.4% PLUNGE FROM AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER IS A REACTION TO THE GULF  CRISIS. AND SOME BELIEVE THAT THE WORST IS YET TO COME.  </P> <P> Home sales in Southern California plunged 23.4% in September compared to August  -- to their lowest levels in nearly three years -- in the first hard evidence  of how badly Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has harmed the region's already-weak  housing market, according to figures released Wednesday by TRW Real Estate  Information Services.  </P> <P> Sales plunged the most in San Diego County, down 27% from August, while Los  Angeles County suffered a 22% tumble from the previous month and Orange County  fell 24%.  </P> <P> The worldwide economic turmoil caused by the Aug. 2 invasion has driven up  gasoline prices, mortgage rates and inflation, while sending consumer  confidence into a tailspin.  </P> <P> "When you see a rise in inflation, you usually see a corresponding drop in  consumer confidence when it comes to big-ticket items," said Mark H. Obrinsky,  senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage Assn. in Washington. "And  houses are about as big ticket as you get."  </P> <P> TRW indicated that the worst is yet to come because the invasion's full impact  is not reflected in the September sales figures. That's because many buyers  whose homes closed escrow in September had agreed to the purchases before the  invasion began, said Ed Setzer, general manager of TRW Information Services.  TRW's data -- including sales of new and existing homes -- is derived from  actual escrow closures filed with county recorders' offices.  </P> <P> "October will be the first full month to show the negative effects that the  current world unrest, higher oil prices and increased inflation rate have on  Southern California home buyers," Setzer said.  </P> <P> John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, said housing  sales in September have been harmed more in southern and western states because  that is where most U.S. troops sent to the Middle East are from.  </P> <P> "You don't have as many people looking for houses, and those that are left  behind are feeling the pinch," Tuccillo said. He estimated that the national  pace of housing sales in September and October will be 5% to 10% below August  levels.  </P> <P> The turmoil came at an inopportune time for the Southern California housing  market, which has been in a tailspin for more than a year following nearly two  years of explosive growth and inflation.  </P> <P> Even prior to the Aug. 2 invasion, real estate sales were at their lowest  levels in years, and housing prices were virtually flat. The market is expected  to remain flat through next year, housing analysts say.  </P> <P> TRW's monthly report tabulated the number of homes, including condominiums,  sold in September in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside  and San Bernardino. TRW Information Services, based in Anaheim, sells real  estate information to investors, lenders and title insurance companies.  </P> <P> According to TRW, 19,331 homes were sold in Southern California in September,  the lowest total since early 1988 and 28% lower than in September, 1989. The  average price of a home in the five-county area was $208,215 in September, off  1.6% from August and up just 1.5% from September, 1989, the company said.  </P> <P> TRW's numbers reflect the actual number of homes sold, unlike the monthly  survey from the California Assn. of Realtors due to be released today that  reflects the pace of sales based on statewide surveys.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLUNGING HOME SALES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: Month-to-month percent change in  total home sales, based on actual closings in five-county area.  </P> <P> Source: TRW Real Estate Information Services.  </P></p>

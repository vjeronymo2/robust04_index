			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Rowntree charity calls for local income tax A LOCAL income tax to supplement council tax and give local government greater autonomy was recommended yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the charitable trust. The report, by a team of former senior civil servants and local officials, says a local income tax (LIT) would be 'by far the most suitable means of restoring financial freedom to local authorities'. The administrative requirements of such a tax could need some changes to national income tax, the authors say. The report - whose authors include Sir George Moseley, a former permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment - suggests that local taxes should cover about half of local revenue. 'The institution of LIT could be accompanied by corresponding reductions in national taxes,' it says. The report also says most other European countries have more than one type of local tax. The report deplores the 'climate of stress and mistrust' in relations between central and local government, and recommends more interchange of officials between the two levels. Launching the paper, Sir Charles Carter, chairman of the foundation's local-government committee, said: 'If good relations between local and central government are to be restored, we need lasting solutions that command support across the political divide'.

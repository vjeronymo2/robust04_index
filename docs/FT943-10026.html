			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Confirmation of the British stereotype One day I am going to write a pot-boiler about a successful entrepreneur. My hero will be a working class boy from a fatherless home. He will have done badly at the local comprehensive, where he will have been persecuted for being so small. He will risk everything and lose, only to start again, even more determined than before. On the way up, he will cross swords with the chief of a mighty corporation. This chap will come from a stable, upper middle-class home. He will be cautious by nature, competitive and will work 18 hours a day. Readers will not be required to believe in either character - this is fiction and bad fiction at that. Yet last week I discovered, much to my amazement, that my imaginary account would be based on fact. Three British occupational psychologists have just published detailed research* based on interviews with twenty of each type which confirm the corniest stereotypes. You cannot fault the authors on method, but I wonder about some of their subjects: author Catherine Cookson is not my idea of a first division entrepreneur, and neither is Teresa Gorman MP nor Lord Young. And when it comes to the 'intrapreneurs' - people who have transformed large organisations from within - Sir Denis Thatcher and Emma Nicholson MP would not be first on my list. At least I have found out how to make my book even more convincing: the corporate man will have to be married to the prime minister and my entrepreneur will end up one of her favourite cabinet ministers. Since I wrote last week about the down-trodden employees who have survived one of the biggest redundancy exercises in British corporate history, I have been contacted by scores of consultants specialising in the 'survivor syndrome'. One such, Alternative International, has sent me a 12-page fax explaining how these employees need to be 'emotionally reconnected to their employer' via three-day workshops consisting of 'force field analysis' and an 'external environment review.' This cure sounds almost as painful as the disease - and not everyone wants to be emotionally connected to their employer. Still, the approach is preferable to that of one FT reader who argues that people lucky enough to have jobs should stop whingeing and work harder so that the economy will recover and their ex-colleagues will be re-employed. It strikes me that if employees did more, the management would have the perfect excuse for shedding more labour. Every day there are fresh estimates of what the strikes have cost the rail industry, but there has been nothing on what it is costing companies. I have tried to find out how many people are failing to get to work, but no one seems to know. To judge by the emptiness of the tubes and buses on rail strike days, people would appear to be staying at home in droves. But in that case it is hard to understand why companies are not more agitated about it. The CBI says its members have barely mentioned the strike. It is not as though companies are making up the slack with temps: according to Alfred Marks, business is actually worse on rail strike days. Some people may be taking their sleeping bags to work. Alternatively companies may be getting on nicely without many of their workers. I hate to think what fate could greet them when they finally start working a five-day week again. If I had a penny for every time I heard someone say they do not believe executives should be rewarded for failure, I would be as rich as some of the failed executives themselves. The latest person to make this banal utterance is Tim Melville-Ross, the incoming boss of the Institute of Directors. I have yet to meet the person who can put their hand on their heart and say they do believe in rewarding failure. The issue is not what people believe in, but what they plan to do about it. At least Melville-Ross has joined the still small band of campaigners against the three-year rolling contracts that allow sacked executives to collect large pay-offs. When people say they do not believe in rewarding failure, they usually mean they do believe in rewarding success. This is equally platitudinous. Nearly everyone thinks success should be rewarded: the question is by how much. The latest survey shows that 54 British directors earned more than Pounds 1m last year. Presumably, most of those were successful. But were they that successful? Would they have been any less successful had they been paid less? There must be another book here for occupational psychologists: meanwhile the message from the 20 intrapreneurs suggests the need to achieve is a much stronger motivation than money. * Business Elites, by Reg Jennings et al.

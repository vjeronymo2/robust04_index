			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, chief PLO negotiator at the </F> Israeli-Palestinian Cairo talks, by Faridah al-Shubashi in Cairo  on 2 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Two days separate us from the signing  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What is the status of the  negotiations and what have the two sides accomplished so far?    [Sha'th] We are about to reach a full agreement that will  cover all aspects of life in Gaza and Jericho and will be ready  for the signature of President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin Wednesday morning, 4 May. This agreement now is  in its final stages. Of course some issues require final  decisions [words indistinct] issues related to stationing a  Palestinian officer on the Allenby bridge and crossings, [words  indistinct] on the Gaza coast. Other issues will be completed  before reaching this agreement, God willing. This agreement  will also include the agreements reached by the Palestinian and  Israeli delegations in the Paris economic talks. The entire  economic agreement will become one of the elements of this  agreement, which we will sign here.    The agreement will also cover all the civilian and security  issues and all the powers the Palestinian authority will  exercise. All security issues related to the Israeli withdrawal  and the [word indistinct] and deployment of the Palestinian  police, as well as the agreement on releasing the detainees.  What remains is the drafting of certain articles related to the  preamble of the agreement and some agreements that were agreed  on in principle between President 'Arafat and Foreign Minister  Peres here in Cairo; that is, the Palestinian passport, its form  and details; the international presence agreed on in Gaza and  Jericho and its details; the Palestinian postage stamp and the  Palestinians' right to international postal union; and certain  issues related to special Palestinian powers at the Rafah  crossing. We agreed that the Rafah crossing will be open 24  hours a day, 365 days a year, and will be open not only for  people but for trucks, goods, and private vehicles. The special  crossing between Gaza and Jericho was agreed to be open 365 days  a year for people, goods, and vehicles. The final touches will  be put on all these issues today and tomorrow.    [Al-Shubashi] In the news conference held when U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher and Peres were present in  Cairo--held jointly with President Mubarak--'Arafat said that he  hoped for tangible progress so that he could present it to his  people. Does this mean that the Palestinian president is still  unable to say that he has anything to present to his people?    [Sha'th] Until this moment we are still negotiating. We have  not implemented [word indistinct] to put what we negotiated into  practice. Will this really happen the morning after the  agreement, that is, Thursday or Friday after the signing  ceremony on Wednesday? The Palestinians [word indistinct]  thousands of detainees will be let out of prisons; hundreds of  deportees will return to their children; 6,000 Palestinian  soldiers and officers will return to the homeland with their  families. The doors will be open and the Israeli withdrawal  will take a speedy form and there will be daily hand-overs of  camps occupied by the Israeli Army to the Palestinian people and  police. The Palestinian authority will enter led by brother  Yasir 'Arafat. This authority will take over all the powers the  Israelis have been exercising.    The Palestinian citizen will feel the great difference, and  the long hours of suffering as a result of searches and  interrogation, more searching and interrogations, will end. The  economic assistance will begin pouring in and the Palestinian  economic institutions will be established to provide a decent  living for our people gradually. Many things will happened.  The Gaza airport will be opened after a short time from the  entry of ... [pauses] and [word indistinct] in Gaza and Jericho,  travel between Gaza and Jericho and then travel between Gaza and  Cairo. Preparations will begin to establish an international  airport as soon as possible. Ships will start arriving at Gaza  in preparation for the opening of the Gaza international harbor.  The fishermen will suddenly have the right to fish up to 20  miles without restrictions. The shores will open and the major  part of the security restrictions that prevented the people of  Gaza even from eating fish will end. They will find that the  shore is theirs. The Israeli presence, which is sitting on  their chests in the camps and streets, will end and they will  find their children wearing the Palestinian uniform, Palestinian  flags, and the Palestinian insignia offering protection for them  instead of pursuing and repressing them everywhere. All of this  and much more will be what brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]  sees as the tangible results on the ground.    [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, last question: What was the U.S.  stand that the U.S. secretary of state brought him? Has the  United States begun to realize that the Palestinian problem  should be solved with at least a minimum of justice?    [Sha'th] No doubt there is a feeling that the lost time is  over and there can be no possibility for any more delay. The  implementation of the Declaration of Principles should go ahead  and implementation of other steps in the Palestinian arena  should continue in terms of an early transfer of power in the  West Bank and Israeli's withdrawal from the West Bank cities and  villages, and then the final solution for the Palestinian  problem should begin in a complete manner. We have heard from  Peres that Israel will shorten the transitional period from five  to three years. This means that we must begin negotiating on  the West Bank immediately. This is for the Palestinian arena...    [Al-Shubashi, interrupting] Including the removal of the  settlements?    [Sha'th] No doubt, the issue of the settlements will  immediately enter the final negotiations. There is no solution  without a full removal of these settlements. Moreover,  Jerusalem is at the heart of our actions. Measures related to  Jerusalem must begin immediately and negotiations on Jerusalem  must begin immediately. In principles, all restriction on the  city of Jerusalem and the other West Bank cities must end. By  the way, there will be no barriers between Gaza, Jericho, and  the West Bank. There will be no measurers relating to entry and  departure from these territories. We are applying the measures  pertaining to the fact that, even at the first stage, the West  Bank and Gaza are an integrated whole, inseparable, and whole  territorial entity.    But I say that the United States clearly is interested in  beginning the solution in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.  Therefore, Christopher's travel to Damascus, then to Israel,  and then to Damascus is to emphasize the idea of a comprehensive  solution and the need for implementation to begin on the Syrian  front and on the Jordanian and Lebanese front and not only on  the Palestinian front.    [Al-Shubashi] Why has Israel criticized Egypt's recent role  and protested against it?    [Sha'th] I do not know. All I can imagine is that Egypt has  never denied that it has been working to support Palestinian  rights and has never said it was a neutral state. It is true  that it is tied to Israel by a treaty -- which Egypt has  respected fully and proven that through peace, rights and  security for all will be realized -- but Egypt never said that  it was a neutral state between the Palestinians and Israel and  has worked throughout the negotiations to back Palestinian  rights. If this sometimes angers the Israelis then let it be.    [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th.</p>

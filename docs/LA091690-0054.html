			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL AIR FORCE BESTED HITLER'S BEST IN WW II'S HEROIC BATTLE OF BRITAIN;  </P> <P> IN SEPTEMBER, 1940, GERMANY LAID SIEGE TO LONDON. AT THE TIME, JOSEPH W. GRIGG  WAS A CORRESPONDENT FOR UNITED PRESS IN BERLIN.  </P> <P> On Sept. 14, 1940, a hot, brilliantly sunny Sunday, Adolf Hitler's  Nazi-controlled Berlin radio launched an all-out propaganda campaign to  announce to the world the climax of what later became known as the Battle of  Britain and the start of the German Luftwaffe's bombing blitz against London.  </P> <P> Along with other foreign correspondents in Berlin, I was summoned to a special  Sunday afternoon news conference at the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.  </P> <P> Raucous trumpet fanfare, special Nazi government communiques and purported  eyewitness stories by breathless Nazi radio reporters -- this was long before  the days of television -- and a new battle tune titled "Bombs on England" kept  the German radio running at white heat throughout that late summer Sunday and  the next week.  </P> <P> With the defeat and surrender of France in June, 1940, Britain had been left  alone to face the might of Hitler's victorious Wermacht and a Luftwaffe that  was at that time the world's most formidable air force.  </P> <P> Over the English Channel and the green fields of southeast England, young,  largely inexperienced and heavily outnumbered British Royal Air Force fighter  pilots plunged in their Spitfires and Hurricanes into battle with the  Luftwaffe's crack Messerschmidt 109 and 110 squadrons.  </P> <P> Nazi bombers blasted Britain's fighter airfields at Manston, Biggin Hill and  elsewhere in southeast England in a bid to smash the Royal Air Force's fighter  resistance.  </P> <P> Hitler's strategy, as expanded at the time to American and other neutral  reporters in Berlin by Nazi officials, depended first on defeating the small,  greatly outnumbered RAF.  </P> <P> His goal was nothing less than the invasion and defeat of Britain and its  elimination from the war. By September, 1940, Hitler already had given orders  to his commanders to prepare for what was to be know as "Operation Sealion,"  the code name for a planned invasion of England.  </P> <P> But Britain's powerful Royal Navy still controlled the English Channel. Nazi  officials with whom I talked argued that if the RAF were first driven from the  skies, a German invasion armada could cross the Channel under what was  described as an "umbrella" of Nazi bombers and fighter planes, against which,  it was claimed, Britain's Royal Navy would be powerless to block the planned  invasion.  </P> <P> Before this, Hitler's master plan called for a general softening up of British  government and civilian morale by means of devastating air raids on London and  other big British cities by the concentrated might of the Luftwaffe.  </P> <P> So convinced were the Nazis that this strategy would succeed that officials in  Berlin boasted that within weeks they would be holding news conferences in  Buckingham Palace, home of Britain's royal family.  </P> <P> Three German reporters of my acquaintance bet me 25 bottles of Champagne that  by July 1, 1941, London and the rest of the British Isles would be under Nazi  occupation. I never collected on that bet because, by the target date in 1941,  Champagne was practically unobtainable in Germany.  </P> <P> For the coming Battle of Britain, Hitler named one of his top aides,  Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering, to be Luftwaffe supreme commander.  </P> <P> Goering concentrated all his available air strength of 3,000 planes in occupied  northern France. He set up his own headquarters on the French channel coast  from which in clear weather he could stare across the 20 miles to the white  chalk cliffs of Dover.  </P> <P> In the last days of August and early September, Goering unleashed his bomber  fleets to attack British coastal shipping and ports and to pound key RAF  fighter bases in southeastern England. His aim was to drive the RAF back into  the interior of the country.  </P> <P> But the British managed to make their fighter bases usable again much faster  than the Nazis had expected.  </P> <P> In the ensuing air battles the RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes suffered grievous  losses. Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6, according to British figures, Britain lost  nearly one-fourth of its 1,000 fighter pilots.  </P> <P> But the RAF still survived as an effective fighting force.  </P> <P> As Winston Churchill declared later in a historic speech to the British House  of Commons, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many  to so few."  </P> <P> Sept. 14 and 15 are commemorated in Britain. On those two days the Luftwaffe  launched its greatest concentrated onslaught yet in daylight attacks against  London. But postwar information has shown that Luftwaffe losses on those days  alone were 56 fighters and bombers. British losses were about half that number.  </P> <P> British leaders had estimated that in order to survive, the RAF needed to down  three Luftwaffe planes to every one RAF plane lost.  </P> <P> Despite grim RAF losses, the result of the Battle of Britain was a defeat for  the Luftwaffe. All told, in three months in 1940 the Luftwaffe lost nearly  2,000 planes. Hitler had to abandon forever his plan to invade England.  </P> <P> British civilian morale remained high despite 20,000 casualties and long nights  spent in bomb shelters and London subway tunnels.  </P> <P> An angry Goering returned from northern France to Berlin after delivering a  tongue-lashing to his Luftwaffe pilots with these words, "You have not only  deeply disappointed me, you have betrayed me."  </P> <P> Nearly four years after the defeat of Hitler's plan to invade Britain, U.S.,  British and Canadian forces crossed the English Channel to Nazi-occupied Europe  on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the forerunner of Allied World War II victory in  Europe.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURAL GEM  </P> <P> As an expatriate Yorkshire woman residing in California since 1952, I feel  compelled to write you a criticism of the Judith Morgan article, "This  Part-Time Job Is One Worth Crying About," June 17. Three times in the story,  the cathedral York Minster in York, England, was incorrectly referred to as  York Minister.  </P> <P> Minster is originally a word of Norse extraction, meaning a large  cathedral-like church or monastery. A minister (person) it is not!  </P> <P> If Morgan really was in York, then she surely was exposed to countless leaflets  about the lovely and famous York Minster, as well as numerous street signs, all  pointing the way to this most historic edifice.  </P> <P> By the way, York is a beautiful city and the Minster an absolute architectural  gem, well worth visiting.  </P> <P> BETTY BATEMAN  </P> <P> Bonita  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, Politburo member and  president of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  has reaffirmed the people's protagonistic role in building a  society for which it is worth making any possible sacrifice.    Alarcon de Quesada has outlined the first progress report to  voters from the capital, at electoral district No. 59 of the  Managua People's Council in Arroyo Naranjo. He urged the  participants to retain the spirit of Guaimaro because we have  the wisdom and the force to succeed and to show the world that  we can resist.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Property Market: Cracks became chasms - Vanessa Houlder on 1992's litany of business failures It is more than three years since the UK commercial property sector went into decline, but 1992 was undoubtedly the year when the cracks became chasms. The past year produced a litany of disastrous corporate news. In March, Randsworth, a West End company bought by US investors at the peak of the market in 1989, went into receivership with debts exceeding Pounds 350m. In April, Speyhawk disclosed that its liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 70m and that it was in talks with its bankers. So too did Heron, the property, finance and trading group, with net debts of Pounds 1.3bn. In May, Mountleigh, a small wool manufacturing company that was transformed into one of the most audacious deal-makers on the stockmarket, went into receivership with debts of Pounds 400m. Rosehaugh, another notable developer and trader, later went into receivership with debts of Pounds 350m. But undoubtedly the most devastating collapse was that of Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest developer. In May, O&amp;Y filed for insolvency protection in Canada and the US. Within days, Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's Pounds 1.5bn development in London's docklands was put into administration. In absolute terms, the downturn is the worst the UK has ever experienced. An estimated Pounds 90bn has been wiped off the total value of commercial property in the UK, which in 1989 stood at Pounds 250bn, according to figures from surveyors Hillier Parker and the London Business School. Some 32m square feet of office in central London is unoccupied. Bank debt to property companies stands at more than Pounds 35bn. Since April 1990, property businesses have been going bankrupt at the rate of one every 36 hours, according to figures from accountants Touche Ross. But however cataclysmic this recession may be to its victims, it is worth recalling that the market has been through some spectacular ups and downs before. The unbridled capitalism of the 19th century unleashed booms and busts every quarter of a century. The break-neck expansion of London was periodically interrupted by mass bankruptcies among property developers. The problems experienced by John Nash, the Prince Regent's architect, to get Regent's Street and Regent's Park built and let 'make Canary Wharf seem a passing local difficulty', said Simon Jenkins, the ex-editor of the Times, in a lecture broadcast in London last week. In the 19th century London was littered with new developments which, like Canary Wharf, appeared to be white elephants. Parts of Notting Hill, for example, became a ghost town when they were developed in the mid-1800s. It was described by the journal Building News as 'a graveyard of buried hopes'. There has been no let-up this century in London's expansion or the cycles of boom and bust. The oldest property slump in living memory was the depression of the 1930s, when the UK economy shrank by a third and property values fell by a quarter, according to a surveyor working at the time. The second world war also precipitated a 'sudden and sweeping' decline in values, according to The Property Boom by Oliver Marriott. One prominent casualty was Jackie Phillips, one of the biggest pre-war developers, who died on Christmas day 1939 'impoverished, his banking accounts overdrawn and his credit stopped'. Widespread disaster in the sector was only averted by a moratorium on loans by insurance companies, building societies and other lenders. One of the market's biggest upheavals was in the 1970s. This was due in part to the post-war introduction of a planning system which restricted supply and encouraged prices to overheat during periods of prosperity. In the period of heady development in the early 1970s, property profits rose to a level which Lord Barber, the then chancellor, described as 'obscene'. In 1973, Clive Jenkins, a trades union leader, said the activities of property developers were 'destroying the middle classes, encouraging petty crime and had led to a decline of investment in manufacturing industries'. The downturn, when it came, was abrupt. 'It was equivalent to walking out of the house and, before you reach the corner, there is an earthquake', said Willie Stern, a developer whose bankruptcy in 1978 with debts of more than Pounds 104m propelled him into the record books. When Margaret Reid assessed the 1970s property crash for her book The Secondary Banking Crisis 1973-75, she described it in terms that makes the present downturn seem tame. 'Never since the South Sea Bubble (in the 18th century) had there been such a massive evaporation of speculators' expectations as at that time in the previously euphoric property market.'</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Australia port strike ends The six-day shutdown of Australia's ports ended yesterday, with maritime union members agreeing to return to work after Canberra reversed its decision not to sell Australian National Line. The government had announced plans to privatise the business, but last month declared 'it couldn't be given away'. This prompted union fears that it was to be wound down, triggering the shutdown. Yesterday, the government said it would put the line up for tender, subject to Australian Labor Party approval.</p>

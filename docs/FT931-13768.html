			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bols, Wessanen hold discussions on merger BOLS, the Dutch spirits and beverages group, and Wessanen, one of the Netherlands' biggest food groups, are holding talks on a full merger by means of a share swap. The proposed merger would create a diversified food and beverages group with sales of more than Fl 5bn (Dollars 2.7bn) and a strong presence in selected niches, mainly in European and North American markets, though it would remain small compared with the other recent link-ups in the foods and beverage industries. The companies declined to give any details of the share-swap proposal, apart from saying that the merger would be on the 'basis of equality'. Shares in Bols, which is smaller than Wessanen but makes roughly the same profits, rose strongly on the news, closing up 9.8 per cent at Fl 47. Wessanen fell Fl 5 to Fl 98.50. The proposed merger brings together two companies with virtually no overlapping areas of business. Bols, which has sales of around Fl 1.2bn, is best known for its liqueurs. It has diversified into wines and non-alcoholic drinks in order to reduce its dependence on spirits. Nearly 90 per cent of turnover comes from Europe. Wessanen, with 1991 sales of Fl 3.9bn, has transformed itself from a producer of bulk foodstuffs to a group active in branded foods. Around 60 per cent of sales are in the US, where it made a string of acquisitions in the 1980s in ice creams, yoghurt and other dairy products.</p>

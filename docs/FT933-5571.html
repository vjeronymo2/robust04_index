			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: BBL chief says recovery under way BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three biggest banks, yesterday claimed to have laid the foundations for recovery after recording net non-consolidated profits of BFr2.46bn (Dollars 69m) for the first half of the year. Announcing the interim results yesterday, Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, who took over as chief executive last December, said: 'Fundamentally the bank that you have here is a better bank, a more solid bank than it was six months ago.' The non-consolidated profit was twice the equivalent figure of BFr1.23bn for 1992, but direct comparison is difficult because BBL has changed its year-end. The group calculated an artificial half-year equivalent from the group's 15-month figures for 1991-1992. Consolidated profits rose from the restated six-month figure of BFr1.46bn to BFr3.06bn after tax, and BBL said it hoped to double net profit for the year. Mr Cardon also hinted that BBL might be ready to return to a more generous dividend policy, following last year's dividend cut. In 1992, BBL had to make extensive provisions against bad loans, which reduced net consolidated profits from BFr4.5bn in the year to the end of September 1991, to BFr3.6bn in the following 15 months. Meanwhile, an attempt to link up with Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services group, fell through. Mr Cardon was appointed following the unexpected resignation of Mr Theo Peeters, who, together with most of the BBL management, had backed the ill-fated plan for an ING bid. Mr Cardon said an 8 per cent increase in customers' deposits in the first six months of 1993 - from BFr1,126bn to BFr1,214bn - showed that 'the new BBL' had retained its credibility following the ING affair. He also pointed out that net interest income of BFr18.8bn, against BFr17.3bn, now more than covered recurring overheads. ING retains an 11 per cent stake in BBL, but the bank has decided to pursue insurance links with two other insurer-investors, Royale Belge of Belgium and Winterthur of Switzerland. Winterthur increased its stake in BBL to 7.2 per cent two weeks ago and Mr Cardon said yesterday that the Swiss company would continue to buy BBL shares, but 'at the right moment and at the right price'.</p>

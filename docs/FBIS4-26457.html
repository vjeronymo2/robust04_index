Speaking at a ceremony entitled "China (Guangdong) First  Program Week To Promote Real Estate and Development Zones," the  deputy governor said that Guangdong will continue its efforts to  improve its investment environment and to deepen the reform of  the land use system so as to bring the role of land assets into  full play in economic development.

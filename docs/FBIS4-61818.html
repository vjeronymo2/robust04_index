			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Remarks" by Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik at the </F> meeting of defense and foreign ministers of Western European  Union member states in Luxembourg on 9 May -- received via  Internet E-LIST]    [Text] Esteemed Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,    It is truly a pleasure to take part in today's historic  meeting called to inaugurate the enhanced position of nine  states from Consultation Partner to Association Partner status  in the WEU [Western European Union]. Estonia warmly welcomes  this step as a clear political signal that these nine states are  regarded as having the best chance of eventual membership in the  European Union.    At the same time, the new enhanced status being celebrated  here today attests to the common values that we, the nine new  Association Partners, share with the WEU member states. It is  these shared values that constitute a common point of departure  for European integration on all levels and in all phases of  life, including defence policy. Estonia takes great pride in  being part of a group dedicated not to old ideas, such as the  reassertion of empire, but rather to the goals of building a  stable Europe based on consensus and democracy.    As Association Partners, we will seek to take an active role  in helping construct the new structures of European security.  We would hope to participate as fully as possible in  discussions held in the WEU, and through these discussions, to  integrate our policies with the European Union's Common Foreign  and Security Policy.    We regard the WEU's decision to extend Association Partner  status simultaneously to the "Group of Nine" seated here today  as showing great foresight. This move is consistent with the  WEU's earlier decision to invite these nine states to be  Consultation Forum members at the same time in the Summer of  1992.    Since that time, the international political arena has  changed significantly. For instance, all of us new Association  Partners have joined NATO's Partnership for Peace [PfP] program.  In the meantime, other states have begun speaking of  condominium [as received] arrangements for assuring the security  of Europe, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev did last  Saturday [7 May] when he rejected PfP, saying that it did not  suit Russia. In bidding for a special relationship with NATO,  which Mr. Kozyrev has referred to as "a real partnership," the  Russian Federation has taken upon itself to dictate the content  of the PfP program for the other, more ordinary partners. This  claim to special status threatens to stymie the ability of other  states to realize their full potential under PfP. Given this  sort of argumentation coming from Moscow, we are all the more  gratified by the WEU's decision to extend nine states enhanced  status. This move demonstrates the WEU's singular understanding  that we cannot and should not draw borders in today's Europe,  especially not borders that could once again become curtains  wrought of iron.    I would turn now to an issue that is not only of vital  importance to us but which also has become a touchstone of  European security, namely troop withdrawals from Estonia. As  you are all aware, our negotiations with the Russia Federation  have come to a virtual standstill. During the more than two  years that we have been negotiating with Russia, Estonia has put  forth constructive proposal after proposal, which have been  regularly and systematically rejected by the Russian side. Our  agreement on troop withdrawals has been ready for signing since  the beginning of March, but Russia continues to delay,  re-opening discussion of questions that were resolved long ago.    Furthermore, in violation of obligations it has incurred in  various international fora to pull the troops out in an "early,  orderly, and unconditional" fashion, Russia continues to link  withdrawal to other issues, primarily to so-called social  guarantees for retired and demobilized military officers. While  we have rejected this linkage from the start, we understand that  Russia needs an agreement on these reserve officers, and for  this reason have continued negotiating in good faith. Still,  despite our best efforts, Russia continues to insist on special  privileges for these officers, privileges above and beyond those  rights our own citizens enjoy.    As you have surely heard, during our 19th round of  negotiations, which ended last Friday near Tallinn, the Russian  side failed to name a date for the next round of talks.  Instead, the Russian negotiating team said a subsequent round  would not be held until Estonia tables sufficiently constructive  proposals as to justify holding a round. In effect, this means  that Russia has suspended talks until Estonia gives in to its  demands, which include, among other things, that Estonia change  its internal legislation. Not only does this stance suggest  that Russia has an interesting view of what compromise and  negotiation should entail, it also suggests a rather bizarre  concept of sovereignty.    And as if this ultimatum-style approach were not enough,  last  Friday, the same day as our negotiations ended, Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters in Moscow that if Estonia  does not meet all of Russia's demands, Russia may not withdraw  the troops at all, but rather may boost the military presence in  my country. The fact that Grachev, representing one UN member  state, threatened to invade another UN member state, at the very  same time as withdrawal talks were going on, is unacceptable if  not ludicrous. We are certain that the international community  will not remain silent, but will give its clear, unmistakable,  and public appraisal of this open intimidation.    I would stress here that Estonia attaches particular  importance to participation in the political and security  consultation mechanisms foreseen for the Association Members of  the WEU. We are eager, for instance, to establish a liaison  arrangement with the Planning Cell and to become involved in  WEU-led humanitarian and rescue tasks as well as tasks of combat  forces in crisis management. Another area of special interest to  us is peacekeeping. As you know, along with our Latvian and  Lithuanian colleagues, we have established a joint Baltic  Peacekeeping Battalion. We hope to offer our joint battalion to  the WEU for peacekeeping operations, and look forward to being  involved in the command structures and decisionmaking processes  that will accompany these future operations.    I would conclude my remarks by once again drawing your  attention to the historic nature of our meeting here in  Luxembourg today. Today's WEU meeting holds the same importance  for us as did the NATO summit last January. Both  meetings--January in Brussels and May in Luxembourg--will be  seen by historians as marking the ascent to an entirely new  plateau in European security. Through these meetings, Estonia  has taken a small step toward full integration in European  security structures. But for all of us gathered here, today's  meeting represents a giant leap toward creating a new European  Defence Identity.    Thank you.</p>

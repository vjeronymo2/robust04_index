			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rock's quintessential New York voice Lou Reed, in his 20th album, titled "New  York," proclaims that the city is in terminal decline, a dirty island sinking  into a filthy river watched over by a "Statue of Bigotry" that taunts the poor  huddled masses she lured into hopeless poverty and brutality. "I'll take  Manhattan," Reed sings, "in a garbage bag." But Reed, 47, told Reuters in an  interview that the album's bitter rage and venomous humor did not reflect  despair, just reality. "I think it's a pretty accurate, kind of jaundiced view  -- with a lot of humor -- of some of the things that are going on in this city  that I really care about," said Reed, who 20 years ago helped found the Velvet  Underground, the Andy Warhol-sponsored band that shattered rock lyrics taboos.

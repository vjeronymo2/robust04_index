			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on  Wednesday warned that if North Korea persists in going nuclear  and tries to test the West's patience, they would have no  alternative but to face self-destruction.    Saying that North Korea is trying to develop nuclear arms  with an aim not at Japan, China or Russia but at South Korea,  Kim said, "Our patience has come to a limit. North Korean  nuclear development should be thwarted by all means."    President Kim made the remarks at a tea party he hosted at  Chongwadae [presidential offices] for about 500 steering and  standing committee members of the Advisory Council for  Democratic and Peaceful Unification.    "I hope North Korean authorities will realize that their  acceptance of nuclear inspection and return to genuine dialogue  for peace will be the only way for the survival of themselves  and the Korean nation," Kim said.    He said he is willing to talk openheartedly with North  Korean  authorities on pending inter-Korean issues including the nuclear  question if they unconditionally accept international inspection  of their nuclear facilities.    The Chongwadae reception was also attended by Deputy Prime  Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. Among  the attending advisory council leaders were council Vice  Chairman Kim Myong-yun and Council Secretary General Yu  Kyong-hyon.</p>

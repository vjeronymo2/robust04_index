			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Ulster peace talks may proceed without Paisley THE BRITISH government is to press ahead with plans to put forward its own proposals for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland even if Mr Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party decides not to return to the negotiating table. Ministers' determination to proceed irrespective of possible DUP objections emerged last night as Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed he will shortly meet the leaders of all four constitutional Northern Ireland parties  -including Mr Paisley - for bilateral talks. The meeting with Mr Paisley, who yesterday spelt out two conditions for rejoining the talks, will focus on the DUP's proposals for 'breaking the logjam' and consequently is not regarded at Westminster as part of the formal process. News of the fresh round of talks came on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, which will try to put renewed impetus behind the government's efforts. The detail of Mr Major's proposals is not expected to become clear for some time and may initially be presented to those participating in the talks in further bilateral sessions and in private. The plan is, however, believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with Mr Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein. Mr Paisley yesterday insisted Mr Hume must end his meetings with Mr Adams, before the DUP would re-enter talks. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2 and 3 (of its constitution which covers its claim to the North), there is no point in sitting down with them,' he added.

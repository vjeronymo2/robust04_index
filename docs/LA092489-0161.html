			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE  </P> <P> Re state Sen. John Seymour's (R-Anaheim) pro-choice position:  </P> <P> The senator's new position on abortion is particularly laudable because it  helps to clarify what it really means to be pro-choice.  </P> <P> Every individual's right to judge abortion as right or wrong and to act  personally according to his own convictions is to be respected. That is the  cornerstone of pro-choice philosophy. But as the senator points out, to impose  one's personal belief on others would not be "appropriate," especially through  the "privileged power" he has as a state legislator. Using the power of the  government to impose personally held beliefs is just as unacceptable as using  tactics of intimidation and coercion.  </P> <P> Especially profound is the senator's realization that the government should not  discriminate against the poor in funding medical services. Politically it  certainly wasn't necessary or even expedient to reach that conclusion. But it  is decent and fair-minded.  </P> <P> BARBARA JACKSON  </P> <P> North Orange County Chapter  </P> <P> National Organization for Women  </P></p>

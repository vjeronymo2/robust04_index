The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Act (Magnuson Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including dead coral or rock (excluding mollusk shells), and therefore is a ``fish'' within the meaning of the Magnuson Act. Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef aquaria. Live rock is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonrenewable resource providing essential fishery habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), NMFS published an emergency interim rule to control the taking of live rock in the Gulf of Mexico. A description of the fishery and the rationale for that rulemaking are contained in that rule and are not repeated here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In part because of concerns about effort shifting from recently closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico to current or new harvest areas off the southern Atlantic states, the South Atlantic Council requested an emergency rule to: (1) Prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) prohibit chipping of live rock in the EEZ from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and (3) limit the harvest of live rock in 1994 from the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reported landings from the Florida portion of the proposed closed area totaled less than 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) in 1993 or about 1 percent of all Florida landings. Florida is the only state in which live rock landings have been recorded. This emergency closure is designed in part to prevent expansion of harvesting effort into new areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into smaller fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer. Chipping causes serious damage to hard bottom habitats including coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Recent public testimony to the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils indicated that chipping accounts for about 10 to 20 percent of the live rock harvest off the southern Atlantic states. In the Gulf of Mexico, chipping of limestone ledges and worm reefs accounts for about 90 percent of the live rock harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During a proposed phase out of live rock harvesting under Amendment 2 to the FMP, which is currently under development, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils intend to limit harvest to loose rubble rock that is primarily the result of natural erosion processes. About 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) of rubble live rock were reported landed in Florida in 1992, and this is the basis for the 1994 quota. Data available to the South Atlantic Council indicate that live rock landings are increasing and the quota for 1994 is likely to be exceeded prior to implementation of management measures in Amendment 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) estimates that the quota will probably be met sometime in October 1994. If a shift of harvesting effort from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic occurs due to the Gulf emergency rule or other factors, the quota could be reached much earlier. Amendment 2 is not expected to be implemented until mid November 1994. The South Atlantic Council therefore requested emergency action to implement the 1994 quota and to prohibit all chipping of live rock to prevent damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery habitat in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, including the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

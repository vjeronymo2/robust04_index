			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he will not be driven from office  by a stock-trading scandal that has forced three Cabinet ministers to resign.  He said he will try to restore public trust in government. Opposition leaders  have demanded Takeshita's removal in the wake of the resignation of Ken Harada,  director of the Economic Planning Agency, because of links to Recruit Co., the  firm at the center of the stock-trading and alleged influence-peddling scandal.  </P></p>

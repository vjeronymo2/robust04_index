			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The Human Rights Institute  released a protest against Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev's recent statement in which he claims the Baltic states  violate human rights.    Kozyrev's statement said the Baltic states violate the  rights  of people of Russian origin on an ethnic basis. He accused them  of planning forcible deportation of thousands of people and an  ethnic cleansing.    The institute declared that the international CSCE, U.N. and  Council of Europe commissions have not observed in the Baltic  states violations of human rights on an ethnic basis.    The institute voiced the opinion that accusations of human  rights violations stem from Russia's interest in keeping its  forces in the Baltic states and subjecting those countries to  its imperialistic ambitions.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The recovery in UK gilts and sterling helped stock index futures shrug off the gloom seen in recent sessions and the advance helped to pull the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,105, up 48 from its previous close but at parity with the underlying cash market. Volume was 12,313 contracts. Earlier, sellers of the contract dominated trading, with Goldman Sachs reported to have been particularly active in the first hour. Having opened at 3,051, June fell to the day's low of 3,045, dragging the cash market lower. The improvement in UK gilts, along with a more steady performance in the other European bond markets, helped to reverse the earlier retreat, with the underlying cash market once again following suit. The high of the day was 3,112, reached in the last half-hour of trading. In the traded options, total volume of 36,718 was little changed from Wednesday's figure. Most of the trading activity was in the index options, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 12,508 lots and the Euro FT-SE option 8,042 contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,142 lots dealt. The August 260 calls were said to have been the busiest series. Argyll Group was next at 1,776 lots.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: Berio roundly celebrated - David Murray welcomes 'Renderings' on the South Bank On the South Bank, a retrospective festival of Luciano Berio's music is well underway. 'Renderings' - the label reflects Berio's penchant for doing things over again, both other composers' things and his own - goes on until May 14 (a semi-staged BBC performance of his opera La vera storia). It is strange to think of this inquiring, playful, sensuous spirit as suddenly belonging to a Grand Old Man. Actually his 70th anniversary is not this year, but next; so we may be in for the protracted kind of musical birthday party that has enjoyed a recent vogue. On Friday Berio conducted the Halle Orchestra in a programme that might have been designed to highlight his elusive twinkle, and his restless revisiting of old sites. First we had Twice upon . . ., a new participation-piece designed for children from a half-dozen primary schools, with ten Halle players to guide them through noisy high-jinks. Not so much a score, more a set of crowd-control directions, but there were unmistakable Berio moments: some suspended chords, luminously spaced just so, and his comic relish for superimposing disparate ideas without letting them blend. We also heard his officially-titled Rendering (1990), a respectful mock-up of late Schubert sketches (D936A) for a symphony in D, with dreamy, celesta-iced interludes out of other late Schubert and Berio's own knight's-move fancies. Not quite enough of the one or of the other, I thought: Schubert's fragments too little fleshed out for a vital reconstruction, Berio's elaborations too shy and bitty to turn the whole thing into an honest post-modern exercise. But interesting, of course, and attractive; Berio is never less than interesting or attractive. Among the famous post-Schoenberg modernists of the 1950s and 1960s - Boulez, Stockhausen, Barraque, Nono, Maderna - Berio already had more of a pre-'modern' oeuvre to his name than most. Only in the early 1950s, when he married a ground-breaking young artist, the American mezzo Cathy Berberian (their creative partnership survived his subsequent marriages) and began studying with Dallapiccola, did the new possibilities of atonality and serialism seize his imagination. So did the extra-musical allure of 'semiotics', language as radically re-studied by Eco, Sanguineti and Calvino. Though British critics have preferred not to examine that side of Berio too closely, it is no less central to his mature work than 'pure' musical serialism. Even in his early, conscientiously formal experiments, Berio scores sounded more transparent and lyrical, more direct and often more mischievously inconsequent - more Italian  - than anything by his Euro-revolutionary comrades. His fascination with procedures has always been leavened by his concern for the human voice, and what - in countless different ways  - it can say. Friday's main work was his 'new' quasi-cantata Epiphanies, for mezzo and orchestra. This is Berio's latest, joined-up and presumably definitive version of what used to be his looser Epifanie sequence (1969), but was originally a set of brief studies (1959-62: Quaderni, 'notebooks') for the overweeningly large orchestra that a lucky young composer could command in those palmy days. Berio soon wanted to interpolate vocal movements amongst them. Sung, spoken or muttered, the 'epiphanies' are drawn from revered Euro-authors (Proust and Joyce, Machado and Brecht); here, young Charlotte Hellekant was superbly in command of Berberian's wide-ranging multilingual role. Re-adjusted by Berio's master hand, the dramatic half-hour sequence of Epiphanies - more exactly, its rhetorical succession of highs and lows, limpid breadths and gnomic compression - works a treat. It grips, surprises and convinces. In detail, however, it seems more of an autobiographical music-album than a integral whole. The earliest Quaderni bits are impacted neo-Webern shards; they share few of their manners with Berio's later solo-voice effusions, when the challenges of his unadorned Sequenze forced him to seek plain, ground-level ways of developing his music for ordinary ears. The fruits of that experience can be heard in the remaining concerts, and in particular the complete, astonishing Sequenze will be delivered by suitable virtuosi this Thursday.</p>

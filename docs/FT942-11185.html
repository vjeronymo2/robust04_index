			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pall above entertainment wedding  -The Dollars 8bn Viacom-Blockbuster union looks shaky Dead, but just not buried. That was the epitaph pronounced this week by one Wall Street analyst on the proposed Dollars 8bn takeover of video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment by Viacom, the film, television and publishing group. The takeover was announced at the start of this year as part of Viacom's successful bid for Paramount Communications. Neither Viacom nor Blockbuster is acknowledging the deal is off, and the merger agreement gives them until the end of September to consummate the marriage. However, it is hard to find anyone on Wall Street who thinks the deal will go through in anything like its present form, and there are indications the two sides are discussing various forms of co-operation short of a merger. In a letter to shareholders this week, Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster chairman, said there could be no assurance its board would be able to recommend a deal. Formal or not, the ending of the engagement has significant implications for both parties. For Viacom, it increases pressures to sell off assets acquired when it took over Paramount. For Blockbuster, it creates question marks over the group's strategy, and makes it a potential takeover target for another media company. The death knell has been sounding for the deal ever since Viacom took over Paramount in March, as victory sharply depressed the price of Viacom stock. Investors feared the company had overpaid for the film and publishing group, and burdened itself with too much debt. That in turn endangered the Blockbuster deal, for Viacom proposes paying for the video retailer in stock: 0.08 of a share of Class A stock and 0.60615 of a share of non-voting class B stock for each Blockbuster share. Blockbuster shareholders would also get limited protection against poor Viacom share-price performance - an award of up to 0.13829 of a share on the first anniversary of the consummation of the merger. However, based on Viacom stock's trading price yesterday, that package would give Blockbuster shareholders only Dollars 21 1/2 a share, Dollars 9 1/2 a share less than the level at which Blockbuster shares were trading before January's announcement. Blockbuster shareholders are hardly likely to accept such a deal. This is reflected in that the company's shares are trading substantially higher than the bid terms, at around Dollars 26 1/2 . The two sides could try to restructure the deal, but there are no signs of Viacom being prepared to do so. Instead, the companies appear to to be discussing a more limited form of co-operation, such as renaming Viacom's Showtime cable television film channel 'The Blockbuster Channel', and possibly using it as an outlet for movies made by Blockbuster's Spelling Entertainment/ Republic Pictures Hollywood film units. For Viacom, the main attraction of the marriage with Blockbuster was always financial. As part of the merger deal, Blockbuster agreed to make a Dollars 1.25bn investment in Viacom stock (on top of the Dollars 600m it had committed earlier in the Paramount bid), giving the company cash to boost its offer at a crucial moment in the takeover battle. The merger also promised to bolster Viacom's balance sheet - weighed down with bid-related debt - with the injection of Blockbuster's strong cashflow from retailing. If the merger does not go through, Viacom will come under increased pressure to sell off peripheral Paramount assets to lower debt. It is already weighing offers for New York's Madison Square Garden arena, though Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman, insists it does not intend to sell any 'strategic' assets. For Blockbuster, the main attraction of the Viacom marriage was to diversify the group away from the video rental market, which is expected to face strong competition from inter-active television over the next decade. If the deal is abandoned, Mr Huizenga may have a tough job convincing Wall Street the company has an equally-compelling strategy for growth. He could also have a hard time convincing shareholders the equity investment already made in Viacom is worthwhile. This is because the stake was bought at Dollars 55 per Viacom B share against a stock market price of Dollars 26 yesterday. Abandonment of the marriage would allow Blockbuster some compensation for this drop, but possibly not enough to cover the investment.</p>

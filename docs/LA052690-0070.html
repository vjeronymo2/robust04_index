			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOING THE EXTRA STEPS;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO, MEXICAN DANCERS TO COLLABORATE SOUTH OF THE BORDER  </P> <P> Despite San Diego's proximity to Tijuana, cross-cultural exchanges with Mexican  artists have been few and far between. But this weekend, some of those  invisible barriers will begin to crumble when Three's Company -- San Diego's  leading modern dance troupe -- joins forces with 15 dancers from the other side  of the border. The one-night stand is scheduled for 7 p.m. Sunday at the  Tijuana Cultural Center.  </P> <P> "We've done five or six performances in Mexico," said Jean Isaacs, the troupe's  bilingual artistic director. "But this is the first time we're actually working  with Mexican dancers."  </P> <P> The impetus for the cross-cultural collaboration was a $4,000 grant from the  city of San Diego.  </P> <P> "I never expected to get it," Isaacs said, "because I'm not an ethnic artist.  But the grant is really doing what it's supposed to do -- encourage  multicultural activity. We have quite a few men and women coming up to our  studio to take class with me as a result of our work there, and Ricardo Peralta  (one of the Mexican dancers involved in the project) has asked permission to  use my work for his company. I never give my pieces away, but, since they don't  have any money, I donated it."  </P> <P> Isaacs credits Miriam Soto, a Mexican part-time student of Three's Company's,  for encouraging her to take the troupe into these uncharted waters.  </P> <P> "Miriam made it happen," recalled Isaacs, who also has an undergraduate degree  in Spanish literature. "She said, 'You speak Spanish, you should teach modern  dance technique in Mexico.' I applied for the grant, and now, Miriam is the  paid coordinator of this project."  </P> <P> With support from the Mexican government in the form of free facilities, Isaacs  began training the dancers a month ago for the performance.  </P> <P> "The Mexican dancers haven't had much modern dance, but they have good  classical training," Isaacs noted. "And they are very grounded dancers. They  understand the sense of weight this kind of dance requires. We sit and talk,  and some of them tell me, 'Hey, this has really changed my life.' I really wish  we could keep this going. There's so much to do.  </P> <P> "They're getting support and attention from the media in their own community as  a result of this concert. We can't let it end with this performance."  </P> <P> When Isaacs began training dancers in Tijuana, she had low expectations.  However, the teacher was pleasantly surprised by what she found out about her  well-motivated students.  </P> <P> "I found the technical level quite high, and they all look good on stage  because they have an innate dramatic sense that compensates for any (kinetic)  weaknesses," Isaacs said. "Dance is a strong part of their culture, and they  just  </P> <P> understand it."  </P> <P> As a result, instead of a choreographing a watered-down dance for the fledgling  modern dancers, Isaacs taught them the most challenging piece in her repertory  -- adjusting the designs to accommodate the contingency of men among them.  </P> <P> To help ensure the future of Mexican-American cultural relations -- at least in  the field of modern dance -- Isaacs and her dancers have extended their  involvement well beyond the terms of the grant.  </P> <P> "Everyone in our company is working for minimal salaries," she explained, "and  we've given the Mexican students scholarships to study with us in San Diego. We  had to, because they couldn't afford the lessons otherwise."  </P> <P> Isaacs is eager to take Three's Company back to Mexico again, but the dance  maker is even more excited about the new talent she discovered south of the  border.  </P> <P> "We have to find some way for Ricardo (Peralta) to show his work here," she  vowed. "I'd like to do it, if we can fund it. It's too late for this year's  low-tech (Three's Company's summer dance series in the studio), but maybe next  year.  </P> <P> "There's a real need for this," she said, referring to the cross-cultural  training. "We're only 15 minutes away. There shouldn't be a border.  Geographically, and culturally, it's all California.  </P></p>

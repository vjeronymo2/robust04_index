			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Privatisation programme gets under way in France THE French government's ambitious privatisation programme gets under way today with the start of the pre-marketing process for Banque Nationale de Paris. The privatisation of BNP, the first of 21 state-controlled groups that the government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur has targeted for sale, is expected to raise between FFr25bn and FFr30bn (Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 5.3bn). Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the BNP privatisation would be completed by December 20 at the latest, although most analysts believe the timetable will be shorter. The pre-marketing process, in which investors can make non-binding claims for shares, will provide a measure of the demand for the issue. It will be used to determine the price at which the shares will be sold. According to the economy ministry, the government will offer about 40 per cent of the share capital of BNP, or some 72m shares, for open sale. At least half of this amount will be sold through a public offer in France. About 12.5m shares will be sold to French institutions and some 23.5m shares placed abroad, while about 8m shares will be offered on preferential terms to BNP staff. The government also confirmed that a core group of stable investors - including Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group - will hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares after privatisation. Individual French residents and citizens of the EC will have the right to at least 40 shares in BNP. Investors who subscribed to the 'Balladur bond', a government borrowing scheme, will have the right to a further 40 shares if they convert some of their 6 per cent bonds into privatisation equity. BNP chairman Mr Michel Pebereau yesterday repeated his forecast of a FFr1bn net profit for full-year 1993, and said that the first half of next year would be 'tricky', Reuter adds.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Companies' Pergau role is censured The government yesterday censured three of Britain's leading industrial companies for their role in helping to build Malaysia's Pergau dam. But, in a formal response to a recent Commons report on Britain's offer of Pounds 234m to help build the dam, the government played down the part of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, in negotiations over the project. The three main companies involved in the scheme - Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar House and GEC - were criticised for providing the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher with incomplete information over the deal's financing. The government did not question the judgment made earlier this year by the Commons foreign affairs committee that Lord Younger, the former defence secretary, had acted in a 'reprehensible' way by signing a protocol on arms sales that committed the UK to offer civil aid to Malaysia. But the government response rejects the committee's claims that a series of ministerial replies on dam funding - including one from Mrs Thatcher - were 'less open and less informative' than the Commons had a right to expect. Instead the government directs clear criticism at the consortium of companies that advised Mrs Thatcher on how much it would cost them to build the dam before negotiations with the Malaysian government in March 1989. The committee had noted that the consortium led by Balfour Beatty had 'put pressure' on Mrs Thatcher to make a firm offer to fund the Pergau project at a cost of Pounds 316m. Shortly after the deal was struck, the consortium increased the cost to Pounds 397m. This raised the amount of cover required under Britain's aid and trade provision. The government stated yesterday: 'It would have been helpful if the consortium had been forthcoming about the risks of a significant price increase while lobbying . . . for an offer of support from (aid and trade provision).' The government also said that the aid was for a 'valid development project which would produce much needed peak-time power in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way'.</p>

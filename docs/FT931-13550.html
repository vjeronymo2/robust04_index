			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Japanese translate English village JAPANESE businessmen attending a language school 90 miles north-west of Tokyo are to get a touch of Olde England. A reproduction Elizabethan village complete with public house, bowling green and village hall is to be shipped in pieces from Britain and re-assembled in Shirakawa. Boarder Oak Design &amp; Construction, a family-owned Herefordshire company, has a won a Pounds 4.1m contract from the Sano Educational Foundation to construct the village which will house up to 400 students. Ten oak-beamed houses, each a replica of a small Tudor manor house, must be built to withstand earthquakes, hurricanes and up to six feet of snow which blankets the ski resort in winter. Mr John Greene, Border Oak's managing director, said: 'The idea is to encourage students not only to speak English but to feel English.' The public house, which will include bar games such as darts and skittles, is expected to provide traditional English ales and pub food such as pork pies. 'The educational foundation intends to encourage English eccentricity and inventiveness,' Mr Greene said. The development on 60 acres will include two tithe barns which will be used as workshops for traditional crafts, a 350ft-long brick and flint manor house, formal gardens, Roman baths and ornamental lake. About 1,000 commercially grown English oak trees, up to 200 years old, have been felled for the project by Henry Venables of Stafford. The first house should arrive at Shirakawa at the end of March. Border Oak is sending four craftsmen to Japan to assist Obayashi, the large Japanese construction group, with assembly.</p>

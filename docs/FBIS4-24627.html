			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] Reform through labor is still an essential part of  China's prison system. CRI's [China Radio International's] (Li  Ben) has filed a two-part story on the (?real scenario) behind  China's prisons and the life of prisoners in prison farms.  Here's Dong Jun with the first story in our series:    [Begin recording] [Dong Jun] China believes that criminals  can become better people and China always tries to give  prisoners a new life. Our reporter talked with Zhang Xiufu, the  vice minister of justice.    [Zhang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation  read by Dong] Zhang Xiufu said: There are many ways to reform  prisoners. For example, all criminals receive political, moral,  and law education while in jail. China wants the whole society  to work together for this endeavor and the first step is labor  reform. At present, China has more than 1 million convicts in  about 600 prisons scattered all over the nation. These  prisoners are engaged in various forms of labor, such as working  on farms and in factories.    Zhang Xiufu said only through labor can criminals be tamed.  He said one of the main motives for crime is to gain without  working; through labor, a prisoner will cultivate a work habit,  know to cherish his own creation, and form a sense of  discipline. Zhang said: In 1950's, China successfully reformed  Japanese war criminals and the last feudal emperor, Pu Yi. They  all began a new life after working for a while in a farm.    Wang Minbing is an official in charge of prison affairs. He  said: All their work is to prepare prisoners for their future.  The prisoners have many opportunities to attend courses and  learn skills in their work. These skills will be essential when  they look for jobs in the future. Every year, more than 200,000  prisoners obtain a diploma confirmed by educational departments  or vocational skill certificate granted by labor departments.    Wang Minbing explained: [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading  into English translation read by Dong] Wang said the  correctional administrators must be warm-hearted to the convicts  and let them see hope. Their goal is to transform the prisoners  into better men and women. Wang said it is a humanitarian deed  to the prisoners, their families, and society. Wang Minbing  said: Only 6 to 8 percent of those released after serving  sentences commit crime again within two years. Ninety percent  are transformed into law-abiding citizens.    However, the living conditions in some jails are sometimes  not good. Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Xiufu said: This is  because China is still a developing country and the people's  average standard of living is low. In fact, the prisoners' cost  of living is similar to that of ordinary citizens. He believes  the situation in prison will be improved along with the  country's economic growth. [end recording]    That was Dong Jun with the report on China's reform through  labor prison. Our reporter (Li Ben) also visited (?Xiyuan)  Prison in Shanghai to talk to the inmates there. Tomorrow at  the same time, you will hear some prisoners talk about their  lives behind bars.</p>

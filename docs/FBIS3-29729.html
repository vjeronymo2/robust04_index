Branding this as a reckless frenzy of simpletons, NODONG  SINMUN in a commentary today says the recent move of the Kim  Yong-sam traitorous clique is very ill-boding as it is a  criminal step usually taken by warmaniacs on the eve of war.    The news analyst goes on:    This year, too, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has held war  confabs not infrequently allegedly to "cope with an actual war"  and "establish a posture of immediate counteraction", and openly  declared that they would resume "Team Spirit" or stage another  military exercises.    The puppets are also making haste with the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea with the United States,  unusually scaled up their "military budget" and are hell bent on  arms buildup. The fact that the Kim Yong-sam group now has put  on the order of the day the question of mobilizing para-military  forces ten million strong in a war against the North tells that  the war frenzy of "civilian" warmaniacs has reached an extremely  dangerous stage.    Due to such criminal moves of the puppets, the situation of  the Korean peninsula now is in a dangerous phase reminding one  of the time when the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppet clique unleashed the war to invade the North in 1950.    While the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique resorting to  criminal moves to ignite a war in a "civilian" guise is left  intact, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace even a  moment, nor can they evade a bloodletting from another war. Kim  Yong-sam, a traitor to the nation and the enemy of peace and  reunification, must be removed in good time.</p>

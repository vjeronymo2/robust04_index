			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Spain sets Pounds 3.5bn borrowing in place THE Kingdom of Spain is setting up an Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.5bn) borrowing facility, which bankers claim is the largest financing to be put together by any European government this year. NatWest Capital Markets , which is arranging the multi-currency revolving credit facility, said it reflected 'changes to the ways in which European Community governments fund themselves following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. 'Under the terms of the Treaty, the Bank of Spain will, from 1 January 1994, be forbidden to provide credit lines to the Treasury of the Kingdom of Spain. The three-year facility is designed to replace those credit lines.' NatWest Capital Markets has been in discussions with other European sovereign borrowers, including Italy, about structuring similar deals. Last September, the UK Treasury announced a Ecu10bn multi-currency funding programme, aimed at supporting sterling in the foreign exchange market and funding government spending. The financing was seen as 'emergency funding' at a time when sterling was under considerable pressure in the foreign exchange market. By contrast, the Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency support, but as a means of establishing long-term liquidity. 'Banks are screaming out for quality assets and we feel they will support this' said one banker involved in the deal. The Kingdom of Spain has a double A credit rating. The deal will probably be signed in September and is unlikely to be drawn before the year-end. Capital Markets, Page 27</p>

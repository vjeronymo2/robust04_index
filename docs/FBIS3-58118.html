			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Clemente Mastella, Italian Christian </F> Democratic Party deputy and leader of the neocentrist faction,  by "S. B." in Rome; date not given: "`But the Party Is Not  Theirs'" ]    [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you sleep well last  night, Deputy Mastella?    [Mastella] Very well. I really do not see why we too should  not exhibit the serenity always displayed by [Christian  Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] Martinazzoli. Nobody is Dante  Alighieri; nobody, not even Martinazzoli, can decide who is to  be in Paradise, who in Purgatory, and who must be confined to  hell.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But how do you feel, outside the DC?    [Mastella] Outside? Look, let it be clear: We are all in  the same fold until it is formally decreed that one party is  finished and another has begun. Today is a day like any other  day. I am here with many friends from the Campania region. We  are talking politics and asking questions. [Mastella ends]    Clemente Mastella counterattacks: Martinazzoli cannot chase  anybody away, the "DC still belongs to everybody." He and  Pierferdinando Casini, the "centrist" leaders, have been a bit  too busy and the secretary has had enough. They have been  behaving like a party, they have had political meetings with the  League....    [LA REPUBBLICA] What happened?    [Mastella] The more I think about it, the more I try to  understand, the less sense this outburst by the staid  Martinazzoli makes. At exactly the moment doves of peace were  flying between us and him and between him and us... Russo  Jervolino and Mancino, Buttiglione, Formigoni.... When I think  that two years ago, when Mino announced that he wanted to retire  at 60, that he wanted to go home and abandon politics, I signed  a document asking him to stay. I was obviously persuasive,  because he did stay. In short, how can he think of building the  new party by starting by throwing out people like us? At any  rate, I would like to ask him a question....    [LA REPUBBLICA] Please do.    [Mastella] Martinazzoli accuses us of having relations with  the League. But he does not realize, or he pretends not to  realize, that people close to him, like Formigoni and  Buttiglione, say it is necessary to form an alliance with  Berlusconi and Bossi. In other words, just look at the pulpit  the sermon of excommunication is coming from! And there is more.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Yes....    [Mastella] Mario Segni is also making overtures to the  League. So the equation is becoming more and more complex. To  be consistent, Martinazzoli should say "no" to Segni as well,  but that is one thing he is steering well clear of. And do you  know why? Because Segni knows full well that his leadership has  a meaning only within the framework of an alliance with the  League; otherwise he will get a majority allowing him to be  premier in about A.D. 2500.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So?    [Mastella] So what we do not accept is that if we say  something, it is heresy, but if Segni says it, it is fine.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You are also suspected of plotting with  Fini...    [Mastella] I have never said anything about forming an  alliance with the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. What I have  said is that "closed-circuit democracy" is over; we should keep  an eye on the MSI's evolution: If it takes place, then...    [LA REPUBBLICA] So what is it that brought the "centrists"  together and keeps them together?    [Mastella] We simply realized that the new electoral  mechanism will bring about a bipolar system, so there is a need  to create two alternative poles. And the People's Party cannot  fail to be part of the moderate pole. It cannot fail to be  "modern," as I call it, as opposed to the PDS [Democratic Party  of the Left] "progressivism." And there is another important  point: If the People's Party does its job, if it rises to its  task and the prestige of its role, Silvio Berlusconi will not  enter the political arena.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Did he tell you that?    [Mastella] I have understood it. Besides, it is  understandable that, if politics plays the absentee, the void  will be filled by something else authorizing other players to  maneuver and to fulfill the functions proper to politics. If we  stay united, this moderate pole can succeed.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But how many of you are there? Have you  counted?    [Mastella] There are very many of us, certainly more than  the four or five poor fools people would like us to be. And our  numbers will increase, in the North, the Center, and the South,  from Campania to Sicily, where we also have electoral weight.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is it true that De Mita, whose right-hand  man you were until a few years ago, is going to make a political  comeback?    [Mastella] Let him. De Mita certainly does not need my  authorization.    [LA REPUBBLICA] To sum up, Deputy Mastella, what is there  outside Piazza del Gesu [DC headquarters], the desert?    [Mastella] Listen, I have spent the day answering calls and  letters of esteem and solidarity from grass-roots militants,  from the party rank and file. But also from important leaders,  all of whom say they are shocked and bewildered. It is a pity  they do not say so, they do not make public statements to  proclaim out loud what they tell me over the phone. I repeat:  Nobody is outside, for the moment we are all in the same fold.</p>

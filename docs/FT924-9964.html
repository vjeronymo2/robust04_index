			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Top Dutch merchant banks plan to merge THE TOP two Dutch merchant banks, Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson and Bank Mees &amp; Hope, said yesterday that they planned to merge, slightly more than two years after their former parent banks combined to create ABN Amro, the biggest bank in the Netherlands. The merger of ABN Amro's two merchant bank subsidiaries will produce a bank with a balance sheet total of Fl 35bn (Dollars 20bn), a strong position in several market segments in the Netherlands, and a network of smaller offices in 17 countries. The new bank, to be called Mees Pierson, aims to consolidate its position at home and then to expand to become a 'European merchant bank' which will be able to compete with Anglo-Saxon merchant banks such as Goldman Sachs, according to Mr Han Kleiterp, chairman of Pierson. 'The new bank will operate entirely independent of the parent bank,' he added. Pierson's former parent, Amro Bank, and Mees' parent, ABN Bank, merged in 1990, sparking speculation that one of the two merchant banks would eventually be sold off or that the two would be combined. However, ABN Amro repeatedly insisted that the two banks would remain separate, independent entities within the group. The decision to merge the two merchant banks after all was taken to respond to the increased international nature of banking and to enable the new bank to grow faster abroad. The narrowing of margins in areas such as stock market trading also spurred the two merchant banks to explore a merger. Cost savings are expected by creating single information technology systems in such areas as treasury management and securities. Officials said the merger would lead to job losses. The banks have a combined workforce of 3,800.</p>

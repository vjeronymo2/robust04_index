			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Motorists who are driven to think Young and newly-qualified drivers could soon be rewarded with cheaper insurance if they take further lessons. The initiative comes from the Department of Transport and a group of insurers. Extra lessons would cover areas such as driving on motorways, at night and in poor weather, none of which is part of the present licence test. The move is part of several measures to improve accident rates for young drivers - the commonly-quoted statistic is that those between 17 and 21 form only 10 per cent of licence-holders but account for 20 per cent of accidents. Other measures announced already include compulsory re-testing for anyone convicted of a motoring offence within two years of getting their licence and a separate theory element in the driving test. Insurers are also concerned that growing numbers of young people are driving without insurance because they cannot afford the premiums; basic third-party cover for a teenager can cost about Pounds 500 a year. The industry estimates that at least one car in 10 is not insured, and the burden of paying for accidents involving these falls on drivers who do have cover through comprehensive premiums, and on levies to the Motor Insurers Bureau. All drivers would benefit if younger motorists had fewer accidents and cheaper insurance. Full details of the government-led initiative are still being discussed but some insurers have taken steps in the same direction already. One is General Accident, which set up the Vantage scheme for new drivers with the British School of Motoring. Those who succeed in completing a Pounds 95 course are entitled to a discount equivalent to one year's no-claims bonus on comprehensive insurance with GA. As yet, though, such schemes are not widespread enough to encourage significant numbers of young people to take the extra lessons. RAC Insurance Services is lobbying insurers to take a more sympathetic attitude to good younger drivers without insisting on extra training. It suggests that new drivers who make no claims in their first year of driving should be rewarded with a discount bigger than a standard one-year no-claims bonus. Younger drivers are often the focus of complaints about poor driving but many experienced motorists could also benefit from further training. Opinion surveys tend to show that the majority of drivers pride themselves on their above-average skills. But anyone with a basic grasp of statistics (and who has ever ventured on to a motorway) will realise that the survey reveals little other than widespread self-delusion. Advanced courses are not usually about skid-pan sessions or anti-hijack techniques more appropriate to James Bond movies. The main idea is to make drivers safer, more in control of their vehicles, and more observant in ordinary driving conditions. Thus, they are both less likely to cause accidents and can spot tricky situations and erratic drivers from further away, so avoiding being the victims of other people's poor driving. The Institute of Advanced Motorists is the best-known arranger of advanced driving courses and tests. Its members country-wide provide free training leading up to the 90-minute advanced test, which costs Pounds 25. The pass rate for those taking the course is 80 per cent. But only 60 per cent of those confident enough to go straight for the test without the training pass first time. Members convicted of driving offences must tell the institute (in case they do not, the IAM even has a team checking press cuttings for court reports). But Ted Clements, its chief examiner, says: 'While our members certainly try to respect the law, they are not holier than thou and they are not perfect drivers - just safety conscious.' The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has a very similar network of volunteers offering training leading up to a test. And many commercial organisations offer advanced driving courses although, of course, these will be more expensive. The IAM has links with one or two insurers and the RoSPA has a scheme with Cornhill Insurance, but the rewards from taking an advanced test do not necessarily result in cheaper insurance on the spot. The few companies offering direct discounts may be at the more expensive end of the market, and their discounted premiums could still be higher than other insurers' standard levies. It is more likely to be that improved skills help you to avoid accidents and, therefore, have an impact on your no-claims bonus. This is what has happened in the fleet insurance market. Increasingly, companies insist that all those driving their cars complete an advanced course. Experience has shown that accident rates can be cut by more than half, leading to much-reduced premiums. This does not necessarily work as effectively for private drivers, however; a single non-blameworthy incident, such as a car being stolen or a hit-and-run accident, can set their claims record back by several years. To encourage more drivers, new and old, to take steps to improve their driving, incentives need to be clearer and more immediate.

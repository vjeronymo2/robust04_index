The bi-weekly PHNOM PENH POST said Ieng Sary, foreign  minister during the radical faction's 1975-79 period in power  and "brother number two" in the organisation, second only to the  notorious Pol Pot, was ousted along with Son Sen, defence  minister under the Khmer Rouge government.    They appear to have lost their posts in 1992, the newspaper  said.    Ieng Sary had been at the centre of internal party friction  for years, the newspaper said, while Son Sen had lost out after  a debate on whether to take part in the UN peace plan for the  country.    Ieng Sary lost his post as Khmer Rouge "minister of defence"  in May 1992 after unsuccessfully arguing inside the faction that  it should participate in the peace plan to gain international  credibility, according to the paper.    He was overruled by hardliners who saw the peace plan,  especially a provision calling for the disbandment of the Khmer  Rouge army, as a ploy to strengthen the Phnom Penh government.    Son Sen had occupied one of the two Khmer Rouge seats on the  Supreme National Council, the national reconciliation body set  up under the Paris peace accord to embody Cambodian sovereignty  until last April's elections were held.    Citing Khmer Rouge sources, the paper said Son Sen was  expected to maintain some influence inside the Khmer Rouge but  that Ieng Sary, after disputes with leader Pol Pot and other  figures in the faction, had been forced completely outside the  power structure.    The PHNOM PENH POST said Pol Pot, who went underground amid  international condemnation after his government was accused of  killing some one million Cambodian civilians during its time in  power, was still firmly in control of the Phnom Penh [as  received].</p>

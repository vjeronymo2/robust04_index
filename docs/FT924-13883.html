			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Aker profits slip to NKr 369m AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday reported a decline in profits to NKr369m (Dollars 61.5m) from NKr445m for the first eight months. The company was saved from going into the red by a NKr680m profit on the disposal of its stake in Cia Valenciana de Cementos, the Spanish cement producer. However, Aker did fall into an operating loss of NKr93m in the period, from a profit of NKr341m last year, due to a NKr430m loss at Norwegian Contractors, part of the oil and gas technology division. Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's president and chief executive, said that new equity and group transfers totalling NKr400m would be injected into NC before the end of the year. Aker's two main divisions - cement and oil and gas technology - significantly increased sales to lift group operating revenue to NKr11.487bn from NKr8.303bn in the same period last year. The oil and gas technology division increased sales by NKr3.1bn to NKr7.534bn, although it fell into an operating loss of NKr223m from a profit of NKr211m last year, and order reserves rose to NKr15bn from NKr11.5bn in the period. The cement division lifted sales by NKr217m to NKr3.963bn. Operating losses fell by NKr2m to NKr53m.</p>

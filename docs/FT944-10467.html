			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Mercury faces cost cuts as profits fall by Pounds 3m The substantial restructuring programme at Mercury Communications announced yesterday by Cable &amp; Wireless is part of a package of measures designed to prepare the UK telecommunications company for increased market competition in the second half of the 1990s. Although Lord Young of Graffham, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman, declined to elaborate on the scale of the job cuts at Mercury, the unions believe that up to 10 per cent of Mercury's 11,400 jobs could go. City analysts believe that the job reductions needed to reposition the company could be even higher. Yesterday some were pencilling in charges of up to Pounds 50m to cover the cost of reorganisation and suggesting that the result could be annual savings of about Pounds 40m. The need for cost reductions of this scale was highlighted by a Pounds 3m fall in Mercury's first half operating profits to Pounds 96m, revealed in C&amp;W's interim results yesterday - although the group insisted the programme had been under consideration for several months. The profit decline at Mercury, which largely reflects competitive and regulatory factors, was a surprise to analysts and overshadowed the 11 per cent rise in C&amp;W's pre-tax profits. Solid growth in call volumes and a 50 per cent increase in customer lines was not matched by profit improvement, which Lord Young and other senior executives said was mainly because it had been hit harder than expected by regulatory changes. In particular Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said the company estimated that the net effect of regulatory measures - including a double price cut imposed on British Telecommunications by Oftel, the regulatory authority, and substantially higher Access Deficit Charges - will reduce Mercury's profits by Pounds 100m in the full year, compared with between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m in a more normal year. Mr Mike Harris, the former Mercury chief executive who has been moved as part of a senior management reshuffle to head a C&amp;W group development division, said a review under way by Oftel is expected to alter the system of ADCs which rival operators pay to BT. Lord Young emphasised that Mercury was being repositioned to face the growing competition in the UK telecommunications market. As part of this process Mr Duncan Lewis, who was in charge of C&amp;W's US operations and director of the group's business networks, has taken over as Mercury's chief executive. He will announce details of the cost cuts and job reductions at Mercury within the next month. At the same time Mercury's structure is being reorganised into services and networks divisions.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Akira Suetsugu, director general of Social </F> Insurance Agency by KANKAI on 20 December 1993; place is not  given: "Rosy Picture of Future Social Insurance"]    [Text] Primary Goals in the 21st Century    [KANKAI] I believe that, with the coming of the aging  society, the work of both welfare administration and the Social  Insurance Agency [SIA] has entered a difficult phase. First, we  would like to have you discuss the content of the SIA's basic  duties and its posture in grappling with them.    [Suetsugu] The SIA was established in 1962. Its initial  purpose was with the national insurance and national pension  systems in place, to separate planning and implementation as the  nucleus of social insurance -- i.e., the management of health  insurance, seamen's insurance, welfare pension insurance, and  national pension under government supervision -- and to clarify  its responsibility for implementation. Therefore, its goal  regarding its administrative duties is to accurately execute  management of the four systems.    When the SIA was inaugurated, the motto of the then director  general and my predecessors was the three S's (`shinsetsu'  [kindness], `jinsoku' [rapidity], and 'seikaku' [accuracy]), and  I believe that the SIA has endeavored to implement the motto in  its operations.    [KANKAI] I believe that the social circumstances and the  environment today have changed considerably compared to 1962  when the SIA made its debut. What are your primary goals for the  21st century?    [Suetsugu] At the outset, the national pension system in  terms of public pensions had just been established and the  welfare pension was just beginning its payments. I believe that  the SIA's role at the time was miniscule compared to the nation  as a whole. To give several current indicators and in terms of  the welfare pension and the national pension, the insured  persons total about 6.3 million which covers about 90 percent of  the public pension system. In terms of the payment of insurance  premiums, the total premiums for the government-supervised  health insurance, the welfare pension, and the national pension  amount to about 21 trillion yen, which is about one-third of the  national taxes. The number of pensioners totals about 23  million, and it is rising at a rate of one million annually. The  amount of pensions paid out was about 16 trillion yen at the end  of FY91. It is growing rapidly, and I believe that it will  continue to grow.    Therefore, regarding the goal for the immediate future in  terms of our future duties, in view of the coming of a  super-aging society, the value concepts will become diversified  and the people's needs will also become diversified. The  environment for social insurance is changing in various ways,  and I believe that it will continue to change rapidly in the  future.    Consequently, we believe that it will become difficult to  accurately conduct the business managment relegated to us by the  people if we adhere to the timeworn methods of the past, and we  feel that we must search for a basic direction for the business  in the future. We therefore drafted a future concept for the  social insurance business in July last year. It contains  visionary ideas as well as realistic tasks. With a blend of such  ideas, we have been looking for a future direction. We hope to  push forward our management in line with the future concept of  social insurance operations.    [KANKAI] The coming fiscal year is the year of pension  reform  and the coalition parties' proposal has been prepared. However,  I believe there are portions which are better than what the  Ministry of Health and Welfare and the SIA had in mind at the  beginning. What is your evaluation in that regard?    [Suetsugu] Speaking from our standpoint, first of all, we  must establish a stable pension system. It must be a pension  system that can be trusted by the people. At the same time, it  must be seen by the people as a convenient system with complete  services. First, in the sense of stable management, we believe  that the recent revised bill is significant. We of the SIA as  the implementing agency are conducting studies to cooperate with  the Pension Bureau at an early stage to enable the revised  contents to be realized smoothly and simultaneously. We believe  that we must further accelerate our efforts to implement them.    [KANKAI] The Ministry of Health and Welfare's timetable  calls  for a three-year postponement from the initial 1998 to 2001.  Will that have a considerable impact? Or can we understand it to  be a move within a somewhat stable system?    [Suetsugu] This is a systemic theory, and in terms of  operations implementation based on our position of actually  putting a system into action, we believe that there is no  special problem.  <H5>  How To Cope With the Problem of Delinquent Payment of </H5> Insurance Premiums    [KANKAI] Speaking of pensions, numerous families are in  arrears in the payment of premiums for the national pension.  Another problem is the imbalance between systems, and it is said  that they should be unified. What is your thinking regarding  these two points?    [Suetsugu] The national pension system requires voluntary  filing and payment of premiums by the insured. In that sense,  management may not be simple. In the case of each pension  system, such an arrangement probably is not practical unless the  administering agency is well equipped and the people's awareness  is at a high level.    The fact that such management has been possible under such  conditions is, I believe, the result of the high awareness among  the people and the efforts by the administering agencies  including the cities, towns, and villages. However, as long as  it is a public pension, we cannot be complacent about the  present situation, but must aim for 100-percent efficiency.    From such a standpoint, we instituted a meeting to promote  the national pension system in 1992 to review failures to file  for national pensions and delinquent payment of insurance  premiums. In October [1993], we received a report in which  various items of advice and proposals for action were included.    First, to seek further understanding among the people,  particularly among the younger generation. Second, to utilize  the various data and material available in the cities, towns,  and villages. For example, the system of national health  insurance is simultaneously in operation in the cities, towns,  and villages, so their resources should be utilized. There is  also a variety of other resources, so the pertinent material  should be used. Third, to further promote the transfer of  accounts.    Such proposeals are being received. However, we believe that  perhaps the most conclusive is the basic pension number. In  order to fundamentally eradicate failures of filing or  notification, we believe that the important point is to  accurately and efficiently implement exchange of information  among the various systems. Therefore, we would like to speedily  introduce a basic pension-numbering system in the form of a  common lifetime numbering key, and we are going ahead with  preparations.    We feel that this is not only a problem of the national  pension, but will also help to improve services for the overall  public pension system, such as the speedup of judgments  concerning the right to receive pension payments, the response  to pension consultation, an early confirmation of the  qualification of the insured at a specific age, and prior  notification of the time and amount of payment before judgment  is made under the pension system.  <H5>  Realization of the Future Concept of Social Insurance </H5>   [KANKAI] What is your position on a unified pension system?    [Suetsugu] I believe that deliberations will be carried out  in various places and forums on unification. Our task is to be  prepared to respond, no matter what conclusion is reached.    [KANKAI] I see that five management directions are included  in the future concept on social insurance.    [Suetsugu] First, social insurance that grows with the  people. Second, insuring the rights of the people to receive  insurance. Third, a flexible response to changes. Fourth, kind,  speedy, and accurate accommodation. Fifth, the promotion of  insurance and welfare facilities.    [KANKAI] Do frequent payment delinquencies and failures of  notification mean that there are some lack of services and PR  [public relations] to the people?    [Suetsugu] Payment delinquencies occur most frequently in  the  urben areas. It is partly due to the constant shifts in  population. Another factor is the large number of youths. Trends  of population shifts are particular noticeable in the large  cities. To solve this, we have established a national pension  countermeasure office within the SIA and are providing  individualized guidance, beginning with the large cities. Both  we and the executives would like to appeal to the municipal  directors on this point. We are visiting the cities individually  and are meeting the mayors directly to seek their understanding.    As I mentioned before, we are also hoping to cope accurately  with the shifts in civilian population through the use of basic  pension identification numbers and to appeal to them regarding  entry and payment of insurance premiums.    Another problem pertains to students. In other words, there  is a lack of understanding about pensions among the youths. They  think that the pension system is a problem concerning the  distant future, and they lack understanding and awareness  concerning pensions. Therefore, we have proclaimed a pension  week every year for the past two years and are conducting public  relations with particular emphasis on urban and rural youths. In  every prefecture, we are in a stage of targeting the youth and  making efforts in public relations by focusing on various ideas.  We are also working on supplementary textbooks on public  pensions to be taken up in school education.    [KANKAI] What projects are you planning for the super-aging  society?    [Suetsugu] The pension system itself is one of the projects.  At the same time, we are implementing the so-called welfare  facilities project through pensions or medical-care insurance.  One example is the home-care support program which has been  newly implemented since 1992 as part of medical-care insurance.  This is a project that supplements the rental fees for machines  and instruments used by persons recuperating or receiving care  at home, who are beneficiaries of government-supervised health  insurance, apart from the previous medical checkup programs or  workplace healthcare. It has been implemented since October  1993. Our posture has been to team up with the networks of  cities, towns, and villages that actually know best who should  be the beneficiaries, in order to let them know that there are  such ways to help them and to expand its use. We are gratified  that it has been quite widely appreciated by the users.  <H5>  The Future of Public Pensions Without Anxiety </H5>   [KANKAI] The best thing for the people is to have a stable  public pension system that will enable them to spend their life  of retirement without worry. According to what we have heard  from you thus far, is it safe to assume that the pension system  will never go bankrupt?    [Suetsugu] That it correct.    [KANKAI] What about medical-care insurance?    [Suetsugu] Medical care has been switched to midterm fiscal  operations which is a term of about five years. We are gratified  that so far we have been able to operate it on a stable basis.  However, due partly to the business stalemate last year,  although medical-care payments have been generally as expected,  revenues have been lower. However, this is considered as a  midterm fiscal operation, and because there are reserve funds,  we believe we can operate it without problems from the  standpoint of the overall system.    Also, I talked earlier about support for home care within  the  insurance welfare facilities system. In addition, the problem of  mental health was taken up in the past, particularly by the  large companies, and has been studied by the respective  companies. A similar problem existed among the small and medium  companies concerning the beneficiaries of government-supervised  health insurance, and there were points that were indicated and  desires expressed. Therefore, with the hope of grappling with  the target goals of mental health, we have begun to conduct  studies. We hope to find ways to cope and to implement them as  soon as possible.    [KANKAI] If the care system under study by the Ministry of  Health and Welfare is feasible, will the implementing agency be  the SIA, or will it be a completely different arrangement?    [Suetsugu] We have not yet heard that the proposal has been  finalized, so we do not know how it will turn out. Assuming that  it will be us (the SIA), we hope to cope with it fully.    [KANKAI] If it is feasible, would it be the only option?    [Suetsugu] The crux is what arrangement to use. On the basis  of the first-time insured persons, and within the framework of  the national pension and the welfare pension, 90 percent of the  people are covered, while the rest is covered by mutual-aid  insurance. The medical-care field is divided into three  categories of the health insurance associations,  government-supervised health insurance, and national insurance,  aside from mutual-aid insurance. Of the three categories, we are  in charge of government-supervised health insurance and,  depending on which arrangement is adopted, the ratio of coverage  will change. If we are the administering agency, we have the  confidence to implement it. However, I believe that the kind of  arrangement that is adopted will be decided in the future.</p>

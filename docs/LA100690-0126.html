			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-SECRET EAST, WEST GERMAN SPY CAMERAS NOW ON AUCTION  </P> <P> East and West German spy cameras, long among the most closely guarded secrets  of the Cold War, went on the auction block here Friday.  </P> <P> The pride of a collection of rare and unusual photographic equipment was a  fully automatic camera from the workshop of East Germany's Stasi security  police, apparently sold by one of the thousands of employees after the collapse  of communism.  </P> <P> "We don't know the exact origin," Uwe Breker of the Auction Team Koeln auction  house said. "Someone walked in off the street and sold it to one of our  suppliers who has a shop in Alexanderplatz."  </P> <P> In contrast, West Germany's intelligence service was represented at the  auction, however unwittingly, by a James Bond-style miniature camera disguised  as a digital watch.  </P> <P> The bulky 35-millimeter Stasi camera, without any markings except the English  words "German Democratic Republic" on its 50-millimeter and 200-millimeter  lenses, was offered with remote and radio-control devices. It holds enough film  to take 250 photographs.  </P> <P> "It would have been mounted on an observation point near a building such as  West Germany's mission," Breker said. "It could have been triggered by an  infrared device every time a door opened or set to take photographs at regular  intervals."  </P> <P> The camera attracted police attention Thursday. Breker said an officer of the  Federal Criminal Office demanded to know where it had come from and tried to  prevent it from being auctioned.  </P> <P> "We showed him our receipt and told him the auction would go ahead," Breker  said.  </P></p>

For more than twenty-five years, the CHC program has been working toward ensuring the availability and accessibility of essential primary health services to those individuals who have the most limited access to services. The goal of the CHC New Start and Expansion strategy is to extend primary health services to populations currently without such services and to improve the health status of medically underserved individuals by supporting the development and maintenance of systems of care in areas where such systems are lacking or inadequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity.

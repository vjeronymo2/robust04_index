			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Speech of Republic of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev </F> at NATO Council Meeting in Brussels on 4 May 1994"]    [Text] Dear Mr. Deputy General Secretary, dear members of  the NATO Council, dear ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen!    I thank you for the warm welcome you have extended to me and  the Azerbaijan delegation. I am glad that I have the opportunity  to be among you today, and I consider it an important event for  the Republic of Azerbaijan. Thank you very much for the warm  words of welcome and good wishes you have expressed toward the  Republic of Azerbaijan. The people of Azerbaijan, having  traveled a long historic road of development through numerous  difficulties and obstacles, achieved national independence in  1991. An independent state of Azerbaijan was formed, which now  is a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, and many  international organizations. I feel very proud today that the  Azerbaijani delegation is present today in the headquarters of  the North Atlantic alliance.    The Republic of Azerbaijan is following the road of  strengthening its independence. In domestic policy it is  pursuing the development of a democratic, law-based state,  creating the conditions for individual freedom and the  protection of human rights and for a multiparty system and  political pluralism, guided by democratic values developed by  humanity. In the economic sphere the republic is firmly on the  road of implementing economic reforms and establishing a market  economy, free entrepreneurship, and freedom of initiative. We  believe that all this creates good preconditions for  Azerbaijan's close integration in the world community.    In foreign policy the Republic of Azerbaijan acts on the  premise of interconnection and interdependence in the world,  conducts a peaceful policy, and strives to maintain good  relations with all countries on the basis of the principles of  respect for sovereignty and noninterference in each other's  internal affairs, territorial integrity, and inviolability of  borders.    The Republic of Azerbaijan is currently experiencing a  serious economic crisis. It was caused, on one hand, by the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was part  for 70 years, and the disruption of close integrated ties with  all other republics of the Soviet Union, a transition from one  economic system to another. On the other hand, this economic  crisis is being deepened and exacerbated by the fact that  Azerbaijan is in a state of war with the neighboring Republic of  Armenia and is a target of military aggression. We believe,  however, that all these difficulties can be overcome, keeping in  mind that Azerbaijan has firmly taken the road of independent  development. Azerbaijan's state independence is an irreversible  factor, and we are convinced that the way we are going about  state organizational development, economic transformation, and  implementation of economic reforms will allow us to overcome  these difficulties and make Azerbaijan, with its abundant  resources and rich economic and intellectual potential, a part  of the world economy and the world community.    As I have already mentioned, the difficulty of Azerbaijan's  situation stems to a considerable extent from the fact that for  six years already the republic has been the target of military  aggression on the part of neighboring Armenia. This aggression,  unleashed by nationalist circles in Armenia, has brought  uncountable misfortunes to both the Azerbaijani and Armenian  people, and represents a very difficult problem for us today.    You know very well that as a result of military aggression  on  the part of Armenia, which is pursuing the goal of annexing part  of Azerbaijan's territory, of making Nagorno-Karabakh a part of  Armenia, Armenian armed formations have occupied a considerable  part of Azerbaijani territory. The six-year war has already  resulted in the death of more than 20,000 people; about 4,000  persons have been taken prisoner of war or hostage; thousands  upon thousands of homes, hospitals, schools, social facilities,  and industrial and agricultural enterprises on the territory of  Azerbaijan have been destroyed. The estimated damage is in the  billions of dollars.    The worst part, however, is that almost 20 percent of  Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian armed formations, and  the inhabitants of these regions--which is more than 1 million  people--have lost their place of habitation, are in a most  difficult socioeconomic situation, and are refugees in their own  country. All persons of Azeri origin have been driven from the  territory of Nagorno-Karabakh; as I said, Nagorno-Karabakh and  seven regions of Azerbaijan adjacent to it are occupied by  Armenian armed formations.    We have always taken, and continue to support, the position  that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. We strive to  actively use the facilities of international organizations: the  United Nations, the CSCE and its Minsk Group. In 1993 the UN  Security Council passed four resolutions that categorically  demand the withdrawal of Armenian occupation troops from the  territory of Azerbaijan, but none of these resolutions have been  carried out by Armenia. The efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group also  so far have not led to positive results. Military operations  continue today; Armenian armed formations, having occupied, as I  already said, a considerable part of Azerbaijani territory, are  conducting an offensive on the Republic of Azerbaijan's defense  positions. Blood is being spilled every day; people are dying.    This can no longer be tolerated. Therefore today I want to  make use of my presence here, in the NATO headquarters, and  state once again Azerbaijan's position. We are for a peaceful  resolution of this issue, for an immediate cease-fire and  suspension of all military operations, for negotiations that  must result in the immediate withdrawal of occupation troops  from the territory of Azerbaijan and at the same time ensure its  territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. On these  terms we are willing to consider the issue of the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh's autonomy.    Speaking on 12 April on Azerbaijani television and radio, I  appealed to the Armenian people, Nagorno-Karabakh residents of  Armenian origin--citizens of Azerbaijan--to stop this bloodshed.  Fate has decided that the Azerbaijani and Armenian people will  live next to one another, and they have lived next to one  another for centuries. We believe that trying to resolve this  problem by military means will lead us to a dead end; this war  is hopeless, and we need to end the bloodshed as soon as  possible and establish peace in our region.    Today we again express our confidence that international  organizations, first and foremost the CSCE and the CSCE Minsk  Group, will take additional steps to implement our peace  initiatives. Today, in this NATO headquarters, I would like to  express my deep respect for the North Atlantic alliance, which  over the period of its existence has made a tremendous  contribution to establishing stability in Europe and the entire  world, to strengthening peace and cooperation. We have great  respect for NATO and attach great importance to its activities  at the current stage. The creation of the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council has become an important phase in NATO  activities, which makes it possible to bring other states into  the NATO orbit.    We have welcomed NATO's decision, announcing on 10 January  of  this year the adoption of the document Partnership for Peace,  and consider it, too, an important step in NATO's activities in  furthering the development of cooperation between countries. We  attach great importance to the fact that NATO's 10 January  decision expressed particular concern regarding the situation in  our region, in the South Caucasus, and a conviction that the  conflict in our region, particularly in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Georgia, must be brought to an end.    All this is very desirable and interesting for us. Based on  this, we welcome with great satisfaction the invitation extended  by NATO to countries of East Europe and the new independent  states, formerly parts of the Soviet Union, to sign the  Partnership for Peace document. We have made a decision to sign  it, and we pin great hopes on cooperation with NATO. For us it  is also very important from the standpoint of Azerbaijan joining  Western democracy and also because it will give us the ability,  in cooperation with NATO, to look for additional ways to  stabilize the situation in the region, stop the war, and  establish peace and good-neighbor relations between Azerbaijan  and Armenia.    These are the thoughts and hopes we brought here to you, and  we are ready today to sign the Partnership for Peace program. I  want to once again express a hope that this step on the part of  the Republic of Azerbaijan will be properly appreciated by NATO,  will bring mutual benefits, and most importantly, will  contribute to stabilization of the situation in our region. I  wish your organization further success. I thank you for your  attention and am ready to sign the framework Partnership for  Peace document.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: SCA signals steep price rises for newsprint SCA, one of Europe's largest paper companies, yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in continental European newsprint prices, and a 15 per cent rise in the UK market. The changes will take effect from the end of this year. The company signalled the price rise as it embarks upon annual contract negotiations with big newspaper proprietors over supplies. It said it was determined to force through increases in the face of some resistance from the large buyers. 'We've cut the prices by so much over the past couple of years - these companies must realise we've got to raise prices as demand goes up,' said Mr Ulf Frolander, SCA's graphic paper managing director. He said intense competition had led to price discounts of DM40 (Dollars 26.60) a tonne since the end of 1992; the latest increase will recover about DM20 a tonne. However, big British newspaper publishers, which buy 75 per cent of UK supplies, are likely to use their market clout to resist large price rises. 'It is unlikely the big publishers will pay those rises this year - they are not expecting a hike of more than 7 per cent,' said Mr Tim Rothwell, paper and packaging analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London stockbrokers. Newsprint producers are trying to recover rising costs after the doubling of prices for virgin pulp this year. Waste paper costs have tripled. At the same time, demand has finally caught up with the availability of newsprint after many years of over-supply. SCA says it has seen a 6 per cent increase in European newsprint demand this year. Mr Rothwell points to a rise in UK consumption of 14 per cent in the first half of the year. Nordic companies Norske Skog and Stora earlier announced newsprint price rises of 15 to 20 per cent and other large producers are expected to follow suit.</p>

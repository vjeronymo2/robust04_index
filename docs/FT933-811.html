			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Asia's dragon sector at last gets off the ground THE DRAGON bond market, Asia's regional capital market, has finally got off the ground, two years after it was set up by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in an effort to develop the capital markets in this part of the world. In the last week, Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), Austria's import-export agency, and Rabobank Nederland, the triple-A rated Dutch bank, both raised Dollars 200m each through offerings of five-year and three-year dragon bonds respectively. Most of the dragon bond issues launched so far have been short-dated, reflecting the early stage of the market's development as well as the short-term horizons of many Asian investors. Including these two issues, the outstanding amount in the dragon bond market now stands at around Dollars 3bn. If the flow of issues continues at the current pace, volume could more than treble to Dollars 10bn by the end of 1994, according to Lehman Brothers, one of the several investment banks which are actively promoting the dragon bond concept. So far, the dragon bond market has been tapped by issuers which already have a wide following in Europe, the US and Japan and which are seeking to widen their investor base in the rapidly-growing economies in the rest of Asia. They also see this market as a useful way to increase their profile with non-Japanese investors in Asia, thereby facilitating their commercial activities in the region. As a result, the jury is still out on whether the dragon bond market will ever be anything more than a useful but illiquid adjunct to the established Eurobond market, where issuance has reached Dollars 295bn so far this year. Bankers who believe the dragon bond market is merely a parody of the Eurobond market give several reasons for taking this view, the most important being the virtual non-existence in Asia of a secondary market in dragon bonds. This effectively means that a large proportion of the bonds flow back to Europe, where there is a secondary market. In addition, dragon bonds are cleared through Euroclear and Cedel, both of which are based in Europe, although there are moves to develop a regional clearing system in Asia. The bankers also point to the exclusive nature of the dragon bond market. So far, all the issuers have been of a high quality and no local borrowers, apart from the ADB, have made an appearance. This perception of the market could be dispelled if rumours of a dragon bond issue from the People's Republic of China come true. An offering by the dominant nation in the region would open the floodgates for other Asian sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers. Another contentious issue has been the pricing of dragon bonds. Some of the issues launched earlier in the summer were widely thought to have been too tightly priced and as a result were seen to have performed poorly. Bankers say this gave Asian investors the impression that borrowers saw the market as a source of cheap funding. 'Why should Asian investors pay a premium for something that is illiquid?' asked one senior investment banker. However, the pricing of recent dragon bond issues has been more in line with levels which the borrowers have to pay in the Eurobond market. 'In our opinion, issuers pay the same price there as in Europe,' said Mr Andrew Pisker, head of fixed-income new issues at Lehman Brothers International. Those who believe in the importance of a fully-fledged capital market in Asia are eager to make the dragon bond market a success. For example, OKB delayed its issue by two months until it was confident that the underwriting banks would make a market in the bonds in Asia and not just in London or Tokyo. 'When we did our roadshow in the region, the major concern which investors had was the lack of liquidity in the secondary market,' said a senior official at OKB. Bankers have no doubt that Asia's capital markets will grow in the coming years, in tandem with China's transformation into a major economic force in the region and in the world. Nevertheless, many feel that expectations placed on the dragon bond market are far too high. 'It's a bit like expecting a little airplane to carry hoards of elephants,' said one banker. Last week also saw progress in the development of Hong Kong's domestic bond market when the ADB raised HKDollars 1bn through an offering of eight-year bonds, the largest issue to date in this market. However, the development of this market is hampered by the tax situation in Hong Kong which effectively limits the market to tax-exempt issuers, such as supranational agencies. Pricing is also haphazard, due to the lack of government bond benchmarks.</p>

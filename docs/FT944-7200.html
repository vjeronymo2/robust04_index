			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield returns to black Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, said yesterday increased sales, higher prices and cost-cutting had underpinned a strong swing into the black at the nine-month stage. The group, 49.9 per cent-owned by British Steel, had profits of SKr858m (Dollars 116.2m) compared with a SKr77m loss in the same 1993 period, after a strong third quarter when profits surged to SKr427m from a SKr56m deficit. Avesta forecast a further improvement in the final three months. It said volume and productivity gains achieved in the first half would allow higher prices to translate into stronger results in the quarter. Mr Per Molin, president, said: 'The strength of European and world demand has been maintained through the summer period and appears to be firm into 1995. Prices and margins continue to improve.' The group saw nine-month sales rise to SKr12.3bn from SKr10.7bn. Third-quarter sales were up 13 per cent at SKr3.97bn, in spite of the seasonal holiday slowdown. Avesta said the recovery in the European stainless market had continued. It noted that European producers had increased deliveries of cold-rolled flat products by 27 per cent in the third quarter, while prices were 24 per cent higher than in the first three months. In the US and Asian markets, demand was also strong.</p>

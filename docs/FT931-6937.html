			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Finance sector lifts Lend Lease 1.6% LEND LEASE, the Australian life insurance and property group, yesterday announced a 1.6 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 111m (USDollars 79m) for the six months to the end of December. The result included a sharply higher contribution from financial services activities, offsetting a further decline in property earnings, which fell from 32 per cent of net profit to 27 per cent. Mr Stuart Hornery, chairman, said the group expected to exceed last year's full-year net profit of ADollars 195.3m. The interim dividend was raised from 32 cents to 33 cents, fully franked. The group said retail financial services contributed ADollars 75m to net profit, compared with ADollars 56m in the previous comparable six months. The result included a dividend of ADollars 13m from Australian Eagle Life, which was acquired last year. Lend Lease said the downward trend in profits from property development, construction and management was believed to have stabilised. The property services division earned ADollars 43m before tax, compared with ADollars 51m. The group said it expected strong growth in the contribution from management of corporate superannuation funds. Premium income from corporate superannuation rose to ADollars 751mn from ADollars 340m during the period.</p>

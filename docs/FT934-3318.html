			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: NFC travels hopefully NFC's first rights issue brings it further into line with convention. The company's policy of giving a best view of profits for the coming year has already been abandoned, for fear of litigation if the forecast was missed. It is a fair bet that the tradition of employee share ownership will now take a knock. The employee shareholding could fall to 11 per cent as a result of the rights issue, only a shade above the level at which employees lose special voting rights. Still, BZW's offer to buy small shareholders' rights should minimise the embarrassment of asking employees for cash in such difficult times. With shareholders' funds of only Pounds 300m supporting sales of almost Pounds 2bn, NFC has long looked in need of additional equity. Gearing of 53 per cent before the issue does not look especially high, but that excludes a growing portfolio of operating leases. Goodwill write-offs arising from acquisitions would have quickly eaten into such a modest equity base. With capital expenditure rising and restructuring costs starting to bite, cash flow was also inadequate to make inroads into debt. Whether NFC will earn a decent return on new investment is less certain. A Pounds 10m loss in parcels last year, following a fundamental reorganisation, is a blot on the management copy-book. By focusing on logistics NFC is edging away from such commodity businesses. Even in specialist markets, though, margins are likely to remain under pressure. With the rights issue now in the open NFC's shares have room to rise, but only if the management spends wisely.</p>

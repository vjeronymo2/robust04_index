A copy of this form, with specific instructions, is attached to this Public Notice. Please see, ``Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 &amp; 159&hyph;C'' for detailed information on how to correctly complete these Forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Where To Send Regulatory Fee Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All regulatory fee payments must be sent to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Regulatory Fees, P.O. Box 358835, Pittsburgh, PA 15251&hyph;5835. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Method of Payment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory fee payments may be made by check or money order. Payments may also be made by credit card (Visa or Mastercard only). When paying by credit card, please make sure you sign the appropriate block of Form 159. Payments may also be made electronically provided prior approval has been obtained from the Commission. Contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418&hyph;1925 for prior approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its Report and Order the Commission noted that ``NECA has proposed to process regulatory fees on behalf of its pooling exchange carriers and to submit their consolidated fees to our lockbox bank in a single instrument of payment.'' The Commission has no objection to NECA's submission of the fee on behalf of its pooling exchange carriers or others. However, we remind entities subject to the payment of a regulatory fee that the regulatee, not an agent, such as NECA, is responsible for ensuring that the payment is made and that it is subject to penalty for failure to submit the entire fee due in a timely manner. LEC's will be expected to pay their fees based on the number of access lines as determined by NECA. In case of a dispute between a carrier and NECA concerning the carrier's line count as of December 31, 1993, NECA will certify its calculation of the carrier's line count and the basis for its calculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We encourage arrangements to consolidate a number of regulatory fee payments for different entities into a single payment instrument made by a single payee. We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding the published schedule of payment due dates, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different entities by a single payee will be due on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> September 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment, should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994. The second installment payment will then be due  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Multiple fee payments may be made with one payment instrument. Payors who will be making a single payment for a significant number of entities and wish to submit automated data submissions in lieu of a large number of FCC Forms 159&hyph;C (``Advice Continuation Sheets'') should contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418&hyph;1925 at least four weeks prior to the payment due date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Installment Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interexchange carriers are permitted to make installment payments if their total regulatory fee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exceeds $500,000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Local exchange carriers are permitted to make installment payments if their total regulatory fee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exceeds $700,000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Fee payments for other than interexchange or local exchange carriers access lines cannot be counted toward the respective installment threshold. Nor can competitive access providers, providers of international bearer circuits and licensees of any public fixed or mobile service pay their fees by installment. Eligible carriers choosing to make installment payments must pay one-half of their total fee by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> August 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The second installment payment is due no later than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> September 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Entities participating in consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and elect, to pay by installment should note the different due dates for their installment payments (see ``Method of Payment'' above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A holding company may combine the fee payments of its operating companies to reach this installment-payment threshold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees. Any omission or payment deficiency can result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation of any authorization. Additionally, the Commission intends to invoke its authority under the Debt Collection Act against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Return of Super 301"] </F>   [Text] In reaction to the U.S. decision to reinstate the  Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act, the government is  intentionally demonstrating a cool head. A senior Foreign  Ministry official said that "it probably is a bargaining chip to  win concessions from Japan." While hard-liners say that Japan  can beat the provision by filing complaints with GATT, the  government is perplexed with the U.S.-led development of the  trade friction issue. Unrest is prevailing in industrial  circles, and Japanese-U.S. relations may become even worse after  this.  <H5>  Government Reactions </H5>   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  believes that "even if the United States opens an investigation  according to the act, this is unlikely to result in unilateral  sanctions." Under the Super 301 provision, the United States  may raise tariffs on Japanese products or limit imports using a  quantitative quota. However, the MITI believes that if these  actions are taken without following GATT procedures, this would  be regarded as a violation of GATT regulations, as well as those  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT  in 1996.    Referring to the fact that the reinstated Super 301  provision  provides 180 days for negotiations before sanctions are imposed,  the MITI official said: "Under the new provision, the  negotiation period is extended by six times. The United States  has adopted a strategy of using economic sanctions as a  bargaining chip."    The MITI is taking a tough stand toward this issue, saying:  "When the United States takes unilateral action, that nation is  most likely to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made products.  In that case, Japan can beat the sanctions by filing a  complaint with GATT."    The U.S. Government, however, is unlikely to actually  trigger  a trade war with Japan. A senior Foreign Ministry official  said: "Even if GATT supports the U.S. sanctions, that would not  reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit. Such actions cannot be a  sovereign remedy for the bilateral trade frictions." He then  demonstrated the ministry's passive attitude toward the issue,  saying: "The Super 301 sanctions and Japan's complaints to GATT  would just produce unnecessary conflict between Japan and the  United States. I just hope that the United States will not pull  the trigger."    Because U.S. negotiators say that "the ball is in Japan's  court" (as noted by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor),  Japan's voluntary market-opening package is becoming the focal  point of the issue. While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has  ordered that the package be formulated within this month, a  senior MITI official demonstrated a pessimistic view of its  effectiveness, saying: "We have already offered almost  everything we have. The package would not look very fresh."    Some hard-liners in the government say: "It is unnecessary  to prepare such a market-opening package. If Japan does so,  this will acknowledge the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is  exclusionary." They, however, have no alternative plans for  rehabilitating Japanese-U.S. relations.  <H5>  Industrial Circles </H5>   Industrial circles are wary of the revival of the Super 301  provision. Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association [JAMA], stated that "we are deeply  concerned about the revival of this sanction-oriented  provision." But, the JAMA intends to carefully watch  developments in this issue for the time being, pointing out that  "the type of sanctions and other details are still unknown."    Auto industry circles have long been dealing with U.S.  demands for expanded imports of auto parts. The Toyota Motor  Corp. has prepared a plan for the voluntary expansion of  purchases of U.S.-made auto parts. Therefore, major automakers  are beginning to question the trade policy of the U.S.  Government, noting: "Unilateral sanctions go against GATT  principles. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is a  macroeconomic issue, not a microeconomic issue (related to such  individual trade sectors as automobiles)."    Because it is questionable if the United States really wants  to impose sanctions on Japan, some quarters demonstrated calm  attitudes. A management official of a major automaker said:  "If the United States limits auto imports from Japan, that  would harm U.S. consumers. It is questionable whether they  really intend to do so." The Electronic Industries Association  of Japan [EIAJ] is also exhibiting a prudent attitude toward the  U.S. decision. EIAJ Managing Director Iwao Oshima said:  "Sanctions under the Super 301 provision may be regarded as  violations of GATT regulations. We want to watch future  developments."    On the other hand, a trading house official said, "Super 301  will be an effective weapon because it can apply strong  pressures on trade barriers even without actual sanctions." NEC  Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto said, "Japan should reduce its  trade surplus through such macroeconomic policies as domestic  market expansion and trade surplus recycling."    Moreover, Takeshi Kondo, director of the Politics-Economics  Research Institute under the Itochu Corp., noted: "The trade  friction is caused by Japan's failure to deal appropriately with  the issue. While the Japanese Government promised increased  public investment and tax cuts, it gave no estimate of how these  policies can contribute to reducing the trade surplus."</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Invasion of privacy to be criminal offence The government has decided to push ahead with new criminal offences covering electronic eavesdropping and the use of long-range photography on private property. The offences, which will apply to everyone and not only the media, will be a key part of a white paper on privacy expected to be published later this month. The offences, first suggested by the Calcutt committee on the press and privacy, have been tacitly accepted by large sections of the press providing they are not specifically aimed at the media and there will be a possible defence of public interest. The government seems to be increasingly wary of creating a right for citizens to sue for breaches of privacy. Apart from problems of definition, ministers such as Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, are understood to be concerned that without legal aid - and the pressures on the legal aid system are already considerable - only the rich would be able to protect their privacy. The possibility of a civil tort of privacy will, it is believed, be retained in the white paper as will the suggestion that there could be a statutory ombudsman as a 'court of appeal' over the Press Complaints Commission, the industry's self-regulating body. The two proposed measures in the white paper are seen largely as a stick to encourage the press to continue strengthening self-regulation. There is little enthusiasm in the government for a statutory ombudsman, and Lord McGregor, chairman of the commission, as well as other commission members, have said they will resign if an ombudsman is imposed. In November, after unauthorised pictures of the Princess of Wales were printed in the Sunday and Daily Mirror, Mr Brooke warned, that the press had to demonstrate that it could respect and abide by its own rules. The appointment of Professor Robert Pinker, a PCC member, as privacy commissioner to head investigations into unnecessary invasions of privacy was seen as a step in the right direction. It may decide to make the privacy commissioner more independent of the complaints commission in return for dropping the proposals of a civil tort and a statutory ombudsman.</p>

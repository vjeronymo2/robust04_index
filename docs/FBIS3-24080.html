			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V.P.: "`Center' Holds Strong Promise"] </F>   [Text] Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg Vyacheslav  Shcherbakov and the city soviet's former deputy vice chairman,  Boris Moiseyev, have been nominated by The City We Love  coalition.    Moiseyev is convinced that, having received new mandates,  candidates of The City We Love coalition will not let the  administration rest in peace and will actively defend the  interests of city residents. At the same time, emphasized Boris  Aleksandrovich, we are not talking about confrontation with the  executive branch: The previous legislative body had normal  working relations with the mayoralty's committees, and this  cooperation should be continued.    Commenting on Sobchak's decision, which bars him as deputy  mayor from running for the Assembly, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov said  that he will leave his job if he becomes a deputy.    Yuriy Boldyrev has already endorsed The City We Love  coalition. Also announced at the press conference was a  statement signed by Oleg Bogomolov, Stanislav Govorukhin, and  Sergey Bogomolov, who also support the bloc's program planks.    Members of the Our City Is Our Home coalition also call  themselves centrists.    In addition to the Liberal Club, the founders of this bloc  include the For Justice movement, the Socialist Workers Party,  and the Civic Democratic Movement. Among other organizations  that have joined this bloc are two charity foundations, the  Association of Families With Many Children, the Center for  Medical-Economic Research, the Jurists for Ecology legal center,  the computer programmers trade union, and other organizations.  In the opinion of the coalition's organizers, reforms cannot be  conducted by "fire and sword," without taking into account the  vital interests of the majority of citizens--otherwise the  result will be a vote for Zhirinovskiy's party.    In the event they are elected to the City Assembly, bloc  candidates, in particular, intend to concentrate on issues of  bringing the city and the oblast closer together. In the opinion  of Sergey Andreyev, leader of the For Justice movement, for  Petersburg residents the result will be lower prices for  agricultural products and expanded selection of them.</p>

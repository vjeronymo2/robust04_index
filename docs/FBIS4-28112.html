			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The government's Tax  Commission on Tuesday [7 Jun] opened a series of public hearings  on proposed tax reforms in Osaka and five other cities  nationwide.    Similar hearings will be held in Tokyo and four other cities  Friday, commission officials said.    The hearings are expected to focus on income tax cuts and a  raise in the general consumption tax from the present 3 percent.    Tuesday's hearings are being held in Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo,  Sendai, Fukuoka and Kumamoto.    A total of 44 persons, including company executives,  housewives and welfare workers, have been selected to express  their views at the hearings.    The commission will take into account views expressed at the  hearings when working out tax reform recommendations to be  announced later this month, the officials said.</p>

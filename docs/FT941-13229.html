			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Karachi equities wobble after doubling in value - The Pakistani equity debate Pakistani equities hit trouble a little later than their counterparts further east this year, but they finally succumbed with large-scale losses in the three days ending on Monday, when the KSE index dropped by some 248 points, or 10 per cent, to 2,202.21. Brokers and market analysts termed this a 'technical correction', predicting that the KSE's three-month rally would regain its momentum, although on 'Black Sunday', January 23, the index lost a record 129 points, roughly 5.5 per cent, on the day. Their confidence seemed borne out yesterday when the index recovered 77.52 to 2,279.57 as domestic institutional, and later general support, outweighed the caution of foreign funds. By the middle of last week a combination of factors, including political stability in the country, continued interest from foreign buyers and growing profitability in some sectors, had helped the market more than double in value since April last year. The rate of climb accelerated spectacularly following the October election of Ms Benazir Bhutto as prime minister. The index, 1,369.61 before the October 6 polls, took off after the election results were announced, in anticipation of the return of political stability following a year of turmoil. The subsequent election, in November, of Mr Farooq Leghari as president strengthened the government's hand further, as Mr Leghari had served as a loyal lieutenant of Ms Bhutto before coming to office. Aside from political factors, continued foreign interest has attracted new investors. A recently launched Dollars 60m Pakistan fund from Morgan Stanley has been oversubscribed, attracting subscriptions worth Dollars 187m. The Karachi equity market seemed tailormade to accommodate the explosion of US and other international investment interest in emerging markets last year, particularly in the final quarter, as speculators looking for quick profits vied with fund managers concerned, in some cases belatedly, to show a good spread of foreign equities in their portfolios. 'Pakistan is a very open market for investors as opposed to other countries. Here, there are no restrictions,' says Mr Farrukh Khan, a broker at BMA Capital Management. Foreign investors have complete freedom to invest in stocks, and fully to repatriate capital as well as profits. There are, moreover, no taxes on capital gains. Foreign investors held stocks worth approximately Dollars 700m before the latest falls, some brokers said in their estimates. Mr Aslam Motiwala, another broker, expects continued buying interest in the year ahead. Pharmaceuticals, banking and other financial stocks, chemicals and the energy sector are expected to be among the strongest performers, he adds. Areas of concern include textile shares, widely expected to be among the largest losers this year due to the severe shortfall in the Pakistani cotton crop, and the consequent rise in prices of raw material. Almost one-third of the 652 companies listed on the KSE represent textiles, and their profitability affects the market's trend. The APTMA (All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association), the largest association representing the industry, claims that at least 1.2m spindles out of a total of 6.5m have shut down during the past year due to continuing losses, while at least half a million more are at the risk of closure. Partly due to the cotton crisis, the government has been forced to lower its annual economic growth rate target from 7.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Although other crucial macroeconomic performance estimates such as the balance of trade and foreign exchange reserves have improved, the lowering of growth targets has created some worries over this year's economic performance, and its effects on business opportunities for companies registered on the market. Accordingly, opinion on the market's prospects cuts both ways. Many analysts, concerned with the break in the uptrend, alsoworry that fresh signs of political uncertainty could reverse the KSE rally. Since 1988, three governments have been forced to leave office without completing their terms. Although Ms Bhutto's government appears to be stable, some analysts fear the prospect of fresh political infighting, which could eventually leave her in a similar position.</p>

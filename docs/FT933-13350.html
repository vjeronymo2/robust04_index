			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Cellnet to cut call charges within M25 area CELLNET, the mobile phone operator, is to cut its tariffs within the M25 area to match growing price competition from rivals. Vodafone, the largest operator, last month announced a 25 per cent price reduction for peak-rate calls within the M25 area, reducing its charge per minute to customers from about 33p to 25p. Cellnet is likely to make a similar reduction soon. The moves come ahead of the launch later this summer of the Mercury One-2-One mobile service within the M25 area, which is expected to offer a peak-rate tariff of less than 20p a minute. Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet managing director, said his company's research showed that 70 per cent of users located within the M25 made the majority of their calls to other destinations in the area. Mr Taylor said: 'We are therefore developing a service that offers lower charges within the M25, while giving customers the freedom to use their cellphones throughout the UK' - a reference to the restricted coverage of Mercury One-2-One. He also announced the launch of a regional and national digital service early next year to compete with a similar service Vodafone is starting this autumn. Although Vodafone has a larger overall market share, Cellnet has made significant strides this year with its low-user 'Lifetime' tariff, and is anxious to keep its edge in the forthcoming battle for low-tariff customers using regional networks. Cellnet says it has 140,583 customers for its low-user service, which charges a Pounds 15 monthly subscription and 50p a minute peak rate, compared with 108,558 customers for Vodafone's equivalent service. Cellnet is considering incentives for frequent callers, which may include discounts on existing and new services.</p>

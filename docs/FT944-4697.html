			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi to launch Zenith giant in the US Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, is to launch its Zenith media-buying business in the US from next month, it was announced yesterday. Zenith Media US, with billings of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.20bn), will be the largest media buyer in the US. It will initially draw its business from Saatchi's three US advertising networks, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, Bates USA and Campbell Mithun Esty. Zenith is well established in Europe and is the top-ranking media-buying business in the UK, where about half its business comes from outside Saatchi-owned agencies. The group hopes to develop similar third-party business in the US. Clients will be offered research and planning on where to place advertisements, and consultancy on new media technology, said Saatchi. Media-buying specialists can also obtain airtime and space in newspapers and magazines at discount rates due to the volume of their purchases. Saatchi's move comes at a time when media buying in the US appears to be consolidating. Last month Interpublic, the US advertising group, announced it was to acquire Western International Media, the country's largest independent media-buying company. Mr Charlie Scott, Saatchi chief executive, said the launch was an important development for the group's US and worldwide clients. 'As the media marketplace becomes more complex our clients will make their media spend work hardest for them by using the skills, information sources and buying leverage of a major player like Zenith,' he said. Saatchi said it was also 'an important step in the development of the world's first global media buying agency'. It would be the only specialist media agency to provide a service to clients in the world's two leading marketing regions of Europe and the US. Zenith is also expected to be launched in China late next year. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the Zenith announcement was not expected to affect Saatchi's profits forecasts in the short term. The move would not involve extra expenditure on premises or personnel, because existing resources would be used. Longer-term success would depend on how much third-party business they could win, he said.</p>

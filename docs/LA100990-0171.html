			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL PLAYOFF NOTES;  </P> <P> PIRATES CRY FOUL ON TICKETS  </P> <P> Reds majority owner Marge Schott got a nice seat Monday at Three Rivers Stadium  -- much nicer than some of the Pirates would have given her.  </P> <P> Several Pirates were upset at the poor seating for their families when the  playoffs opened in Cincinnati. Some Pirates received only one ticket each  between the foul lines and another in the deep recesses of the center field  upper deck.  </P> <P> "What am I supposed to do, let my little girl sit by herself in center field?"  Pirates reliever Ted Power asked.  </P> <P> "She is the cheapest person I've ever met in the game of baseball," catcher  Mike LaValliere said of Schott. " . . . It's the kind of thing where Marge  doesn't care about her own players, and she's definitely not going to care  about the other team's players. When we get back to Pittsburgh, if it was my  choice, I would set Marge up in the upper deck all by herself."  </P> <P> Schott got much better treatment than that. She got a first-row seat right  behind the Reds' dugout and Reds players were given complimentary box seat  tickets, some of them immediately behind home plate.  </P> <P> Schott said the Pirates got poor tickets because the Reds sell so many season  tickets.  </P> <P> "I don't care if we sell 15,000 season tickets, we'll never be like that,"  Pirates President Carl Barger said.  </P> <P> The great debate in Boston concerns the premature -- say the natives -- hook  used by Manager Joe Morgan in the first two games.  </P> <P> Morgan removed Roger Clemens with a 1-0 lead after six on Saturday and Dana  Kiecker tied 1-1 after 5 2/3 on Sunday. The bullpen was charged with eight runs  in Game 1 and three in Game 2.  </P> <P> Neither pitcher exactly complained, although Kiecker said, "I didn't think he  was coming to pull me, to be honest. I thought he was coming out to recommend  this or that. If I had known he was coming to pull me out, I might have tried  to fight a little harder."  </P></p>

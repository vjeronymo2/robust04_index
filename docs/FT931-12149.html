			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Sharp rise in air travel EUROPEAN airlines said yesterday the number of passengers they carried on international routes rose by 12 per cent last year, but the increase largely represented recovery of traffic lost during 1991, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Association of European Airlines said its 23 members carried 110m passengers over the year, 11.7m up on 1991 when traffic was hit by the Gulf war which persuaded many prospective passengers to stay at home. The AEA also forecast gloomy financial results for its members last year.</p>

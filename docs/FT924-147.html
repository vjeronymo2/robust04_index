			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Counteracting a parent's tarnished image - Maggie Urry describes how Westminster Health Care is preparing for its flotation WESTMINSTER Health Care, a leading nursing home operator, had always traded fairly autonomously from its US parent, National Medical Enterprises. So when it was working on a flotation in the autumn, it was shocked to discover that litigation in which NME was embroiled would overwhelm the process. After many transatlantic phone calls and flights, the flotation process was postponed until next spring, when the UK management hopes that NME will have more time to spend on the offer, expected to value WHC at more than Pounds 100m. NME's difficulties - which led to its own share price diving - stemmed from two separate, but related, legal contests. In September 1991, the state of Texas sued NME, alleging that its psychiatric hospitals in the state were admitting patients unnecessarily. By June this year NME had come to a settlement with Texas, without admitting wrongdoing. WHC thought the issue would fade away. Then in July NME sued three insurance companies saying that bills for psychiatric care had not been fully paid by the patients' insurers. Within days, the three companies and another five, had responded with a lawsuit alleging over-charging. This litigation continues. These cases not only distracted NME's management, but also cast a cloud over the WHC flotation. Could investors be asked to put money into a company which, however distantly, was connected with allegations of fraud? Was there the chance that WHC would one day be faced with costly litigation in the UK? In its 1992 accounts NME took a Dollars 218m (Pounds 145m) pre-tax charge to cover the cost of reorganising its psychiatric division and a Dollars 24m after-tax charge for the Texas settlement and legal costs. Mr Pat Carter, managing director of WHC, argues that the UK end has always been run distinctly from its US parent. It does not operate psychiatric hospitals or treat acute psychiatric patients. To ensure standards of quality are maintained, a drive to gain BS 5750 approval for the homes has started. Mr Carter says that staff bonuses are only paid if both financial and quality targets are met. Ultimately, he says, people will not come into the group's homes unless they are convinced of the quality of care. A bad reputation would quickly spread since the homes are generally sited within communities. Staff live locally, relatives visit, and each home has a resident's council where complaints can be aired without fear of reprisals from staff. Spot checks are also made. But for the shadow cast by NME's problems, WHC would have had been able to tell a story any public relations executive would be proud to peddle. It would have started with Mr Carter arriving early one day for an appointment with a lawyer, thumbing through a copy of Business Week while he waited, and spotting an article about nursing homes. Mr Carter, who had spent 10 years working for MAI, the financial services and advertising group, instantly realised nursing homes offered a business opportunity. He bought one which confirmed his view, and decided to expand to a chain of homes. While travelling in the US he found himself in Seattle and on the off chance rang a local nursing home operator and arranged to meet for a chat. That conversation led to NME giving financial backing to Mr Carter's plan to build a UK chain. NME owns 90 per cent of WHC's shares, the rest held by Mr Carter and a colleague, but it owns smaller proportions in its other non-US operations. However, the decision to float WHC was not motivated by a need by NME to raise cash. Although its stake will be cut below 50 per cent, the shares sold will be new, with the money going to repay WHC's debt of about Pounds 60m, and to fund further expansion. WHC's business has grown rapidly in the seven years since it was started, and the prospect is of continued rising demand for homes for elderly people who need round-the-clock nursing care. It now owns or operates 36 homes, of which 14 were opened during the financial year to end May 1992. Pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds 66,000 in 1988 to Pounds 1.7m in 1992. However, interest charges in the latest year were high at Pounds 3.6m, showing WHC's need for an equity injection to continue expansion. After the flotation, WHC believes it would have reached a size where it would be able to fund continued expansion largely from internal resources rather than needing further equity. Smaller nursing home operators have needed to call on shareholders repeatedly for capital to grow. WHC's formula of running purpose built homes, mainly offering single rooms with en-suite bathrooms, gives it an edge over some older homes where people often sleep three or more to a room. Standards required of nursing homes are rising, and many older ones are expected to close. Further, as the population ages, and people live longer, demand for nursing homes is increasing. The government's aim is for more elderly people to be looked after at home, a plan enshrined in the National Health Service and Community Care Act which comes into force in April. But, Mr Carter says that the cost of providing constant nursing care in somebody's own home is higher than in a nursing home and 'the higher dependency end of the market will continue to expand'. WHC means to grow with it.</p>

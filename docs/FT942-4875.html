			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Spain joins drive for EU 'great leap forward' Spain will join France and Germany in a co-ordinated drive in the European Union over the next 18 months to ensure that the 1996 conference on institutional reform - the follow-up conference to Maastricht - takes further clear steps towards European integration. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, both passionate believers in the process of European unification, committed themselves at their summit in Schwerin, in east Germany, yesterday to close co-operation in the planning process for the next European 'great leap forward'. Spain will also be involved with France and Germany in carrying through a clear programme of EU priorities during their three consecutive six-month presidencies, beginning with Germany on July 1. That will include European-wide policies to tackle unemployment, measures to support the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe, and a programme of assistance to the countries of northern Africa. In spite of differences of detail on questions such as the German initiative for deregulation in the EU, and the borrowing powers of the European Commission, the German Christian Democrat and the Spanish Socialist leaders both stressed the overriding need to give impetus to the ideal of a united Europe in the wake of post-Maastricht disillusionment. In several hours of tete-a-tete talks, the two also sought to agree on a common slate of candidates for a whole series of top European and international jobs to be decided in the coming weeks, including the future president of the European Commission. 'He should be someone who can get things done, and who can persuade everyone to agree on common action,' Mr Kohl said after a joint press conference in the Schwerin castle, former home of the grand dukes of Mecklenburg. He refused flatly to name any names, although he is widely believed to favour the candidacy of Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, against the rival candidacy of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch prime minister. Mr Gonzalez has previously given public support to Mr Lubbers - before it became clear that Mr Dehaene was an alternative. He also maintains that the future commission president should be a former prime minister, which would rule out the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner in Brussels. There is now speculation in Spanish circles that Mr Gonzalez might switch his position in exchange for support for Mr Enrique Baron, the former president of the European parliament, to become the next secretary-general of the Western European Union. At their press conference, however, the two leaders insisted that there would be no public talk on the jobs list - which includes the secretary-generalships of Nato and the OECD, the European council of ministers, and the head of the future World Trade Organisation - until a deal was done at the EU summit in Corfu. 'We both agreed that we would talk intensively with as many colleagues as possible in order to reach the greatest possible degree of unity on a name,' Mr Kohl said. 'It would not help to discuss it in public.'</p>

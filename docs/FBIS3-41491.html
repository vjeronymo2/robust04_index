Last  Friday in Hamburg, the yearly meeting of the Federal Association  of German Waste Management [BDE] focused on the concentration in  the waste management sector and energy supply firms' commitment  to this market.    There is more of a market for waste than ever before.  Hellmut  Trienekens, president of BDE, estimates that by the year 2005  there will be surge in Germany's market from the current  approximately DM75 billion to nearly DM200 billion. This  includes building rubble, crushed road surface and industrial  waste.    It is large companies that are increasingly engaged in this  lucrative business. In the past, the monopolies commission, the  top watchdog over the market economy and competition, repeatedly  voiced sharp criticism of the process of concentration in the  sector. The monopolies commission's president, Dieter Wolf, did  not even refrain from criticism in Hamburg. According to Wolf,  it is, above all, the activity of the large energy supply firms  in taking over the numerous small and mid-size waste companies  that constitutes a threat to competition. In Wolf's words:  ``More and more I get the impression that monopoly yields on the  protected energy supply markets are henceforth being applied  profitably to other markets.'' Hence, at present, of nearly  1,000 waste management firms, only 10 large ones are getting  half of the turnover in the waste management sector. Nor did  Wolf spare criticism of environmental minister, Klaus Toepfer,  who was in attendance and who previously had eloquently  supported his recycling model. Wolf lamented: ``As early as the  introduction of the packaging ordinance, many of the monopolies  commission's misgivings were not taken into consideration.''  Without the restrictions on competition, it is impossible to  give practical application to the ordinance. Accordingly, the  Dual System Germany [DSD] is a demand monopoly.    Wolf was unable to recognize any kind of advantage compared  to the government waste management monopoly that prevailed  earlier. As a consequence, business is stocking almost  exclusively products with the green dot. That is tantamount to a  restriction on a company's freedom of organization since no  merchant has any other choice should he be unwilling to take  back the packaging himself. Wolf described this situation as  ``strictly prohibited under monopoly law.'' The monopolies  commission president expressed it quite harshly: ``This kind of  system passed on in the guise of civil law tends to exploit the  citizenry.''    For this reason the Federal Monopolies Office wants by all  means to prevent energy supply companies from taking over the  DSD. Solving DSD's financial crisis through waste management  would entail heavy influence of waste managers. Not only their  financial commitment but also the appointment of three DSD board  members from waste management causes the monopolies commission  to be mistrustful.    In any event, the BDE does not want to take over the DSD. At  least that is what BDE president, Trienekens remarked. He is  willing to give back his board mandate immediately, once the DSD  regains its financial standing and waste managers' demands are  satisfied. Frank-Rainer Billigmann, in charge at BDE  headquarters, argued in a similar vein. Waste management's  stabilization of the Dual System has ``helped'' Toepfer's  recycling model ``to survive.'' Whereas he gave the  environmental minister a hearty welcome, he greeted Dieter Wolf  with a frosty: ``We are interested in seeing your report.''  Earlier he indirectly accused the monopolies commission of  overstepping its jurisdiction in criticizing the DSD's personnel  policy.</p>

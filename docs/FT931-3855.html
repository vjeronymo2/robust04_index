			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon bid forces change at Drayton Asia DRAYTON ASIA, the far eastern investment trust, is giving its investors a choice between a unit trust or a new split capital investment trust. The proposals are designed to defeat an all-share bid from EFM Dragon, a rival trust. Those who choose the unit trust, Invesco MIM's South and East Asia Growth Trust, will be able to realise their holdings for cash at about 98 per cent of the diluted net asset value of Drayton Asia. The proposed split capital Asian investment trust will have ordinary shares, zero dividend preference shares and warrants. Investors will be able to choose between a package of the three or a combination of shares and warrants. The trust will be managed by Invesco MIM for a fee of 1 per cent a year. Drayton said that the investment trust proposals offered investors between 101.5 and 102.3 per cent of its diluted net asset value, compared with 98.7 per cent under the Dragon offer. Mr Ratan Engineer, the chairman of Drayton Asia said: 'With these proposals, shareholders and warrantholders will now have greater choice, enhanced flexibility, new opportunities for gearing and most importantly, better and certain value. 'On this basis, I strongly urge shareholders and warrantholders to continue to reject the Dragon share offer.' EFM Dragon responding by saying: 'These proposals are complex, uncertain as to value and the timing of their implementation remains in doubt.'</p>

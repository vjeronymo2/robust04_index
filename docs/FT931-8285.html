			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (16): A general purpose tool-box - Applications Software APPLICATIONS software for personal computers is changing. The increased power, mobility and ease-of-use of modern personal computers has stimulated a new wave of software - in the form of a general-purpose tool-box. This replaces the traditional idea that an application is a set of programs built to suit a specific user. At the same time, personal computer software is now required - and increasingly able - to span different technology environments in terms of hardware and operating systems software. This means the same software can be used on different types of personal computer and even on powerful workstations. Personal computers can also communicate with each other - and with larger systems - to make use of shared resources such as laser printers and centralised corporate databases. Increasingly, a personal computer - whether on a desktop or on someone's lap in an aeroplane - is a personal window into a corporate computer network. This growing role for personal computers has put pressure on software developers to build software which is flexible, adaptable and portable. 'We have to think about the tools we can build which will contribute to what users want - particularly as they are becoming more mobile,' says Mr Paul Bailey, European and international vice-president of leading software developer Lotus Development. 'Mobile computers speak directly about personal productivity. But it goes beyond that. You can dial up and connect to the network and the rest of the company. And through electronic mail and workgroup systems like Lotus Notes, you can work in new ways,' Mr Bailey continues. It is also possible to build applications in new ways. Lotus Notes applications, for example, grow from electronic mail infrastructure and a set of tools which can be used both by the end user and by the systems professional. The end user applies the tools to individual needs and preferences - the professional developer extends the infrastructure to provide more services and features. Application software for personal computers has always differed from that used on larger computers. The low costs of personal computer hardware and the way it is used, meant that traditional ways of building applications could never work. They require lengthy analysis and design, rigorous testing and expensive support. While this is still necessary for large-scale, corporate computing, it is not cost-effective to build applications for personal computing in this way. Applications software for personal computers evolves organically, rather than being cast in concrete like that used in larger computers. Personal computing must take account of the personal and the best way to provide this is to devise good tools which can be used to do many different things. This concept began with the emergence of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. These environments provided a standard framework which could be used to build many different types of application and, more important, new types of tool. 'Many leading products - Lotus 1-2-3, Excel 4, Wordperfect - are now available across Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows on the DOS PC,' says Mr Nigel Turner, product manager at Apple UK. 'This means that users can mix-and-match their software and their computer hardware. They can run the same applications and exchange data between the two machines,' he adds. The increased popularity of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is a principal force in the drive towards standardisation. Not only have GUIs provided a common standard for user access and a better way to exploit the power of personal computers, they have also helped standardisation at increasingly high levels of software. An application program built for the Apple Macintosh can be transported to a Windows environment relatively easily. Although they are different environments, both use a common set of functions to draw screens, control the mouse and access data. These functions can be translated easily from one environment to the other. 'A lot of DOS developers are finding the benefit of Windows - it brings them broader market potential,' says Mr Turner. It also brings advantages to the end user. There is no need to learn a new set of controls for every new program - the instruction to print a document is the same regardless of what type of document it is. But GUIs are the tip of the iceberg. Behind the flashy graphics is a set of standards for exchanging data between programs, access to standard 'drivers' for screens, printers, scanners, and even ways to link data dynamically. This is a powerful mechanism for building new style applications. A spreadsheet table showing monthly sales figures can, for example, be embedded in a word processor document - and updated automatically if there are any changes in the table. An executive information system can extract data from remote databases automatically and display the results as if they had come from the local disk. The disciplines of developing application software based on GUIs has led to rapid standardisation of many aspects of software. And as personal computers evolve into multimedia communications devices, this process is likely to accelerate. 'Quicktime - the systems software which handles multimedia in the Macintosh - will soon be available for Windows PCs too,' says Mr Turner. This means that all types of data - video, audio, text and numbers - will become interchangeable - if not identical in form. A video message recorded on a Macintosh will be playable on a Windows-based personal computer. This new form of computer communications demands different ways to create applications and will stimulate development of new software tools. 'We increasingly view an application as a series of editors - ways to enter, change and access data,' says Mr Bailey of Lotus. 'We need to provide an infrastructure - electronic mail, access to databases  -and the tools to let users get at it and use it the way they want to,' he adds. There is no doubt that a great deal of progress has already been made and it is not too hard to imagine a time, when personal computers will combine a broad set of power tools which can be applied to all aspects of information processing.</p>

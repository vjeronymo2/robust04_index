			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Polish cabinet approves spending cuts in budget POLAND'S government yesterday approved a controversial draft budget which would include large cuts in education, health and welfare spending in an attempt to curtail inflation, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The draft was presented to the cabinet by Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister who this week wrested assurances from the International Monetary Fund in Washington that the deficit of Zl65,500bn (Pounds 2.8bn) written into the document was acceptable as a basis for talks on reactivating a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) extended loan facility. The facility was suspended last year when Poland failed to meet its performance criteria. The IMF also agreed to encourage western governments to help finance some of this year's deficit. Ministers expressed dismay at having their spending plans curtailed but Mr Marcin Gugulski, the government spokesman dismissed the possibility of protest resignations and said 'the entire cabinet would stand by the budget in parliament' when it is debated next month.</p>

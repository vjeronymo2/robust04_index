The municipality's major party and government officials, Wu  Bangguo and Huang Ju, saw Deng off at the railway station.    A source said Deng Xiaoping's special train was heading  northward for Beijing, but he did not rule out the possibility  that the train might go to other cities.    The schedules of all trains arriving and leaving the  Shanghai  station this morning were changed unexpectedly. Passengers were  given the explanation that the change was due to the departure  of a special train from Minhang, Shanghai, carrying a Long March  rocket to the Xichang satellite launching base.    Deng Xiaoping has spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai in  the past few years since 1988. He showed up in public on the  Spring Festival this year, which has caused various speculations  on his health. According to those who were present at the  railway station seeing Deng Xiaoping off, he looked in pretty  good shape [jing shen bu cuo 4737 4377 0008 6934] today. And  Deng Xiaoping's being able to travel by train may be in itself a  reply to people's speculations.    Chen Yun, who also passed the Spring Festival and made a  public appearance in Shanghai as Deng did, is still in Shanghai.</p>

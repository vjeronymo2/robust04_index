			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F> Shlomo Ganor and Yoni Ben-Menahem in the studio on 19 May --  recorded, in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the  Hebrew]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ganor] What about a Syrian  early warning station in the Galilee? Could such a thing be  acceptable to Israel?    [Beilin] Look, I cannot get into detail. Someone has taken  something out of context or made something up. There will be  many such reports. I think that what is important is that U.S.  shuttle diplomacy is working and I very much hope that it will  continue at an accelerated pace. If it does not continue I see  no possibility of reaching an agreement because the Syrians  refuse to hold Oslo or Camp David style talks with us. If  things continue at the present pace, then I believe agreement is  possible and then all these details will be explained in the  course of negotiations.    [Ben-Menahem] But there are five Syrian conditions. What is  Israel's reaction to these conditions?    [Beilin] Look, I do not want to discuss the actual  negotiations. Although everything is very public, it is very  important to keep the details secret because negotiations become  impossible once everything becomes public. The five conditions  published in AL-HAYAH apparently are not really Syria's  conditions, and I would not like to juxtapose Israel's stands  against some newspaper leak -- whether accurate or not -- of the  Syrian position.    [Ben-Menahem] Why hold these shuttle trips? Why not  establish a secret negotiating track as we did in Oslo?    [Beilin] Because the Syrians refuse to do so. That is the  only reason. I think that if one wants to hold serious  negotiations it is very important to keep things secret. Then  you do not have media or psychological pressures on either side.  Nor must one point to a breakthrough in every single round of  talks. To my great regret, the Syrians refuse to make such a  move. If I had to choose between not holding negotiations at  all or having these shuttle missions by U.S. officials in  parallel with the bilateral negotiations in Washington, then I  think we have to accept the continuation of U.S. diplomacy.    [Ganor] You keep stressing the U.S. role, especially that of  the secretary of state in these shuttle missions. What should  Warren Christopher do now in order to put the Syrian-Israeli  negotiations on a more practical track?    [Beilin] This decision is a matter of great importance. Out  of more than 70 international conflicts, this is one with a  better chance for resolution. He should be here more often, he  should travel between Damascus and Jerusalem. If this is done,  I am sure that we shall reach a solution because, in my opinion,  the major problems have already been resolved now that the  Syrians have finally expressed their readiness to talk about  peace with Israel and Israel is finally prepared after quite a  few years to speak of withdrawal with regard to the Golan  Heights.    [Ganor] Do you expect the secretary of state to visit the  region more frequently?    [Beilin] I would very much hope that these visits not always  come at the tail end of other visits. In other words, as some  kind of way to cap other visits to Europe or Turkey. I think it  is important that the Americans consider this a central foreign  policy issue. Something they can start work on and resolve.    [Ben-Menahem] There were reports this week that Christopher  applied some sort of pressure on Syrian President al-Asad. Do  you really think the Americans can pressure Syria in a way that  can accelerate the process?    [Beilin] Look, the question is how you define pressure.  According to the reports and I have received no confirmation of  them -- he simply told the Syrians that if they could not answer  his questions he would wash his hands of the matter. The only  U.S. pressure I can discern here is a lack of involvement in the  process. They did not threaten to stop helping some party or to  harm someone else. I do not particularly believe in this theory  of U.S. pressure. In Oslo, we proved that we could reach a very  interesting and far-reaching agreement without any U.S.  involvement, and I also think there is no need for any U.S.  pressure either on Syria or on Israel. I think that what is  needed is for the United States to devote time to this issue,  because without the Americans there will be no peace with Syria.  [passage omitted]    [Ben-Menahem] Mr. Beilin, you have voiced great  expectations from Christopher's shuttle missions. Do you still  believe that peace with Syria is attainable in 1994?    [Beilin] It all depends on the rate of progress. If things  are accelerated, many rounds of talks will be held, and we will  be able to exchange views with the Syrians. Then I think that  peace will be achievable in 1994. If, on the other hand, the  meetings and visits by U.S. officials come every two months then  we can simply forget about it.    [Ganor] What must first happen in order to realize your more  optimistic assessment?    [Beilin] What I am saying is quite simple and based on my  own personal experience from the talks with the Jordanians and  Palestinians six, seven, and eight years ago. When the  negotiations were not direct but rather conducted through the  Americans we were totally dependent on their tempo. When the  Americans could afford to devote a lot of time to the politics  of the region, things made very rapid progress. If you recall,  there were the 10 points with Jordan in 1986 and other things  that the Americans -- at the time Richard Murphy was especially  involved in the political process -- pushed very quickly.  Whenever they were forced to devote their attention to other  matters, the peace process ground to a halt. I must admit that  there is an unpleasant dependency on the United States. We must  fight for an important place on the U.S. agenda. The more time  Washington devotes to the Middle East, the greater the chances  of peace.    [Ganor] Nevertheless, Mr. Beilin, if Jerusalem declares that  it is prepared to withdraw from the Golan Heights, then progress  can be made, at least from the Syrian point of view.    [Beilin] First of all, I am not sure. I do not know. Do  you believe we will rapidly establish peace if we make such a  declaration tomorrow? I would not bet on it. So far, I have  found some elements of Syria's policy quite baffling. The fact  is that up to this very moment, Syria has not fully detailed its  concept of the nature of peace and whether it includes  diplomatic and economic relations, open borders, and so forth.  I, however, do not believe we shall issue such a declaration.  Our declaration that the depth of withdrawal on the Golan  Heights will correspond to the depth of peace with Syria is the  most far-reaching and comprehensive statement that Israel can  make before launching negotiations. I am not proposing that  Syria and Israel accept the other party's position before the  negotiations start.    [Ganor] But you are not ruling out the possibility that  Jerusalem may declare its readiness to relinquish the Golan  Heights in the course of the negotiations?    [Beilin] I hope this will not be the case. I hope we can  reach an arrangement with Syria while giving up as little as  possible of the Golan Heights. At any rate, whatever agreement  is eventually reached will have to be brought before the people  in a national referendum and the people will decide whether they  are willing to pay the price for peace with Syria, which by  definition will not be an easy one, or actually to pay the price  for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East because currently  the Syrians are the most problematic element in the Arab world  vis a vis Israel. An agreement with them means diplomatic  relations with Lebanon, Jordan, the Gulf states and most of the  Maghreb countries. [passage omitted]</p>

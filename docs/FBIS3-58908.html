			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Francois de Rose by unidentified LE POINT </F> correspondent; place and date not given: "The Clinton Project  Threatens NATO"]    [Text] Francois de Rose, ambassador of France and former  representative to NATO, is one of the best French experts on  strategic issues.    LE POINT: How do you view the future Atlantic summit, which  must define future relations between the Atlantic alliance and  the countries of Central and East Europe?    Francois de Rose: President Clinton presented to the allies  a  project called Partnership for Peace. This project takes into  account his compatriots' reservations vis-a-vis overseas  obligations and their new demand for "zero dead wars" [preceding  three words in English]. Thus the document seeks a formula that  would allow the United States to remain present in Europe  without the risk of becoming implicated in possible conflicts...  However, it should also be viewed within the context of a  priority in U.S. policy, that is, assistance to the  consolidation of the regime in Russia, where more than 30,000  nuclear weapons are stored. The complex ambition in this  undertaking translates into a program that would like to  associate Western allies, neutral nations, members of the former  Warsaw Pact and successor states in the former USSR, including  Asian countries, to this partnership. "It is thus difficult to  understand what distinguishes this partnership" from the CSCE or  from the Committee for North Atlantic Coordination (COCONA).  Since the project additionally contemplates the eventual  adherence of all the participants, and hence of Russia, to the  alliance, how could one not see in it a threat to the Alliance  itself? By being everyone's ally, one ends up being no one's  ally.    LE POINT: And how about our Europe in there?    Francois de Rose: West Europeans naturally share  Washington's  interest in the consolidation of the changes under way in  Russia. And they prove it by contributing 80 percent of the  economic assistance provided. However, this does not mean that  American and European priorities are necessarily similar. Ours  is -- or should be -- that Central and East Europeans should be  given the security assistance necessary for their course toward  democracy and a market economy. When voices in Moscow are heard  protesting the adherence -- even long-term -- of some of these  countries to the alliance in the name of the so-called threat  this would represent for Russia, one must see in it the survival  of the worst impostures of the Soviet false language. Must we  let this language obstruct the measures that we would deem to be  in the interest of security in Europe?    Let us be frank: what these Central and East European  countries are seeking in a close association with the Atlantic  alliance is assurance against a possible return of the Soviet  danger. While waiting for the WEU [Western European Union] to  provide a steady foundation for its structures and forces, only  NATO possesses the trump cards indispensable to make deterrence  credible.    For the alliance to bring to East Europe this "plus" it  alone  holds, its members -- including the United States -- must  entrust it, not only with peacekeeping missions, but with  missions aimed at reestablishing peace. Bosnia, however, has  taught us that Europeans have opposed air strikes against Serb  artillery positions, and that the United States subordinates the  dispatch of land forces to a stop in the fighting, which would  mean that the problem is solved.    This summit should decide to create "groups of combined  interarmy forces" used for peacekeeping operations. The question  would then be to know whether their mobilization would depend on  the UN, which allows the murder of its blue helmets to go  unpunished, or on the CSCE, or on the alliance itself. Thus we  could begin thinking of stationing such a group right away in  Macedonia to maintain the peace in this very fragile area  bordering on Kosovo. Because who can think that such a decision,  already difficult enough within the Alliance, could be made by  the UN or by the CSCE?    The cruel punishment for our hesitation is that Russia seems  to hold more precise, but negative, views on NATO enlargement  than the allies themselves. Nevertheless, if the alliance loses  its credibility, the only direct influence remaining in Central  and East Europe would be that of Russia and Germany. Ours, the  French one, would only be part of the common foreign policy of  the European Union. This should lead us to reflect on the place  that we should hold in NATO leadership structure.</p>

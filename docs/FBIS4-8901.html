			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia's President  Milan Kucan has admitted that Slovenia supplied arms to Croatia  and Bosnian Moslems in defiance of a U.N. ban on arms deliveries  to ex- Yugoslavia's territory.    In a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek,  carried by Ljubljana papers, Kucan demanded a government  investigation into arms smuggling to determine who was involved,  what was the profit of officials, institutions and individuals  gained in that way, and the exact quantity of arms delivered to  Slovenia from abroad.    The truth about Slovenia's involvement in arms smuggling  came  out in the public last summer, when 120 tonnes of weapons for  Croatia and Bosnian Moslems were recovered at Maribor airport.    By drawing attention to arms smuggling, Kucan attempted to  attenuate his role in the affair that assumed international  proportions.    Kucan's "considerate" letter to Drnovsek is also intended to  build up his reputation, but it will probably trigger new  polemics instead, notably about the ex-Defence Minister Janez  Jansa's role in Slovenia's instigating armed conflicts in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

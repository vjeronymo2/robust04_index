			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke  Peace Committee and the Central Committee of the Korean  Environmental Conservation Union proposed that the anti-nuke,  environmental organisations of the North and the South conduct  joint survey and monitoring activities at an early date to probe  the very truth behind the nuclear waste dumping by the South  Korean authorities and check it.    This proposal was made in a letter sent today to the  Alliance  of the Anti-Nuke Peace Movement, the Alliance of the  Environmental Movement and the Civic Federation for Economic  Justice of South Korea.    Noting that the South Korean authorities had dumped 11,000  trillion becquerels of nuclear waste into the sea in the 1986-92  period, the letter goes on:    "Such nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean authorities  is a crude breach of the international conventions on protection  and conservation of the sea environment and an anti-national,  anti-human crime inflicting immeasurable disasters on our nation  and mankind.    "The random dumping of nuclear waste by South Korea vividly  shows how far the South Korean authorities have gone in  developing nuclear arms while crying over `suspected nuclear  programme of the North.'    "It is entirely natural that in South Korea environmental  organisations, people and broad public circles took issue with  the authorities' criminal dumping of nuclear waste and have  risen in a struggle against it.    "We hope your organisations will turn out more courageously  in the just struggle in the future to check the South Korean  authorities' criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear arms  development."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 24 Jun (EFE) -- The serious economic,  political, and social situation in Venezuela has triggered new  waves of protests in several cities in the country during the  past few days.    The riots in Bejuma, Miranda, and Montalban, Carabobo State,  211 km from Caracas, resulted in three injuries, a fire at a  commercial warehouse, and several attempts to loot shops.  Citizens clashed with police during the "Day For Hunger"  [Jornada por el Hambre] held on Wednesday. The event, which was  to protest the high cost of living, was organized by the  Federation of Consumer Associations in Montalban.    The main cause of the people's unrest is price speculation  on  staple goods and store hoarding. As a result of the protests  over the last few days, the Chamber of Deputies approved an  agreement that calls upon the people and the government to join  efforts to find effective solutions to the deterioration in  family budgets and to control speculation.    The speculative wave has prompted the government to look for  agreements with merchants on consumer prices. Several  parliamentarians, however, have demanded that the Executive  Branch implement a "war economy" to control prices directly.    Lorenzo Tovar, the president of the Consumer Defense and  Education Institute (IDEC) said that excessive and uncontrolled  price increases in several stores is a crime. Tovar recommended  that the government find a solution to price speculation in the  country because it has turned into a state problem.</p>

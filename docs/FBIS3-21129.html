The project that Pioneer is going to join decided to develop and  use its own regulations as a world standard in the summer of  1993. Because of this decision, Pioneer, a non-European company,  was able to join the project.    The Eureka 147 project is promoting DAB via digital  transmission which makes it possible to receive signals even by  a mobile media. DAB will start in 1995.    Pioneer which was permitted to join the project as the first  non-European company said, ``by being able to participate in  this project, production of experimental devices for  broadcasting will become possible.''    Pioneer will provide DAB experimental receivers to DRRI  (Digital Radio Research Inc.) in the beginning of 1995. The  experimental broadcasting is planned to start in Canada in the  beginning of 1994 using a transmitter developed in Europe.    The reason why the Eureka 147 project opened the door to  non-European companies seems to be that the project aims at  world standardization. In the past, it was said that the  specifications regarding OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division  Multiplex) for modulation ``had never been disclosed to  technical people in Japan.'' This sudden change is perceived as  a way to establish a world standard which will enable Japanese  makers to manufacture the receivers.  <H5>  Three Kinds Of Modes According To Frequency Bands </H5>   Table 1 shows the DAB regulation that Europe is suggesting  to  ITU-RS (old: CCIR). OFDM used for modulation is digital  transmission using intersecting multiple carrier waves.  Depending on the carrier waves in frequency bands, three modes  are set. Mode I is terrestrial broadcasting, mode II is  terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, and mode III assumes use  for satellite broadcasting. All three modes have 1.5 MHz  frequency band width.    Most characteristic for OFDM is that it is not significantly  influenced by multipath distortion caused by objects such as  mountains and buildings. The development of a mobile receiver  for audio and video is getting quite active.    Allowable hours of multipath change depending on the mode.  Since terrestrial broadcasting will be most susceptible to  multipath interference, mode I has the longest allowable hours.  Depending on the allowable delay hours, the duration of the  guard interval (during the period of 1 symbol, the period at the  time of demodulation is ignored) which avoids interference  between symbols also varies.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

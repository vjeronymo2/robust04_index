			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Government under pressure from EC over works councils DENMARK yesterday began to push for European Community approval for a directive that would force many big British companies operating on the continent to set up elected works councils. The Danes want agreement by June, when they end their six months' term as president of the EC. The Danish government is anxious for progress to persuade Danish voters in next month's referendum on European union that the EC can deliver acceptable social and work standards. Britain is the only member state hostile to the measure. It would require a works council to be set up by all companies - including those based outside the EC - if they employ more than 1,000 people in more than one of the EC's 12 member states (with more than 100 in at least two of the states). The works councils would have to be consulted on such issues as job changes, new technology, investment and any relocation of business. After talks between employment and social affairs ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, it became clear that Britain faces a fight to dilute the measure, or see it passed by its 11 partners, assuming the Maastricht treaty on European union and its social protocol come into force later this year. If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did from the Maastricht social chapter, the works council requirements would go through without the British if and when the treaty is ratified. If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies would be among those most affected. According to British calculations, more than 100 UK companies' operations in continental Europe would be affected if the 11 decided to press ahead on their own. But if the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 British companies would be affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than France. During the recent controversies over alleged 'job poaching' in relocation to the UK of production by Hoover from Burgundy and Digital from the west of Ireland, Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president, promised a new effort to get the works councils directive into EC law. The Commission believes such cases would be less inflammatory with obligatory consultation of the workforce, denying companies the chance to play one set of employees off against another. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK employment secretary, yesterday expressed 'fundamental reservations', objecting because the measure was prescriptive, mandatory and based on a single model which did not include, for instance, employee share options.

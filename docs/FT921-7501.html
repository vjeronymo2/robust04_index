			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Transamerica falls into the red TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group which holds a 25 per cent stake in Britain's Sedgwick Group, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 77.5m in the final three months of 1991 - compared with Dollars 28.7m profit a year earlier. The company blamed the loss on its commercial lending division, where it took a previously-announced special charge. This reflected 'the decision to substantially reduce lending to certain industries and to aggressively liquidate receivables from previously sold businesses'. Commercial lending contributed a Dollars 154m operating loss for the three-month period. Both life insurance and property-casualty operations produced improved figures, and insurance interests overall made a Dollars 60.7m operating profit, against Dollars 56.3m in the fourth quarter of 1990. Consumer lending profits nudged up from Dollars 24.7m to Dollars 25.2m, but leasing slumped from Dollars 19m to Dollars 15.5m. For 1991 overall, net profits were Dollars 50.1m, down sharply from 1990's Dollars 266.3m. The loss from commercial lending, at the operating level, was Dollars 217m. However, the company said it expected Transamerica Commercial Finance Company to be profitable in 1992, and for the group overall to achieve 'a strong consolidated earnings performance.' Transamerica shares eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 .</p>

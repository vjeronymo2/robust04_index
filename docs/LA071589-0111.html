			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HILBURN: THE HEAVY HITTERS OF COUNTRY, R&amp;B MUSIC  </P> <P> Elvis Presley was far and away the most successful record artist of the modern  pop era, a point that Wisconsin researcher Joel Whitburn has documented in a  series of books devoted to the history of the Billboard magazine pop charts.  </P> <P> But who are the most successful artists in country music and rhythm and blues,  the two styles whose fusion in the '50s gave birth to rock 'n' roll and which  have continued, in varying degrees, to influence the pop-rock mainstream?  </P> <P> Whitburn supplies the answer in a pair of new books: The top R&amp;B and  country artists, respectively, are James Brown and Eddy Arnold.  </P> <P> The books -- "Top R&amp;B Singles 1942-1988" and "Top Country Singles  1944-1988" -- chronicle the magazine's weekly pop and country charts for the  years involved and assign points to individual artists for every week they have  a single on the charts, with bonus points for Top 10 or No. 1 hits.  </P> <P> Brown's victory isn't a surprise. Despite such worthy rivals as Aretha  Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, Brown remains a major presence in  R&amp;B. His passionate vocal and performance styles have influenced hundreds  of artists, both in rock and in R&amp;B -- from Mick Jagger and Prince to  Michael Jackson.  </P> <P> But Arnold's victory will probably be a surprise to most contemporary pop fans  because Arnold is far less known today than such other country artists as  Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash.  </P> <P> Arnold, who enjoyed his greatest success between 1945 and 1969, was a break  from Nashville's hard-core "hillbilly" tradition -- someone whose smooth vocal  style was closer to pop in many ways than the rural emphasis of such rivals as  Roy Acuff and Hank Williams.  </P> <P> Arnold, whose 91 Top 10 country hits included "Bouquet of Roses" and "Make the  World Go Away," helped win new fans for country music among previously  skeptical pop fans and is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. But he  has far less influence on today's crop of "back-to-basics" country stars  (including Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam) than such former contemporaries as  Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell.  </P> <P> Seventy-one-year-old Arnold lives in semi-retirement near Nashville. Brown, 55,  has been in prison in Columbia, S.C., since December, serving a six-year  sentence for failing to stop for a police car, a felony in that state.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that chart success is not an exact measurement of sales, but  Whitburn's stats do provide the most comprehensive evaluation of an artist's  popularity.  </P> <P> The most popular R&amp;B singles artists, according to Whitburn's research  (along with the number of points they received in his evaluation system):  </P> <P> 1 -- James Brown (11,872 points -- 57 Top 10 hits).  </P> <P> 2 -- Aretha Franklin (8,732 -- 48).  </P> <P> 3 -- Ray Charles (8,462 -- 40).  </P> <P> 4 -- Temptations (8,065 -- 42).  </P> <P> 5 -- Louis Jordan (7,361 -- 54).  </P> <P> 6 -- Stevie Wonder (7,122 -- 42).  </P> <P> 7 -- Marvin Gaye (7,029 -- 33).  </P> <P> 8 -- B.B. King (6,760 -- 24).  </P> <P> 9 -- Fats Domino (6,735 -- 39).  </P> <P> 10 -- Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips (6,282 -- 30).  </P> <P> Whitburn, who has published nearly three dozen musical research books since  forming his company in 1970, also notes in "Top R&amp;B Singles" the most  successful R&amp;B artists by decade: Jordan in the '40s, Domino in the '50s,  Brown in the '60s and '70s, and Prince so far in the '80s.  </P> <P> Diana Ross, he says, has achieved more points as a solo artist (4,541) than as  a member of the Supremes (4,405). If the figures were combined, she would move  into second place, ahead of Franklin.  </P> <P> However, Michael Jackson's solo points (3,525) place him slightly behind the  points he earned as a member of the Jackson 5 (3,805). Surprisingly, Elvis  Presley, with 3,934 points, ranks higher on the charts than the either the solo  Jackson or the Jackson 5.  </P> <P> The most successful country artists:  </P> <P> 1 -- Eddy Arnold (17,092 points -- 91 Top 10 hits).  </P> <P> 2 -- George Jones (16,198 -- 77).  </P> <P> 3 -- Johnny Cash (13,356 -- 51).  </P> <P> 4 -- Merle Haggard (12,171 -- 70).  </P> <P> 5 -- Conway Twitty (11,905 -- 72).  </P> <P> 6 -- Ray Price (10,870 -- 46).  </P> <P> 7 -- Webb Pierce (10,791 -- 58).  </P> <P> 8 -- Willie Nelson (10,570 -- 37).  </P> <P> 9 -- Marty Robbins (10,550 -- 47).  </P> <P> 10 -- Dolly Parton (10,191 -- 51).  </P> <P> Unlike Brown in the R&amp;B field, no one dominated the country charts for two  decades in a row, according to statistics in Whitburn's "Top Country Singles."  Arnold was the leader in the '40s, followed by Pierce in the '50s, Jones in the  '60s, Twitty in the '70s and Nelson so far in the '80s.  </P> <P> "The thing that struck me about the country charts is the loyalty of the fans,"  Whitburn said.  </P> <P> "When an artist breaks through with a couple of Top 10 hits, he's almost  guaranteed of a long career. We found five country artists who had hits in five  different decades. It's almost the opposite in R&amp;B, where there is an  enormous amount of turnover on the charts. You obviously have some R&amp;B  artists with long careers, but not nearly as many."  </P> <P> A few of Whitburn's pop books are sold in stores, but most of his collections  -- including the new R&amp;B and country volumes -- are available only by mail  order through his company. Catalogues may be obtained by writing him at Record  Research Inc., Menomonee Falls, Wis. 53051.  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale Monday for Elton John's third Forum show (Aug.  18) and his Pacific Amphitheatre appearance (Aug. 19). . . .

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> PAY RAISES: Top managers in Orange County can expect an average 5.9% salary  increase in 1990, according to a new survey of planned merit raises released by  an Irvine-based consultant. . . . That tops projected jumps of 5.7% in Los  Angeles and 5.5% in San Diego. . . . The news is not as good for mid-level  managers and hourly workers, whose projected pay raises of 5.3% fall well below  figures in those neighboring counties and the state average.

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Key facts you need to know - Disclosure of Investment Charges Market research was used to refine the format of the 'key features' paper and, given that it is dealing with complex financial products, the final version is reasonably clear, writes Alison Smith. Although each life company will produce its own variant, regulators have been specific about what information it must contain and how this should be presented. The front of the four-page paper must state the aims and risks of the policy, as well as the commitment the customer has to make. The back page deals with more general information about the company and aspects of the policy such as tax treatment, paying premiums, the 'cooling off' period after the sale, and how complaints are handled. In between, there is more detailed information about the specific policy chosen and how it would apply in your own circumstances. Much of it comes in a question and answer form, and it includes two tables. One shows what a customer might get back if a policy is given up in any of the first five years. The second shows what a customer might get back at later stages before the policy reaches its full term. This shows the impact of deductions to cover commissions, administration and other charges. The other important numbers in the paper show how the benefits would mount up depending on different rates of investment growth; the impact of the charges expressed in terms of reducing that yield; and the cost of being given the advice to buy the policy. While the figures are useful, they do carry a health warning: the investment returns are not guaranteed. But they are not entirely notional, as they must be based on the life insurer's own charges and not on some arithmetical average for the sector. This makes them most valuable as a way to compare similar policies offered by different companies, rather than as an absolute guide to what the policy will provide. To make the most of the information, though, you need to shop around. Our survey starting on page 7 explains what disclosure reveals about personal pension plans</p>

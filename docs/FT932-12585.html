			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Clinton brings spring to Bob Dole's career: The fixer and blocker who has been energised by the Republican party's straitened times PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is not the only one in Washington commemorating a first 100 days this week. Senator Robert Dole of Kansas may have been the Republican leader in the Senate since 1984, but never before was he obliged to operate with a Democrat in the White House and with his own party in such apparent disarray after a sharp electoral repudiation. If the president is getting predictably mixed reviews, Mr Dole is receiving surprisingly good ones. The big notch on his belt is defeat of Mr Clinton's economic stimulus package, achieved by holding together in a filibuster the 43 Republicans in the Senate. This alone made Mr Dole, who will be 70 in July, a man to be reckoned with again, and his party's most effective national voice on everything from Bosnia to the budget. Some polls even make him the new favourite for the Republican nomination in 1996, remarkable since that would be 20 years after he came off so badly as a mean-spirited partisan vice-presidential candidate, when matched against Mr Walter Mondale, and after two poor runs at his party banner in 1980 and 1988. Even his former enemies are impressed. Congressman Newt Gingrich, the conservative ideologue and Republican House Whip from Georgia, who once derided him as 'the tax collector for the welfare state', now says 'this is the best spring of Bob Dole's political career'. Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leader and personal friend, concurs, suggesting Mr Dole 'clearly has been energised by no longer having to carry water for the (Bush) administration.' There is more than a little truth in this, for the caustic street fighter from Russell, Kansas, never had much personal truck with the patrician former president. In defeat and victory, Bob Dole has been a conspicuous figure in Washington, where he is one of its funniest, sometimes most vicious and always quoteable politicians. Yet it did seem with the advent of the Clinton administration that at best he was holding the Republican fort while it sorted out its succession among the younger likes of former vice-president Dan Quayle, Mr Jack Kemp and Mr Dick Cheney from the Bush administration, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, Governor Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Governor Bill Weld of Massachussetts, and a few talk show hosts. Even now, a good first 100 days in opposition is no guarantee of longer term success, and Mr Dole knows he is walking a very fine line. Frustrating Mr Clinton over the stimulus package, mismanaged as it was by the administration, may earn him Washington credits but not necessarily national approbation. For example, a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal survey found 60 per cent believing that the Republicans were just 'playing politics' in resisting the president's economic proposals: by a 52-29 per cent margin, those polled thought Mr Clinton was more serious about reducing the budget deficit than the Republicans were: and last year's independent presidential candidate Mr Ross Perot is back on television again, all the time muttering about 'gridlock'. Logically, having drawn the president's blood, Mr Dole should be contemplating offering positive alternative policies, rather than recycling complaints about 'tax and spend' Democrats. His problem here is twofold: first, he is an expert legislative 'fixer' and blocker but not a man with big ideas: second he is contemptuous of those in his party with big ideas (like Mr Kemp and Mr Weld) and the sharpness of his tongue often makes these feelings mutual. He could also let the Democrats in Congress unravel the Clinton agenda, as they are perfectly capable of doing. There has been much talk in Washington since the defeat of the stimulus package about the balance of power on domestic issues shifting back from the administration to Congress, which is where it mostly resided from 1986-1992. But if Mr Mitchell and Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House, get their troops back in line, as they did over the first budget bill, and if the president learns from his initial political mistakes, then pure Republican obstructionism may not be enough. There is a theory in the capital that the Republican leader's ulterior motive is to be invited to a seat at the Democratic administration's policy-making table. Partisan he may be, but in the Reagan and Bush years he was also very much the arbitrator between the White House and both parties in Congress, a role which, as a proud man and as an insider, he found congenial and flattering. This worries some keepers of the conservative flame, long suspicious of Mr Dole. A recent Wall Street Journal editorial, for example, concluded: 'asked what price he wants for peace with Mr Clinton, Bob Dole said 'big'. We hope he means something bigger than merely being a 'player' with President Clinton.' On the other hand, 'playing' with Mr Perot and his populist army is the sort of venture that might appeal to him, and many Republicans, even more. At least they talk the same plain language and Mr Perot is not a Democrat.</p>

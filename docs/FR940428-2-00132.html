(``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 2, 1987, the Commission issued an order approving operation of a market information linkage between the NASD and the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'') (formerly, the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) for a pilot term of two years. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  This experimental linkage supports an interchange of quotation information (``linkage information'') on about 740 securities (``linkage securities''); of that total, each marketplace has designated approximately half as its ``pilot group'' of linkage securities. NASD and LSE members that function as market makers in one or more of a subset of linkage securities that are quoted in both the Nasdaq and LSE dealer systems (``common issues'') are entitled to access linkage information without paying a separate charge to receive it. Operation of the linkage in this fashion comports with the terms of the Commission's October 1987 Order. Most recently, the Commission authorized an extension of this pilot linkage through May 5, 1994, by approving File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;55. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24979 (Oct. 2, 1987), 52 FR 37684 (Oct. 8, 1987) (the ``October 1987 Order'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33060 (Oct. 15, 1993), 58 FR 54616 (Oct. 22, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, the NASD hereby files this proposed rule change to obtain Commission approval for continuation of the NASD/LSE pilot linkage through October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this rule filing is to obtain an extension of the Commission's interim approval of the NASD/LSE linkage through October 31, 1994. Absent an extension, authorization for the linkage will expire as of May 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For some time now, the sponsors of this linkage have considered various possibilities for its future development in meeting the needs of the international investment community. Both markets have also launched major initiatives to migrate their core processing and communications facilities to state-of-the-art technologies that will yield operational efficiencies and enhanced capacity. In this connection, the LSE has notified the NASD that the progression of the LSE's technology migration will foreclose continued operation of the NASD/LSE linkage after October 31, 1994. Accordingly, the NASD is requesting that the Commission extend its interim approval of the NASD/LSE linkage through October 31, 1994. The NASD does not anticipate further extension beyond that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD submits that the statutory basis for the NASD/LSE pilot linkage and the requested extension thereof, are contained in Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and (C) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Subsections (B) and (C) of Section 11A(a)(1) set forth the Congressional goals of achieving more efficient and effective market operations, the availability of information with respect to quotations for securities and the execution of investor orders in the best market through the application of new data processing and communications techniques. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. The NASD believes that the requested extension of the linkage's temporary authorization is fully consistent with the policy goals reflected in these statutory provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its original release announcing interim approval of the NASD/LSE pilot linkage, the Commission referenced certain competitive concerns raised by Instinet Corporation (``Instinet'') through counsel. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In response, the NASD, after consultation with the LSE, made a good faith effort to address those concerns by narrowing the universe of firms and terminals permitted access to linkage information at no cost. Those changes were reflected in File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;87&hyph;20, which the Commission approved by issuing the October 1987 Order. With respect to File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;89&hyph;44 (which resulted in extension of the linkage's authorization until December 1, 1990), the NASD also submitted statistical and cost information relative to its participation in the pilot project. Given that the NASD/LSE linkage will be terminated on or shortly before October 31, 1994, the NASD believes that the instant rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23158 (Apr. 21, 1986), 51 FR 15989 (Apr. 29, 1986).

Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD requested that the Commission find good cause for approving this proposed rule change prior to the 30th day following publication of notice of the filing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and, in any event, by May 5, 1994, the expiration of the linkage's present authorization. The NASD believes that the requested extension of the pilot period is fully consistent with the statutory provisions and policy goals referenced in Section II of this Rule 19b-4 filing. Moreover, the NASD argued the additional time will enable the sponsoring markets to effect an orderly termination of this experimental project. Under the circumstances, the Commission finds that allowing the NASD/LSE linkage to cease abruptly would be counterproductive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 11A(a)(1) (B) and (C) and 15A(b)(6), and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Accelerated approval will avoid an unnecessary interruption of the pilot linkage while allowing the NASD and LSE to provide for an orderly termination of this experimental program in the final quarter of 1994. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Commission believes the NASD/LSE linkage should be permitted to continue operating, without a hiatus, for a brief period sufficient to bridge the migration to new technologies being developed by the sponsoring markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD has represented that it will provide notice to its subscribers of the termination of the NASD/LSE linkage in its Subscriber Bulletin no later than August 30, 1994.

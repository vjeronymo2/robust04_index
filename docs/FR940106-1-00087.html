Species characteristic of the Delta and rivers, such as striped bass and salmon, began to decline during the late 1970s. Prolonged drought, large diversions of fresh water, and dramatic increases in populations of introduced aquatic species during the 1980s and 1990s brought a number of indigenous aquatic species to extremely low levels. Species that spend more of their lives downstream of the Delta, including Delta smelt, longfin smelt, and many zooplankton, maintained large populations through the 1970s, but declined sharply after the mid-1980s. Declines in aquatic resources have led to curtailed fishing seasons, to petitions for endangered species status, and general concern about the health of the estuarine ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern over the impacts of increased salinity produced from the combination of drought and high diversion rates is not limited to aquatic communities. The few remaining fragments of brackish and freshwater tidal marshlands are particularly vulnerable to increased salinity or to reduced variability in salinity. Under natural conditions, these tidal marsh communities would move upstream with the changing salinity. But the flood plains and other lowlands suitable for the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream. Tidal marshes provide important habitat for numerous plants and animals of special concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large demands for water by the agricultural community and by California's burgeoning urban areas make it difficult to allocate additional freshwater for the protection of dwindling aquatic and wetland resources of the estuary. Management of the State's water resources necessitates a delicate balancing of needs, given the intense and growing competition for water. If the freshwater needs of the estuary are to be considered seriously they must be based on sensitive, straightforward, and diagnostic indicators of the responses of the estuarine ecosystem to patterns of freshwater inflow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An extensive body of scientific evidence indicates that flows into, within, and through the estuary are extremely important to organisms that depend on the estuary for at least a portion of their life cycles. However, the mechanisms by which flows affect different elements of the ecosystem are not well understood. In the Bay/Delta Estuary, many chemical and physical properties and processes are tightly linked to flow, including proportion of water diverted, salinity at a given point, the longitudinal position of a particular salinity range, and alteration of the effects of toxicants through dilutions. Any of these phenomena could be controlling a particular species, but each will also vary with the other variables that are closely correlated with flow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present, the complex configuration of the Delta and the estuary, combined with the complex withdrawal and diversion network, preclude any simple, directly monitored measure of freshwater discharge to the estuary. Effective protection and management of the estuary requires an index of the estuary's response to freshwater inflow that (1) Can be measured accurately, easily and inexpensively; (2) has ecological significance; and (3) has meaning for nonspecialists. Net Delta outflow, which is calculated from various measures and estimates of water inflow and use, has been a useful tool but it does not satisfy all of these requirements. Because of the high correlations among the flow-related variables, the choice of a suitable index does not need to be based on any presumed mechanism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Francisco Estuary Project convened a series of technical workshops to evaluate the responses of estuarine biota and habitats to various conditions of salinity and flow. The workshops involved approximately 30 scientists and policy makers with expertise in estuarine oceanography and ecology, and in water and living resource management. The group focused its attention on the Suisun Bay area, the portion of the estuary downstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and upstream of Carquinez Strait. Internal Delta issues (such as gate closures, water exports, and internal flows) or problems of downstream portions of the San Francisco Bay (such as urban and industrial discharges) were not directly addressed by the group. No attempt was made to incorporate all management actions that might benefit biological communities, nor to identify what level of environmental restoration and protection should be set based on salinity and flow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V.P. Voytenko and Ye.M. Libmanova (Based on </F> Materials of the Ecodefencinform Agency): "Mortality and Life  Expectancy in Ukraine"]    [Text] A conference entitled "Ecology, Health, and  Old Age" was held quite recently at the Gerontology Institute of  the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences in Kiev. Taking part  in this conference's work were staffers of the scientific organs  under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and Academy of Medical  Sciences, as well as those from the Ukrainian Ministry of  Education. Twelve reports by prominent specialists in the fields  of ecology, medicine, and gerontology were discussed here. The  conference's goal was to thoroughly analyze the consequences of  the ecological situation which has evolved in Ukraine and which  has evoked deep concern. This conference also had the goal of  discussing possible ways to extricate ourselves from this  crisis-type situation. The initiator for holding this  conference--the Gerontology Institute--hopes and anticipates  that the most adequate ways will be found for overcoming the  symptoms which menace our nation's health. This hope likewise  unites the efforts of scientists in various fields and  practicing specialists.    Press Center of the Ukrainian Health Center    According to data published by the World Health Organization  in 1990, Ukraine ranks 45th out of 65 countries in average life  expectancy for women, and it ranks 54th for men.    The principal cause of death in Ukraine consists of diseases  of the circulatory system. Our fellow-countrymen are dying from  these diseases not only more freqently, but also earlier: The  greatest losses of life--as compared with our foreign  counterparts--occur between the ages of 45 and 65. Of particular  significance are deaths from cardiovascular diseases in  Zarkarpat, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk,  and Zaporozhye oblasts, as well as throughout the entire  territory of Southern Ukraine.    Ranking second in importance as a cause of death  (contributed  to by pollution of the environment and by tobacco smoking) are  malignant new growths--tumors and cancers. Kiev, as well as the  industrial oblasts of the western and southern regions, have  become particularly hazardous with regard to such oncological  diseases.    Ranking third are accidents, poisonings, and injuries. The  number of injury-caused deaths--which was reduced by the  short-term success of the anti-alcohol campaign--has begun to  increase again since 1988.    Increasing the life expectancy in Ukraine is possible  provided that there are changes in the mortality structure. In  the first place, what we are talking about here is a reduction  in the role played by deaths from infectious diseases and  injuries. In the second place, it is a matter of reducing the  average number of deaths from cardiovascular and oncological  diseases. Successfully performing both of these tasks is  connected--in one way or another--with solving our economic  problems. An increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and  personal consumption (PC) by 1,000 "international dollars" would  allow an increase in life expectancy of 0.5 years for men and 1  year for women. But this ratio is not absolute. The greatest  life expectancy is not in the United States (which ranks first  in personal consumption), but rather in Japan (which ranks 22nd  in personal consumption). That is to say, extra-ecological  factors are also of essential importance, in particular, life  style and the nature (not merely the quantity) of the personal  consumption involved. This furnished optimism for those who are  poor.    Most urgent for Ukraine is investing in the preservation and  safeguarding of nature, even though restoring the environment to  good health will not have an effect on mortality very soon.  <H8>  Prognosis </H8>   The Central Region (the city of Kiev, as well as  Poltava, Chernigov, Zhitomir, Sumy, Cherkassy, Vinnitsa, and  Kiev oblasts) is characterized by a relatively favorable  mortality structure-one closely approximating international  standards. Serving as a foreign analogue to the mortality  pattern here could be Belgium during the early 1960's (for men)  and during the late 1970's (for women).    The Western Region (Lvov, Khmelnitskiy, Chernigov,  Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Volyn, Rovno, and Zakarpat oblasts)  slightly exceeds the average level for Ukraine with regard to  life expectancy; however, it is progressing quite slowly. The  unfavorable mortality trends in Zakarpat Oblast provide grounds  for doubting the reliability of the health statistics in this  oblast, as well as in Ivano-Frankovsk and Volyn oblasts. Among  the European countries an analogue may be seen with France  during the early 1960's (for men) and during the late 1960's  (for women).    The Eastern Region (Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk,  Kharkov, and Lugansk oblasts) is characterized not only by a  high present-day level of mortality, but also by a stagnation of  its basic indicators during the last 10 years. It is analogous  to Finland during the early 1970's.    The Southern Region (Crimea, as well as Kherson,  Kirovograd, Nikolayev, and Odessa oblasts) is the most  unfavorable zone. In fact, it is a zone of increased risk for  health and life (especially the maritime rayons of Kherson and  Odessa oblasts). The closest analogue is Spain during the late  1950's (for men) and the late 1960's (for women).</p>

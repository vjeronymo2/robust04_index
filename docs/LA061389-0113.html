			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> California Federal Changes Name: California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn.,  one of the nation's largest thrifts, has changed its name to California Federal  Bank, reflecting an increasing homogenization of financial services offered by  banks and thrifts. Several of the state's largest savings and loans now call  themselves banks, including Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills and First  Nationwide Bank in San Francisco. The name change "clearly recognizes the  evolution of the financial services industry along common lines," said John R.  Torell III, California Federal's chief executive.  </P></p>

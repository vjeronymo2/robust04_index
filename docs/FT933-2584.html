			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Paribas arm loses role in Hungarian state sale HUNGARY'S privatisation authority is striking Magyar Paribas, the local subsidiary of France's Paribas, off its list of advisers. Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of Hungary's State Property Agency (SPA), claimed yesterday that Paribas had made 'big mistakes' as consultant on the privatisation of Pannon Suto, a bakery. The SPA's clash with Paribas is the latest in a series of disputes between the Hungarian authorities and western advisers. 'This is just the same game they played with BZW,' said Mr Peter Medgyessy, director-general of Magyar Paribas. The SPA sacked the UK's Barclays de Zoete Wedd as adviser on the privatisation of Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest brewery, in November 1992. The SPA claimed, and BZW denied, that the UK bank had ignored instructions. More recently, Hungary's State Audit Office attacked the handling by London-based Morgan Grenfell of the sale of Allami Biztosito, the state-owned insurer, to Aegon of the Netherlands. The underlying charge against Paribas is that it should have stopped managers of Pannon Suto siphoning off the company's assets into their own private company. Magyar Paribas said it was 'absolutely innocent' and found the SPA's actions inexplicable. 'I simply don't understand,' said Mr Medgyessy. Pannon Suto is included in Hungary's decentralised 'self-privatisation' programme, in which advisers are given extra freedom to set the terms for disposal with a minimum of state intervention. Confusion surrounds the decision to exclude Paribas, which is uncertain about the extent of the ban. It is unclear whether the SPA had excluded Magyar Paribas just from Pannon Suto's sale, from participation in the self-privatisation programme, or from all privatisation work with the agency.</p>

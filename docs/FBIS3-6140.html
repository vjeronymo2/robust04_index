			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Barisan Nasional [National Front, BN] will wait  for a right time to approach Sabah Governor Tun Mohamed Said  Keruak to form a new state government in accordance with the  Constitution. The situation is not clear yet. Prime Minister  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the BN will have a majority in the  State Legislative Assembly following the crossing-over of  several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS]  assemblymen and the formation of Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan of a  new party which wants to join the BN. He told newsmen after  holding a Hari Raya [end of fasting month] open house at Sri  Perdana for VIP guests that the BN will implement its manifesto.  The first sitting of the Sabah State Assembly after last  month's state elections is slated for Friday.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, who is also UMNO [United Malays  National Organization] president, said the PBS now has less than  half the number of seats in the assembly even with the inclusion  of six appointed assemblymen. He also warned that  three-quarters of the PBS assemblymen are expected to switch to  the BN.    The prime minister also said the BN will approve the  application by the new Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [United Sabah  People's Party, PBRS] to join the coalition. The PBRS was  launched today in Kota Kinabalu with Joseph Kurup as pro-tem  president and Dr. Jeffrey as its deputy. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  said the BN would fulfill its promise to rotate the chief  minister's post among the three major groups in the state with  each leader serving a two-year term. When asked to comment on  his meeting with Bingkor State Assemblyman Datuk Dr. Jeffrey  Kitingan at Sri Perdana last night, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said  no specific decision was made. He, however, pointed out that  all agree to form a government that is responsible and works  together with the Sabahans and not by a small group only.</p>

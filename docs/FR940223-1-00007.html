			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proponents indicated that at the time of the hearing 59 percent of the Class II and Class III milk pooled under the Pacific Northwest order was being made into nonfat dry milk and 26 percent into cheese. Thus, the use of solids nonfat is appropriate since the majority of manufactured milk is oriented more toward the products and uses in which all the solids nonfat are consumed together. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, in the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon market, nearly 80 percent of the milk is made into cheese, in which protein is an important component. Thus, the use of butterfat and protein for MCP is appropriate for Order 135. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the plan adopted herein, the price for a pound of butterfat will be the same for both orders, i.e., the sum of the skim milk price divided by 100 and the butterfat differential multiplied by 10. Since each producer will receive payment for the milkfat on a price-per-pound basis, there will no longer be a need for a producer butterfat differential in either order. Thus, the proposed order language does not contain a provision for a ``producer butterfat differential.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prices per pound for solids nonfat and protein should be based on the basic formula price (i.e., the M&hyph;W price). For each component, the skim milk value will be determined by subtracting from the M&hyph;W price the butterfat price multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the average percent of solids nonfat or protein (as appropriate) for the month in the milk upon which the M&hyph;W price is based, as announced by the Dairy Division. Use of the average tests for the components (other than butterfat) in the M&hyph;W milk will be consistent with such a provision recently adopted for the Great Basin, Ohio Valley, Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, and Indiana markets. This approach was suggested by several people and was supported in briefs. No one specifically opposed it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two related issues that also should be addressed in connection with determining component prices. First, we should point out that the solids nonfat content of producer milk in the Pacific Northwest market may be higher than the solids nonfat content of the milk that is the basis for the M&hyph;W price, based on limited information in the record. For example, Exhibit Number 7, Table 1, shows that Darigold Farms' solids nonfat tests averaged 8.69 percent for the months of January through July 1992. On a monthly basis, the Darigold tests were from .04 to .19 higher than the M&hyph;W milk solids nonfat content for the same period. Also, page two of Exhibit 10&hyph;B shows that NWI's solids nonfat tests averaged 9.10 percent during January through July 1992. Each of the monthly tests of NWI's milk was more than .5 above the nonfat solids content of the M&hyph;W milk. The average percent solids nonfat tests of producer milk included in the M&hyph;W ``Base Month'' Price Series during January through July 1992 were: January, 8.55; February, 8.52; March, 8.55; April, 8.57; May, 8.56; June, 8.56; and July 8.53. Official notice is taken of page 2 of Dairy Market News, Volume 59, Report 46, dated November 13, 1992, issued by the Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, Dairy Division, P.O. Box 8911, Madison, Wisconsin 53708&hyph;8911. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record does not contain data showing the average solids nonfat content of all producer milk for the Pacific Northwest market. Thus, the comparisons made above are not conclusive. However, if the comparison reflects the actual market situation, the price for a pound of solids nonfat would be higher if the M&hyph;W test is used as a divisor in the proposed formula for calculating the price than if the market average test is used. As a result, the value of Class II and Class III milk in the pool would increase from current levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second related issue that must be kept in mind is that USDA has already conducted a hearing to consider proposed alternatives to the M&hyph;W price as the basic formula price for all the orders. If the Secretary decides to replace the M&hyph;W price with some other factor or factors to establish the basic formula price, a question may arise as to what tests for solids nonfat or protein should then be used. Absent any knowledge at this time as to the outcome of that proceeding, it would seem appropriate to continue to use the tests prescribed in this decision. Later, it may be necessary to consider amending the orders in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NWI's proposal to put a $12.10 per hundredweight floor under the basic formula price is not adopted. The principal purpose of this proposal relates to Class I milk prices. However, Class I milk prices are not an issue in this proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other proposed modifications to the initial proposal on component prices were offered at the hearing. However, none of these modifications should be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

All three were associated with the former government of  Vladimir Meciar, which fell in a no confidence vote earlier this  month. Despite protests from the erstwhile opposition, which is  today's government, Vanko was named to the top NKU post as a  deputy of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).    The vote was preceded by a stormy debate full of accusations  that the NKU was misused under Meciar's government for political  purposes and was "indirectly" run by the government office,  headed by Meciar colleague Ivan Lexa. Others accused the new  government of intending to do basically the same thing.    During the evening, members of the HZDS and its former  coalition partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), demonstrated  in front of the parliament building.</p>

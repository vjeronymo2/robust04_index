			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PARIS TO RESTORE CHAMPS-ELYSEES TO ITS FORMER GLORY  </P> <P> Mayor Jacques Chirac unveiled a plan today to restore the famed Champs-Elysees  to its former glory by widening sidewalks, planting more trees, redesigning  street furniture and preventing the opening of new fast-food restaurants.  </P> <P> "We want to give back to the Champs-Elysees the prestige and pleasure of a  superb promenade," the conservative former prime minister told a news  conference at City Hall.  </P> <P> "Clearly it has been spoiled."  </P> <P> The plan would eliminate parking on the contre-allees, the minor roads on  either side of the main avenue. This would enable the sidewalks to be widened  and covered in granite and a second row of trees to be planted, the mayor said.  </P> <P> A key part of the plan would be to give the avenue a special status as "a zone  of protected architectural and urban heritage" to prevent the construction of  "unsuitable buildings or facades," Chirac said.  </P></p>

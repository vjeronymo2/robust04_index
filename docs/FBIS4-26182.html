			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Society's Priority"] </F>   [Text] A national education conference held in Beijing  from Tuesday through Friday reviewed the initial fruits yielded  by "The Outline of the Reform and Development of China's  Education" in the first year after its publication in February  1993.    China's education system has made tremendous progress since  the birth of the People's Republic, and especially in the last  15 years along with the economic reforms and China's opening to  the outside world.    Top leaders have all repeatedly stressed the importance of  education not only to the country's modernization programme but  also to the future of the socialist State.    At the opening session of the just concluded education  conference, President Jiang Zemin, also the Party's General  Secretary, reaffirmed that hopes for rejuvenation of the nation  lie in education. He urged that the development of education be  truly given top priority.    As a matter of fact, with regard to a developing country  such  as China and against the background of the extremely fast  advances of science and technology around the world, the  importance of education can never be overestimated. "The Outline  of the Reform and Development of China's Education" published by  the Party's Central Committee and the State Council, stipulates  the specific measures and targets for the development of  education for the 1990s and the beginning of the next century.    The outline sets the goal of instituting throughout the  whole  country a system of nine-year compulsory education by the turn  of the century and eliminating illiteracy among young and  middle-aged people by that time. It also formulates plans for  better streamlined and more efficient higher education and calls  for faster expansion of vocational and continuing education.    According to the State Education Commission, primary  education is by and large available to all children in areas  inhabited by 90 per cent of China's population;  lower-intermediate education is available to most children in  major cities and developed areas. The illiteracy rate among the  young and middle-aged has dropped to about 7 per cent compared  with the pre-liberation figure of 80 per cent.    College enrollment in 1993 was 2.63 million, up by 16.1 per  cent from the previous year and a record high so far. For the  first time in history, the enrollment in professional schools at  the upper-intermediate level exceeded that of ordinary  upper-intermediate schools -- an indication of the significant  restructuring of education in China so that it becomes more  rational and better suits the actual needs.    However, the development of education is still plagued with  problems that call for strenuous effort.    Shortage of funds is the No 1 problem. Though the  government, which has little money to spare, has done the best  it can, the outlay on education in 1993 covered just 3 per cent  of the gross national product (GNP), while the average of world  developing countries was 4.1 per cent. The government promises  to raise educational spending to 4 per cent of GNP by the end of  the century. Other sources of funding are being sought, too.    Teachers are still not adequately paid, and many of them are  not decently housed. All this has led to a serious brain drain,  with a concomitant adverse effect on the quality of education.    Then there is the problem of dropouts. Whether under stress  of poverty or because the household needs a helping hand,  dropouts from lower-intermediate and primary schools reached 7.1  per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively last year.    The fact that most of the top officials of the central and  provincial-level governments were present in the just-completed  conference shows that the decision makers are fully aware of the  problems and seeking measures to tackle them effectively.    The successful conference certainly can be expected to boost  China's education, enabling it to better serve the urgent  requirements of the fast-growing economy and the long-term  interest of our nation.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (7): A focus for revival - The textiles industry offers good prospects for jobs The textiles and clothing industry, so often associated with industrial decline in the face of low cost competitors, is emerging as one of the main immediate hopes for a revival of the Nottinghamshire economy. This is partly defensive. Even if employment levels in the industry have been declining for decades, there are, says Howard Jackson, director of the county council's planning and economic development department, '27,000 still employed in clothing and textiles in Notts. We clearly can't afford to see that go down'. The industry's geographical location is also significant. Clothing and textiles are better represented in the coalfield area than in the national economy. But what seemed an industry of limited prospects has received a boost from the establishment of a plant in Mansfield by Toray Textiles Europe and the decision of Johnson Controls to manufacture car seat covers in the town. The task now is to turn these isolated inward investments into the core of growth. Toray's site, in fact, is close to the forthcoming Mansfield enterprise zone and the district council has acquired 60 acres next door, opening up the possibility of a new textiles and clothing manufacturing district. Indeed, the council has started receiving investment enquiries from companies in the sector. In the longer term, growth prospects are likely to depend on a strengthening ability to produce high quality products following the example of Germany in the rebuilding of its clothing industry. The Nottinghamshire International Clothing Centre - developed by the county council but drawing extensively on the services of Nottingham Trent University - will be a focal point for the latest technology, design and practice in the industry. Efforts to regenerate the textiles and clothing industry show the way in which the county is developing its infrastructure in order to extract faster growth. Because the economy cannot rely on inward investment but must depend on companies in business, the quickest way to generate growth is to support them and encourage diversification into more technologically advanced products. Such growth is possible in the Nottinghamshire engineering industry which, with coal mining and textiles, has been a pillar of the traditional county economy. It will remain so despite the long term trend of lower job numbers and competition resulting from the strengthening of the EU's internal market. The loss of the coal mine market has companies chasing new products. It is hoped Toyota's new car plant in Derbyshire will provide a new stimulus. But the speed of growth in the longer term will depend on strengthening the academic-industrial nexus. Although Nottingham University has its Highfield science park, facilities designed to profit from the research capabilities of the universities have not yet been expanded. The universities have been active in research vital to regional industry - Nottingham University's work on composite materials for the automotive industry, for example - and they are becoming increasingly active in applying expertise to immediate economic problems - Nottingham Trent University's work in encouraging technology transfer in the north of the county is an example. But experience elsewhere has shown that the quickest economic diversification is likely to come from the provision of services, in the way that Coventry sought to offset erosion of the manufacturing base by establishing a back office sector during the 1980s. Thus importance is attached to the decision of the Inland Revenue to establish offices in Nottingham which open next year employing 2,000 people. Accountants and bankers in the city of Nottingham see considerable scope to expand the provision of financial services as none of the cities in the East Midlands has a dominant role such as that of Birmingham in the West Midlands. But none of this is of relevance to a redundant miner in a village near Mansfield. In the north of the county, where sympathies often lie closer to Sheffield than Nottingham, Pat Richards, chief executive of the North Nottinghamshire Tec, sees 'an emerging common vision'. This envisages a development project which would draw attention to the area and create jobs, such as Glasgow Hospital and the conference centre in Maastricht, Netherlands. How such a scheme might be funded is unclear. Ideas about the nature of growth are therefore more clear for the medium and long-term than the short term, where corporate health and job prospects remain tightly linked to the movements of the national economy. Hence the concern of agencies such as the Tec and British Coal Enterprise to help companies in the difficult process of emerging from recession and equipping former miners for jobs as they become available. The demand for such a jobs service is clear. The Tec, at what it calls its gateways, received 27,655 visits between October 1993 and last April which resulted in more than 6,200 interviews. The outcome was that 232 people were placed in jobs and a further 260 people were offered training and guidance of different types. British Coal Enterprise said that it had been resettling miners at the rate of 100 a week either in jobs or retraining for a specific post. What it will not undertake is training on a speculative basis.</p>

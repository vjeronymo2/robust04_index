			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Political Week" section] </F>   [Text] A new Islamist organization calling itself the  "Caliphate Group" has recently appeared. The organization,  which espouses the concept of repudiation and accuses all  existing Islamic societies and countries of apostasy, is  operating in tribal territories adjacent to the Pakistani-Afghan  border. It advocates the restoration of the caliphate under the  leadership of the group's chief. The membership of the new  organization comprises Egyptian, Sudanese, Jordanian, and  Algerian nationals. The leader of the group is an Arab  millionaire of Palestinian extraction called Abu-'Uthman. He  considers himself an extension of Shukri Mustafa, leader of the  Repudation and Renunciation group.    Last week the Pakistani authorities asked the group's  leading  members to leave Pakistan.</p>

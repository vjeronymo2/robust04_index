The regulation amends the director compensation regulations to reflect changes to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act) made by the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (1992 Amendments), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and amends the annual report disclosure rules for director reimbursable expenses to address concerns raised by Farm Credit banks regarding the equity and regulatory burden of the existing rule. Additionally, the rule amends the disclosure requirements for senior officer compensation to make the disclosures more informative and useful to shareholders.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pub.

Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA published a proposed rule concerning director and senior officer compensation and reimbursable expense disclosures on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68069). The comment period closed January 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 611.400, concerning bank director compensation, is adopted substantially as proposed with the exception that the cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would consider waiving the statutory limitation on bank director compensation for exceptional circumstances has been increased from 25 to 30 percent. Section 618.8270, regarding the reimbursement of travel, subsistence, and related expenses, has been modified by reducing several of the policy and procedure requirements originally proposed. The final rule retains the requirement that each Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institution develop a written policy regarding the reimbursement of travel, subsistence, and other related expenses to its directors, officers, and employees and provide stockholders with a brief description of the policy. Substantial changes have been made to the proposed senior officer compensation disclosure requirements in &sect;620.5(i)(2). The final rule requires FCS institutions to disclose: (1) Individual compensation information of chief executive officers (CEOs) whose annualized salary and bonus exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI); and (2) aggregate compensation information of all senior officers as a group. Both the CEO and aggregate senior officer compensation information is required to be reported for each of the last 3 fiscal years and presented in a Summary Compensation Table. The final rule retains the requirement that the institutions provide a discussion of compensation plans. Finally, a provision was added to allow associations the option of disclosing senior officer compensation information in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement or the annual report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA received 140 comment letters from the Farm Credit Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership, 7 Farm Credit Banks, 3 Banks for Cooperatives, 122 associations, and 7 shareholders. Commenters expressed strong opposition to the proposed disclosure of individual compensation information for each of the five most highly paid senior officers. The following discussion focuses on the FCA response to commenters' concerns regarding the proposed senior officer disclosures as this was the predominant issue raised in their letters. The section-by-section discussion also addresses other comments received on the proposed rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal recommendations should not be accepted Sir, Your editorial ('The committee and the colliers', January 30) on the the subject of the trade and industry select committee's report on the coal industry has the same reassuring statement about the lack of effect on the natural gas industry which the authors of the report would like the public to believe. The offshore natural gas producers do not share this comfortable view; neither should those employed in the offshore industry or the 300,000 whose onshore jobs support its activities. The committee's recommendations threaten both existing and new gas-fired power plants (CCGTs) and therefore the offshore projects supporting them. The committee recommends reducing gas use on existing projects, ignoring the substantial capital investments already made and the contracts entered into. Future CCGTs and offshore developments are the subject of recommendations to restrict their development, despite the fact that the committee has had to admit that not a single witness challenged the position that gas-fired plants are the cheapest form of new power generation. In our view the committee failed properly to address the consequences for gas arising from its recommendations. Its consideration of the gas side of the energy balance was perfunctory and its conclusions on the subject buried away in several places. There was no attempt at a full and impartial study of the implications for Britain's vigorous offshore industry arising from the overall recommendations. This offshore industry, far from needing expensive long-term subsidies, is itself a significant taxpayer, having contributed over Pounds 115bn since operations began. It is responsible alone for a quarter of all the investment in UK's productive industry. It is time the 55,000 workers whose jobs will be affected if the government adopts these recommendations were given consideration equal to those employed elsewhere in energy production. The government should not accept these recommendations as they stand. Harold W D Hughes, UK Offshore Operators Association, 3 Hans Crescent, London SW1X 0LN</p>

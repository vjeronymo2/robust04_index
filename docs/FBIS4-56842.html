			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles of </F> the Change `94 coalition by an unidentified reporter; place not  given; from the "Telemetro Reports" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] Professor Carles, would you be willing to  participate in the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  government, should you be invited to do so?    [Carles] I have no personal interest in participating in any  government. As president, I would have had the opportunity and  the authority to do the things that we had proposed, and that we  had planned, [words indistinct] I do not believe I could  transfer those goals, that vision, and that determination to any  group. Political problems will have to be resolved in another  manner, not through my individual participation. That is  another issue altogether. We are going to have to unite as  Panamanians to safeguard justice, liberty, and democracy in this  country.    I invite Ruben Blades to stay here in Panama to fight for  Panamanians. This is why Blades said as a candidate that: This  is the time to face problems and to struggle for justice,  freedom, and democracy... [pauses] and for all those other  things that were not very clear in his speeches.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nomura bails out property division NOMURA Securities, the world's largest stockbroker, yesterday joined the list of Japan's financial institutions forced into a costly corporate restructuring by the collapse of property prices. It is bailing out a troubled property lending affiliate - Nomura Finance - by merging it with another offshoot. The move will allow the write-off of Y200bn (Dollars 1.87bn) in bad loans, a cost which the group is to absorb. The demise of Nomura Finance is a further indication of the problems besetting non-bank financial institutions in Japan. It follows a number of similar moves by commercial banks to ease the burden of their non-bank subsidiaries, and could form a precedentfor other brokerage houseswhich are similarly afflicted. The bail-out is the second blow in a week for Nomura - last Thursday, Mr Joseph Perella quit Wasserstein Perella, the Wall Street investment bank he co-founded and into which Nomura sank Dollars 100m for a 20 per cent stake. Nomura Finance, created in 1989 at the height of the property boom, had operating assets of Y1,462bn as of March, but non-performing and other doubtful loans put yesterday at Y330bn. It is being subsumed by Ivy Real Estate, a subsidiary of Nomura Land and Building, a property management unit. Of the bad loans, Y200bn will be written off, financed by Ivy's unrealised profits on landholdings, a capital increase by Ivy, and a Y100bn injection from Nomura Securities over 10 years, for which it will receive mortgage-backed paper. Companies in the Nomura group together own 68.5 per cent of Nomura Finance, although the stockbroker holds only 5 per cent. The stake is thus not consolidated in Nomura Securities' group accounts, and the company insisted yesterday's move would have no direct impact on profits.</p>

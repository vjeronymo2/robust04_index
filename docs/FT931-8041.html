			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / 'Illiteracy' of students alarms Patten FOUR out of ten students entering further education colleges from school need help with literacy and numeracy, according to a survey published yesterday by the the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, an independent body funded by the government. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the findings revealed 'worrying levels of illiteracy'. He said they justified the government's policy of compulsory testing of 14-year-olds, which he confirmed would be extended to the subjects English and technology in England and Wales this summer. In a move designed to divide opposition to the compulsory English tests, Mr Patten announced that the results of the first year's tests would not be published in school league tables. However, national totals will be compiled, allowing parents to compare their children's performance with the national average. Teachers' unions had claimed that the tests, to be taken for the first time in June, had been inadequately prepared and that material for them had arrived at schools too late. The two largest unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, said they would continue balloting members over boycotting the tests. Other teachers' unions welcomed the announcement. Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers described the decision as 'statesmanlike'. He said it was evidence that Mr Patten had heeded fears expressed over the tests in a meeting with teachers' unions earlier this week. Mr Patten also published consultation documents setting out the government's plans for this year's performance tables for schools and colleges. The league tables will cover 4,000 state secondary schools and 19,000 primary schools. For the first time, they will also cover 2,000 independent schools, and 470 sixth-form and further-education colleges. The tables will include national curriculum test results; GCSE, A-level and AS-level examination results; and truancy rates. In a concession to independent schools, schools will be able to include GCSE exam results taken up to three years before the age of 16. Last year, only results in the previous two years could be included, which meant that some schools which entered pupils very early for GCSEs appeared have fewer pupils with five or more passes at grade C and above.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Danes trigger rises AFTER several days of uncertainty about the direction of European interest rates, there was a new mood of optimism yesterday, helped in particular by a cut in Denmark's official interest rates, writes James Blitz. The Danish central bank lowered its discount and key deposit rates to 8.75 per cent from 9.25 per cent with immediate effect. Yesterday's move followed last week's  1/2 percentage point easing in the Bundesbank's discount rate. But it was the first discount and deposit rates cut since the central bank raised both instruments by 1.5 percentage points to defend the krona in the turmoil that preceded the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism bands in August. The move helped French franc interest rate futures to rise, even though the Bank of France again left its official interest rates unchanged at its regular Thursday intervention. The December French franc contract added 6 basis points to close at 93.76. In Germany, Euromark futures were also a little stronger as dealers took the view that sell-offs earlier this week had been a little over-done. Comments from Mr Wilhelm Noelling, a former Bundesbank council member, that the discount rate would be at 4 per cent by the end of the year helped sentiment. So, too, did a rather dovish Bundesbank monthly report. The Bundesbank drew attention to improving trends in M3 money supply from October onwards. While calling for fiscal consolidation, it acknowledged that first half deficits had gone according to plan; and it also admonished France and Denmark for having cut their interest rates too timidly. The December contract was up 3 basis points at a close of 93.95 and the March 1994 contract gained 4 basis points, ending at 94.46. Sterling interest rate futures also rebounded after the heavy downturn of recent days. But the second consecutive monthly rise in UK unemployment also helped to turn sentiment in the market. The December short sterling contract moved up 8 basis points to close at 94.28 and the March 1994 contract climbed 10 basis points to finish at 94.39. Events in the sterling cash market were less eventful. Three-month interest rates again closed at 5 31/32 per cent. There was an Pounds 800m shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of trading, which was only removed through late assistance - but the overnight rate hovered at 6 per cent for most of the day.</p>

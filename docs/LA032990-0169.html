			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC SCHOOL;  </P> <P> THIS MIGHT BE THE TICKET, NO JOKING  </P> <P> Choosing which traffic school to attend in Ventura County could drive you  crazy.  </P> <P> Scenario: You're a Ventura County resident minding your own business, doing  nothing more than 75 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone, and they give you a traffic  citation within the county. Fortunately, this is your first offense in a long  time and you are eligible to attend traffic school to keep those insurance  premiums down.  </P> <P> Aren't you lucky! There are about 55 classrooms being operated by 17  DMV-approved traffic violator schools in Ventura County. Fees vary from $18.99  to $30, with day, evening and weekend sessions available. And what a variety of  classes to choose from. There are the three community colleges, May Co.,  Comediane Plus-Learn From Us, California Traffic Schools, Lunch N Learn at Fine  Restaurants, Cheap School, and Tri-County Traffic School, among others.  </P> <P> The truth is, if you live in and were ticketed in Ventura County, there won't  be any jugglers, hay rides, comedians or gourmet lunches in your future. With  rare exceptions, all eligible violators opting for classes must attend  Tri-County Traffic School.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Ventura County residents ticketed outside the county may  attend any state-licensed traffic school in California. Non-residents of the  county have the same option, regardless of where in California the citation was  received.  </P> <P> Avoid problems. Read the explanation on your ticket or that courtesy notice  that is generally mailed by the court. If you attend the wrong school, the  court will not accept the certificate.  </P> <P> And remember, a driver's insurance rates are usually increased if the fine is  paid without traffic school, but that doesn't mean that completion of traffic  school wipes the offending ticket off your record. It goes as an 'explained  citation,' on their record," said Melody Jorgenson, office manager of  Tri-County Traffic School.  </P> <P> Tri-County is the only nonprofit, as well as the first and oldest traffic  school in Ventura County. Originally named the "Conejo Valley Traffic Survival  School," it was established in 1974 in Thousand Oaks by the Jaycees as a  community service. The school is operated by paid coordinator Lt. Arnie  Schwartz of Los Angeles CHP, and five volunteer board members. According to  Sheila Gonzalez, supervisor of courts administrations at Ventura County  Municipal Court, after meeting expenses, Tri-Valley puts money back into the  community for driver's education and traffic safety programs.  </P> <P> Tri-County has six locations in Ventura, Simi Valley, Westlake Village, and the  main office in Thousand Oaks, which serve approximately 32,000 students  annually.  </P> <P> Although in recent years the names and delivery style of schools have evolved,  all operators and instructors must pass tests and be licensed by the DMV. Most  instructors are associated with law enforcement or teaching, but a few are  professional comedians.  </P> <P> Lewis Reck, an instructor in Santa Monica who served 28 years with the Los  Angeles Police Department, says that almost any person could be "coached" to  pass the comprehensive instructor's test, but an instructor needs experience in  law enforcement to know traffic and the vehicle code. Reck says that humor in  teaching is important but so is a knowledge of the law.  </P> <P> According to Bill Gengler, spokesman for the DMV in Sacramento, a policy shift  initiated by judges and public alike will soon require that approved traffic  schools be listed by their state license numbers instead of their names. This  practice is meant to eliminate advertising while it emphasizes the serious  purpose of traffic school.  </P> <P> For information on traffic court eligibility, call Ventura County Municipal  Court-Traffic Division, Ventura office: 654-2611, between 9:30 a.m. and 11:30  a.m. or 1:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.; Simi Valley branch: 584-4802 Ext. 4800.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEARNING THE RULES OF THE ROAD  </P> <P> Here are some traffic schools to choose from, but remember, you may not be  eligible for all of them.

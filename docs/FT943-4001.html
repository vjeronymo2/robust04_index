			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Trading in BPA shares to reopen Shares in Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second largest bank, are to be readmitted to trading on the Lisbon stock exchange on Monday after a month's suspension following the announcement of a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, a smaller rival. The securities exchange commission (CMVM) suspended the shares on August 10 after BCP's Es132bn (Dollars 39.04bn) offer for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA. BPA shares were last quoted at Es2,650, a gain of 31.8 per cent from July 26 when BCP bid Es3,000 a share. The CMVM said BCP could buy 1.65m shares, 1.5 per cent of BPA capital, at the offer price. But BCP will be allowed to purchase these shares only if the government authorises the offer. A decision is expected on Tuesday.</p>

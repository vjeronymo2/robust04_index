			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Stake in German insurer increased Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second largest insurance group, is to take its holding in Volksfursorge, a Hamburg-based insurer, from just under 50 per cent to 75 per cent. It is buying a stake of 25 per cent plus one share from BGAG, a Frankfurt-based trade union-owned holding company. No price was announced but Volksfursorge has a market capitalisation of DM2.6bn (Dollars 4.17bn) so the deal is likely to be worth well in excess of DM600m.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Cost liability urged for quango members A call for quango board members to be made personally liable for costs if they act in unlawful ways which have a financial effect on their agency, was made yesterday. Local government leaders from the West Midlands said quango board members should be liable in the same way as local councillors. Mr Brian Clack, leader of Coventry City Council, pointed out that quangos spend Pounds 50bn of public money a year. He said: 'We should know much more about how this money is spent and how we, as elected members, can call to account these local quangos.' He and other West Midlands metropolitan authority leaders yesterday published a 10-point code of good practice which they urged the government to have adopted by quangos, the agencies appointed and often financed by Whitehall. The code, based on a University of Central England study of practice among quangos in the West Midlands, was published at the annual conference of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in Newcastle upon Tyne. The council leaders want the ombudsman system to cover quangos. They also want quangos to conduct their financial affairs in line with the principles the Audit Commission applies to local government. The proposed charter suggests quangos should make a commitment to open meetings of their boards, adopt a complaints procedure, publish a list of board members' pecuniary interests and appoint a monitoring officer to ensure compliance with the law.

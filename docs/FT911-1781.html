			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Management: Inadequate today, disastrous tomorrow - Organisational structures Since Peter Drucker let fly three years ago with a much-quoted article on The Coming of the New Organisation, managers have been subjected to a growing barrage of warnings from gurus and consultants that their organisations will have to change character dramatically if they are to survive far beyond the turn of the century. At present, the argument runs, most organisations respond ineffectively to today's competitive pressures because they are too hierarchical, too costly, too slow to adapt, too unresponsive to customers, too demotivating to employees, and altogether too limited in creativity and initiative. What is merely inadequate today will become downright disastrous tomorrow. To Drucker, Tom Peters, Charles Handy, and others, the ideal organisations of the near future will be flat, flexible, and 'knowledge-based' - peopled heavily by skilled professionals, in the widest sense. Hence their citation of unlikely-looking models: Drucker favours orchestras and hospitals (presumably the American, rather than the British variety), while Peters and Handy tend to go for fast-moving TV stations such as CNN, together with a handful of well-run management consultancies and other professional service firms. To people who work in them, such organisations may seem chaotic, but many do achieve their corporate objectives very effectively. Though a growing body of managers in all sorts of com panies and industries does perceive the need for change, many executives find such examples either daunting or unconvincing. So they will take heart from the claim that they can, after all, discover the organisation of the future closer to home: in the factories and financial operations departments of apparently conventional organisations. Writing in the latest issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, Steve Dichter, the leader of the consultancy's organisation performance practice, argues that radically new organisational principles are needed now. He cites as a model a US General Electric factory making electrical circuit breakers which now has only three levels of employee: 'associate' (shop floor), advisor, and plant manager. The 'associates' are organised into self-managing teams which perform traditional staff functions, such as planning, capital investment requests, and recruitment. Elected facilitators lead problem-solving teams, and cross-functional committees of 'associates' meet weekly to deal with policy issues. Instant plant performance data is available. Since the early 1980s, over 400 units across a wide range of industries in the US have been converted to this sort of approach; and the approach has started to appear in Europe, reports Dichter. Drawing on these examples, he promulgates a common set of characteristics for what he calls, 'the organisation of the 1990s'. More akin to some of the basic tenets of total quality management than he admits, they all contradict sharply the 'command control' principles which have dominated western corporate organisation since the early 1900s. Hierarchy To managers worried that such characteristics will not only undermine their control, but diminish individual accountability and remove all hierarchy, Dichter has a message designed to reassure: that a new, more effective type of 'committed' control is created; that team and individual accountability are enhanced; and that 'hierarchy remains as a very important dimension of every organisation . . . they will continue to have a series of management layers'. The nine actions which Dichter says should be taken in order to create such organisations are rather pedestrian compared with much of the other available literature on the management of change. More questionable, however, is whether, as Dichter claims, his ideal organisation fully matches up to his criteria of being 'borderless, networked, inverted, empowered, and non-hierarchical'. If not, then the well-managed 'professional service' organisation may be a more sustainable, if less comfortable, model after all.</p>

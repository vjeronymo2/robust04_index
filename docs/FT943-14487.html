			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Book Review: Jacques the lad, Jacques the leader DELORS: Inside the House that Jacques Built By Charles Grant Nicholas Brealey, Pounds 12.99, 310 pages Last week Jacques Delors admitted on French television that he was rather flattered by all the fuss surrounding the choice of his successor as president of the European Commission. As well he might be. Last month the UK government paid him the tribute of declaring that so important had Delors made the presidency of the European Union's executive that it was ready to risk a serious row with its European Union partners over who should fill his shoes. And it is a British journalist who has paid him the compliment of writing the first serious book about him. Some skimpy tomes about Delors have appeared in France, but none is the Compleat Delors that Charles Grant has produced. It is, of course, Delors' decade in Brussels which has made him famous, and on which Grant, as former Brussels correspondent for The Economist, might have been expected to focus most. But Grant has also delved meticulously into Delors' French upbringing and political career, and served up a mixture of personal juice and intellectual fibre that makes for a most satisfying meal. What most intrigues Grant, and Delors' friends and enemies, are the man's contradictions. 'He is a socialist trade unionist who once worked for a Gaullist prime minister and who describes himself as a closet Christian Democrat. He is a practising Roman Catholic who takes moral stances and claims not to be ambitious; yet he is a crafty political tactician who enjoys power and has held the Commission in an iron grip. He is a patriotic Frenchman with a vision of a unified Europe.' Thus, one face of 'Janus' Delors is modesty - he was the only socialist minister in the early 1980s to live in a working-class part of Paris, and as Commission president he sometimes takes meals with his chauffeur and bodyguard. His other visage is that of the haughty Eurocrat, telling national governments in 1988 that 'in 10 years' time 80 per cent of their economic legislation will come from the EC', or telling French opponents of Maastricht in 1992 to 'get out of politics'. Such careless outbursts contrast with Delors' careful approach to important European negotiations. Most of Delors' main achievements are well known - keeping France, when he was its finance minister, within the European Monetary System; playing a leading role in pushing through the 1986 Single European Act and increased use of majority voting that paved the way for Lord Cockfield's single market programme; and the launching of the move towards economic and monetary union (Emu). Grant is very revealing about the way that Delors has always paid court to Germany in general and to Chancellor Kohl in particular, though one German, Karl-Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, now regrets he sat on the Delors' committee whose 1989 report paved the way for Emu. 'If I had boycotted (the committee), I could not have stopped the process, but I might have slowed it down,' Pohl has since told Grant. But this book also recalls two other achievements. One is how Delors, by pushing through his EU budget packages of 1988 and 1992, has spared the Union, up until 1999, the mind-numbing arguments over money that prevailed before 1988. The second is the European Economic Area (EEA). Delors' aim in proposing this extension of the single market was to discourage a rush of members from the European Free Trade Association applying to join the EU as full members; he did not succeed. But should the Nordic countries fail this year to get their peoples to approve EU membership, they will at least have the EEA to fall back on. On the minus side, Grant records Delors' disappointment in not getting the EU to adopt his 'Euro-Colbertist' schemes for more R&amp;D spending, and contrasts that failure with the success, largely unwelcome to Delors, of the tougher EU competition policy that Sir Leon Brittan and Peter Sutherland imposed. For the most part, however, Delors and his 'mafia' got their way in Brussels, frequently riding rough-shod over others. Grant finds major fault here. 'By the end of his reign, Delors' personal system of command and control had begun to damage the Commission's internal organisation, sap the enthusiasm of its officials and contribute to the tarnishing of its image.' If that sounds a bit like Mrs Thatcher's eventual impact on her own government, Grant intends it to be so. For, in a comparison neither would appreciate, he likens Delors to Thatcher in his 'attention to ideas and implementation, to ideology and to detail, to principle and power'. How does Europe stand after Delors? Grant, perhaps wisely, offers few predictions, except to say that Delorism/federalism will live on to do battle with Thatcherism/Gaullism in the EU's 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty. He provides more clues about Delors' own future. Delors' wife, Marie, apparently does not want him to run for president of France, while Delors seems to believe his daughter, Martine, a former socialist minister, has a better chance of entering the Elysee one day than he has. But the vacuum created in the Socialist party by Michel Rocard's abrupt ousting could yet suck him into France's presidential election campaign. So will Delors chance his hand for another kind of presidency? Grant records Delors' ambivalence about elected politics, and the attitude of the one man who might prevail on him to run - Francois Mitterrand. In the words of an Elysee aide, Mitterrand 'has a Darwinian view of the world: people must cope on their own and take their chances. He won't arrange Delors' political career for him. Delors has always been appointed to jobs, but the one job you're not appointed to is the presidency. Mitterrand is not going to send for him with four horses and a chariot'.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT SO GREAT SWIMMER BETTER THAN MOST  </P> <P> The rap against UCLA's Craig Oppel is that he is good. Very good.  </P> <P> But not great.  </P> <P> Sure, he won a gold medal in swimming at the Seoul Olympics. But he won it as  an alternate on the U.S. 800-meter freestyle relay team and did not swim in the  finals.  </P> <P> And at last year's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship meet, he  scored 27 points, yet failed to win an individual event for the third  consecutive year.  </P> <P> That may be so, but Oppel, a psychology major, rationalizes that not many  people have been where he's been. The NCAA championship next month figures to  be his last competitive meet and then he plans to attend law school in the  fall. Swimming has been good to him, he says, but it's time to move on.  </P> <P> "Few people have finished second, and even fewer have won. I wanted to win, but  it just didn't happen," said Oppel, donned in an Olympic jacket and gold ring.  "Right now it (not winning an NCAA title) bothers me, but hopefully I can  rectify that this year.  </P> <P> "I'll look back on swimming very favorably. I have a lot of fond memories. I've  traveled all around the world free. As far as swimming goes, getting to be part  of the U.S. team and the UCLA team. Getting to meet great people. The list goes  on and on."  </P> <P> When Oppel arrived at UCLA he emphasized four goals:  </P> <P> * To win an individual and a team NCAA title.  </P> <P> * To win a title at a U.S. national meet.  </P> <P> * To win a world title.  </P> <P> * To win an Olympic gold medal.  </P> <P> Now into his senior season, Oppel has accomplished three of those goals. In  1986 he swam the butterfly leg of the winning 400-meter medley relay at the  World Championships in Madrid. In 1987 he won a national title at the Long  Course Nationals in the 200-meter freestyle, and then came the gold medal in  Seoul this summer.  </P> <P> "Coming out of high school (Valley High in Des Moines, Iowa) I had seen  numerous people with 'potential,' the kiss of death," Oppel said. "I didn't  want to be one of those people who had potential and didn't foster it."  </P> <P> But the one goal eluding him would appear to be easiest: the NCAA title. Last  year he swam a season-best 1:35.08 in the 200-yard freestyle final but placed  second to Doug Gjertsen of the University of Texas.  </P> <P> At practice, Oppel does not need to convey his desire to win an NCAA title this  season.  </P> <P> "Everyone understands that I want it this time," he said.  </P> <P> Said UCLA Coach Ron Ballatore: "He was a quiet leader the first three years,  but this year you hear more than ever before. He feels like he's more part of  the team than he's been before."  </P> <P> Oppel's return to the UCLA team this season resembles the experience of another  former Bruin swimmer, Brian Goodell, Ballatore said. Goodell won two gold  medals at the 1976 Montreal Games in world record times while still in high  school. When Goodell came to UCLA, people wondered what he would do for an  encore.  </P> <P> "I was concerned about Craig in the fall," Ballatore said. "But he's very loyal  to the program. He felt that he really wanted to finish this season. He has  things left that he hasn't accomplished."  </P> <P> Even though he finished fifth at the Olympic trials in Indianapolis, Oppel felt  that he had a chance to swim in the finals in Seoul. It looked as if he would  after he swam on the team that finished first in its qualifying heat.  </P> <P> Relay teams, however, are not set until the day of the final, and that morning  he swam what he calls one of his two bad meets in the last four years.  </P> <P> "I felt that he had a good chance to swim in the finals. He swam the fastest  200 meters in the world the year before," said Ballatore, who was Oppel's guest  coach in Seoul. "He just didn't swim a good leg. That's about all I can say."  </P> <P> Said Oppel: "In this sport, you have your ups and downs and that was one of my  downs. . . . You're dealing with a sport measured in hundredths of seconds.  Medals are decided in less time than it takes to blink an eye."  </P> <P> The perception that the Olympics serve as a gathering place to interact with  athletes from around the world did not hold true for Oppel. The majority of  Oppel's spare time in Seoul was spent with the 10 past or present Bruins  swimmers there.  </P> <P> One thing Oppel did want to do was exchange uniforms with athletes from  Iceland, where he was born, but they left before closing ceremonies before  Oppel could negotiate the trade.  </P> <P> "The only experience you have with foreigners are people you know through  swimming in international meets," Oppel said. "As far as athletes from other  nations and other sports, each had their own niche. You might play Ping-Pong  against a German weight lifter or snooker against a Russian gymnast."  </P> <P> Nearing the end of his swimming career does not seem to bother Oppel. When he  is recognized on campus as the Olympic swimmer, he squirms.  </P> <P> His gold medal from Seoul lies on his desk at home -- under a pile of books.  </P> <P> "When I'm at the pool I'm an intense competitor," he said, "but I really just  want to be another person when I'm away from the pool."  </P></p>

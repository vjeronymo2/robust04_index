			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBIE, DOLPHIN FRANCHISE BUILDER, DIES AT 73  </P> <P> Miami Dolphin owner Joe Robbie, who two years ago moved the NFL team to his own  privately financed stadium, died Sunday at age 73, Coach Don Shula said.  </P> <P> Robbie, who had reportedly been ill in recent months, died at an undisclosed  Miami-area hospital.  </P> <P> "I was aware he was seriously ill, but I only found out about this a half hour  ago, and it's still a shock," Shula said.  </P> <P> There was no immediate information on the cause or exact time of his death.  </P> <P> Robbie is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and 11 children, three of which work  for the Dolphins. Late last year, he announced the establishment of a living  trust for the franchise that he said ensured family ownership for at least the  next generation.  </P> <P> Robbie was a successful trial lawyer when he got involved in the sport in  August 1965 at age 49 with a franchise in the American Football League.  </P> <P> In 1970, Robbie hired Shula as coach. In his first season, Shula improved the  Dolphin record from 3-10-1 in 1969 to 10-4. Two years later, the team compiled  a 17-0 record -- still the best in league history -- to give Miami its first  NFL championship.  </P> <P> The Dolphins repeated as NFL champion in 1973 and have won five AFC titles and  have pro football's best record since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Dolphins moved their home games from the half-century-old Orange  Bowl to $115 million Joe Robbie Stadium. Super Bowl XXIII was played there last  Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Robbie put up all his possessions -- including the Dolphins franchise -- as  collateral to assure completion of construction.  </P> <P> Robbie was born July 7, 1916, in Sisseton, S.D. He attended Northern State  Teachers College in Aberdeen and the University of South Dakota Law School.  </P> <P> Robbie, a Democrat, served in the South Dakota Legislature. He ran  unsuccessfully for governor in South Dakota and for a U.S. House seat in  Minnesota.  </P></p>

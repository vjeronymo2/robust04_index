The Archivist of the United States is required by law to issue these regulations, and may amend them from time to time. The proposed regulatory amendments would clarify various terms that appear in 36 CFR part 1275; clarify the nature of the archival processing being conducted on the Nixon Presidential materials; and provide for the reproduction of the Nixon White House tape recordings. The proposed amendments to 36 CFR part 1275 would affect former President Nixon and other individuals whose names appear in the materials, as well as members of the general public interested in conducting research regarding those materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments must be received by close of business May 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments must be submitted in writing to the Policy and Program Analysis Division (NAA), National Archives and Records Administration, The National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740&hyph;6001. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mary Ann Hadyka or Nancy Allard at (301) 713&hyph;6730. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The current regulations were required to be promulgated because the previous regulations were ruled invalid by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Allen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Carmen,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 578 F. Supp. 951 (D.D.C. 1983); the case held that the previous regulations were tainted by the legislative veto provision of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (``PRMPA''), 44 U.S.C. 2111 note (1974). The current regulations were published on February 28, 1986, 51 FR 7228, and became effective on June 26, 1986. On April 12, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the District Court's approval of the regulations promulgated by the Archivist on June 26, 1986.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Public Citizen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Burke,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 843 F.2d 1473 (D.C.

Nixon Presidential historical material falling into several categories has been released since 1986. One category consists of selected subject categories and Staff Member and Office Files from the Nixon White House Central Files, which has been released (subject to the withholding of restricted material) in relatively small portions over time. Most of this material from the White House Central Files documents the President's constitutional and statutory duties, and the release of that material has been largely uneventful. 51 FR 32700 (Sept. 15, 1986), 53 FR 1870 (Jan. 22, 1988), 53 FR 40976 and 41441 (Oct. 19, 1988), 54 FR 24054 (June 5, 1989), 54 FR 43878 (Oct. 27, 1989), 56 FR 30774 (July 5, 1991), 57 FR 417 (Jan. 6, 1992), 57 FR 23602 (June 4, 1992), 58 FR 17433 (April 2, 1993), and 58 FR 31548 (June 3, 1993). In addition, the National Archives and Records Administration has released the Nixon White House Photo Collection, 44 FR 57221 (Oct. 4, 1979); Nixon White House Communications Agency Audio and Video Files, 51 FR 26782 (July 25, 1986); Nixon White House selected audiovisual materials, 53 FR 40976 (October 19, 1988); and Nixon Presidential historical materials relating to POW/MIA matters, 58 FR 52121 (Oct. 6, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1987, a large series of materials known as the White House Special Files was released. 52 FR 3068 (Jan. 30, 1987). That file consists of many thousands of pages of sensitive documents, a high percentage of which document abuses of power. In addition to the withholding of material that the National Archives and Records Administration determined to be subject to restriction under the current regulations, the National Archives and Records Administration withheld material from the White House Special Files which it deemed releasable, but which former President Nixon claimed was subject to restriction or that was private or personal and therefore returnable. These contested documents are currently undergoing further review by the Presidential Materials Review Board in accordance with the provisions of the current PRMPA regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

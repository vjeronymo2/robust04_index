			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: DFC beats debt deadline DFC New Zealand, the investment bank that sent shock waves through the New Zealand economy when it collapsed in 1989, has largely repaid its tier-one debt, three years ahead of schedule, Reuter reports from Wellington. Creditors with tier-one notes and loans are to be repaid in full three years earlier than expected, the final NZDollars 235 (Dollars 129m) payment taking place on April 15, according to Mr Sandy Maier, DFC's statutory manager Sandy Maier. The payment would bring to about NZDollars 1bn the amount DFC has paid to tier one creditors over the last year. A large part of DFC's debt, which was estimated at about NZDollars 2.2bn at the time of its failure, is held by Japanese creditors. Mr Maier said the risk that DFC might default on any of its scheduled repayments had now been removed. The government's participation in the DFC restructuring and repayment plan had included various currency swap transactions needed to hedge DFC's currency exposure relating to US dollar and yen obligations under its tier-one debt. These swaps would now be sold or cancelled.</p>

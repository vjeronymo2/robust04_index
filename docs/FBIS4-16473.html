			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "A Big Gap </F> Has Been Found in the Constitution. Through It, the Duma Can  Contest the President's Exclusive Powers To Pursue Domestic and  Foreign Policy"]    [Text] Yesterday the State Duma Council received two draft  laws initiated by the Agrarian Party faction, namely by the  Duma's Legislation Committee Chairman Vladimir Isakov. The laws  have long titles: The former, On Suspending Participation by  the Russian Federation in Enforcing International Sanctions  Imposed Against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia; and the  second, On Compulsory Ratification of the Act of Accession to  the Partnership for Peace Program. Mr. Isakov first announced  the existence of these documents at the Duma's 13 April session,  which discussed the chamber's statement on the bombing of Bosnia.    Vladimir Isakov told the deputies at the time that their  motives for issuing statements only because the Constitution  refers the definition of the main aspects of foreign policy  exclusively to the president's jurisdiction are erroneous  because Article 3 of the Constitution says this is done in  accordance with federal laws. Isakov called on his colleagues to  adopt such laws.    The first draft law provides for Russia's suspending its  participation in sanctions against the Union Republic of  Yugoslavia in view of their one-sided application, recommending  to the government to restore all relations with Serbia and  Montenegro. The title of the second bill speaks for itself and  furthermore establishes that prior to ratification of Russia's  accession to Partnership for Peace it does not impose any  obligations on Russia. Therefore Vladimir Isakov, who reads the  constitution carefully, unlike those who drafted it in their  time, has scored a first success by finding a loophole which, if  need be, can be enlarged. He does not, however, regard the  corresponding article in the Constitution as a hole because,  according to him, "it is big enough for even a truck to pass  through."    The fact is that the main domestic policy lines formulated  by  the president are also pursued in accordance with federal laws.  To be sure, laws adopted by the Duma may be vetoed by both the  Federation Council and the president but if there is really a  strong desire, two-thirds of the votes can always be secured to  override this veto. To a very large extent this applies to the  Partnership for Peace ratification bill: An overwhelming  majority of the Duma factions are demanding that an act on  accession to this program be submitted for approval.</p>

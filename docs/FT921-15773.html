			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Tough EC line raises new fears for Gatt Round THE European Community yesterday appeared to be hardening its position on the farm subsidies row, threatening to sink the Uruguay Round world trade talks, as EC-US bilateral talks failed to resolve the impasse. The EC has reiterated to the US that there can be no agreement on farm trade within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) talks unless the direct payments to farmers for the Community's planned subsidy cuts are put in the Gatt 'green box'. This is for subventions allowable under Gatt rules because they do not distort trade, and would allow Brussels to make the deep cuts in its farm price support system through which it could meet the Uruguay Round targets for dismantling subsidies. When the US and EC failed to agree on farm subsidies just before Christmas, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, surprised Brussels by writing into the 'final act' of the Uruguay Round that the EC's compensation payments would not qualify for the 'green box'. 'It is now in the hands of Dunkel to redraft the proposal. Nothing can happen bilaterally (with the US) until he moves,' a Commission official said yesterday. The Commission insists that the payments, which like any subsidy cannot be 'totally decoupled' from production as Gatt insists, are nevertheless designed to restrain both production and subsidised exports. 'The Dunkel paper was therefore asking us to crucify our farmers for absolutely no benefit at all to the world market for farm produce,' an official stressed. On December 23, the Twelve told Mr Dunkel his proposal was 'not acceptable and therefore has to be modified'. Foreign, trade and agriculture ministers of the Twelve meet on Friday and Saturday to agree a formal position before the 108 countries involved in the Uruguay Round respond to the Dunkel proposals on Monday in Geneva. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, on Monday told Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, that the EC 'position was likely to strengthen rather than weaken,' a Commission official said. Senior officials say that the Gatt impasse could jeopardise political progress in persuading the Twelve to reform radically the Common Agricultural Policy, the engine for escalating farm subsidies. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, was yesterday meeting Mrs Carla Hills, US special trade representative, in Washington, in a further attempt to generate movement on the trade talks.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Democracy where no one ever argues: Indonesia's president will be re-elected unanimously today INDONESIA'S President Suharto is likely to get unanimous support from the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) today when it elects him into a sixth term of office. The lack of opposition is part of Indonesia's 'consensus' democracy, say ministers. But government critics believe it signals trouble for when Mr Suharto, now 71, finally relinquishes power. The assembly meets for 11 days every five years to ratify the government's programme and vote for the president. Its five factions - the ruling Golkar party, two opposition parties, military representatives and provincial leaders - have always concurred on all economic and political issues. Even demands by the small nationalistic, pro-Christian Indonesian Democratic party for an electoral process less favourable to the ruling party were withdrawn to avoid a vote, an act which 'shows a maturity of democracy in our country,' says energy minister Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita. Investors in the Jakarta stock market have welcomed the prospect of five more years of Mr Suharto. After a depressed second half of 1992, the composite index has risen 13 per cent this year. Brokers say foreign buying has increased ahead of the election. Golkar dominated last year's general election for 400 of the 500 seats of the lower parliament. Representatives of the armed forces, which have a political role enshrined in the constitution, fill the remaining 100 places. The 1,000-member assembly consists of the lower parliament and 500 members appointed by the government. Golkar has formed the government since 1971, the first election following Mr Suharto's assumption of power in 1965. Political analysts worry that this monopoly on power is storing up problems for the future. Mr Cornelius Lay, a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, believes long exclusion of opposition parties from power may produce radicalism as they become disenchanted with the political process. Mr Suharto, however, a former major-general, is unlikely to relax his grip. Last week he criticised liberal democracy as failing to sustain development. He reaffirmed the military as 'an inseparable part of our democracy'. He is bolstered by a track record of economic growth averaging 6 per cent a year over the last two decades. The proportion of the population living in absolute poverty has fallen from 60 per cent in 1970 to under 15 per cent. Annual per capita income has risen from Dollars 70 in the mid-1960s to over Dollars 600 (Pounds 422) now. Mr Suharto can also point to an influx of foreign investment worth Dollars 34bn over the last five years. Non-oil exports, driven by an increase in manufacturing investment, have risen from Dollars 8.5bn in 1987 to an estimated Dollars 21bn last year and are growing at 20 per cent a year. However, some businessmen are concerned that Mr Suharto's next cabinet, to be announced within two weeks, will reverse the trend toward economic deregulation, where the government has liberalised the banking sector in particular, and return to a policy of state intervention. The government is already providing substantial funds for a state-owned high-technology sector involved in aircraft, shipbuilding and munitions manufacturing. Donor agencies complain that what the government calls deregulation has to date often entailed transferring state monopolies to favoured private companies, while the system of competitive tender is often disregarded by the government when awarding contracts. On balance, however, donors and businessmen are hopeful for continued economic growth and, with the military playing a central role, a peaceful transfer of power from Mr Suharto. As one business executive explains, possibly the most delicate task is to complete the smooth transition from the old generation military leaders (who fought for independence) to the new generation. There is still, however, no apparent successor to Mr Suharto. General Try Sutrisno, the sole vice-presidential candidate and former aide to Mr Suharto, is regarded by many officials as lacking charisma. Senior diplomats believe General Wismoyo Arismunandar, deputy chief of army staff and Mr Suharto's brother-in-law, is being groomed for the job. His appointment, however, would antagonise government and military officials keen to prevent the Suharto family, already powerful in business, becoming a ruling dynasty. What is apparent, say the government's critics, is that Indonesia's 185m people will have little involvement in choosing the next leader. And the three separatist movements in Aceh, Irian Jaya and East Timor are a reminder that political stability is not assured. Without Mr Suharto and the depth of authority he commands, Indonesia's 'consensus' democracy may begin to crack.</p>

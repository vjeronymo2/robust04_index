			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Calabro: "Silvio and the Nested Chinese </F> Boxes"]    [Text] Milan--Controversy in Fininvest. Doubts  expressed regarding Fininvest's property.    AVVENIRE calls the 45 percent share of the company a  "mystery," and Berlusconi's people threaten to sue.    Who owns Fininvest? Why, Silvio Berlusconi, right? To get to  Berlusconi, however, you have to pass through a filter of 22  companies--Holding Italiana One, then Two, Three, and so on, in  boring progression, all the way to Holding Italiana Twenty-two.  Some of these companies, which in business and financial jargon  are called "empty boxes," are in the hands of two trustees:  Servizio Italia of BNL [National Bank of Labor] and Parmafid of  Milan. A study of this tight, complicated network of holdings  reveals that only 50.35 percent of Fininvest is held "directly"  by Berlusconi, while the rest is managed as a trust by Servizio  Italia (exactly 45.8 percent) and by Parmafid. The figures were  supplied in an investigative report published yesterday by the  Catholic daily, AVVENIRE, which is full of new information (we  have known about the 22 boxes for some time, but the exact  figures on the shares held by the trustees had never been made  public). Why do they need to play this game of Chinese boxes?  AVVENIRE spoke of "mysteries" and of "a troublesome atmosphere  of ambiguity and embarrassing cunning surrounding Fininvest."  And although it does not want "to join the ranks of those who  suspect the existence of a mysterious secret partner behind  Berlusconi's success," the daily does reveal how the "empty  boxes" serve to provide the companies with substantial tax  advantages and are a "perfect system for avoiding taxes."    Berlusconi's people did not like this report one bit. In a  letter sent by Fininvest Communications to the AVVENIRE  publisher, they maintained that "100 percent of the Group's  ownership is directly or indirectly in the hands of the  Berlusconi family"; reminded him that authorities and the  financial world have known for more than a decade about how  Fininvest's capital stock was structured"; insisted that the  trusteeships are a "perfectly legitimate" instrument"; affirmed  that "documents and disclosures had been provided to CONSOB  [Commission for the Supervision of Companies and Stock  Exchanges], their backers, and the Revenue Guards; and, lastly,  stated that the investigation "did not discover anything new or  wrong." Therefore, it was a "deliberate contribution to the  press's attempt to misinform and denigrate Silvio Berlusconi for  obvious political ends." That was the letter. But Fininvest also  let it be known that they are evaluating possible "legal  actions" against those who want to "use" the story of the 22  companies to make insinuations about "secret partners."    So, there will be no lack of controversy, which is likely to  be centered mostly around the issues of taxation. Although the  game of trading off the earnings and losses of various companies  is routinely used by businesses to avoid paying excessive taxes  on earnings and although "avoiding" taxes is legitimate (using  all the legal tax loopholes is called "avoiding taxes"), it  becomes a different story when the entrepreneur--in this case,  Berlusconi--enters politics and wages one of his first campaigns  against "high taxes."    But let us take a closer look at the story of the trustees.  Last December, Mediobanca, which organizes the shareholding  structures and the budget statements of the leading Italian  companies, reported that "the entire capital stock of Fininvest  is directly or indirectly in the hands of Silvio Berlusconi."  Armed with Mediobanca's judgment, the people at Fininvest are  insisting that "everything is clear, everything belongs to the  Doctor (as Berlusconi is deferentially referred to at  headquarters in Arcore). The network of holdings, however, is  intricate. "It was set up 15 years ago and sooner or later we  may change it, but enough of these suspicions. There is nothing  mysterious here," explodes Fedele Confalonieri who will become  the chairman of Fininvest if and when Berlusconi decides to  enter politics directly.    So let us go back 15 years, to June 1978, when two tax  accountants, Armando Minna and Nicla [as published] Crocitto,  set up the 22 holding companies for Silvio Berlusconi with a  sole director, Luigi Foscale, Berlusconi's uncle and the father  of Giancarlo Foscale, the current president of the Standa chain.  Still in 1978, two trustees of the BNL (which at that time was  headed by the Socialist Nerio Nesi, who was then replaced in  1989 by another Socialist, Giampiero Cantoni), that is, the  Servizio Italia and SAF [expansion unknown], were involved in  the creation of Fininvest Roma, which in turn would incorporate  Fininvest Milano. Servizio Italia is still being used. It holds  trustee management ("passive, or nonoperational management," BNL  points out) of 42 percent of Fininvest's capital stock to which  must be added an additional 3 percent, if you consider Holding  Italiana Seven's 55 percent, in order to arrive at the 45  percent we mentioned in the beginning of this article. Parmafid  is also in the picture. It is a trustee headquartered at 2 Via  Sant'Orsola in Milan and its director is the accountant Roberto  Massimo Filippa. Parmafid controls 49 percent of Fininvest's  Holding Italiana One and 10 percent of Holdings Two, Three,  Four, Five, Twenty-one, and Twenty-two. The total is just over 4  percent of Fininvest and, thus, the figures add up.    Why does Fininvest play this game of holdings and  trusteeships? One explanation can be found if we look at three  of the companies in this tangle: Nodit, Sodif (former Gaumont  Italia), and Videotrading (former Costa, a "tax haven" of Costa  Shipbuilders that Berlusconi bought in 1987). All three were  loaded with debts, and the rather strong earnings in early years  from the television rights paid by the Fininvest networks were,  to a large extent, written off against their losses. In November  1992, L'ESPRESSO stated that in a few years' time "180 billion  lire had passed from Fininvest to Berlusconi without being  subject to taxation." It was all legal, of course, just like in  so many other respectable companies.</p>

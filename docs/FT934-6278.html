			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Future and Options Trading Traded options took centre stage in London's equity derivative dealings yesterday as volumes were boosted by expiry of the November series, writes Peter John. Equity options turnover represented more than half of the total options volume of just over 56,000 contracts as dealers rolled out their holdings. Royal Insurance with 2,716 lots traded, GEC (2,312 lots), BT (1,805), British Aerospace (1,681), Vodafone (1,310) and Guinness (1,174) all had expiring November series yesterday. However, the most active stock option - National Power with 3,501 lots dealt  -was the result of one very large bearish deal carried out by a leading UK securities house. Dealers said BZW bought 3,500 puts, options giving the right but not the obligation to sell stock at a fixed price and time, expiring in March at 390p. BZW was not available for comment The out-of-the-money options, priced at 11p and 12p per share and representing 3.5m shares, was seen as representing protection against the stock falling over the next four months. National Power shares slipped 8 to 399p in the underlying market. Futures trade was very quiet after Tuesday's frenetic trading. The December contract on the Footsie opened up at 3,072 and hit a high of 3,086 in mid-morning. December ticked all the way back to 3,062 by the afternoon but it clawed its way back to 3,070 by the official close, some four points above cash. Volume was a pitiful 7,670 contracts during official dealing. Elsewhere on Liffe, long gilt futures for December were the most active series with more than 91,000 lots dealt.</p>

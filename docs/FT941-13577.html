			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium Base metals bulls hoping for a quick solution to the problem of overcapacity in aluminium may be disappointed. The draft memorandum which emerged from last week's negotiations among producing countries stops short of allocating capacity reductions among continents, let alone companies. That may reflect worries about anti-trust legislation in the US and the reluctance of Russian officials to be tied down without a firm commitment on the western side. But vague wording will make meaningful cuts difficult to enforce - always assuming that governments accept the draft by Friday's deadline. The danger must be that the metal's price rises in anticipation of cuts, but the memorandum allows producers enough latitude to back off. While the fall in aluminium yesterday suggests a healthy scepticism among commodities traders, equity markets appear to be taking a stronger aluminium price for granted. Pechiney's shares have risen by 40 per cent since the autumn, Alusuisse by only slightly less. In North America, Kaiser and Alcan have matched that performance. While all producers would gain from a stronger aluminium price, the benefit would not be spread evenly. As a net buyer of aluminium, Alusuisse could find its margins squeezed unless the price of fabricated products also rises. With Europe in deep recession, that cannot be taken for granted. Exporters of alumina and bauxite into Russia - Alcoa chief among them - stand to lose a valuable market if Siberian smelters are closed.</p>

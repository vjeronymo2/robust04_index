			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEISS DROPPED BECAUSE OF INJURY  </P> <P> Walt Weiss was dropped from the Oakland Athletics' World Series roster because  of the strained ligaments in his left knee he suffered during the American  League playoffs.  </P> <P> "I probably needed three more weeks if I seriously thought about getting out  there," Weiss said. "It's going to be tough to feel involved when I'm used to  being out there every day."  </P> <P> Infielder Mike Bordick replaces Weiss on the roster. Mike Gallego will start at  shortstop and Willie Randolph will start at second, where he and Gallego have  been platooned.  </P></p>

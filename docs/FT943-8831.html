			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Emap pays Pounds 11.25m for three golf magazine titles Emap's golf handicap improved substantially as the media group struck a deal with The New York Times to buy three of the sport's best known UK magazine titles for Pounds 11.25m cash. Emap is buying Golf World, Golf Weekly and the trade magazine Golf Industry News, as well as the rights to re-publish articles from the US company's Golf Digest title. The UK company already owns Today's Golfer, described as a magazine for the player with a handicap of 16 or more, and Fore], which is aimed at helping the frustrated golfer improve his or her game. It also owns two golfing titles in France as a result of the recent Pounds 108m purchase of Editions Mondiales. Mr Barry Dennis, managing director of Emap Pursuit, the sports publishing arm, said the company was confident the golf market was set for continued growth. 'It's a little bit like trout fishing a few years ago. It was once exclusive and now its available to everyone,' Mr Dennis said. Golf World, a monthly and the largest of the three titles bought by Emap, has a circulation of over 80,000. It reaches more than 700,000 golfers, with almost nine people picking up each copy in clubs or shops. The titles were marginally lossmaking last year on sales of Pounds 5.6m. Emap said it expected the titles to be earnings enhancing in their first full financial year. IPC Magazines has agreed to buy five titles, including The Field and Shooting Times, from the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust for an undisclosed sum.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Premiere of Matthus's 'Gewandhaus Symphony' - Music in Leipzig At first there were just 16 musicians, standing alone on the concert platform. Before long they had become a classical orchestra, which in turn grew to Straussian proportions. At the final count, there were nearly 200 musicians. That, in short, is the story of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, which has just celebrated its 250th anniversary. It is also the story of Siegfried Matthus' new Gewandhaus Symphony, the premiere of which was the focus of the anniversary celebrations. Leipzig may not boast the oldest orchestra in the world - that honour belongs to Dresden - but it does have Germany's oldest concert orchestra. The Gewandhaus Orchestra, named after the hall of the clothmakers' guild, was founded in 1743 on the private initiative of 16 wealthy burghers, eager to sustain a musical tradition bequeathed by Bach, Telemann and their medieval forebears. Today the orchestra is the focal point of the city's musical life, playing in the Thomaskirche, the opera house and the handsome Gewandhaus concert hall, which opened in 1981 as a replacement for its war-bombed predecessor. In the intervening 250 years, the Gewandhaus Orchestra has made music with Mozart, Mendelssohn and Wagner, attracted chief conductors of the calibre of Nikisch, Furtwangler and Bruno Walter, and premiered such pillars of the repertoire as Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony, Schubert's Great C major Symphony and Brahms' German Requiem. It has remained the most distinctly classical-sounding of German orchestras - a sound nurtured by its own music school, which continues to supply many of its players. Since unification it has lost not a single musician, despite lucrative job opportunities further west. Tradition constantly renewing itself was the leitmotif of the anniversary celebrations. Kurt Masur, chief conductor since 1970, opened the birthday concert with a robust account of the Meistersinger overture (another work premiered by the orchestra), followed by a contemporary homage to Bach in Sofia Gubaidulina's Offertorium - with Gidon Kremer, like some musical acupuncturist, pinpointing all the nerve-ends of the solo violin part. Then came Matthus' 45-minute symphony, scored for large orchestra, soprano, boys' voices and organ. It is a gargantuan piece d'occasion, in which Matthus - east Germany's leading composer and a longstanding friend of Masur  -has attempted to turn Gewandhaus history into music. He incorporates the orchestra's growth into the four-movement structure, pays tribute to various musical epochs along the way, throws in references to the orchestra's role in the Bach revival and the downfall of Communism (when the Gewandhaus became a forum for political discussion), and ends on a utopian note. As a technical tour de force, the symphony has an oddball fascination. In the opening concerto grosso movement, Matthus cleverly evokes the spirit of Bach in a modern sound world; in a scherzo of daunting rhythmic complexity, he whips the musical argument round a huge orchestra like a breakneck conversational chain; the final passacaglia, dominated by organ and a phalanx of brass, rises to a massive climax without a hint of pomposity. Even so, the symphony has a hollow ring. By trying to cram so much in, Matthus allows extra-musical factors to dictate the work's character: the only development is numerical. The music has a piecemeal quality, shot through with faded modernist colouring which hardly raises the spirit. Matthus apparently intends to adapt the symphony for more conventional forces. But stripped of the theatricals (and of the boys' chorus linking each movement while the stage fills up), it is hard to imagine the Gewandhaus Symphony thriving far beyond its illustrious namesake.</p>

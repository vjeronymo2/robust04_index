			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Safety fears halt cancer research Government inspectors have acted for the first time to stop genetic engineering research for safety reasons. The Health and Safety Executive has served 'prohibition' and 'improvement' notices on Birmingham University's Department of Cancer Studies where researchers were using viruses to carry cancer-causing genes - known as oncogenes - into human cell cultures. The inspectors told them to stop work because they had not done enough to contain the genetically engineered virus in the laboratory. There was theoretically a remote risk that it could escape and infect lab workers or the public. In the words of the prohibition notice, 'sufficient assessments of the risks of this work to human health and the environment have not been carried out, so causing uncertainty as to whether the correct level of containment has been adopted'. Professor David Westbury, vice-principal of Birmingham University, said the project - part of a large programme funded by the Cancer Research Campaign - was suspended as soon as the notices were issued. 'Some initial work had started but it was only for a couple of weeks,' Prof Westbury said. The cancer researchers are now working out tighter containment precautions in consultation with the university's safety staff and HSE inspectors. For example it is planned that the viral oncogene project will have its own secure room instead of sharing space with other cancer research. By an unfortunate coincidence, Birmingham University was the site of the world's last smallpox case - in 1978 - when smallpox virus escaped from a different laboratory and killed a research worker. Prof Westbury stressed that there was no link between that incident and the inspectors' action. 'Circumstances were entirely different then,' he said.</p>

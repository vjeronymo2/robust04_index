The declaration dated Feb. 12 noted the seminar was a more  significant gathering as it was held on the occasion of the 52d  birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who is  consistently developing in depth the chuche idea.    It said:    The participants in the seminar unanimously stressed that it  is the most urgent matter for the independent development of  developing countries at present to liquidate neocolonialism,  establish a fair international economic order based on the  principle of democracy and achieve the unity of the patriotic  forces by establishing political formula suited to realities of  each country.    We consider that a new international economic order should  be  an independent l one which can ensure the interests of all  countries, strong and weak, irrespective of differences between  the rich and the poor on the principle of democracy. The  developing countries should reject the unlimited opening of  markets and conditioned "aids", which may cause the bankruptcy  of the national economy and economic dependence, and positively  develop the South-South cooperation on the principle of the  collective self-reliance.    We are convinced that the fundamental interests of the  developing nations lie in building an independent sovereign  state in a political aspect by uniting the patriotic forces.    The developing countries should not follow the western-style  multi-party system and destroy the national unity achieved  through the arduous struggle, but firmly ensure unity and  solidarity among the popular masses by means of building up the  united front of different political parties around the patriotic  political party.</p>

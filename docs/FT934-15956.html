			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Abbott Laboratories 15% ahead ABBOTT Laboratories, the US drugs and healthcare group, met market expectations in the third quarter with a 15 per cent growth in earnings per share to 38 cents, from 33 cents a year ago. Sales advanced by 4.7 per cent to just over Dollars 2bn in the quarter, with sales of drugs and nutritional products showing the strongest growth. International sales, held back by the strong US dollar, grew by less than 1 per cent, to Dollars 769m. Future sales are likely to be boosted by Food and Drug Administration approval at the end of September for one of Abbott's leading drugs, Hytrin, to be used in the treatment of a prostate gland condition. Analysts predict this could eventually double sales of the drug, which reached Dollars 250m in 1992. R&amp;D spending rose to Dollars 225m in the third quarter, or 11 per cent of sales, from Dollars 191m a year before. Net income in the period, at Dollars 316m, was up from Dollars 278m in the 1992 period, while nine-month after-tax earnings rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.01bn.</p>

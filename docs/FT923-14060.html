			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Telegraph shares fall 42p on first day's dealing THE FIRST day's dealings in shares of The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK newspaper group, saw the price fall to below the 325p level set for the flotation. The shares opened at 289p, hovered around that level in the morning and then closed at 283p. Mr Black's Hollinger Group retains a 68.3 per cent stake in The Telegraph, worth Pounds 258.7m at yesterday's closing price, Pounds 38.4m less than at the flotation price. Public investors shunned the issue with applications arriving for only 3m of the 13m shares offered. Another 13m shares had been placed with institutions. On Tuesday, retail investors were even more reluctant to take up the public offering of shares in Anglian Group, the double-glazing company which was to float with a market capitalisation of Pounds 183.5m at the flotation price. Anglian's shares are also expected to open at a discount to the 210p price at when dealing begins next Wednesday. The public offer for shares in MFI Furniture Group, the retailer, closes on Friday while the offer for Taunton Cider, the drinks group, closes next Wednesday. Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen equipment maker, opened at a modest premium to its 285p offer price but had slipped back by yesterday to 282p. The Telegraph float was hampered by a number of factors including the fact that Hollinger was to retain a majority stake. Analysts suggested the sale could have succeeded with a price of 300p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Geneva by Gay Bekhor] </F>   [Excerpts] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad may today notify  U.S. President Bill Clinton that Syria will stop supporting  "elements operating against the peace process," that is, the  Palestinian and Lebanese terror organizations. Contacts on this  Syrian announcement have been held since last night at the  Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. This was told to HA'ARETZ by  a Lebanese diplomat in Geneva. The announcement reportedly will  be handed over to the Americans today, but will not be  publicized.    According to the Lebanese diplomat, the Syrians have  prepared  an initial draft stipulating that they "will suspend or stop  supporting elements operating against the peace process." The  Americans, however, are demanding a more detailed and explicit  commitment, including mentioning Hizballah by name. In return,  the State Department may strike Syria off the list of terror  supporting countries. [passage omitted]    The Lebanese diplomat estimated that the Syrian-Israeli  rapprochement will be similar to the Israel-PLO mutual  recognition, which followed 'Arafat's public renouncement of  terrorism. The Lebanese diplomat believes this will be the main  achievement of the summit, which is to be held this morning at  the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. The meeting is scheduled  to last some three hours. A joint news conference may be held at  the end of the meeting.</p>

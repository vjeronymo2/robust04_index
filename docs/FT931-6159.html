			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Tunisia pulls off an economic turnaround: But President Ben Ali faces a demanding test of his skills IN sharp contrast to its neighbours, Tunisia has quietly and steadily pulled off an economic turnaround in the last six years. But as it completes the first phase of reform, aimed at curbing the country's serious economic imbalances, the Tunisian government faces real obstacles to further adjustment. Stabilisation policies are now giving way to a dismantling of the command economy, and with liberalisation is coming resistance. Strict austerity since 1986 has brought the budget deficit down from 6.7 per cent of GDP in 1984 to 2 per cent last year, while inflation is down to 6 per cent from a high of more than 10 per cent. Subsidies on food staples and agricultural products have been cut from 3 per cent of GDP to 2 per cent over the last six years, with remaining subsidies now targeted at poorer Tunisians. Meanwhile, economic growth has averaged 6.6 per cent over the past three years, more than three times the rate of population growth. But, as Mr Aziz Krichen, a Tunisian academic, argues in 'The Bourguiba Syndrome', the real battle to modernise Tunisian society is now being fought in the economic sphere. Reforms to date have been backed by a steady flow of World Bank loans, worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 281.6m) last year and Dollars 300m in 1993, and have been helped by the country's political stability, which has survived the upsurge in Islamic fundamentalist tensions since Mr Zine El Abidine Ben Ali succeeded Mr Habib Bourguiba as president in November 1987. Foreign currency restrictions have been lifted, foreign investors no longer require prior agreement from the central bank to repatriate their capital investments or remit profits, and Tunisians have seen their foreign currency allowances doubled. Vested interests in the civil service and industry are now to be challenged by reforms aimed at raising industrial productivity, enforcing quality control and boosting exports. Together with the potentially destabilising impact of religious extremism in the region, the new phase of reform amounts to the most demanding test of President Ben Ali's skills since he took office nearly five years ago. One of the main obstacles to reform is a banking system which bears all the hallmarks of a command economy: it is overstaffed, has accumulated many bad loans and is often run by former hierarchs of the Central Bank who have little understanding of the needs of the economy. Recent economic news has been good. Hard currency receipts from over 3m tourists were worth close to TD1bn last year, an increase of more than 50 per cent on the 1991 figure, as the country attracted Europeans who, in more settled times, travelled to Yugoslavia. Three good harvests have also played their part. But ministers are concerned about the growing trade deficit, which is estimated to have increased last year from TD1.35bn to TD1.85bn. Imports rose faster than expected as Tunisian businessmen took advantage of more liberal import policy - with 85 per cent of imports now free of duties. Simultaneously, export growth slackened, although some factors such as the Mediterranean glut of olive oil, of which Tunisia is a major exporter, are temporary. Others are more structural. Demand in the EC, Tunisia's principle market, has weakened, most notably for leather and textiles. Younger Tunisians are pushing the government to become more accountable and to stop changing rules abruptly and without explanation, while managers are seeking greater freedom. These reformists do not hide their resentment at what they consider the arbitrary methods of customs and tax officials, who one respected Tunisian businessman bemoans as having 'the mentality of the tax inspector who believes every private investor is out to defraud the state'. Such attitudes, they argue, act as a brake on investment, particularly at a time when domestic interest rates stand at 15 per cent. Overall, however, investment is increasing, from TD2.7bn in 1990 to TD3.46bn last year, TD3.3bn of which is domestic. With public investment reigned in by government efforts to cut budget and public company deficits, private investment, worth TD1.5bn last year has now overtaken the contribution made from public funds. Foreign investment has not grown overall, the bulk of it going to the energy sector but the volume of funds going into manufacturing has surged from TD25m in 1988 to TD52 last year. Well known international names such as Alcatel, Siemens, BASF, Ericsson, Goldstar and Sony are now manufacturing in Tunisia. The US corporate presence has traditionally focused on the oil sector, but Sara Lee in the textile sector and AT&amp;T in telecommunications are now considering setting up in Tunisia, where labour costs are, on average, one quarter of those in the EC. Creating new jobs is now vital for both economic and political reasons as unemployment remains fertile breeding ground for religious fundamentalism.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / AEEU recruiting at Nissan suppliers THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has launched a campaign to recruit members among suppliers to Nissan in north-east England. The AEEU is the only recognised union at Nissan's Sunderland car plant and its growth in membership there - to about 2,000 out of 4,600 employees has helped to maintain its Tyneside numbers against a declining national trend. The union hopes that by recruiting members at Nissan suppliers it will strengthen its request for recognition by managements, many of which rebuffed formal AEEU approaches when they first moved into the area and have no recognised union on site. 'We have the key - Nissan. We're looking for a knock-on effect,' Mr Davey Hall, AEEU Tyne district secretary, said. 'It's a continuous campaign. We'll be on the doorsteps on a number of occasions during 1993.' AEEU full-time officials are handing out recruitment literature outside suppliers' premises in the early morning and evening. Mr Hall described the response from employees as 'tremendous' but admitted that take-up had been limited. On two occasions AEEU officials have been asked to leave company car parks. At Nissan's Sunderland plant the works council, not the union, negotiates pay and conditions, although some elected representatives are AEEU members. The plant's 195 European suppliers include 27 in north-east England. The AEEU is focusing on the 21 that have set up since Nissan arrived in the mid 80s. One crucial AEEU target - TRW, which supplies Nissan with valves, switches and machined forgings - said the subject was 'very sensitive'. Mr Nigel Clark, human resources manager of Reydel, which employs 160 people at its plant in Washington, Tyne and Wear, making door finishers and centre console assemblies for Nissan, said, 'We aren't anti-union but we're quite happy with our current arrangements.'</p>

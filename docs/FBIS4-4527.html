			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu agreed  Monday [4 April] that China must play a larger role in  encouraging North Korea to remove suspicions about its nuclear  program. Hosokawa told Han that China's role will be crucial in  tackling growing threats arising from Pyongyang's alleged  nuclear weapons development program, a Foreign Ministry official  said.    The premier also spoke of the need to seek cooperation from  Beijing in persuading Pyongyang to allay international concern  that it is developing nuclear weapons capability at its  facilities in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the capital, the  official said. China is North Korea's last major ally.    During the 35-minute meeting, Han remarked that China  appears  ready to play a more active role than before, the official said.    Han told Hosokawa that in addition to close contact among  Japan, the United States and South Korea, the roles of China,  Russia and other members in the UN Security Council will be  important in helping resolve the issue. On Sunday, Han agreed  with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that China has a  vital role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.    They also confirmed their intention to monitor how Pyongyang  responds to the UN Security Council's call for it to accept full  inspections of its suspected nuclear sites.    The Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a  statement urging North Korea to allow the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete checks of its nuclear  facilities. The IAEA had reported that it was not allowed to  carry out certain measures at a North Korean radiochemical  laboratory.    After emerging from the session with Hosokawa, Han declined  to reveal exactly what he discussed with the premier on North  Korea's suspected nuclear program. "I cannot make a simple  statement now," he said.    Han will return home later Monday at the end of a  three-country trip to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue.  Before flying to Tokyo, he visited China and the U.S. to seek  cooperation on the issue.</p>

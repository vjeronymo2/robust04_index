			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ward loses Pounds 5m as purchaser confidence sags Ward Holdings, the housebuilder and property group, blamed the severe recession for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.29m after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.07m for the year to October 31. This compares with a deficit of Pounds 14m after exceptional charges of Pounds 12.2m, relating to the write-down in the value of the land bank. Turnover remained static at Pounds 29.7m. The final dividend is passed again - there was no interim. Losses per share were 8.8p (19.1p). Although Ward sold 10 per cent more houses than in the previous year, it said there had been a further loss of house purchaser confidence. This was due to falling house prices, increases in unemployment and business failures, and exceptionally high levels of house repossessions and mortgage repayment arrears. The company was unable to dispose of certain investment property to reduce its gearing. It blamed the 'disappointing delay' on prospective purchasers failing to complete after agreeing terms. Agreement has been reached with its banks to extend its syndicate loans through to May 31 1994.</p>

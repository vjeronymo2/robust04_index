			<p>BFN     [Text] The computer diskettes seized by the District  Attorney's Office reveal that since at least January 1990, still  during Moreira Franco's administration, the civil and military  police leadership were on the payroll of the numbers game  kingpins. Until now the main police precincts subordinate to  the General Department of Specialized Police [DGPE] have been  included on this monthly payroll. There was money enough for  the capital's precincts, as well as for those in Baixada  Fluminense [region of poor satellite towns on the outskirts of  the capital] and in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State. In  addition, money was given to the Military Police [PM] barracks  and to some sectors of the Federal Police.    According to the illegal game accounting, the Civil Police  leadership have their monthly earning ensured. The list is so  well detailed that it includes all the police inspectors who  have occupied important positions in the Police Secretariat.    Under Secretary Joel Vieira, for example, had his name  included up to October 1993, when he left his position and was  replaced by Police Inspector Frederico Henning. Inspectors  Paulo Emilio (former director of the capital's General Police  Department, who was replaced by Jorge Mario Gomes), and Elson  Campello (former DGPE director who was replaced by Marta Rocha)  are also included on the list.    Rocha's name is not included on the payroll, but the main  police organization is included under the acronym DPE [expansion  unknown]. The name of the former DGPE chief of staff, Inaldo  Santana, is also on the list. Other inspectors who have  occupied important positions in the Civil Police, such as Helio  Vigio, Antonio Nonato da Costa, Roberto de Castro, and Mauro  Magalhaes, were included on the list next to the amounts they  allegedly received from the illegal game kingpins.    PM Colonels Anani, Arouca, and Lages, in addition to the  members of the PM Public Relations Department and of the  operations nucleus, are mentioned on the list of those who  received bribes.</p>

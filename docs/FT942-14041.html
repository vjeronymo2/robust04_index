			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / German threat to British beef All the main political parties in the German parliament yesterday agreed on the need for tougher restrictions on the import of British beef, including if necessary a unilateral import ban, in order to curb the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The ban demanded by a meeting of agricultural and health experts in the governing Christian Democratic Union would affect any animals more than three years old. Mr Peter Hintze, CDU secretary-general, said Germany would be calling for such a ban at the EU farm ministers' meeting in Brussels next week. If there was no agreement, 'in an emergency an import ban will have to be put into effect by Germany unilaterally'. Mr Horst Seehofer, health minister, said he had already ordered further measures to prevent any human exposure to BSE, including a ban on the use of any cattle parts or beef from the UK in children's food products, and the registration of any cattle imported from the UK since 1986.</p>

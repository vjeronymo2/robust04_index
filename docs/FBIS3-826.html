Addressing a farm workers forum in the Senekal District on  Sunday, Mr Lekota said an ANC government intended buying farms  that were being put up for sale. These will in turn be resold  to aspirant trained black farmers. He said these farmers would  be assisted with equipment and implements. Mr Lekota said an  ANC government would allow farmworkers to form and belong to  labour movements. He said farmworkers would not have to work  longer than 40-hours a week.</p>

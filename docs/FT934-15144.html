			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: TDG US sale terms amended Transport Development Group said that it hoped to receive the outstanding Dollars 14.3m (Pounds 9.4m) payment on its sale of Willig Freight Lines in the US on or before November 30. The purchasers had been due to pay Dollars 7.5m on September 30 with the balance on November 30, but despite efforts to adhere to the sale terms, they were unable to make the payment. However, letters of intent, satisfactory to TDG, had been signed between the purchasers and their potential financial partners which should enable the single payment to be made on or before the end of next month. The sale to a management team was first announced last November.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> 2 HELD IN ROBBERY OF CONVENIENCE STORE  </P> <P> Two men suspected of robbing a Moorpark convenience store of beer Christmas  morning were arrested after their revelry spurred neighbors to call police,  authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A disturbance at Park Spring Condominiums led to the arrest of Jeffrey James  Taylor, 19, of Simi Valley and Gregory Raymond Wilson, 21, of Palmdale at 4:45  a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> The pair were booked on suspicion of strong-armed robbery, Ventura County  Sheriff's Sgt. Frank O'Hanlon said.  </P> <P> O'Hanlon said two men entered a convenience store in the 500 block of Los  Angeles Avenue shortly after 2 a.m. O'Hanlon said they found the beer  refrigerator locked, as required by law at 2 a.m., so each grabbed a 12-pack of  warm beer from a display and ran from the store with the clerk chasing them.  </P> <P> One man allegedly punched the clerk, and the pair then jumped into a white  pickup truck and fled.  </P> <P> Deputies Eric Hatlee and Bernie McMahon, responding to a disturbance call two  hours later at the condominiums on Spring Road, saw Taylor and Wilson inside,  O'Hanlon said, adding that the two men fit the description of the suspects. The  deputies found the suspects' pickup parked outside and arrested them as they  left the apartment.  </P> <P> O'Hanlon said the two men were identified by the clerk, who was treated for  minor injuries.

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAM-PATRIOT GAME BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SLATER AND GROGAN  </P> <P> It's a wonder Jackie Slater and Steve Grogan, two 35-year-olds who entered the  NFL before the disco movement, made it through Sunday's sub-zero game without  needing antifreeze.  </P> <P> They're not getting colder, they're getting better.  </P> <P> New England's Grogan, suffering from the flu, replaced starting quarterback  Marc Wilson in the second quarter and finished with 313 passing yards, falling  four yards short of the end zone in a 24-20 loss to the Rams.  </P> <P> "The old man was really throwing the ball well," Slater said.  </P> <P> Slater, the Rams' right tackle, throws blocks, and he didn't have a bad game  either, helping to raise the offensive line from its slumber. Slater also  cleared a path that sprung Greg Bell loose for his game-winning, three-yard  scoring run with 1:55 remaining at Sullivan Stadium.  </P> <P> No surprise there. Rams have been running Slater's way for 14 seasons. On  Bell's touchdown run, Slater pinched Patriot defensive end Milford Hodge inside  to make room for Bell.  </P> <P> "For some reason, he (Hodge) raised his head up, and I was able to get under  him," Slater said.  </P> <P> It hasn't been the best of seasons for the Rams' offensive line, which has  struggled at times to keep running lanes open for Bell and others.  </P> <P> But it was a great Sunday, and just in time for the playoffs. Slater said line  coach Hudson Houck worked overtime last week dissecting New England's defensive  schemes.  </P> <P> "I think our concentration level on the line was as high as it's been in a long  time," Slater said. "We were just able to flat-out get it done. I doubt that we  had any assignment errors at all. Maybe one or two."  </P> <P> Slater won't be around when young Rams grow up. He figures he has one more shot  at the Super Bowl, maybe two.  </P> <P> "It's been the most fun year I've had in a long time," Slater said. "As you  look at this football team in the '90s, I think this team will bring a  championship to Los Angeles. I just have a feeling about this team. With the  young talent, it can't help get better and better."  </P> <P> The two faces of Bell: He gained nearly half (559) of his 1,137 rushing yards  in three games this season. In those games, he averaged 6.9 yards per carry.  Bell averaged three yards per rush in 13 others. And when was the last time a  tailback had more 200-yard rushing games than 100-yard games in one season?  Bell gained 221 yards against Green Bay on Sept. 24 and 210 against New  England. His only 100-yard game came on opening day in Atlanta, when he rushed  for 128 against the Falcons.  </P> <P> Bell, who seems to disappear for weeks at a time when nicked with injuries,  saved his best stuff for the Patriots. He proved to be quick, strong, and  elusive.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson said Bell's hot-and-cold season shouldn't come as a  shock.  </P> <P> "Isn't that the way it goes in this league?" Robinson asked. "You don't succeed  that well, that easily, all the time."  </P> <P> The Rams should get a couple more bodies back on defense this week. Defensive  end Mike Piel is expected to return from a dislocated elbow. In addition, the  team can use its free roster move this week to activate safety James  Washington, who would step in for injured safety Anthony Newman (fractured  elbow).  </P> <P> Also out of the New England game with injuries were defensive ends Doug Reed  and Bill Hawkins. Two more Rams, starting left end Shawn Miller (groin) and  cornerback Cliff Hicks (right knee bruise), were forced from the game with  injuries.  </P> <P> The immediate playoff forecast for the Rams remains distant and cold, but if  they beat Philadelphia in Sunday's wild-card game at Veterans Stadium, they'll  pack their bags again a week later and meet the New York Giants at the  Meadowlands in a first-round divisional game.  </P> <P> If nothing else, Sunday's game against New England provided the Rams with some  cold-weather training.  </P> <P> "At least you know now where you get the clothes," Robinson said. "It isn't so  much the weather, but you have to put on all these different clothes, and you  have to drive the rental car differently. All those things are different."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> With 232 passing yards Sunday, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski finished the  season with an NFL-leading 4,318 yards, eight more than Jim Everett. But for  the second consecutive season, Everett led the league in touchdown passes. He  finished with 29, two more than Majkowski. Cincinnati's Boomer Esiason moved  into second with three touchdown passes Monday night, giving him 28.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson claims Sunday's sub-freezing temperatures posed no problems  for either team. "I never saw a dropped pass," he said. Robinson must have been  looking elsewhere when his tight end, Damone Johnson, wide open in the end  zone, dropped a sure touchdown pass in the first quarter. . . The Rams averaged  6.8 yards per offensive play against the Patriots.  </P> <P> Linebacker Kevin Greene said his team's crazy finishes must mean there is  something in the stars for the Rams this season. "It's happening, that  feeling," he said. "And I'm leading the way.". . . A public service  announcement from safety Vince Newsome: "We're never just going to get a  comfortable lead in a game and ride it out. I don't think it's in the best  interest for us or our fans, but that's what we just seem to do."  </P></p>

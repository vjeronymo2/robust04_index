The Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  Standing Committee examined a bill submitted by the State  Council concerning Interim Regulations for Value-Added Tax,  Consumption Tax, Business Tax, and other Taxes Applicable to  Foreign-Funded Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises. To unify  the taxation system, fairly distribute tax burdens, improve  China's investment environment, and meet the needs of  establishing and developing socialist market economy, a decision  is hereby made as follows:    1. Pending the enactment of relevant taxation laws, the  interim regulations on value-added tax, the interim regulations  on consumption tax, and the interim regulations on business tax  promulgated by the State Council will be applicable to foreign-  funded enterprises and foreign enterprises beginning on 1  January 1994. "The Regulations (Draft) of the PRC Governing the  Unified Industrial and Commercial Taxes" adopted in principle by  the 101st Session of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee on 11 September 1958 and promulgated for trial  implementation by the State Council on 13 September 1958 will be  abolished on the same date [1 January 1994].    The value-added tax on offshore oil and natural gas  extracted  by Chinese-foreign joint ventures shall be levied in kind. The  rate and collecting measures of such tax shall be separately  stipulated by the State Council.    2. Foreign-funded enterprises, the establishment of which  was  approved before 31 December 1993, may have to bear additional  tax burdens after they are required, in accordance with Item 1  of this decision, to pay value-added tax, consumption tax, and  business tax. In this case, they may apply for reimbursement of  the additional taxes paid within their approved business period,  with the maximum period of five years; and their application is  subject to the approval of the taxation authorities. If their  business period is not specified, they may apply for  reimbursement of the additional taxes paid within a period not  exceeding five years; and their application is subject to the  approval of the taxation authorities. The concrete measures  shall be stipulated by the State Council.    3. In addition to value-added tax, consumption tax, and  business tax, foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises  shall pay other taxes in accordance with relevant laws, if any;  or in the absence of such laws, in accordance with the  regulations of the State Council.    Foreign-funded enterprises referred to in this decision  denote Chinese-foreign joint ventures, Chinese-foreign  cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises  established within the boundaries of China.    Foreign enterprises referred to in this decision denote  foreign companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations  which have established organizations or workshops within the  boundaries of China to engage in production and business, as  well as foreign companies, enterprises, and other economic  organizations whose incomes originate from within the boundaries  of China even though they have no organizations or workshops in  China.    This decision will become effective on the day of its  promulgation.</p>

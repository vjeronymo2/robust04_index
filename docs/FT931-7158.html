			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: EBRD set to take 20% stake in Romanian bank THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is set to become the first western financial institution to take an equity stake in a Romanian commercial bank since the end of communist rule in 1989. It has agreed in principle to take a 20 per cent stake in the Ion Tiriac Bank. The bank, the country's first post-communist private commercial bank, was founded in 1991 by Mr Ion Tiriac, the Romanian-born former tennis player. Mr Tiriac and his companies own 25 per cent of the bank with the remainder held by more than 5,000 mainly local shareholders. The bank has declared a provisional profit of 7.1bn lei (Dollars 13m) for 1992 on turnover of 53.6bn lei. This represents a return of 238 per cent on the bank's paid-up capital of 3bn lei. The bank intends to increase its capital with the EBRD expected to pay Ecu6m (Dollars 7.17m) for a 20 per cent stake in the recapitalised bank.</p>

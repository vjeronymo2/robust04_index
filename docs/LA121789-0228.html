			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES: EASTERN EUROPE, 1989;  </P> <P> UNITED STATES;  </P> <P> A ONCE-WARY BUSH IS SWEPT UP IN EAST BLOC WAVE OF FREEDOM;  </P> <P> THE PRESIDENT AND HIS AIDES NOW VIEW GORBACHEV AS A PARTNER IN DEMOCRACY.  </P> <P> For the better part of a year, the upheaval in Eastern Europe has posed two  central questions to George Bush and his foreign policy advisers: What do the  changes in the Soviet Bloc mean for the West? And how should the United States  and its allies respond?  </P> <P> President Bush gleaned a key part of the answer, some aides say, from a most  unlikely source: Poland's dour President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who tried to  crush the Solidarity opposition movement in 1981, only to surrender a share of  power to it in 1989.  </P> <P> "We are on this path, the path of democratization, for good," Jaruzelski told  Bush last July in a long meeting in the palace of Poland's 19th-Century kings.  Moreover, he added, Moscow had given its full support to reform -- with "no  limits" on Warsaw's freedom of action.  </P> <P> Bush, who had gone to Eastern Europe skeptical about the extent of the  commitment to reform, was deeply impressed by Jaruzelski's apparent sincerity  -- and by his message about Soviet policy.  </P> <P> That afternoon, the President told Poland's new Parliament: "Because of what  you're doing here, the genuine opportunity exists for all of us to build a  Europe which many thought was destroyed forever in the 1940s."  </P> <P> A few days later, Bush wrote to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposing  that the two meet -- the invitation that led to the Malta summit.  </P> <P> The changes that have transformed Eastern Europe this year have had a dramatic  effect on the Bush Administration's foreign policy -- far beyond the issue of  U.S. attitudes toward what used to be called the Soviet "satellites."  </P> <P> The sudden wave of freedom that has swept through Poland and its neighbors has  changed the way Bush and his advisers look at the world. Once wary of  Gorbachev, they now embrace the Soviet leader as a partner in diplomacy. Once  skeptical of the chances for lasting change, they now proclaim the real  possibility of an end to the Cold War.  </P> <P> "As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has handled the changes in Eastern  Europe, it deserves new thinking," Bush told reporters at a meeting of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization earlier this month. "It absolutely mandates  new thinking."  </P> <P> "The issue had been, 'Is it going to last or not?' " a senior Administration  official said. "But with Eastern Europe, you have got some events that, no  matter what happens to Gorbachev, are probably irreversible. They can't be  changed. The post-World War II order is gone. The Soviet Union has essentially  allowed its bloc, which has been under its tight control, to just go away. And  that is a transforming event."  </P> <P> Eastern Europe is where the Cold War began 40 years ago, with Josef Stalin's  installation of Soviet-controlled governments in the lands occupied by the Red  Army at the end of World War II. Ever since, the world's two most formidable  military forces have faced each other across a barbed-wire frontier, with  nuclear missiles to back them up. For a long, white-knuckled generation, when  strategists in the Pentagon drew up their plans for war, it was Europe they  thought of first.  </P> <P> Now, all that has changed. Thanks to the collapse of Communist power under  popular pressure in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the great  confrontation that has dominated the second half of the 20th Century appears to  be coming to an end.  </P> <P> "The most important development in the world today is the democratization of  Eastern Europe," said Fred C. Ikle, an undersecretary of defense in the Reagan  Administration. ". . . If East Germany becomes a democracy, the question of  Soviet troops will simply go away."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is beginning to agree. "What these changes amount to is  nothing less than a peaceful revolution," Bush said after his summit meeting  with Gorbachev off Malta. "The task before us . . . is to consolidate the  fruits of this peaceful revolution, and provide the architecture for continued  change, to end the division of Europe and Germany, to make Europe whole and  free."  </P> <P> So far, the Administration's cautious attempts to devise policies to advance  those aims have been easily outstripped by events.  </P> <P> Throughout most of the year, diplomats and intelligence analysts expected the  Soviet Union to set some limits to the East Bloc nation's freedom of action.  But beyond calling for the maintenance of the Warsaw Pact and opposing any  early move toward the reunification of Germany, Gorbachev surprised U.S.  officials by setting no other limits.  </P> <P> The biggest surprise of all was the sudden opening of the political system in  East Germany, which officials expected to be one of the last Soviet Bloc  countries to embrace reform. Bush and his aides were "amazed" when intelligence  reports showed that Gorbachev had actively encouraged the overthrow of  hard-line leader Erich Honecker, one official said.  </P> <P> The Administration's response has been characteristically cautious. Bush and  his aides have emphasized that they want reforms in Eastern Europe to take  place gradually, in a way that will not provoke a backlash from the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> As one surprising result, U.S. diplomats have pleaded privately with leaders of  Hungary's democratic opposition to shelve their demand for withdrawal from the  Warsaw Pact, because such a move might threaten the Soviet Union's sense of  security.  </P> <P> "We have no reason to encourage them to leave the Warsaw Pact -- it would be  unhelpful, so why raise it?" a State Department official said. "Besides,  membership in the Warsaw Pact in no way inhibits their reforms."  </P></p>

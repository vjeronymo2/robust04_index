			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 13 Jan (EFE) -- Peruvian Economy Minister  Jorge Camet today confirmed that the United States is  withholding a large economic contribution offered for 1993.  This is a result of pressure from the U.S. Senate over the  human rights situation apparently linked to arrests based on  antiterrorist laws. Camet said that the United States, which  offered $105 million to improve Peru's balance of payments, is  the only country of a group of six that pledged to help Peru  achieve this goal that has failed to fulfill its promise. "The  disbursement is being delayed by U.S. Senate pressure, perhaps  because it is not properly informed about the human rights issue  in Peru," the minister said.    The withholding of funds will apparently be the main issue  that the Peruvian Government will discuss with Alexander Watson,  assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, during  an official visit that the high-ranking U.S. official will make  to Peru from 18 to 21 January.    Camet added that Watson's visit to Lima "will have the  important effect of unblocking the aid, because the United  States is the only friendly country that has not yet honored an  offer made last year."    Washington's concerns over human rights in Peru, according  to  various sources, are focused on abuses committed in the  administration of justice during trials of people charged with  terrorism based on strict antiterrorist laws. The discrepancies  recently led to an incident between Peruvian Justice Minister  Fernando Vega and a U.S. State Department and Congress  commission in charge of evaluating the administration of justice  in Peru.    Vega refused to receive the commissioners because he deemed  "unacceptable" both the preliminary report approved by the  commission and a letter sent to him by former U.S. Ambassador  George Brayshaw asking him to receive the delegation. The  minister said the commission, headed by jurist Robert Goldman,  reported that the laws in question remained in effect "even  though the commission was appropriately informed that the laws  had been effectively invalidated." As for Brayshaw's letter,  the minister said "it contained inadmissible terms for any  sovereign nation," but he did not provide more detail.    The human rights situation in Peru improved significantly in  1993, the National Human Rights Coordinating Board reported this  week. But it did ask the government to rectify several legal  norms for fighting terrorism, which in its opinion have led to  an "alarming" number of arbitrary arrests. These laws  constitute "a source of permanent human rights violations," the  National Human Rights Coordinating Board also indicated.    The Peruvian Human Rights Association reported on 2 January  that the number of arrested or missing people in 1993 "continued  to be extremely high," with 87 cases, of which only 20 have been  cleared up.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Head of German stock exchange issues plea for a takeover code MR ROLF BREUER, the director responsible for Deutsche Bank's securities activities, yesterday called for a law to regulate takeovers and mergers in Germany. Mr Breuer, who is also chairman of the German stock exchange, said that it was no excuse to say there were relatively few takeovers on the German equity markets. Although many senior bankers privately condemn the lack of rules governing takeovers, the financial establishment has tended to keep quiet on the issue, reflecting fears that codification of takeover rules would encourage a practice which is considered anti-social in Germany. Analysts have also suspected that large German financial institutions have benefited from the absence of rules. They have taken advantage of the fact that it is possible to acquire control of a company by buying a simple majority of the shares, without obligation to extend the offer to all shareholders. The remarks by a member of the board of Germany's biggest bank, made in the context of a speech about the future development of 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' - Germany as a financial centre - reflect the German financial establishment's concern to bring regulations for the securities industry up to international standards. The focus at present is on the passage of legislation designed to make insider dealing a criminal offence, and to introduce a German equivalent of the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC). The absence of such laws was seen as a failing, especially by foreign investors in the German market. For that reason the proposed laws should be adopted as soon as possible, Mr Breuer said. The package of new laws will bring disclosure requirements into line with UK and US practice. At present companies only have to disclose share stakes when they reach between 20 and 25 per cent, in contrast to 3 per cent in the UK. There are no current plans to introduce a takeover code.</p>

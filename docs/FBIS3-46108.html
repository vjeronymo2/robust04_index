Xu Bonian, vice chairman of the  regional committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, attended the forum. Wang Qun gave  important views.    Wang Qun said: The theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete  system and a strong ideological weapon for guiding the Chinese  people to realize the great ideal of invigorating China. At  present the most important task is to use this theory to further  arm the minds of the whole party, in particular, the leading  cadres at all levels. on the basis of studying well the  original work in line with the reality of the current reform and  development, we should realistically unify our ideology with the  spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, the 14th party congress, and the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.    Wang Qun pointed out: Since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, great achievements have been made in  the whole country, in the regional economic construction,  reform, opening up and in all fields of work. These  achievements can be seen by all. We should extensively  popularize these achievements in an effort to strengthen the  confidence of the masses of people of various nationalities,  including the broad masses of teachers and students of colleges  and universities, in advancing triumphantly along the socialist  road with Chinese characteristics. We should educate the broad  masses of cadres to correctly recognize the current situation,  seize the opportunity, and spare no efforts to comprehensively  advance reform and opening up. It is necessary to properly  handle the relations of reform, development and stability, and  the relationship between the part and the whole, and between  immediate interests and long-term ones in an effort to stimulate  the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and  the people and to give better play to reform and development.    Wang Qun pointed out: While fully affirming the  achievements, and the current situation in the main aspect, we  should analyze the existing difficulties and problems on our  road of advance in a fact- seeking manner. Reform and  construction is the cause of 100 million people. As long as we  unswervingly rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants,  intellectuals, and cadres at all levels, mobilize all positive  factors, and unite with all the forces that can be united, we  can overcome all difficulties. We should continue to promote  the spirit of arduous struggle and dedication, work with one  heart and one mind, help one another, and work in a  down-to-earth manner. Only thus, can we be able to overcome all  difficulties, create new achievements, and win new victories.    In referring to the issue of anticorruption, Wang Qun said:  We should historically and dialectically analyze unhealthy  trends and corrupt phenomena, fully understand the long-term  nature, arduousness and complexity of anticorruption struggle,  and realistically regard this struggle as one of the strategic  tasks and uphold it with unremitting efforts. At present, our  region has achieved certain achievements in anticorruption  struggle, and the self-inspection and correction of leading  cadres, the investigation and handling of major and appalling  cases, and the checking of unhealthy trends in various trades  are being deeply carried out. He said: In anticorruption work,  we must first be resolute and second be fact-seeking, and manage  things in line with law. We should combine reform and  anticorruption with stability and development in an effort to  guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and  economic construction.    In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the work of Inner  Mongolia University and its special educational program on the  current situation which will be carried out soon.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK investors lead Manila inflow British investors led the flow of new foreign direct investment into the Philippines last year, according to government data released at the weekend. Of the total foreign investments of Dollars 327.9m (Pounds 182m) registered in 1993, Dollars 108.6m or 33 per cent was from British investors. Early last year, Shell Petroleum, the Anglo-Dutch energy group, increased its investment in its Philippine oil refining and marketing subsidiary. It was from this that other companies in Britain had apparently taken their cue, officials said. British investments in 1993 exceeded those from Japan and the US, traditionally the largest sources of foreign capital for the Philippines. Investments from Japan totalled Dollars 46.2m, down 70 per cent from the year before, while the US total reached Dollars 35.6m, some 37 per cent lower than in the year before. Foreign investments recorded in 1993 represented a slight decline from Dollars 328.01m in 1992, according to data released by the Bangko Sentral, the country's central monetary authority. It was the second con-secutive annual decline. In 1992 the level was off 21 per cent from 1991's Dollars 415.3m. The National Statistics Office announced that the average year-on-year inflation rate in February was 10.5 per cent. The highest in two years, the month's accelerated inflation rate was fuelled by higher petroleum product prices and power rates. Annual average inflation in 1993 was 7.6 per cent; forecasts for 1994 point to 8-10 per cent.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Christies deems dividend cut wise 'in uncharted territory' CHRISTIES International, the auction house, cut its interim dividend from 2.3p to 0.5p yesterday. The move followed the reduction in the 1991 dividend from 8.3p to 3.3p through a 5p cut in the final payment. Christies had said in March that the lower level of dividends should be seen as a base for the future. Yesterday Mr Christopher Davidge, managing director, said that the group had been expecting an upturn towards the end of the current year, but that had not happened. Now, he said, 'we are living in uncharted territory.' The interim payment was prudent and a judgment would be made at the year end. If the board had declared an uncovered dividend, he said, it would have implied that it knew what the future held. Earnings per share fell from 0.98p to 0.7p. Christies' shares fell 3p to 105p. The group's interim pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 2.11m due to lower interest receivable of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.4m). Operating profits rose from Pounds 608,000 to Pounds 718,000 on increased turnover of Pounds 51.4m (Pounds 50.6m). Lord Carrington, chairman, said: 'We recognise that we have much to do to provide our shareholders with an acceptable return.' He is stepping down next May in favour of Sir Anthony Tennant, although he will remain a non-executive director. He said 'conditions in the art market were little changed in the six months ended June 30.' The balance sheet still had net cash of Pounds 16m at June 30, which gave the group flexibility and security. Mr Davidge said auction sales of Pounds 290m (Pounds 286m) had been at about that level for three halves now. Private treaty sales rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 17m, however, including the sale to the National Gallery for Pounds 10m of Hans Holbein's portrait of A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling. During the half year Christies also handled the sale of a Canaletto for Pounds 10.1m. Mr Davidge said that although there was a good mixture of works for sale in the second half, there was 'nothing headline fetching.' Christies had 23 items to sell, which would raise more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 500,000). In addition a Dollars 50m Impressionist sale and a Dollars 30m contemporary art sale were coming up.</p>

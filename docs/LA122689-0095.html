			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HE'S NOT YET READY TO DRIVE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I promised to teach my 16-year-old son to drive and to let  him get a learner's permit, but in many ways, I think he's too immature to be  behind the wheel of a car. I hate to go back on my promise, but when I see him  take so many needless risks in sports and even on our riding lawn mower, I'm  concerned. His sister was much more mature at his age and she's an excellent  driver. Because she got her permit at 16, he feels that he should too. -- M.O.  </P> <P> DEAR M.O.: You're the one in charge, and driving a car is a responsibility, not  a privilege that comes automatically at a certain age. Don't be afraid to  explain that your son hasn't exhibited the mature behavior you feel is  necessary for someone placed in charge of an auto. You may be surprised how  rapidly his behavior improves.  </P> <P> One way to determine whether or not a youngster is ready to get behind the  wheel of a car is to watch how he handles stressful situations. If he has  outbursts of temper whenever he's frustrated or doesn't get what he wants, then  it might be wise to wait another six months or a year until he gets more  control.  </P> <P> As Dr. John Schowalter, the president of the American Academy of Child and  Adolescent Psychiatry, points out, anger is the leading cause of accidents  second only to drugs and alcohol. Discuss this with your son. Unfortunately,  automobiles can provide a quick but dangerous remedy to feelings of  powerlessness.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I hate it when my mother and her friends tell me to smile.  The only thing that happens when they say this is that I get angry and want to  throw something at them. I hate adult hypocrisy. Sometimes I think all adults  ever do is lie to each other about their feelings. -- D.R.  </P> <P> DEAR D.R.: Maybe what you're seeing as hypocrisy is good manners. Few people  admire hypocrites but "letting it all hang out" can be damaging. If there is a  lot of anger and resentment, it can actually make things worse. Anger that is  expressed tends to escalate, rather than diminish, until people end up saying  things they wish they hadn't.  </P> <P> Recent studies indicate that putting on a sad face or a smile directly produces  the feeling that the expressions represent. Facial signs may contribute to the  feeling itself. Facial expressions affect the temperature of blood flowing to  the brain, providing a possible, though not undisputed, mechanism for  regulating emotions.  </P> <P> You might try smiling or even just saying "cheese" if you can't bring yourself  to actually smile. This might put you in a more relaxed, happier mood -- it  might even make you laugh.  </P></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: The roots of an underclass Sir, Your editorial on the zig-zags of government policy on inner cities ('Urban Policy', December 7) was, for the most part, bang on target. Overstretched, over-stressed local authorities attempting to provide some hope to the most deprived populations are to receive less financial support. But it isn't helpful to confuse the problem with the people. When you speak of the underclass as a 'formidable challenge to western democracies', aren't you forgetting that membership of this group is rather more of a challenge for the people themselves? The much-talked-about underclass is composed of people who have given up the search for work because there isn't any, who are homeless because council accommodation has been sold off, and who are in some cases denied income support because they are too young. The government fails to recognise that the underclass has been created by conscious, incremental acts of policy. Sadly, it may be much harder to unmake these problems than it was to invent them.

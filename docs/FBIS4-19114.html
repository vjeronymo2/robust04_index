			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- The French Foreign  Ministry said Tuesday [12 April] it has warned Russian  ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to keep in check  his outrageous behaviour and comments during the rest of his  stay in France.    Zhirinovskiy, who is part of a Russian delegation attending  the Council of Europe's spring parliamentary session in  Strasbourg, has outdone himself since his arrival in France by  gatecrashing one Council meeting Monday and ripping plants and  throwing them at protesters outside the Russian consulate in  Strasbourg.    He also denounced NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs,  suggesting Russia should bomb European cities.    "His statements are unacceptable and Mr. Zhirinovskiy was  once again warned to refrain from making such statements,"  Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here Tuesday.    He said Zhirinovskiy was reminded that French law concerning  visitors to France was applicable in his case and that his  activities should be linked to his stated purpose for coming  here, that is to attend the Council of Europe session.    He said Zhirinovskiy's visa application to France was  approved only so that he could attend the parliamentary session  in Strasbourg.    Zhirinovskiy is part of the 18-strong Russian delegation  attending the Parliamentary Assembly. Russia has had "special  guest" status since 1992.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Misplaced confidence A surprising faith in the government's generosity has been revealed by a telephone poll seeking people's views about the payment of mortgage interest relief for people who have been made redundant. Just over one in three think the government will pay all the interest from day one. In fact, it will do so only after 16 weeks. The poll, conducted by Audience Selection, was commissioned by Alliance &amp; Leicester building society which, until November 12, is offering a year's free unemployment insurance with its fixed rate or discounted mortgages. In the case of a joint mortgage, the insurance pays half the amount if one borrower becomes redundant. More generally, however, the poll comes against a background of lobbying by mortgage lenders to try to prevent the government curtailing mortgage interest payments for people on income support. Already, the payments are not available for loans above Pounds 125,000, or for people with more than Pounds 8,000 savings. There were more mortgage rate announcements this week. Woolwich has increased its standard variable rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 8.1 per cent, the same as the Halifax. Midland, National Westminster and Lloyds bank are all moving to 8.1 and join Barclays bank, which made its announcement earlier. Variable rates at Scottish banks are better - the Royal Bank of Scotland has passed on the full half percentage point increase but its standard variable rate is now 7.99 per cent. Bank of Scotland also moves to 7.99 per cent on Monday from 7.64 per cent.</p>

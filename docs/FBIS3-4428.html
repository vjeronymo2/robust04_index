At the closing session, Major General Wang Zhicheng,  provincial party committee standing committee member and  military district commander, delivered a speech in which he  spoke of strengthening party leadership over the armed forces  and constantly improving the people's militia reserve forces  under the new circumstances.    The closing session was presided over by Cheng Andong,  provincial party committee standing committee member, Xian City  CPC Committee secretary, and Xian Military Subarea CPC Committee  first secretary.    In his speech, Commander Wang Zhicheng stated: It is one of  the fine traditions of the CPC and the People's Liberation Army  to ensure strong party leadership over armed forces, this being  also an important task assigned to the local party committees  and people's governments by the CPC Central Committee and the  Central Military Commission. Placing the armed forces under  party leadership is also a fundamental guarantee of successfully  handling new situations and new problems in the course of the  people's militia reserve forces development and of building  stronger national defense reserve forces under market economic  conditions.    Commander Wang Zhicheng expressed the hope that leaders at  all levels across the province will show concern for and  effectively manage armed forces, actively support and build the  armed forces, and make important contributions to the armed  forces development. In the meantime, he said leading organs and  people's armed forces departments at all levels across the  province should organize and mobilize people's militia reserve  forces personnel to cultivate a spirit of selfless devotion and  actively promote two civilizations building in local areas.    Also attending yesterday's closing session were provincial  and Xian City leaders, city district and county party committees  secretaries, county magistrates, and others.</p>

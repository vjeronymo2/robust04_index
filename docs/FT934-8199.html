			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Optimism over Uruguay Round accord OPTIMISM has grown this week among trade negotiators in Geneva that a trade liberalising Uruguay Round accord can be completed successfully by the deadline of December 15, despite concern over the potentially damaging impact of rejection by the US Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'You can see it coming together,' a top US negotiator noted: 'It's hard to believe that any of the issues remaining will hang the agreement.' Although negotiators failed to meet the November 15 deadline for completion of a tariff-cutting market access package, confidence has been buoyed by successful completion of draft texts on a proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation to succeed Gatt and improved disputes settlement. EU negotiators are also due to table proposals for trade in audio-visual services, while the US is urging reform of dumping rules. The slippage in the market access talks largely reflects the inability of the US and EU to resolve their outstanding differences. Next week's meeting in Washington between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, is critical in breaking the logjam between the two. The EU says it will lower fish tariffs and will cut duties on electronics and non-ferrous metals if the US cuts very high textiles tariffs. Washington is due to table a revised tariff offer in Geneva this week. US negotiators made light yesterday of the effect on the Uruguay Round talks of Congressional rejection of Nafta. 'A lot in Congress who voted against Nafta would go out of their way to say they are not going protectionist,' said one.</p>

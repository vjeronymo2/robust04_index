We wanted to get an answer to this question on the  basis of a survey of a 1,000-head sample representing the  country's population over the age of 15 that was carried out by  the Szonda Ipsos Public Opinion Research company in January 1994.    During the survey, the people questioned first had to say  whether they find it acceptable for a person who is in one of  the following nine groups to become a member of the next  government and plays an important political role. The replies  were as follows.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Group                    |Acceptable               |Unacceptable             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Younger than 35          |76                       |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Had a leading role in pr-|51                       |49                       |  |evious system            |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moved back to Hungary fr-|39                       |61                       |  |om abroad                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parents were communist l-|66                       |34                       |  |eaders                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Is a member of a nationa-|77                       |23                       |  |l minority               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Is unfaithful to his mar-|63                       |37                       |  |riage partner            |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Does not believe in God  |79                       |21                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Is of Jewish origin      |83                       |17                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Homosexual               |34                       |64                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The answers show that the vast majority of the Hungarian  population has no objections against a young, national minority,  atheist, or Jewish person playing a leading role in Hungarian  politics. For about two-thirds of the voters, it is not an  important factor making a political role impossible if someone  is adulterous or if his parents were communist leaders.  However, only half of those who replied considered leading  positions in the previous regime compatible with a future  governmental position, and the majority of the public clearly  rejects those who have moved back from abroad or are  homosexuals: Nearly two-thirds of the questioned people  considered it unacceptable for them to have a serious political  position.    Apart from those who oppose the political role of people  returning from abroad, the social-demographic characteristics of  people who reject the other groups are very similar. Elderly  people, people with lower levels of education, people living in  small villages, people with low incomes, and those who are  inactive or dependent are represented more than the average.  People with lower schooling generally gave more negative  answers than the average. The rejection of people under 35,  those who are returning from abroad, who are adulterous,  atheists, or homosexuals increases with the increase of age, and  it is mainly village dwellers who reject those who deceive their  partners, Jews, and homosexuals taking on a political role. It  is worth looking at the answers in relation to the political  orientation of the person replying (Table 2). Examining the  left-wing, liberal, and conservative voters in groups -- placing  all those who selected a party in one of the groups -- we can  see that an important political role when the person is young,  member of a national minority, of Jewish origin, adulterous, or  homosexual is most acceptable to the liberal voters. The liberal  voters mainly reject those who are returning from abroad or  played a political role in the previous system, and most of them  do not find the political role of homosexuals acceptable,  although fewer of them reject this than people among the  conservative voters.    Naturally, the largest proportion of left-wing voters find  it  acceptable for atheists, children of communist parents, and  former functionaries to play an important political role, but a  large majority of them do not reject the political role of  national minority or Jewish people. However, it is interesting  that more of them reject young people -- on this issue, they are  closer to the views of the conservative voters -- and they  particularly reject people returning from abroad. On this  issue, the liberal and conservative voters are closer to each  other, just as in the rejection of the future important role of  former leaders.    The conservative voters are extremely opposed to homosexuals  or former cadres taking on political roles, however, they are  mainly in contrast with the majority of the whole population in  the fact that their majority finds it unacceptable for children  of communist parents to have an important role in the country's  leadership.

The statistical  analysis distinguished three groups of opinions. The first  group in which the views rejecting adulterous, atheist, Jewish,  and homosexual people appear together is obviously characterized  by a traditional and prejudiced attitude. The second group of  opinions, which is dominated by the rejection of former  functionaries and the children of communist parents, is  characterized by an anti-communist attitude, while the third  group of opinions, in which the rejection of people under the  age of 35 and those returning from abroad are together, can be  seen as a conservative attitude. [passage omitted]    The distribution of the replies indicates the dilemmas into  which a "negative campaign" can sweep parties belonging to the  various groups. According to the data, the relative majority of  those who replied represent a liberal attitude at the moment,  but it can also be seen that some one-fifth of the liberal,  left-wing, and uncertain voters, mainly those of lower social  status, can easily change their mind under the influence of a  powerful negative campaign. It is not certain that this kind of  campaign would, at the same time, strengthen the conservative  parties, because many of their voters have a liberal attitude  and a vehement negative campaign can make these people uncertain  in their choice of party, as was seen after Istvan Csurka's  [them member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum] actions in the  summer of 1992.    It is also striking that the voters of left-wing and  conservative parties are mainly divided by their attitude to the  previous system, rather than by their relationship to the  liberal and conservative attitudes. While 60 percent of the  voters of liberal parties belong to the group characterized by a  liberal attitude and 40 percent to the conservative attitude,  the proportion in the case of the voters of left-wing and  conservative parties is the opposite: Some 40 percent of them  are characterized by liberal attitudes and 60 percent by  conservative attitudes. Therefore, from this point of view, the  profile of left-wing and conservative voting bases are similar  to each other. [passage omitted]    In the course of our survey, we attempted to find out if  there is a group in society that is consistently mistaken in its  judgment on the distribution of opinions and is, as a result,  more susceptible to the influence of campaign messages. We  examined how many times the people surveyed were able to say  what the majority view was on the nine questions they were  asked, and how many times they were wrong.    On the basis of the social and demographic characteristics,  the group that was completely unable to give an estimate can be  best isolated from the rest: Many more people over the age of  60, with lower schooling, with income in the lowest 10 percent,  who are religious, and many of whom said they did not wish to  participate in the elections can be found in this group than the  average. Accurate estimates were mainly given by people in  Budapest, with highest incomes, and people in their 50's. These  social groups have many Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  supporters, therefore, the proportion of people giving accurate  estimates was also higher than the average among the MSZP  supporters.    However, there is not much difference in the accuracy of the  estimates between the various groups of voters, although  somewhat more of the opposition supporters were able to form an  accurate opinion on the public view.    To sum up the results of the survey, we can say that the  majority of Hungarian society definitely rejects the future  political role of only homosexuals and people returning from  abroad, and to a smaller extent, functionaries of the former  regime, and the vast majority formed an accurate view of  society's dominant views. It is unlikely that the other  stereotypes of a possible negative campaign would have much  influence. Therefore, people against whom these campaigns are  directed do not risk much if they respond, thereby strengthening  the consensus of the majority.    Nevertheless, there is a group in society that might also be  vulnerable to a negative campaign. However, for the bigger  parties, giving gestures to this group of people might be risky  because this might alienate the rest of their voters. In  addition to this, this group's willingness to vote is rather  low, and a negative campaign is mainly suitable for changing the  views of already committed voters, rather than for mobilizing  people.</p>

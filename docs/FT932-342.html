			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner wins control of Investa ANDERS Wilhelmsen, the privately-owned Norwegian shipowner, has acquired control of Investa, the unlisted Norwegian investment group, for NKr350m (Dollars 48.8m) from a group of 34 financial creditors. Investa collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.4bn in debt, of which NKr2.8bn was in unsecured loans in the form of debt notes and commercial paper. The deal brings Wilco, Wilhelmsen's main subsidiary, an 87.8 per cent stake in Investa and an 90.2 per cent stake in the Norwegian Golar Nor group, which owns the Petrojarl oil and gas production testing vessel. Mr Endre Ording Sund, chief executive of Anders Wilhelmsen, said yesterday his company planned to develop Golar Nor, which has had six owners in the past eight years. Mr Sund said several companies had expressed interest in becoming a joint partner. The deal also gives the group 80 per cent of the shares of Nydalen Company, an Oslo bourse-listed real estate company, which has about 500,000 sq m of property in Norway. Wilhelmsen will also secure control of Nydalen's board. Wilhelmsen also gets a 47 per cent stake in Euronav, the French shipowner, in which it will gain a seat on the board. The deal also brings Wilhelmsen a 7.5 per cent stake in Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group. Mr Sund said his company intended to be a long-term investor in Vard, whose shares he feels are considerably under-priced. Yesterday, Vard's shares closed on the Oslo bourse NKr1.25 lower at NKr16.25. Wilhelmsen already holds 50 per cent of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the world's second-biggest cruise group and Vard's main competitor. Mr Sund said his company was likely to gain full control of Investa and of Golar Nor and end expects soon to enter talks with minority creditors.</p>

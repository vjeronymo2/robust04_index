			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (10): The picture is rather cloudy - Satellite television THE FUTURE of Australia's subscription television remains murky as the government desperately tries to clear the mess created by its bungled bidding process for the licences for satellite-delivered services. In April this year, the government awarded the rights to two licences to industry dark horses. Bidding was strictly on a highest-price basis, and the two newcomers defeated the race favourite, the powerful consortium led by Rupert Murdoch, the media baron, Kerry Packer, and Telecom. The winning bidders were UCOM Pty, which offered ADollars 177m (Dollars 120m), and Hi Vision, which tendered ADollars 212m (Dollars 144m). Australia's subscription television policy allows for three satellite-delivered services. The two licences are for four-channel operations. The third licence has been reserved for the national Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The media industry gasped at the very high prices offered by the winners. Speculation had the rich Murdoch-Packer consortium and the US Continental Cable group offering less than ADollars 100m each. The government, on the other hand, immediately realised the folly of its decision and that it had been out-foxed by two industry upstarts. The two winners had put up unrealistic and purely speculative bids to guarantee that they got the winning spots. They have also put in cascading bids so that they remained in the game as the licences were re-awarded to the 'next highest bidders'. To contain its embarrassment, the government quickly revised the bidding rules. It required the next highest bidders to pay a non-refundable five per cent deposit within three days of winning. The patch-up job was obviously amateur and calls for the head of Senator Bob Collins, the communications minister, grew louder. Only the intervention of the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, saved the day for the beleaguered minister. As expected, the two winners failed to produce the cash for their original bids. Bidding cascaded and in August, after six rounds of failed bids from the same parties, UCOM paid a five per cent deposit on a price of ADollars 97m for the first licence, ADollars 80m less than its original tender. A company associated with UCOM, New World Telecommunications, also paid a deposit for Hi Vision's bid of ADollars 117m, ADollars 95m less than the original figure. The deposits should have provided some relief to the government. However, they have raised yet another problem, that of media cross-ownership. The Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog, is now examining whether UCOM, having paid for HI-Vision's deposit, has breached competition laws. Under the government's subscription television policy, a company that holds one licence is allowed to have no more than two per cent interest in the company holding the other licence. Mr Albert Hadid, the controlling shareholder of the UCOM group, said that UCOM's cross-ownership of the two licences would be within the law. He promised that Australia's first subscription television would start operating by July next year. Mr Hadid has the financial backing of the Lenfest group, a small Pennsylvania-based cable TV operator. Meanwhile, the Murdoch-Packer-Telecom group has abandoned all interest in satellite-delivered services. It is now putting up plans for an alternative cable network for limited residential markets. The government had previously put all its weight behind satellite subscription television. It has argued that cable and microwave-delivered services would not provide a national coverage. But with the satellite service merely crawling into reality, the government seems prepared to review the merits of other methods of delivering subscription television.</p>

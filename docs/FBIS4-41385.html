			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Viktor Grebenshchikov, the presidential state  adviser, does not rule out that the contradictions on the draft  decree on a special legal status of the Gagauzs agreed between  the leaderships of Moldova and Gagauzia is "the result of a  certain influence on the representatives of this region from the  outside."    IF Note: Last Monday leadership of the self-proclaimed  Gagauz  republic accused Moldovan authorities of falsification of the  draft decree on a special legal status of the regions densely  populated with Gagauzs, which was agreed earlier, and declared  that "despite the agreement Moldova's parliamentary commission  has unilaterally introduced its changes into the document."  Having called this move "a unilateral and unprecedented act,"  the Gagauz leadership asserted that it could not been made  without the knowledge and consent of President Mircea Snegur and  parliament chairman Pyotr Luchinsky.    In his exclusive interview with Interfax Grebenshchikov  asserted that such actions have the aim to delay the process of  the decree's adoption and finally the the aim to link solution  of this issue with granting a special juridical status to  Transdniestria. "These are quite different things and the Gagauz  leaders understand this quite well, Grebenshchikov said. As for  Gagauzia, the question concerns the fate of the ethnos which has  the right for existence and development. Transdniestria's  problem is a political one."    Grebenshchikov refused to give his estimate to the last  statements of the Gagauz leaders "about serious contradictions  on the draft decree." He qualified the attempts of the  opposition to assert that Gagauzia is a republic as  "demonstration of a certain extremism." As Grebenshchikov said,  Article 1 of this draft concretely stipulates that Gagauzia is  "a national-territorial autonomous entity as a form of  self-determination of the Gagauzs and is a constituent part of  the Republic of Moldova." "There are no contradictions between  the parties regarding this Article," Grebenshchikov asserted.    He expressed his conviction saying that in the near term  leaderships of Kishinev and Komrat "will come to a common  denominator." (INTERFAX has learned that leaders of Moldova and  Gagauzia are to meet next week). Grebenshchikov hopes that the  Moldovan parliament would adopt the decree on Gagauzia's special  legal status before its summer vacations.</p>

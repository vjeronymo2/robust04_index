			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for Licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> J. W. Durham, Sr., Esquire, Sr. V. P. and General Counsel, Philadelphia Electric Company, 2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Charles L. Miller.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Power Authority of The State of New York, Docket No. 50&hyph;286, Indian Point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> June 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes would alter the Plant Operating Review Committee's (PORC's) membership requirements and would delegate a portion of PORC's procedure review responsibilities for nuclear safety related procedures and procedure changes to the line organizations. Section 6.5, ``Review and Audit,'' of the Technical Specifications (TSs) would be revised to modify the composition of the PORC and delete review and audit responsibilities for the Emergency and Security Plans from the TSs. The review and audit responsibilities would be relocated to the respective Emergency and Security Plans consistent with Generic Letter 93&hyph;07, ``Modification of the Technical Specification Administrative Control Requirements for Emergency and Security Plans.'' The proposed changes would also revise Section 6.5 and Section 6.8, ``Procedures,'' of the TSs to delegate a portion of the PORC's procedure review responsibilities for nuclear safety related procedures to the line organizations. The PORC would continue to perform safety reviews associated with procedures that are of safety significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards based on the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since: (1) PORC will continue to review environmental impact and 10 CFR 50.59 safety evaluations associated with procedures and procedure changes; (2) Only personnel knowledgeable in the affected functional areas will review procedures and procedure changes; (3) Review and approval personnel (designated technical reviewers, qualified safety reviewers and responsible procedure owners) will be identified in the appropriate administrative procedures; (4) Designated technical reviewers shall meet or exceed the qualifications described in Section 4 of ANSI N18.1&hyph;1971 [*&blank;*&blank;*] for applicable positions and are designated by the Department Managers; 5) The designated technical reviewers will be responsible for identifying whether additional cross disciplinary reviews are required; (6) The qualified safety reviewers will be responsible for reviewing the procedure changes from a safety perspective; (7) The responsible procedure owners are designated by the Resident Manager; and (8) The responsible procedure owners will be responsible for verifying that procedure reviews are performed in accordance with the administrative procedure governing the procedure review and approval process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes (1) will add more detailed requirements regarding procedure review and approval to the Technical Specifications which will strengthen the controls over the process, and (2) will free PORC from reviewing items that are outside the charter of a ``safety review'' committee [*&blank;*&blank;*] [because non-safety significant items can reduce the time that PORC members can spend on matters that are safety significant. The proposed Technical Specification change establishes a highly structured review and approval program for procedures.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the PORC membership requirements would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident because it does not adversely affect the level of expertise applied to the PORC review function or its effectiveness. The PORC quorum is currently composed of five members including up to two designated alternates and a Chairman. [*&blank;*&blank;*] [This composition is not changed by the proposed amendment.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval process or the PORC membership requirements cannot affect the probability or consequences of an accident because they do not affect plant operations[,] [*&blank;*&blank;*] equipment[, or any safety-related activity.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [*&blank;*&blank;*] [No physical changes to the plant or changes in plant equipment operating procedures are being proposed.] The changes are administrative and will not have any direct effect on equipment important to safety. Changing the process by which procedures are reviewed and approved cannot in itself create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. Furthermore, a documented safety review, utilizing screening criteria, will be performed for all nuclear safety related procedures and procedure changes. The proposed change establishes detailed controls while allowing PORC to spend more time on safety significant issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the PORC membership requirements would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated since no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval or the PORC Membership requirements cannot create the possibility of an accident because they do not affect plant operations[,] [*&blank;*&blank;*] equipment [or any safety-related activity.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

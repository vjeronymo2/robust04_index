			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Squeeze on costs that is threatening more providers of training Sir, Unfortunately, Lisa Wood's article ('Training shunted to the slow track', January 21) on the dilemma faced by voluntary sector employment training (ET) and youth training (YT) providers in England and Wales also reflects the situation in Scotland. Although the voluntary sector here has maintained around a third of total ET places, the perennial pressure to reduce costs threatens to squeeze out more and more providers. Our concern is that ET will contract to a narrower fast-track scheme for the most able. It remains the task of voluntary bodies to prevent the Department of Employment defaulting on its commitments to trainees with special needs. Inevitably, this will entail more flexible arrangements for those whose training costs more and takes longer. Ian Brown, enterprise &amp; training officer, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, 24a Annandale Street, Edinburgh EH7 4AN</p>

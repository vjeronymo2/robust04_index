			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Judge keeps Noriega jury deliberating THE jury in the drug-trafficking conspiracy trial of the Panamanian former leader, General Manuel Antonio Noriega, said yesterday it was deadlocked, but the trial judge in Miami sent it back for more deliberations. The jurors seem in disagreement about one of the fundamental aspects of the case - whether or not Gen Noriega took bribes from the cocaine cartel in Medelln, Colombia, in return for protection. To prove this arrangement is central to the US government's case. Only if a business link is found to exist can the general be found guilty of two charges under the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organisation laws, the most serious of the 10 charges. The jury had asked Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday for transcripts of the testimony of 10 prosecution witnesses who claimed personal knowledge of Gen Noriega's arrangements with the cartel.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Premier Health cuts losses Pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.91m were announced by Premier Health Group, the healthcare services concern, for the year to December 31. There were restated losses of Pounds 9.37m for 1992. The result was struck after Pounds 640,000 exceptional charges resulting from the sale of IMC Europe, its continuity sales arm, and Pounds 486,000 refinancing and restructuring costs. The company said the year was one of consolidation, including the refinancing completed on September 3, which included a capital reduction involving the cancellation of Pounds 16.8m share capital and Pounds 26.5m share premium against the deficit on the profit and loss account. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 17.2m) including Pounds 173,000 (Pounds 4.22m) from discontinued activities. Increased operating losses of Pounds 2m (Pounds 595,000) were 'disappointing', the company said, but reflected the rebuilding of Nursing Management Services, its international healthcare business which has relocated from California to Atlanta. There were losses of Pounds 203,000 from IMC and its disposal in April marked the final step in focusing the group on healthcare. Losses per share fell to 1p (3.2p).</p>

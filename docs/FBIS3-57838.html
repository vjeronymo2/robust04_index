			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal </F> Employment Office, by Gernot Facius and Hans-Werner Loose; place  and date not given: "I Do Not Get Nervous When the Instruments  of Torture Are Shown"]    [Excerpt] [DIE WELT] Cassandra is in: At the turn of the  millennium mass unemployment of about 6 million people is being  predicted. Weimar 2000?    [Jagoda] Unfortunately, Cassandra was right with her somber  predictions. Therefore, I refuse to give this name to  pessimists, who are currently very popular. The renowned  Prognos Institute in Basel expects a decline of unemployment all  over Germany to about 3 million by the turn of the millennium.    [DIE WELT] Good prospects for a late improvement, but things  are getting worse at the moment. How many unemployed will there  be in 1994?    [Jagoda] I assume an annual average of about 3.8 million  unemployed -- about 2.6 million in the west and about 1.2  million in the east. These would be 300,000 to 400,000 more  than in 1993.    [DIE WELT] Will the labor market in united Germany remain  divided?    [Jagoda] Yes, and the situation is slowly improving in the  east. Signs of that are multiplying. In the worst case we will  keep stability at a low employment level in the new laender.    [DIE WELT] By means of job creation with the taxpayers'  money?    [Jagoda] In the new laender in 1994 we will no longer be  able to cushion 1.4 million people with an active labor market  policy. This is, however, also due to the fact that the  instrument of retirement transition money and early retirement  will no longer be so effective. Many of the 900,000 who have  made use of that are now reaching retirement age. In job  creation we can do a bit more again than in 1993. Basically, I  say: Things in the east are improving gradually; in the west  economic development will start again; the increase in  productivity will, however, be approximately as high as growth,  which means that nothing is left for more employment.    [DIE WELT] Light in the east, darkness in the west?    [Jagoda] Unfortunately. The increase in unemployment will  mainly hit the old laender.    [DIE WELT] Is a new wave of layoffs threatening in the west?    [Jagoda] Some structural adjustments will be unavoidable.  We are entering the new year with a high number of unemployed.  In 1993 job losses were concentrated primarily in the  manufacturing industry. A total of 90 percent of the people  working short hours come from this sector. The danger is not  yet over, but there is reason for hope.    [DIE WELT] Where do you see the silver lining?    [Jagoda] In working short hours, which is not free. I  interpret this as a hope that companies will be able to overcome  the problems and keep their employees.    [DIE WELT] For the time being it is still primarily the big  companies that are stumbling. Will the medium-sized companies  also get into turbulent waters?    [Jagoda] The medium-sized companies will also feel the  harsher wind of competition. However, they are able to react  more flexibly and quicker. This is an opportunity. Much has  already been done to improve the position of the companies. I  expect that his will begin to pay off in 1995 at the latest.    [DIE WELT] This is an alleviation of the suffering. When  will recovery come?    [Jagoda] Unemployment can be reduced to a tolerable level  only if more is again invested in jobs. For this purpose, our  economy has to develop new markets. In addition, unemployment  could be considerably reduced by expanding part-time work.  About 16 percent in Germany have part-time jobs, in the  Netherlands about one-third.    [DIE WELT] Which means....    [Jagoda] ...that we could employ up to 2 million people more  and thus have 2 million unemployed less if we had Dutch  conditions in Germany. We need an offensive to create more  jobs, e.g. by distributing work differently. We are not in the  lead in this field in Europe.    [DIE WELT] Are the contributions to unemployment insurance  sufficient to pay the army of unemployed?    [Jagoda] No. Therefore, the Federal Government will help  the Federal Employment Office also in 1994: 18 billion marks  are allocated as subsidies in the federal budget. Another 8  billion are ready to be used as liquidation aid.    [DIE WELT] Are your mechanisms sufficient to control the  ailing labor market?    [Jagoda] We can only play the accompanying music. Even if  more jobs are abolished than are taken into consideration in the  Federal Employment Office's budget, which I consider unlikely,  everyone will still get his unemployment benefits. Unemployment  benefits are a compulsory service; here the Federal Government  has to pay what is needed.    [DIE WELT] Do you still have money left for labor market  policy measures?    [Jagoda] The Federal Employment Office, too, must make great  efforts in view of the difficult financial situation. But we do  not capitulate, and in 1994, too, we will spend considerable  amounts of money on labor market policy in order to prevent  additional unemployment of 1.5 million in west and east.    [DIE WELT] And when will the state again put its fingers  into the pockets of those who have jobs, to fill the gap?    [Jagoda] At the moment the contribution is 6.5 percent.  This will remain so in 1994. I do not think that a raise is  possible. The social contributions that burden the companies and  the employers have reached the upper limit.    [DIE WELT] And this will remain so?    [Jagoda] Hopefully not. When the labor markets in the west  and the east grow together and the structures are comparable,  the contributions will go down.    [DIE WELT] To what level?    [Jagoda] At first to a 5 in front of the decimal point.    [DIE WELT] Wolfgang Schaeuble wants a clear difference  between wages for working people and wage compensation payments  for unemployed. Do you agree?    [Jagoda] Our benefits for unemployed are not excessive.  There is no fat left that could be removed. Whoever has paid  contributions all his life, loses his job at 55, and does not  have children, gets 60 percent of his last net salary from us.  If I reduce that, I cross the threshold of pain and drive  people into illegal employment.    [DIE WELT] Does new work fall from the sky like manna?    [Jagoda] Certainly not. But instead of complaining, we  should think back to our strengths. From 1983 to 1991 the  German economy created more than 3 million new jobs. Why should  that no longer be possible in the future?    [DIE WELT] Have our managers slept through the future?    [Jagoda] At least 40 percent of the west German  manufacturing industry companies have not engaged in any  activities for innovations over the past two years. This gives  food for thought.    [DIE WELT] Can we still catch up with the technological lead  of the competition from Asia and the United States?    [Jagoda] We have certainly not been left behind by  technological development. Others, however, have caught up and  can produce some things more cheaply. If one has recognized a  deficit and starts to remedy it, this is progress. In this  respect, the recession and structural crisis were certainly very  instructive for some companies.    [DIE WELT] Do only economic refugees still see Germany as an  attractive business location?    [Jagoda] This is highly exaggerated. However, we must  become aware of our importance as a business location. Many  decisionmaking processes are still far too protracted in our  country. In the future, it will not be the big ones that devour  the small ones in competition but the quick ones that devour the  slow ones. Research in Germany has to be conducted far more  intensively and with more cooperation. Not only the patent  statistics show that the brakes must be released a bit. We must  roll up our sleeves again and struggle for the world market.    [DIE WELT] Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the German Trade  Union Federation, spoke in DIE WELT of a "real danger of  strikes" -- in the west German metal industry. Would a strike  counteract efforts for new jobs?    [Jagoda] A strike is always bad. However, strikes are a  legitimate recourse in the wage conflict. One should not moan  if the culture of struggle is exercised. I do not get nervous  when everyone puts his instruments of torture -- here a strike,  there lockouts -- on the table. The German partners to the wage  negotiations have been very responsible about strikes in the  past. This will not change this year, either. Right now, it is  shown that the partners to the wage negotiations are also able  to find new answers to new questions. This should give rise to  optimism.    [DIE WELT] Is one of the answers that you positively assess  the four-day working week, or is this just camouflaged working  short hours?    [Jagoda] Not if it is the usual working hours in a specific  company. The four-day work week at Volkswagen is a model for  new distribution of work, a real innovation that breaks many  taboos.    [DIE WELT] Can this model be transferred to other companies  and branches?    [Jagoda] Not just like that, but the topic of "flex time" is  now on the table. Wherever one works with great efficiency and  high productivity, I can imagine this very well. This has  nothing to do with the size of the company and the branch.  However, a four-day work week is possible only in those places  where wages are far above average and where it is compensated  not from another cash source but through renunciation.

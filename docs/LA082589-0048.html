			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A blind man who prosecutors say entered a bank and robbed it of $950 was  released into the custody of another blind man. San Francisco Municipal Judge  Charles James ruled that 34-year-old ex-welder Richard Dunbar can remain free  without bond during plea proceedings on charges of second-degree burglary and  grand theft. Dunbar was arrested at the teller's window of a Bank of America  branch earlier this month. He was released into the custody of 38-year-old  William Douglas of Eureka. Dunbar declared at the time of the incident that he  had become desperate because he was robbed of all of his Social Security money  during a mugging. The judge ordered Dunbar back to court next month to enter a  plea.  </P></p>

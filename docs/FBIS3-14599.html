They reviewed the status of the industrial  sector in Jordan as a result of the sanctions imposed on Iraq  and the measures being taken in the Red Sea, which delay the  arrival of imports and increase their costs, thus increasing the  cost of Jordanian products and reducing their competitiveness.  Details are in the following report:    Khaldun Abu-Hassan told the UN official that Jordan feels it  is being targeted by these measures. He said that the cost of  these measures increases the cost of shipping every tonne of  goods by $15, which constitutes an additional cost to Jordan  amounting to approximately $600 million per year. He noted that  the measures have also resulted in damaging some of the goods  that undergo inspection. He added that delays in the arrival of  these goods has also forced exporters to pay fines to the  parties who have ordered these good.    He said that preventing the import of certain raw materials  from Iraq resulted in increasing the cost of local production,  which is the case with importing sulfur that led to an increase  in the cost of producing fertilizers in Jordan.    Abu-Hassan noted that Jordan was affected by the Gulf crisis  on a larger scale by losing some of its traditional markets, not  including Iraq, and the return of thousands of Jordanians  working in the Gulf states. This, he added, has affected the  Jordanian economy and increased poverty and unemployment.    The head of the Chamber of Industry said that the UN  Sanctions Committee's resolution is not based on firm standards,  noting that if it sometimes allows the export of a certain  commodity to Iraq, it does not mean that it will allow the  continuous export of this commodity.    For his part, Mr. (Jeng), secretary of the UN Sanctions  Committee, reaffirmed that Jordan is not being targeted by the  sanctions but is being affected by them. He noted that the  Sanctions Committee is aware that Jordan is the second country  after Iraq that is being harmed by the sanctions. He said that  he would present a memorandum from the Chamber of Industry to  the UN Sanctions Committee and will brief them on Jordan's  situation.    The two sides discussed a proposal by the chamber to send a  delegation representing the various sectors harmed by the  sanctions to express their viewpoint to the Sanctions Committee  and hold contacts with the Jordanian Government to discuss and  arrange this visit. (Jeng) expressed willingness to follow up  this proposal.    In another development, Muhammad 'Asfur, chairman of the  Board of Directors of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, received a  Canadian economic delegation, including a number of businessmen  and representatives of Canadian companies. A number of  Jordanian businessmen attended.    'Asfur reviewed Jordanian-Canadian economic relations, the  economic situation in Jordan, the negative effects of the siege  on the port of al-'Aqabah, the losses and the increase in the  prices of commodities and products that have resulted from  inspections and from other measures taken under the pretext of  implementing UN resolutions.    The guest delegation expressed its understanding of Jordan's  stands and economic situation and its willingness to increase  and reinforce trade and economic exchange between the two  friendly countries. The delegation also expressed a desire to  exert efforts to lift the siege on the ships bound for the port  of al-'Aqabah.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank joins rescue effort for dairy DEUTSCHE Bank, the agricultural ministry of Saxony and Sudmilch of Stuttgart will try to arrange a rescue package for Sachsenmilch, the one eastern German company listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Sachsenmilch, a Saxon-based dairy, is part of the Sudmilch group. Deutsche Bank, which helped it go public in 1991, had the shares suspended after disclosures of over-spending. Deutsche Bank, the company's principal creditor, says it was not told about cost overruns by Sachsenmilch's former management. 'The facts were withheld from us. . . . .If we had known, we would have had thought twice about going public,' the bank said. The shares, floated at DM80, were suspended at DM60.</p>

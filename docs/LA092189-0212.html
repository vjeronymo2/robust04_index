			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: COLLEGE PARK/COLONY: FOCUS;  </P> <P> GOOD MORNING, BUENOS DIAS, CHOA EM , BUON GIORNO . . .  </P> <P> Echoes of more than 70 different exotic phrases have resounded throughout the  halls of the College Park Elementary School, thanks to its English-assimilation  instruction programs. The school is one of two elementary schools in Irvine  offering ESL (English as a Second Language) courses to students.  </P> <P> Because of the influx of immigrants into Southern California, the need for  bilingual and ESL learning became a must at the school five years ago. At the  College Park school, on Chaparral Avenue, there are two ESL magnet classes --  one class for grades one through three and the other for grades four through  six.  </P> <P> The ESL magnet program involves teaching children, in English, who have very  little or no interpretation or comprehension of the language. Most of the  instruction is done through visual aids and constant repetition. This concept  is sometimes tagged "motherly." The one-semester (nine months) program is  "orally intensive," says Maureen Terry, who taught an ESL class for two years  at College Park and is now reinitiating an interactive video class for the  Irvine Unified School District. "Children are like sponges -- you'd be  surprised how quickly they absorb everything. As long as you make their  environment comfortable, the atmosphere relaxed and use the hands-on approach,  they'll be eager to learn."  </P> <P> When students use their native language, educators give them an example in  English rather than scolding them. Teachers have found this technique  encourages the children to use English while respecting their native tongue.  </P> <P> Kathy Allard was among the first to teach and assist in instituting this  program five years ago at the College Park school.  </P> <P> "I love teaching children," she said. "I couldn't do it if I didn't. They bring  me great joy. This summer to get a better understanding of the culture of the  majority of my students, I went to Japan."  </P> <P> Allard has 27 children in her class -- 15 are Japanese, three are Taiwanese,  three are Latino, two are Italian, one is Costa Rican, one is Lebanese, one is  Vietnamese and one is Norwegian.  </P> <P> The College Park/Colony and its environs does include other properties along  with its unusual and highly-acclaimed school. The Colony area is northeast of  Walnut Avenue and was built in three phases 16 years ago, The Colony, Colony I  and Colony II. Four different styles of homes are situated on streets given  such names as Hemingway, Steinbeck and Wyeth. For the Colony residents'  convenience, there is the Walnut Village Center (a mini-shopping center) at  Culver Drive and Walnut Avenue.  </P> <P> Southwest of Walnut Avenue is the College Park residential tract. But don't  expect to find street signs with college names; they don't exist. Instead, they  have been given names of trees.  </P> <P> About a mile away, both sides of Jamboree Boulevard are lined with acres of  vacant space, with the exception of a few trucks, pieces of equipment and a  pile of rocks being stored there. The Irvine Co., which owns the land, has no  development plans at present.  </P> <P> For the entire community's pleasure, a 20.4-acre park -- Harvard Community  Athletic Park -- has been on Harvard Avenue for 12 years now. It is a  multipurpose facility with a snack bar, lighted softball, baseball and soccer  fields, and a community building where meetings and other neighborhood  functions are held.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 6,142  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +24.3%  </P> <P> Median Age: 34.3  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White: (non-Latino) 78%  </P> <P> Latino: 9%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 12%  </P> <P> By sex and age: In hundreds  </P> <P> MALES Median age: 33.8 years  </P> <P> FEMALES Median age: 34.6 years  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $15,685  </P> <P> Median household: $47,198  </P> <P> Average household: $49,838  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000 12%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999 31%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999 46%  </P> <P> More than $75,000 11%Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

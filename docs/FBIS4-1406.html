			<p>BFN     [Text] The current national flag, the orange, white and  blue will flutter for the last time today before government  buildings. It will be lowered at midnight and be replaced by a  flag entirely foreign to the nation, the flag of the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council].    Afrikaner National Front leader Ferdi Hartzenberg will hoist  the liberation flag at midnight tonight at Donkerhoek.  According to the National Front, the flag will be regarded as a  freedom symbol until such time that the future national republic  introduces another flag. Dr. Hartzenberg will render a brief  address during the occasion. The ceremony will be coupled with  prayers.    Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg has also requested flag-raising on  Wednesday between 0400 GMT and 0500 GMT. In a statement, he  requested the flag-raising to take place in every town and city.  He has asked that the national flag and the liberation flag,  such as the four-color or the Orange Free State flag, be hoisted  during the occasion and that the national anthem of South  Africa, "Die Stem" ["The Voice"], be sung or played over loud  hailers.</p>

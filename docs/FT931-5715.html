			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: French group sets out to bid for medicine wholesaler A FRENCH consortium which includes Rhone-Poulenc, the country's biggest chemicals group, is attempting to raise between FFr1.5bn (Dollars 269m) and FFr2.5bn to make a counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's biggest medicines wholesaler. Its aim is to outbid Gehe, Germany's second-largest wholesaler, which last month announced a friendly takeover of OCP for FFr800 a share, valuing the company at FFr1.8bn. A takeover by Gehe would form Europe's largest drugs wholesaling company with sales of around DM14bn a year. The consortium, which includes a number of leading French investment banks and drugs groups, has been pulled together by Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister. The Bourely family, which owns 15 per cent of OCP and is the group's largest shareholder, is understood to oppose the German takeover. Mr Dieter Kammerer, vice-president of Gehe, said he was shocked by the intervention of the government and pharmaceuticals groups. He said there was no industrial logic for drugs companies to be involved in wholesaling. Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP chief executive, supports the deal. Under the agreement OCP management would control the German group's wholesaling operations which represent 80 per cent of its turn-over. However, French pharmaceuticals groups are reluctant to join the consortium. Mr Jean-Paul Leon, Elf-Sanofi's chief financial officer, said the company had no interest in promoting or participating in such a consortium. Rhone-Poulenc said it was not interested in taking over OCP on its own and would not take a significant stake. Both said wholesaling did not represent a core business. The Gehe takeover was given the go-ahead this week by the Paris bourse. It is awaiting permission from Commission d'Operations de Bourse, the stock exchange regulatory body, and the French ministry of finance. The takeover was expected to have been completed by the end of the month.</p>

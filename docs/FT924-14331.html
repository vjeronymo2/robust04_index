			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / World accounts standards sought THOSE WHO set accounting standards should prepare a minimum core list of requirements for companies seeking an international stock exchange listing, Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the Hundred Group of finance directors, said yesterday. Speaking at the Board of Chartered Accountants conference in Bristol, Mr Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer goods group, emphasised the importance of cross-border harmonisation of accounting. He said directors needed to create standards that deliver 'equitable, accurate, transparent, comprehensive and comprehensible accounts'. The different standards between the UK and the US reduced accountancy 'to the status of tribal black magic', he said. Mr Collum believed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices the securities and investments industry, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards in the US, are developing core standards in conjunction with the European Community. In practice, he expected much of the initiative to come from the UK's Accounting Standards Board. Mr Collum said businesses and the accounting profession had helped to undermine corporate financial credibility through competitive pressures, loose accounting standards, inadequate financial control systems and confusion over responsibilities.</p>

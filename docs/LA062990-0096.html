			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM TO EXPAND  </P> <P> An anti-drug education program in Ventura elementary schools will be expanded  this fall to include the city's four middle schools, Ventura police officials  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Police Department, which coordinates the Drug Abuse Resistance Education  (DARE) program for the Ventura Unified School District, is working this summer  on a curriculum that will be presented to seventh-graders during the upcoming  school year.  </P> <P> The department supplies three specially trained officers for the DARE programs  at elementary schools and will assign one more officer for the seventh-grade  program. The new program also will have a new name: Middle School DARE/GIARY,  which stands for Gang Involved At Risk Youth.  </P> <P> Although the program will educate the youngsters on the dangers of drug and  gang involvement, it also will deal with other problems facing the district's  nearly 1,100 seventh-graders, said Ric Nargie, director of pupil services for  the school district.  </P> <P> The California Office of Criminal Justice has provided a $50,000 grant, the  bulk of the needed start-up money for the new program. The Police Department is  contributing $16,600 and the Downtown Ventura Lions Club has donated $15,000.  </P> <P> The money will be used to hire a new police officer to replace the veteran  officer chosen to work full time presenting DARE/GIARY classes at Anacapa,  Balboa, Cabrillo and De Anza middle schools.  </P> <P> The middle school program will continue the message offered in lower grades.  About 1,800 fifth-graders participate in DARE, and then go through the  sixth-grade QUEST program, which teaches life skills for adolescents.  </P> <P> "The elementary school is just the place to begin, not the place to stop," said  Police Chief Richard Thomas. "The three programs will be kind of like a  washing-machine cycle for the students. Each grade that passes through will be  cleansed even more."  </P> <P> The implementation of the new program will provide seventh-graders with help in  making choices, Nargie said.  </P> <P> "It'll give them accurate information about the sort of dangerous effects of  substance abuse," he said. "It gives them some coping mechanisms to deal with  peer pressure, and through the program they can build some of their self-esteem  so that they know that they're an OK person and don't have to use drugs to deal  with their problems."

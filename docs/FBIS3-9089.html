			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 21 March carries in its  regular 6-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in the  republic.    Reporting on the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says  that "Karadzic's terrorists and Fikret Abdic's paramilitaries  have continued to attack the free Bihac territory overnight and  this morning. The chetniks have been using all their artillery  and tanks against the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski  plateau, Hasin Vrh, (Vrsak), and the Bihac part of the front,  and they have also occasionally directed their guns at the  Bosanska Krupa front. They attempted several infantry  breakthroughs, but these were repulsed by our defenders." He  says that "in the meantime, the paramilitary formations of the  so-called Kladusa autonomy attacked the outskirts of Cazin with  considerable help from the chetniks of the Serbian autonomous  region of Krajina. The members of the 5th Corps responded to  the attacks and recaptured some villages that Abdic's  paramilitaries had temporarily occupied."    Emir Aldakovic reports from Bugojno that "all night the town  shook to the explosions of heavy shells fired from the chetnik  positions in Kupres and Donji Vakuf. Unable to do anything  serious on the front line after the major successes of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, when over 40 chetniks were killed in  just a few days, the chetniks are returning to their tested  formula of shelling residential areas from a safe distance. The  shelling of Bugojno and the killing of civilians is aimed at  encouraging the chetniks at least a little, as total chaos --  according to reliable information -- has overtaken their ranks.  Aware of the failure of their destructive policy and that it is  only a matter of time before the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army comes  knocking on the door of Donji Vakuf, or Srbobran as they call  it, the Serb extremists have been trying their best -- of course  with the help of unlimited supplies of liquor -- to raise their  low morale."    Enes Ratusic reports from Mostar from the Bosnia-Herzegovina  4th Corps Press Center that "the last 24 hours have been marked  by sporadic violations of the cease-fire between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council." As  for the southern part of the Mostar commune, the reports says  that "the Serb aggressor fired antiaircraft machine guns and  guns at Obradovici."</p>

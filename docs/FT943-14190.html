			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Steady first half at Banco Popular Banco Popular, the big Spanish bank majority-owned by foreign institutions, has turned in a resilient performance for the first half of 1994. Pre-tax profits were Pta44.1bn (Dollars 350m), a 4.6 per cent dip on the same period a year ago. After lower tax, net income was 1.9 per cent higher at Pta30.2bn. Net interest revenue fell 2.8 per cent to Pta79.8bn, reflecting the sharp drop in interest rates between the two six-month periods and the resulting squeeze on margins. The net interest fall was less than some analysts had predicted and suggested the possibility of more buoyant results in the second half of this year. Popular's balance sheet strength was underlined by total assets of Pta3,038bn at end-June, 6.1 per cent up on December 1993 and 4.7 per cent up on June 1993. Popular's loans and discounts portfolio grew by 3.4 per cent in the half year and by 7.2 per cent over the past 12 months. The ratio of non-performing loans to total risks fell to 2.79 per cent, down from 2.90 per cent at end-March and 2.93 at end-December. Popular is the first of the big Spanish banks to report interim figures and its performance appears to set a strong standard for the results season.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan PM backs BAe venture - UK group confident of Pounds 250m deal despite need for further funds MR LIEN CHAN, Taiwan's prime minister, has approved a plan to support the Pounds 250m joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC). Some financial details have yet to be finalised, but BAe said yesterday that for the first time it regarded the deal as a certainty. Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, nevertheless, sounded a note of caution, saying the securing of further private sector funds required for the joint venture - Avro International Aerospace - could take another month. The deal is central to BAe's drive to return to profitability. It would mean that manufacturing of the RJ range of regional jets would be partly in Taiwan, which is close to the fast-growing markets of east Asia and which offers lower labour costs. The venture also offers Taiwan a route into the aviation industry and would let it upgrade its component industry and design and manufacturing capabilities. BAe had set a July 31 deadline for conclusion of the deal but said it was satisfied with the Taiwanese government's 'irrevocable commitment' to the deal yesterday. Mr Ko said he might yet have to visit the UK for further talks with BAe. 'I hope the (government's) commitment will also be enough for BAe to feel comfortable.' Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy economics minister, confirmed the government would increase its direct equity holding in TAC from a previously planned 29 per cent to 39 per cent of the company's TDollars 5.24bn (Dollars 129m) capitalisation. This holding will be through two bodies; a government development fund, which will lift its stake in TAC from 24 per cent to 29 per cent, and the state-run Chiao Tung Bank, which will raise its stake from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. The China Development Corp, owned by the ruling Kuomintang party will also take a 10 per cent share. Mr Yang said the economics ministry would officially request a local bank consortium led by the Chiao Tung Bank to extend a Dollars 400m secured credit line to Avro's leasing company and Dollars 60m in working capital. TAC still needs to secure about TDollars 1.3bn in equity inputs from private investors to reach its planned capitalisation of TDollars 5.24bn. Mr Yang added that the ministry of national defence would make the resources of its Aeronautics Industry Development Centre available for the project.</p>

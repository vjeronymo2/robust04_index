At the center of  the controversy is an ANC-alliance document on the future of  minerals. The document, which describes mineral wealth as a  national asset could become ANC policy if it is adopted at a  special two-day conference at the end of January.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] South Africa is well known for  its mineral riches. It is these minerals that are the focus of  an ANC document on the future exploitation of minerals. The ANC  says mineral wealth belongs to all South Africans and shouldn't  be in the hands of a few monopolies. Their idea is not to  nationalize the mines, but to tax the minerals which are being  mined. Part of the plan is that mining companies will no longer  own the actual land but will have to lease it from the  government.    [ANC spokesman Paul Jourdan] The other aspects of the RDP  [Reconstruction and Development Program] are a round ...  [pauses] making the industry grow, what we call widening the  industry, that means opening up new mines and what we call  deepening the industry, that is using our minerals further  downstream -- using our minerals to make mineral products, to  add value, to increase the foreign exchange earnings, to  increase employment, to increase government revenue.    [Reporter] The Chamber of Mines says it will only comment on  the document once it becomes policy, but at least three  political parties, the NP [National Party], the DP [Democratic  Party], and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] have called it  nothing more than nationalization. The National Party said the  ANC was still clinging to its socialistic policies. The DP said  the plan would undermine investor confidence and the economy and  the IFP said the proposal was nothing less than nationalization  by stealth. [end recording]</p>

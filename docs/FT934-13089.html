			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Italian army chief resigns GENERAL Goffredo Canino resigned yesterday as head of the Italian army's joint chiefs-of-staff in protest at the dismissal of a fellow general by Mr Fabio Fabbri, the defence minister, reports Robert Graham. The resignation marks a further deterioration in relations between the government and the military, under fire for talking of coup conspiracies and failing to control Italy's intelligence services. Gen Canino's action was prompted by the dismissal on Tuesday of General Biaggio Rizzo, head of the Emilian-Tuscan military region.</p>

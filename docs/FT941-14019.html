			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Council raids builders' offices in fraud probe The Labour-controlled London Borough of Lambeth has taken the unprecedented legal step of raiding the offices of one of its own sub-contractors, confiscating documents and freezing funds as part of an attempted crackdown on alleged fraud. Mr Paul Claydon, the district auditor who last year attacked the south London borough in a report, claiming that Pounds 20.2m had been spent unlawfully, has backed Lambeth's 'unique' action, signalling that local authorities will be encouraged to take a tougher stance on fraud. In a management letter to council members, he says: 'I regard the council's success in obtaining High Court orders as a sound, appropriate and imaginative approach to the recovery of large sums which may have been overpaid.' Last October council officials obtained injunctions from the High Court against Botes Building, a London-based maintenance company which carried out work on council houses in six of Lambeth's 20 administrative areas. Solicitors for the council, accompanied by independent solicitors, raided Botes's offices and removed and copied thousands of documents. Lambeth claims that it was overcharged a total of Pounds 4m by Botes Building, and its managing director, Mr Ian Botes. There are three other defendants: a former Lambeth employee; a consultant surveyor previously retained by Lambeth; and a former director of Botes who left the company last year. Mr Botes and the company were ordered by the High Court to pay Pounds 100,000 into an account. This was raised to Pounds 250,000 by the Appeal Court after an appeal by Lambeth. Lambeth's claim concerns four contracts, three on individual properties, including a building in Guildford Road, Stockwell, and one claim of Pounds 3.5m covering the council's maintenance contract, which includes thousands of individual transactions. Mr Justice Judge said there was 'powerful evidence to support the allegation that the Guildford Road contract was marked by dishonesty and fraud on Lambeth which involved employees of both Lambeth and Botes'. He said that 'by not earlier than early 1993 Mr Botes personally was aware of very serious anxieties to which this contract was giving rise'. He added: 'In spite of that knowledge he neither acted personally to ensure that the issue was ventilated with Lambeth, nor did he instruct his staff to do so.' However, Lord Justice Evans, speaking in the Appeal Court, said Lambeth's claim for a Pounds 4m limit was 'clearly excessive on the material now before us', and added that Lambeth's records were not yet up to date. The court was told that Mr Botes had done a 'quick check' in October and had arrived at an overvaluation figure - the difference between the value of work Botes did and the amount Lambeth paid them - of Pounds 1m for the maintenance contract. Lord Justice Evans said Lambeth 'should be free to renew their application when clear evidence, simply stated, becomes available to them to justify a certain or approximate sum as the value of their claim in respect of the maintenance contract'.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hijack by the theorists Sir, I read with interest Lisa Wood's recent article ('Inspectors attack 'narrow' work-based qualification', September 14) and while I agree that the underpinning knowledge required for some national vocational qualifications needs to be reviewed, in hairdressing (one of the first NVQs) there is ample knowledge and understanding built in. I remember it was not so long ago that employers complained that potential employees had the theoretical knowledge but had not been taught the practical skills to do the job] Certainly in hairdressing the previous qualification required far too much theoretical knowledge which was inappropriate. I agree with the concluding comments by Dr Melia, the Further Education Funding Council's chief inspector, that more attention should be paid to both underpinning knowledge and assessment in the workplace. However, there is a great danger that the academics will hijack NVQs and take us back to the bad old days of 'know all the theory but can't do the job'.

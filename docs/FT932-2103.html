			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Beijing to set up export-import bank to aid trade CHINA'S plans to establish an export-import bank to promote its growing trading interests are well advanced, according to a senior Chinese official responsible for establishing the 'trade bank'. Mr Tong Zhiguang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation, expects the institution to open soon. One of its aims would be to facilitate exports of capital goods such as electronics and machinery, which accounted for less than a quarter of China's exports in 1992. Textiles and light industrial products form the bulk of China's exports. Mr Tong said the new bank would provide import and export credits, export credit insurance and project financing. The state would help finance it. The bank would be likely to float bonds at home and abroad. 'Our economy is growing very fast, and this means that the growth rate of our foreign trade must keep pace,' Mr Tong said. Two-way trade reached Dollars 165.6bn (Pounds 110.4bn) last year, with exports of Dollars 85bn. China, whose exports grew more slowly than imports in the first quarter, wants to boost exports of sophisticated value-added goods. Northern Telecom of Toronto expects to become a leading supplier of telephone switches and other telecommunications equipment to China, under a deal signed with China's State Planning Commission, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The memorandum of understanding covers various manufacturing, research and training projects, including joint ventures for the development and manufacture of large-scale circuits and switching systems. Northern expects the deal to result in sales worth 'billions of dollars' over the next few years. Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said that business flowing from the agreement could become the most extensive in the company's history. The company also regards the agreement as an effort by China to broaden sources of telecommunications equipment and expertise.</p>

Mr. (Niko Koni Santana) issued the challenge in a videotape  which had been smuggled out of East Timor to the nearby  Australian city of Darwin. Loraine Davies reports:    [Begin Davies recording] (Koni Santana) says that if, as  Jakarta asserts, the people of East Timor have already freely  determined their desire for integration, why is it so afraid of  a referendum. He defies Jakarta to hold the referendum under UN  supervision to establish the true wish of the East Timorese. He  states the resistance undertakes to accept the outcome, whatever  it may be, and also to give up their arms and themselves to the  Indonesian authorities if the East Timorese vote for  integration.

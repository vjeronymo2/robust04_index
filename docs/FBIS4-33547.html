			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] Cuban-American organizations, headed by the  Cuban-American Committee for Peace, will meet U.S. congressmen  on 9 June to denounce the U.S. blockade against Cuba. Committee  President Raymundo del Toro says the meeting is an opportunity  to support the act of free trade with Cuba, sponsored by New  York Representative Charles Rangel. Del Toro says it is time  for the Clinton administration to change U.S. policy toward Cuba  now that the United States has ratified the most-favored-nation  status for the PRC and lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam.    The Cuban-American Committee for Peace president says  Clinton  is associating himself with the reactionary minority of the  Cuban emigre community, which has made maintaining the economic  blockade against Cuba a lucrative business. Del Toro also  predicted that Clinton will, once again, lose the 1996 elections  in Florida if he maintains ties with that minority group of the  Cuban emigre community.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zheng Zhifang (6774 1807 5364) From "Earnestly </F> Study the Third Volume of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" column: "It Is Necessary to Constantly and  Tightly Grasp the Agricultural Problem"]    [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always paid great  attention to problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and  peasants. In many articles in the third volume of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, he makes brilliant  expositions about the importance of problems concerning  agriculture, rural areas, and peasants, and about ways to  promote agricultural production and improve rural work.  Earnestly studying these expositions is of great importance to  upholding the ideological guidance that agriculture serves as  the foundation of the national economy, to further invigorating  agricultural production and improving rural work, to maintaining  social stability, and to promoting a sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the economy.  <H5>  We Must Never Forget Agriculture Is the Foundation of the </H5> Economy    In sizing up the situation, studying problems, or making  policy decisions, Comrade Xiaoping has always attached top  strategic importance to problems concerning agriculture, rural  areas, and peasants. He has repeated on many occasions that  agriculture plays a key strategic role in our effort to develop  agricultural production. He said: "In our strategy for economic  development, energy and transport are the key points, so is  agriculture." He believed that whether the Chinese economy will  develop depends on whether rural areas make progress and on  whether peasants can lead a good life. Whether the objective of  quadrupling the 1980 GNP will be attained by the end of this  century mainly depends on the efforts of peasants, who account  for 80 percent of the Chinese population. Stability in rural  areas is the foundation of national stability. "A total of 80  percent of the Chinese population resides in rural areas, so  whether China will maintain stability mainly depends on whether  rural areas will maintain stability. Even if we have done a  good job in urban areas, we will go nowhere without a stable  countryside serving as the foundation." "There will be no  overall political stability without rural stability. We will  not shake off poverty if the peasants do not shake off poverty."  Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly told the whole party:  "Agriculture is the foundation of the economy, we must never  forget this"; "it is essential to have a constant and firm grasp  of agriculture." The priority placed by Comrade Xiaoping on  problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is  based on his consideration of international and internal  economics and politics, so what he has said is highly pertinent.  We must arrive at an adequate understanding of his expositions.  We must regard problems concerning agriculture, rural areas,  and peasants as important issues affecting social stability,  consolidation of the achievements we have made in reform, our  efforts to attain the objective of the modernization drive, and  the future and destiny of the party and the country.    However, in the previous period, quite a number of leading  cadres have failed to really put agriculture in the first place  of the economic work. Especially in the process of developing a  market economy, leading cadres in many places shifted their  energy elsewhere, neglecting or relaxing their leadership over  agriculture. To counter this tendency, Comrade Jiang Zemin, in  speeches at the national conferences on rural work held in  October 1993 and March this year, called on the party membership  to conscientiously study Comrade Xiaoping's important  expositions about agriculture and sum up our experience in  developing agricultural production to further uphold the  ideological guidance that agriculture is the foundation for the  economy. He said: As we step up reform and open China more  widely to the outside world, there will be more need for us to  attach importance to, safeguard, and strengthen agriculture. It  is necessary to really, rather than superficially, practically,  rather than verbally, and wholeheartedly, rather than  half-heartedly, strengthen agriculture as the foundation for the  economy. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal party  committees must devote great efforts to rural work and  prefectural and county party committees must also focus on it.  The success of rural work should become an important criterion  for appraising the work results of key leading cadres.  <H5>  Grain Problem Is the Principal Problem for Agricultural </H5> Production    Comrade Xiaoping has given top priority to the grain  problem.  He believed that the grain problem is part and parcel of  agricultural production. While talking to responsible members  of the State Planning Commission, the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, and the department in charge of  agricultural production in January 1983, Comrade Xiaoping said:  "We should have an overall plan for agricultural development.  We must first of all increase grain production... and basically  solve the problem of adequate grain production by 2000. This is  an important strategic plan."    After listening to reports by  leading comrades of the central authorities on the economic  situation in June 1986, he pointed out: "In exercising  macroeconomic control, we should put agriculture in an  appropriate place, bearing in mind the general objective of  producing 480 billion kg of grain per year by the end of this  century. The practice of importing a large quantity of grain  should not be repeated in a few years, because that will affect  our economic growth rate."    Grain is the people's most fundamental means of subsistence  and also an important raw material for light industry, so it has  a direct bearing on the people's basic livelihood and immediate  interest, on social stability, and on economic development as a  whole. Especially in China, a big country with 1.1 billion  people, if something has gone wrong with grain production, no  country in the world can save us. If we live on imported grain,  we will be controlled by others. Therefore, we must, at any  time, never forget this important matter regarding independence  and self-reliance of our nation, must pay close attention to the  matter, and try our utmost to solve the problem, never relaxing  our vigilance a bit.  <H5>  Township Enterprises Must Be Developed and Upgraded </H5>   Comrade Xiaoping has paid great attention to the development  of township enterprises and has given a high appraisal of  achievements made by township enterprises. He said gladly in  June 1987: "The most rewarding achievement totally unexpected  in rural reform is the setting up of township enterprises. Many  small enterprises in various trades suddenly emerged as a new  force and worked together to develop a market economy. This  does not reflect the merits and achievements of the central  authorities. Township enterprises have been growing at an  annual rate of 20 percent for several years." He believes that  the township enterprise is an invention of the Chinese peasants.  Comrade Xiaoping has adequately affirmed the important role the  township enterprises have played in rural reform and  development. After listing township enterprise achievements such  as "helping promote rural development," "giving jobs to people  who accounted for 50 percent of surplus rural labor," and  "building up a large number of small new towns," he has  emphasized that "township enterprises are very important" and  that "they must be developed and upgraded."    Thanks to the great concern of Comrade Xiaoping and under  the  leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council,  China's township enterprises have developed and been upgraded  more rapidly over the last few years. They have made gratifying  achievements and have become the mainstay of our rural economy  and an important pillar of our national economy. In 1993,  China's township enterprise output value totaled 2.9 trillion  yuan, net profit was 160 billion yuan, taxes turned over to the  state totaled 95 billion yuan, export volume was 190 billion  yuan, and 112 million workers were employed. By now, the annual  gross output value of township enterprises constitutes over 60  percent of the gross rural output value and "one-third" of  China's gross industrial output value. History has proved and  will continue to prove that if the countryside is to become  moderately prosperous, it is essential to develop township  enterprises. The township enterprise serves as our greatest  project for supporting poor areas and achieving common  prosperity and a fundamental guarantee for attaining  agricultural modernization.  <H5>  Appropriate Policies and Science Are Essential to </H5> Agricultural Development    After making an in-depth analysis of our experience in  developing agriculture, Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out  that "two things are essential to agricultural development:  appropriate policies and science." He adequately affirmed the  correctness of the party's policy on introducing the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output. The system has proved effective and must not  be changed for a long time, he said. He told the third full  session of the Central Advisory Commission: "If we change the  present policies, the state and the people will suffer losses,  so the people, the 800 million peasants in particular, will come  out against us. If we change present rural polices, we will  immediately lower peasant living standards." "Judging by our  experience, the present generation must not change the policies,  neither must future generations." In the meantime, he was fully  positive of the "endless development and role of science and  technology" and vigorously advocated "tilling the land in a  scientific way" and invigorating agriculture by applying  scientific and technological achievements and promoting  education. In a speech given in January 1983, he pointed out  that "great efforts should be made to intensify research on  agricultural science and technology and train more agricultural  technicians, as well as to tackle key problems in agricultural  scientific research."    In line with Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on agricultural  development, that is, that appropriate policies and science are  essential to agricultural development, we must continue to  stabilize the party's policies for rural areas and improve and  develop them in practice. In addition, we must take effective  measures to promote research on agricultural science and  education and to propagate advanced agricultural techniques.  <H5>  We Have To Make Two Breakthroughs To Enhance Agricultural </H5> Reform and Development    Comrade Xiaoping told several leading comrades of the  central  authorities in March 1990: "From a long-term point of view, we  have to make two breakthroughs to enhance China's socialist  agricultural reform and development. The first breakthrough is  to abolish the people's commune and introduce the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output. This is a major advance, we must not change  the system for a long time. The second breakthrough is to  operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop the  collective economy to meet the needs of tilling the land in a  scientific way and of socialization of production. This is  another major advance and needs, of course, a long period."    The contract responsibility system on a household basis with  remuneration linked to output is a great creation by Chinese  peasants. Its greatest advantage has manifested itself in  thoroughly doing away with the practice of "allowing everyone to  eat from the same big pot" and thus enabling the peasants to  make land management decisions on their own. The system has  greatly mobilized peasant enthusiasm for production and thus  greatly liberated productive forces in rural areas. With the  development of rural productive forces and the planned economy  being replaced by the market economy, the contradictions between  separation of landholding and intensive management and between  individual household operation and socialized production have  become increasingly acute. To solve these contradictions, it is  necessary to operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop  the collective economy. This is a very difficult policy issue.  We must properly explore and analyze our experience before we  can work out the guiding principle and policies, as well as  measures to implement the principle and policies. Our  fundamental approach is that we must work energetically rather  than rashly to attain our objective. Judging from our  successful experience in introducing the cooperative joint-  stock system in the countryside, the system should serve as a  vanguard in deepening rural reforms and achieving the second  breakthrough in the countryside.</p>

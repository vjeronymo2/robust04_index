			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> PANEL TO DELIBERATE ON IRVINE CO. LAND  </P> <P> City officials this week named a committee to begin negotiations with the  Irvine Co. on the future of about 400 acres of vacant land the company owns in  the city.  </P> <P> Committee members are Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer and council members Clarence J.  Turner and Jean H. Watt. They will negotiate to ensure preservation of open  space and to gain funds for transportation.  </P> <P> On the Irvine Co. team, selected last month, are Vice Chairman Ray Watson and  two officials of a company subsidiary, Patrick Smith and Dave Dmohowski.  </P> <P> "These properties are very significant in terms of what people are concerned  about in Newport Beach," Watt said Tuesday. "About half of them are very  sensitive areas, like around the bay, and we want to preserve open space and  get a community park."  </P> <P> The basis of the negotiations was laid last year, when city officials adopted a  new land use and traffic plan within the city's general plan.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. then proposed a conceptual plan whereby the firm would advance  money for road improvements. In return, the company would receive a development  agreement to build on its remaining vacant parcels.  </P> <P> "This way the city gets road funding now instead of it trickling in," said  Dmohowski. "That's why we want to pool them all up front and look at these  properties as a package instead of coming back on every single one and  reinventing the wheel."  </P> <P> While the precise number of parcels to be discussed has not yet been  determined, at least six highly visible sites will be looked at in terms of  open space preservation:  </P> <P> * A 60-acre tract known as Castaways at Dover Drive and Coast Highway, site of  the original McFadden's Wharf. The upper portion of the parcel is designated by  the general plan for 151 residential units and 10 acres of open space. Watt  said this parcel is the favorite potential site for a park.  </P> <P> * The Newporter North parcel, about 80 acres east and north of Upper Newport  Bay between San Joaquin Hills Road and the John Wayne Tennis Club. Under the  general plan, 212 units are permitted, with provisions for open space.  </P> <P> * The 33-acre Newport Village site on the northwest corner of the junction of  MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway. The Irvine Co. gave 10 acres at the site  for the Newport Harbor Art Museum, and four acres are under negotiation for a  new public library site. The remaining acreage is slated in the general plan  for about 115,000 square feet of commercial space and a four-acre park.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Creek North and South sites between Jamboree Road and MacArthur  Boulevard at the head of Upper Newport Bay. The north site totals 13 acres and  is designated for commercial space and a fire station. The south site totals 20  acres and is planned for 300 residential units.  </P> <P> * Bayview Landing at the corner of Coast Highway and Jamboree Road. The upper  pad of the 17-acre parcel will probably become a park, Watt said.  </P> <P> Most of the other sites to be considered as part of the overall package are  zoned for commercial or residential development. Others, such as Buck Gully, 55  acres between Coast Highway and Spyglass Hill in Corona del Mar, are designated  to remain open space. Still others, such as five ecologically sensitive acres  at Jamboree and MacArthur, may be preserved as open space if development rights  can be transferred elsewhere, Dmohowski said.  </P> <P> Preliminary findings are expected in three to six months, Dmohowski said.

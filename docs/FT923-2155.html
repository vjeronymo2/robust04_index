			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: More jobs better than more 'poorer consumers' Sir, So the World Development Movement believes that the interests of the 'poorer consumers' would be best served by making available more low cost textiles from the Far East at the expense of the UK industry, thus creating more 'poorer consumers' ('Textile trade rules are attacked', September 14). How much more positive it would be to provide jobs for these people in wealth-creating manufacturing industries, enabling them to spend their incomes in the shops which could then offer UK goods alongside the imported ones. John G Bridge, chairman, Textile Industry Support Campaign, Thorncliffe, 115 Windsor Road, Oldham OL8 1RQ</p>

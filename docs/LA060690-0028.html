			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLOSURE OF STREETS NEAR LOW-INCOME PROJECT OKD  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council Tuesday voted to close portions of two public  streets that intersect the crime-ridden San Fernando Gardens housing project,  the first phase of a long-awaited plan to upgrade security.  </P> <P> The street closures, approved without debate on a 10-0 vote, are needed to  restrict access to the 448-unit project, said David Mays, chief deputy for City  Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the area. A nearly 1-mile-long,  8-foot-tall wrought iron fence will then be built around the low-income housing  project.  </P> <P> "The street closures are a first step forward and everyone is very excited,"  Mays said. Closed will be Lehigh Avenue between Van Nuys Boulevard and Pierce  Street, and Carl Street between Pala Avenue and Lehigh.  </P> <P> Bernardi, who introduced the street closure plan, was not present during the  council's consideration of the matter.  </P> <P> The proposal to enclose San Fernando Gardens, whose 2,000 tenants are mostly  Latinos, including 1,500 children, caused a brief flap during Bernardi's 1989  reelection bid. Lyle Hall, Bernardi's major foe, insinuated that the  incumbent's support of the fencing plan was racially motivated. However, Hall's  comments backfired with tenants of the project.  </P> <P> "We're doing this at the request of the housing project's tenant's  association," Mays said. "We have continuing crime problems there, most of them  drug-related. The community wants to have more control over their environment  and this . . . will help."  </P> <P> City Councilman Hal Bernson has said a similar enclosure of Park Parthenia, a  60-building private housing project in his district in Northridge, proved to be  an effective crime-fighting tool.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Housing Authority, which owns and operates the project, has the  $400,000 needed to erect the fence, and construction should be completed within  two to three months, Mays said. Two entrances to the housing project will  remain when the fence is built, and the authority is seeking grants to hire  security guards to man the entrances, Mays said.  </P> <P> Additionally, Bernardi is supporting a plan to build a 5,300-square-foot  community center that would house day-care, social services and recreational  facilities for the project.  </P> <P> San Fernando Gardens is the only city housing project that does not have such a  facility.  </P></p>

The minister gave a briefing on Iraqi  policy concerning relations with neighboring Arab countries and  the latest political developments concerning the unjust blockade  imposed on the Iraqi people.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf explained that thanks to the  instructions of leader President Saddam Husayn, the Iraqi policy  has yielded good results at the current stage, especially with  respect to the change in the policies of some international  powers. He hoped that the next stage will witness more positive  developments in terms of understanding the nature of the  existing conflict in the region in a manner that will contribute  to bolstering regional security, stability, and prosperity, and  to countering the challenges posed to the region's peoples.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Owl plan 'would halve Pacific timber harvest' A RECOVERY plan for the northern spotted owl would result in the timber harvest on federal land in the Pacific north-west being halved, lowering it to about 2bn board feet, according to a US Interior Department official, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary, said the plan would be released in mid to late April. The draft was sent to the printers this week. The recovery plan would mean the loss of about 31,000 jobs in the Northwest, Mr Lujan said. The spotted owl, which has been listed as a threatened species, nests in old-growth forests in the region. Logging has been restricted sharply due to lawsuits filed by environmental groups. Mr Lujan said the Endangered Species Act, which requires steps to protect species in danger of extinction, needs change. He intends in April to give Congress options for saving the owl but with a smaller job loss. More than 40,000 plant species could vanish in the next 60 years because of swift population growth and environmental devastation, threatening world food supplies, according to a United Nations study. Unless countries redouble efforts to preserve plants and the genetic material they contain, it may be impossible to adapt many crops to rapidly changing weather and soil conditions - leaving them vulnerable to pests or disease.</p>

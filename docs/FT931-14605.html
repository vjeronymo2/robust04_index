			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / US cruise missile attack on Iraqi nuclear factory: Three killed and hotel hit, claims Baghdad THE US last night launched a further attack on Iraqi military installations, firing cruise missiles from naval vessels in the Gulf at a nuclear components plant on the outskirts of Baghdad, the capital. The White House, which did not rule out further attacks, said the plant made components for Iraq's nuclear enrichment programme. The Iraqis said at least three people were killed, including two women receptionists at Baghdad's Rasheed hotel, which was badly damaged during the raid. They said 31 people were injured at the hotel, 11 of them Islamic scholars attending a conference. Iraq claimed the hotel, which houses many foreign journalists, was hit by a US missile, but Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said it might have been struck by falling Iraqi anti-aircraft shells. Pentagon officials said warships unleashed about 40 Tomahawk missiles at the targeted factory. Iraqi officials later took journalists to the plant to show them it had been reduced to rubble, but said there were no casualties. 'We were expecting the strike. We only had a few people around at night,' the plant director said, adding: 'It was progressive bombing, building after building.' Iraqi officials said the plant was a civilian engineering one, specialising in design and fabrication of moulds for metal casting. Asked if his plant had been engaged in any nuclear activity, the director said: 'We were very, very far away from this field.' The attack, on the second anniversary of the start of the Gulf War, came after a weekend of increasing tension between Iraq and the US-led allies. Earlier yesterday Washington said one of its jets shot down an Iraqi MiG 23 in the northern no-fly zone and another US aircraft attacked a radar station. Iraq claimed the MiG was south of the zone and was hit while taking off. In a further clash, Kuwaiti border police killed an Iraqi infiltrator who crossed into Kuwait territory. Another infiltrator was captured, but a third escaped back into Iraq. In a sign that Baghdad was backing down, Kuwait disclosed later that Iraq had begun to dismantle six of its border posts inside what is now Kuwaiti territory in compliance with United Nations demands. But Iraq continued to place conditions on flights into the country by UN weapons inspectors and the UN last night rejected these conditions. President-elect Bill Clinton said he fully supported the cruise missile attack sanctioned by the outgoing administration of President George Bush. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's 'continuing provocation has been met by appropriate and forceful response', Mr Clinton said. Voicing Britain's support, Mr John Major said the Iraqi leader had been 'courting trouble - he has had trouble'. Mr Fitzwater said that the latest US attack was justified under UN resolutions seeking to curb Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He said the factory, 13 miles from the centre of Baghdad, made components for Iraq's nuclear enrichment programme, and, in particular, electromagnetic isotope separators. He would not specify whether the allies had other targets in their sights for future strikes, but gave a day-by-day catalogue of Iraq's recent infringements of UN requirements, saying: 'The goal of this operation is to seek compliance with UN resolutions. We don't have that yet.' As the coalition geared up for military action yesterday, US defence officials appeared keen to launch a heavier and more sustained assault than last Wednesday's limited raid on Iraqi air defences in the southern no-fly zone, which was set up to protect the Shia marsh Arabs. Although the Bush administration insists last week's raid was militarily and politically successful, it failed to destroy some of the targeted anti-aircraft missile batteries. But a strike on the suburbs of Baghdad itself, with consequent risk to civilian lives, came as a surprise. An Iraqi hospital doctor said three people were killed during the air raid. The Iraqi agency news agency INA said a number of 'civilian, tourist and cultural targets' in Baghdad were hit. Britain's backing for renewed military strikes was underlined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, who accused Mr Saddam of being as 'provocative as possible against the United Nations'. Downing Street stressed Mr Major's firm backing for the missile strike, adding that it had been undertaken after full consultations between the allies and with the United Nations. Officials denied suggestions that Mr Major had held back an earlier US strike. Iraq yesterday claimed it was now willing to provide for the safety of UN aircraft flying in teams from Bahrain if the UN guaranteed the suspension of allied aircraft operations in the southern no-fly zone during such flights. But in New York, Mr Tim Trevan, spokesman of the UN special commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said: 'This is a condition or a guarantee which the special commission simply is not in a position to give. So, in these circumstances, the special commission is still not in a position to fly its aircraft.' Speaking before yesterday's attack, Mr Fitzwater accused Iraq of opening fire with anti-aircraft artillery and missiles on coalition aircraft, and of sending aircraft into the northern no-fly zone. In a speech yesterday, Mr Saddam underlined Iraq's determination to resist the no-fly zones. He also attacked Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family and called on Kuwaitis to remove their rulers who had 'linked their destiny to the interests of foreign forces'.

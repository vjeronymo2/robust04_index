			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/FINANCE;  </P> <P> AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS GET BOOST FROM S&amp;L GRANTS  </P> <P> Three affordable housing projects in Orange County received a financial boost  recently from a special subsidy program mandated by last year's federal law  that restructured the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> The projects are among 31 in California, Arizona and Nevada to win the first  round of S&amp;L grants totaling $12.1 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank  in San Francisco, one of 12 regional banks in the federal system that provides  credit to savings and loans.  </P> <P> The winning projects were chosen from 43 applications from 34 institutions  seeking $39.4 million in subsidies.  </P> <P> The thrifts are required to ultimately pass the savings to the buyers and  renters of low- and moderate-income housing.  </P> <P> ITT Federal Bank in Irvine will be receiving $43,327 to pay for an Orange  County Community Housing Corp. project for acquiring six condominium sites in  Irvine. The units would be available as rentals to households earning up to  30%, or in some cases up to 50%, of median income for the area.  </P> <P> Plaza Savings &amp; Loan of Santa Ana will receive $9,499 to fund Community  Housing's acquisition and rehabilitation of 20 rental apartments for low-income  large families in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco will get $21,000 to help the Civic  Center Barrio Housing Corp. in Santa Ana build six condominiums for very  low-income families to lease with an option to buy.  </P> <P> In addition, Plaza Savings and 22 other thrifts will share in a $1.3-million  grant to the Savings Assns. Mortgage Co. for projects to be identified by  SAMCO.  </P> <P> The San Francisco district bank is funding the great majority of the nation's  affordable housing projects. The bank's $12.1 million in first-round subsidies  is more than 25% of the $47.2 million provided by all 12 district banks. Its  money will be used to provide 5,514 housing units. The bank is taking  applications through August for $8 million in funding that will be offered  later this year. It will then hold two competitions a year, one in January and  one in July.  </P> <P>  -- Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer  </P></p>

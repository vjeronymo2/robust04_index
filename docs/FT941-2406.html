			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Rescue near for Credit Lyonnais The French government is this week expected to unveil its rescue package for Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which is set to announce on Thursday a hefty loss for 1993. The government is ready to inject around FFr4bn (Pounds 450m) of fresh capital into the bank, according to recurrent press reports. It could also take much of the bank's non-performing property loans and put them into a new state-backed company. Credit Lyonnais has refused to comment on a report in the Nouvel Economiste weekly that last year's losses would total FFr4.5bn, despite a sharp reduction in provisions against bad loans because some FFr40bn of these loans would be shifted into a shell company. This new company would be financed by a Credit Lyonnais loan, but this would be guaranteed by the state which would bear any losses on the loans. In its 1992 annual report Credit Lyonnais said its exposure on direct property lending amounted to FFr24bn. Of this 'a fraction seems compromised' and therefore it only made a provision of FFr6bn. The Nouvel Economiste article claims that the bank was grossly under-provisioned and had told the finance ministry that - in the absence of a state rescue - FFr22.5bn of provisions would be required in its 1993 accounts. Of this, FFr13bn would be to cover property loans, with the rest for industrial loans and shareholdings. Some private French banks, as well as the European Commission, may question the state aid for Credit Lyonnais.</p>

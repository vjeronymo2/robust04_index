Discussing the forthcoming Prague meeting, Jeszenszky said  the main aim of the talks is for the new American Administration  to be familiarized with the views of Central Europe, and for  Washington to acknowledge that the road to Moscow leads through  Central Europe.    The Prague talks should, according to the foreign minister,  also focus on the steps that could best promote the survival, or  intensification of the favorable, democratic processes in Russia.    As regards the expansion of NATO, Jeszenszky again stressed  that opening the organization towards the East would not  strengthen the conservative forces in Russia. "In my view, the  contrary of this is true: Expanding NATO is a Russian interest  as well," he said.    Jeszenszky said he does not agree with the position whereby  the American "Partnership for Peace" proposal conceals the  intention of delivering Central-Eastern Europe into the hands of  the Russians. "I consider the existence of such a Western  intention to be completely out of the question, nor do I believe  that the American proposal, or any other Western policy, would  result in this," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said.</p>

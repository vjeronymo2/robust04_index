			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Lessa] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 19 May (AE) -- In a lecture given at  the Heavy Construction Association, the War College [ESG]  commander, Brigadier Sergio Xavier Ferolla, today defended  several points of the Workers Party [PT] program. Among these  points are the expansion of the domestic market and the state  monopoly over strategic economic areas. Endorsing the PT line,  Ferolla attacked economic neoliberal proposals and  privatization. Attending the lecture were some heavy  construction heavyweights such as Emilio Odebrecht and Sergio  Andrade. The latter is director of the Andrade Gutierrez company.    Ferolla said that, taking into account the Armed Forces'  viewpoint, he endorses many points of the PT program. "In  general, the program is correct," he said. He denied, however,  that he is going to support the PT. He said: "My party is  Brazil." He added that "there can be no problems if they are  defending sound ideas." He noted that the party that best  reflects his own ideas is the Communist Party of Brazil. "This  is what democracy is all about," he said.    Ferolla provoked surprise among the businessmen when he made  a historical correction. He said: "Many people believe the ESG  was responsible for the 1964 military movement, but that was not  the case at all." He noted that former President Castello  Branco, who took courses at the ESG when he was a colonel, was  an advocate of democracy. He also denied allegations that the  ESG's creation had been inspired by the United States. He said:  "We always have been concerned about formulating a national  plan."    In defending the domestic market's expansion, Ferolla said  he  is not among the 10 million Brazilians who can afford to buy a  new car. "Just think that if we could increase this figure by a  factor of seven we would have a market equal to that of Japan,"  he said. "Our main strength lies in the size of our market."    Ferolla criticized the opening of the economy to foreign  capital and the Argentine privatization program. He said: "They  sold Argentine Airlines to the Spanish airline Iberia and the  Argentine telephone company to Italian and French state-owned  companies. If we applied legislation here similar to that  enacted by the United States to protect its economy, they would  characterize us as xenophobes."</p>

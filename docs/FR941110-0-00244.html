(See &sect;488.308 for special rules for SNFs and NFs.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Section 488.24 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;488.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certification of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Special rules for certification of noncompliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in &sect;488.330.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The State agency will certify that a provider or supplier is not or is no longer in compliance with the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage where the deficiencies are of such character as to substantially limit the provider's or supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or which adversely affect the health and safety of patients; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If HCFA determines that an institution or agency does not qualify for participation or coverage because it is not in compliance with the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage, or if a provider's agreement is terminated for that reason, the institution or agency has the right to request that the determination be reviewed. (Appeals procedures are set forth in Part 498 of this chapter.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Section 488.26 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;488.26  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determining compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Additional rules for certification of compliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in &sect;488.330.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or condition for coverage depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition. Evaluation of a provider's or supplier's performance against these standards enables the State survey agency to document the nature and extent of deficiencies, if any, with respect to a particular function, and to assess the need for improvement in relation to the prescribed conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The State survey agency must adhere to the following principles in determining compliance with participation requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance status of facilities. Specifically surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

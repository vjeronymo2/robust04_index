			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Counting on the zeta potential ZETA potential has little to do with starry galaxies or even movie starlets. It involves the way particles interact in a liquid. When ions in the liquid attach themselves to the charged particles, they affect the speed with which the particles move. This velocity (the zeta potential) can be measured when an electric current is applied. By measuring the zeta potential companies can calculate how liquid products will react over time and so cut down on testing. Lots of movement means the liquid will form a long-lasting emulsion - good for face creams - while a low score means the liquid will destabilise, useful in oil recovery. The Zetamaster, from Malvern Instruments, should enable medium-sized companies to carry out the tests at the press of a button. Malvern Instruments: UK, 0684 892456.</p>

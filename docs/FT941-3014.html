			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Buthelezi warns of a 'liberation war' A liberation war lies ahead if the South African government crushes opposition to April's all-race elections, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, warned yesterday. Inkatha seemed almost certain to act on its threat to boycott the poll, after Chief Buthelezi took a hard line on participation in a speech to the legislative assembly of the KwaZulu homeland which he heads, and after last-ditch talks planned for today between the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela were called off. The meeting, to have taken place at Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital, was 'postponed indefinitely' after the ANC said it believed Inkatha members planned to assassinate Mr Mandela. They insisted the venue be changed after learning that thousands of heavily-armed Zulus were expected to attend, but Inkatha refused. The ANC had counted on a private meeting between the two men, but Chief Buthelezi yesterday urged the king's supporters to attend. Chief Buthelezi said the king would meet his subjects at Ulundi later today, to inform them whether or not they should be preparing for elections in six weeks' time. The chief implied King Goodwill would use that opportunity to call for a boycott. If he does so, it will be the first time the Zulu monarch has issued such an instruction, and will dash remaining hopes on the part of the government and the ANC that they could make a separate peace with the king to support elections publicly, despite Inkatha's planned boycott. The king said there would be 'rolling Zulu mass action' unless his demands for Zulu sovereignty were met. Chief Buthelezi yesterday accused the government and the ANC of trying to overthrow his government. 'Agitators attempting to destabilise the KwaZulu government are trying to use the same tactics adopted against the government of Bophuthatswana,' he said. The government was ousted there last week through a combination of civil servants' strike, popular protest, security force mutiny and the intervention of South African troops. If troops were sent into KwaZulu, the chief said, this would 'spawn a struggle for liberation from ANC/National Party oppression with no parallel in Africa'. He warned of the 'highly explosive situation in KwaZulu', with tension likely to rise further when the Independent Electoral Commission acts, probably within a fortnight, to ensure political parties can campaign freely in the homeland, and polling stations can be erected there.</p>

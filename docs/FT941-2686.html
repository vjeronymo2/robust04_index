			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Job losses 'hit ethnic minorities' Black and Asian workers are seven times more likely to lose their jobs than white people, the Trades Union Congress says in an analysis, published today, of the government's labour force survey. The rate of job losses among white workers was 0.5 per cent between the summers of 1992 and 1993, but for workers from ethnic minorities there was a 3.7 per cent fall. The TUC is holding a demonstration today in east London against racism.</p>

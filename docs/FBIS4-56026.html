			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the </F> Christian Democratic People's Party, by Karoly Banhidi; place  and date not given: "Everyone in the KDNP Comes to the End of  His Mandate"]    [Excerpts] For the coalition parties, a shocking  socialist-liberal advance emerged after the first round of the  elections. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has  multiplied the number of its members in recent years. However,  only 7 percent of citizens voted in favor of the KDNP, a party  that represents Christian-national values. We asked KDNP Deputy  Chairman Laszlo Varga about the causes of this unexpected  failure.    [Banhidi] You declared repeatedly that, in the past, the  Hungarian people never gave more than 16 percent of their votes  to either the extreme right, the arrow-cross people, or the  communists. In view of the results of the first round of the  elections in which the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] received  32 percent, what is your opinion about such an expression of the  voters' will?    [Varga] Indeed, I mentioned this repeatedly during our  campaign meetings in the capital and in the provinces. I also  declared in front of prominent foreign guests present at the  conference of the European Democratic Union in Budapest that  they are now in a country where people never lost their senses  and never gave more than 16 percent votes to either the  arrow-cross people or the communists. And now, the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] received as many votes as the arrow-cross  people and the communists together. I see a simple explanation  for this, namely that, in democracy, every government has to go  if it is unable to deal with unemployment and inflation. Of  course, there is no rule to this, and there is no exception to  the rule either. People see and feel politics on their own skin  and through the increase in their own expenses. Some 20 percent  of our 2.5 million pensioners are living on the boundary of the  subsistence minimum, and we have an unemployment rate of almost  500,000 people. In such a situation, these people cannot think  further than everyday problems and subsistence. The citizens  decided to have another government. This would take care of the  election issue, but the situation is not that simple after all.  No matter how many mistakes this government made, and every  government makes mistakes, they are not the only ones that  caused the problems; the fact that a socialist economy had to be  turned into a market economy in the course of the change in the  regime also had its share. The Hungarian population failed to  consider and evaluate this.    [Banhidi] At least on the basis of the first round of  elections, we can say that the socialist-liberal advance in  Hungary is unique in Europe, and the consequences of this  phenomenon are unpredictable....    [Varga] I agree that such an advance of the left and of the  liberal trend is a unique phenomenon on the map of Europe.  However, we set the pillars of democracy, and I continue to  have confidence in the common sense of the Hungarian people. I  regard the first round of elections a little as a mistake,  haste, and even defiance, rather than a real stand in favor of  the MSZP ideology. At the same time, in my opinion, one should  not be afraid of a left-wing danger because, the left that is  regarded as left in the classic sense of the word in Europe does  not exist in Hungary. Rather, I see a danger in the fact that  we do not yet know which, and how many, people there are in the  MSZP who are still there from among the old communists.  Although transformed, this party came from the past, and it is  difficult to forget that.    [Banhidi] Many people think that the socialists' victory is  also due to the exaggerated national and Christian line and  manifestations of the coalition....    [Varga] It is possible that the national-Christian concept  has become overused. One can overuse a slogan, but if this  slogan has content, I think the use and depth of this slogan  must affect the people. If we take the composition of our  current population, people between 15 and 50 years of age make  up 60 percent of the population. In the previous regime, these  people grew totally disaccustomed to the national and Christian  values or their internal content. Governments and powers come  and go but, in a democracy, the people find out quickly whether  the promises are really fulfilled.    [Banhidi] In evaluating the results of the first round, one  can hear voices according to which a certain process of change  has started in the KDNP and this could even lead to a change in  the person of the party chairman.    [Varga] The mandate of everyone in the KDNP will come to an  end this year. The debates are natural, and they were strong  after the first round of the elections.    [Banhidi] Has any national committee member accepted  personal responsibility?    [Varga] There has not been any one like that, and I did not  hear of any calling to account. [passage omitted]    [Banhidi] There are people who think that those who voted in  favor of the MSZP are confusing the concepts of settling  accounts and revenge. The socialists have not yet announced  their candidate for the position of prime minister, but Gyula  Horn would accept the position if the MSZP members decided in  favor of this....    [Varga] We do not yet know whether Gyula Horn will become  prime minister; nor do we know yet whether the MSZP will get an  absolute majority after the second round. The key position is  now in the hands of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. A  lot will depend on their results. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR PANEL OKS PERMIT TO RAZE OLD WILMINGTON CANNERY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Harbor Commission on Wednesday approved a permit allowing  demolition of the old Heinz pet food cannery in Wilmington amid complaints that  the building's most historically valued equipment was not passed on to the  community as promised.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, the Los Angeles City Council abandoned plans to designate the  cannery, at 545 S. Fries Ave., a historical and cultural monument.  </P> <P> Instead, at the urging of Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, city lawmakers called  for the port to provide Wilmington with a new waterfront museum or plaza.  </P> <P> But several Wilmington residents complained Wednesday that the cannery's  equipment, including a conveyor, was sold by Heinz to a salvage company before  residents had an opportunity to tour the plant.  </P> <P> The residents blamed the loss on port officials who, they said, led them to  believe that Heinz would donate to the community what residents wanted, not  just what was left after the building was stripped.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that the Harbor Department never saw the historical value  of the cannery," said Olivia Cueva-Fernandez, whose mother and grandmother  worked at the cannery.  </P> <P> Port officials countered that they have set aside items from the cannery that  were pointed out by several residents who toured it June 13. And regardless of  what might have been there before the tour, port spokesman Chuck Ellis said,  the Harbor Department has no authority to order a tenant to turn over property  it owns.  </P></p>

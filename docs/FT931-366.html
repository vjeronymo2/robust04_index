			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Interest in Japan as financial centre wanes JAPAN'S position as an international financial centre has waned over the past four years as foreign banks and brokers have become frustrated by opaque market practices and the slow pace of financial deregulation. According to a survey by the Japan Center for International Finance, an affiliate of the ministry of finance, only 6 per cent of 67 foreign financial institutions questioned believed the Tokyo market could pip New York and London to become the leading financial market within five years. This figure is sharply lower than in 1989, when 32 per cent of those surveyed expected Tokyo to lead the other two markets in five years' time. The figures reflect the weakness of the Tokyo stock market, which has forced some foreign brokers to restructure their Japanese operations and, in some cases, withdraw from the market altogether. Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch, the US brokerages, have recently announced reorganisations. County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank of the UK, last year became the first foreign broker to relinquish its seat on the Tokyo stock exchange. Only 9 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied with the extent of financial deregulation in Japan, and 49 per cent said liberalisation was inadequate compared with London and New York. Some 23 per cent said the financial markets were far from being liberalised. On the stability of Japan's financial system, 22 per cent said there was a lack of disclosure over the extent of bad loans held by Japanese banks. A total of 67 per cent said obscure market practices and decision-making were a problem, while others indicated that accounting and tax rules were obstructive. Despite their waning enthusiasm, foreign banks said profits were rising as a result of the reluctance of Japanese banks to lend to corporations, together with lower interest rates. The number of foreign banks who found fund procurement from the short-term money market difficult fell from 21 per cent in 1989 to 10 per cent. Most foreign brokers were taking a long-term view, with 60 per cent replying that they had a long-term strategy in Japan. Only 5 per cent indicated they were withdrawing from the securities business, while another 5 per cent said they were cutting securities operations.</p>

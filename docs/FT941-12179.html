			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Output wavers but trend remains upward Manufacturing output fell back in January but remains on an upward trend, says a survey published yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The survey's index result is based on responses from purchasing managers at manufacturers, and is designed to give an early indication of changes in economic activity. The index dropped from 54.6 per cent in December to 49.1 per cent in January, its lowest level since January 1993. The drop to below 50 per cent signalled an overall decline in manufacturing output. But the institute said this mainly reflected seasonal factors. 'The demand for goods, especially consumer goods, tailed off after Christmas,' the survey said. The index, which has been running for almost two years, is not yet seasonally adjusted. The employment index also dropped - from 50.2 per cent in December to 47.5 per cent in January - but the institute said that much of the contraction could be attributed to the release of temporary staff 'as the busy seasonal period finished'. The outlook for manufacturers is encouraging. A significant number of purchasing managers interviewed reported strong growth in new orders in January, particularly in export markets. The managers' optimism was also reflected in the stocks of purchases index, which rose from 47.1 per cent in December to 50.9 per cent in January. The institute reported that a considerable number of companies began to rebuild stock levels after the end of the year.</p>

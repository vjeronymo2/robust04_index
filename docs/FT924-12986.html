			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Property: The rich folk who live on the hills - David Hoppit visits Hampstead and Highgate, two historic and desirable London villages a McDonalds in Hampstead High Street. After an 11-year legal battle, the hamburger chain has won the right to open a franchise on the main shopping street of the predominantly 18th century 'village' in north London. Older inhabitants may worry for the value of their homes, but most of the local children, as well as the huge number of teenagers who converge on Hampstead from all over north London in the evenings, will be dancing in the street. 'Frankly, it's a bit of a storm in a teacup. Hampstead is not a twee little village any more; it is a busy, cosmopolitan place,' says Duncan Harding, of Anscombe and Ringland. 'People have complained for years that it is full of estate agents, boutiques and restaurants; now they can add hamburger bars.' McDonalds will open early next year on a small site that used to house a far more down-market 'burger bar. Although its design will have to be approved, soon it will be used by the sons and daughters of those who opposed it. But the good people of Highgate, that other favoured hilltop village nearby, are nervous about the judgment. 'Highgate is still a delightful village and we certainly don't want hamburgers and litter here,' said one resident. 'We do]' chorused nearby schoolchildren.' The two villages remain among the most desirable corners of London's vast sprawl. They have been spared the worst excesses of modern building and share that most wonderful amenity: Hampstead Heath, nearly 800 acres of unmanicured park. There was a hamlet at Highgate as long ago as the 13th century; 100 years later, the bishop of London allowed a road to be built over the hill. It was at the foot of Highgate hill that Dick Whittington was said to have heard Bow Bells calling him back; and it was up nearby West Hill that the late poet laureate, John Betjeman, lost his infant heart - 'Oh Peggy Purey-Cust, how pure you were' - on his way to school. Hampstead and Highgate always have been the heralds of recession and recovery. In times ofprosperity, house prices reflect the competition between the rich for the most fashionable homes. In hard time, prices there are the first to collapse. The villages already were a barometer late in the late 17th century. William Blake, who founded a school for orphaned children, built speculative houses in The Grove to help finance the charity. He ended up in a debtor's prison. There are many in similar financial difficulties today. In The Bishop's Avenue, famous as 'Millionaires Row,' local agents will tell you there are only two houses NOT for sale. 'One man I know there has bank borrowings of about Pounds 5m but his house is worth nearer Pounds 2.5m,' says Harding. Richard Crosthwaite, of Knight Frank and Rutley, agrees. 'A few years ago, there was competition from all corners of the globe for the few houses for sale in The Bishop's Avenue and Winnington Road. All that is changed; one resident told me recently his house was about the only one not up for sale. Behind those gilded gates paces many an anxious vendor, probably with an equally anxious bank manager.' But Hampstead and Highgate will always be the Rolls-Royce of the market; in spite of McDonalds, they retain their historic feel. Early in the 1960s, I was with the gunners stationed at St John's Wood barracks. Every morning, we would ride up Hampstead hill to exercise the horses of the King's Troop. Our mouths watered at the smells of fresh bread and sizzling bacon wafting through Georgian sashes. At the top, we splashed through Whitestone Pond, where poet Percy Shelley sailed paper boats for children. We loved the scenery up in the villages - the architecture, the misty heathland, the fresh-faced au pairs waving from the windows. And it is the timelessness of 'Ham and High' that is intoxicating; small wonder that millionaires want to live there. But the villages are not exclusively for the wealthy. 'We have everything from studio flats at Pounds 60,000 up to The Towers, in The Bishop's Avenue, priced at Pounds 25m; and our inquiries are 50-50 from international and English buyers,' says Harding. Anscombe and Ringland is finding a shortage of property to offer its (admittedly reduced) number of inquirers; owners, like most others not forced to sell, are waiting for better times. The firm is selling Byron House in North Road, the Grade II building dating from 1719 that housed the little school attended by Betjeman and Peggy Purey-Cust. Later pupils included Elizabeth Taylor. The house, with its five bedrooms, can be had for Pounds 650,000. Victorian prime minister William Gladstone and his wife stayed at Heath Lodge, another Grade II Georgian home on the edge of Hampstead Heath; it was occupied then by his son, Henry. The house, designed by James Wyatt, has seven bedrooms, a fine cellar and lovely walled gardens. Knight Frank and Rutley cut the price recently from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 1.5m. For those who prefer a new building, the villages offer some temptations. Savills, with Benham and Reeves, is selling five apartments and two penthouses in a new block at Bracknell Gardens, Hampstead. The building, in red brick with balconies, reflects the Edwardian architecture of the area. Prices range from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 750,000; buyers will be able to choose their own interiors, up to a budget of Pounds 30,000. In Highgate, St George has just acquired one of the best building sites in London. Strolling beneath a canopy of high trees, it is easy to imagine you are in the centre of Epping forest; yet, you are just a few yards from busy Highgate high street while Waterlow Park and Highgate cemetery, where Karl Marx is buried, are close by. The developer plans to build terraced and detached houses and some two-bedroom apartments. Prices are expected to start at around Pounds 150,000. Millionaires come and go, fortunes are won and lost, but there will always be people of substance to buy sanctuary behind the high brick walls of Hampstead and Highgate. Only one thing is missing from the Highgate of yesteryear: 'Swearing the horns'. Strangers were required to take an oath holding animal horns and 20 local taverns observed the custom. Participants chanted the oath: 'Both men and maids are sworn; and consecrate the oath with dance and draught till morn.' There is a danger that this custom could be revived.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz presented a  request for annulment of the VAT law to the political and  administrative division of the Supreme Court of Justice because  he feels it is unconstitutional. He will also present a writ of  amparo calling for the suspendion of the VAT collection in his  jurisdiction while the Supreme Court issues a ruling.    According to Mayor Isturiz, the law is unconstitutional  because tax issues are the exclusive responsibility of the  national Congress and therefore its approval cannot be delegated  to others. In addition, modifications to the tax system should  be done in a progressive manner and not the way it has been done.</p>

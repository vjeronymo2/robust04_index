According to the radio, local discontent with the mayor's  approach to solving daily problems of the town was the reason.  Petitions demanding the mayor's resignation have been put up by  civic initiatives at many places in the town and a public rally  was called for Wednesday [5 January] in the headquarters of the  Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska.    Pasztor as chairman of the Council of the Association of  Towns and Villages of the Zitny Island, is an initiator of a  meeting of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia scheduled  for January 8 in Komarno to demand the establishment of a  "region with special status" in southern Slovakia populated by a  large Hungarian minority. Matica Slovenska has sharply  condemned the meeting.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (10): Gold offers gleam of hope - International economic relations SOUTH AFRICA'S monetary guardians over the past six months have experienced mixed blessings: significant and heartening progress in the struggle to curb inflation being countered by the sharp decline in the country's foreign reserves which fell by 35 per cent from a high of R11.5bn in August 1992 (2.8 months import cover) to R7.5bn (1.7 months import cover) six months later. The decline in reserves was caused by a sharp contraction in the current account surplus during the second half of 1992, and an increase in capital outflows during the fourth quarter. The deterioration in the current account was largely the result of huge maize imports following the 1991/2 drought. This caused the current account surplus to decline to under R1bn in the second half of 1992 from nearly R3.5bn during the first half. The deterioration in the capital account - capital outflows increased to R3.7bn during the fourth quarter from less than R1bn during the third quarter - was the result of large debt repayments, accelerated capital flight following renewed political unrest, and adverse 'leads-and-lags' in foreign payments as the rand weakened against the dollar. By all accounts heavy capital outflows continued in the first four months of 1993. The first quarter of 1993 did not bring much good cheer on the trade side either with the trade balance falling to R2.9bn from R3.6bn in the final quarter of 1992 and R4.5bn a year previously. Exports were only 0.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1992. Any possible dividend from the lifting of sanctions would appear to be overshadowed by world economic recession. Given net service payments and debt repayments that have to be made in the balance of the year, a continuation of this trade pattern would keep pressure on the already weak reserves position. Coming to the rescue in recent weeks, of course, has been the sharp rise in the price of gold. Gold still accounts for about a quarter of South Africa's export earnings - R18.2bn out of a total R67bn in 1992. Having averaged R980 an ounce in 1992, the price has climbed in recent weeks to more than R1,200 an ounce. If it averages R1,150 an ounce for the year (Dollars 360 at R3.20 to Dollars 1 or Dollars 340 at R3.38 to Dollars 1) then, with gold production unchanged, South Africa stands to earn an extra R3bn in foreign exchange - a huge increase given that the current account surplus last year stood at R4.3bn. This will not only be welcome but necessary given that South Africa could have to repay up to Dollars 1.6bn foreign debt this year (comprising about Dollars 440m affected debt, tied up in the debt standstill net; Dollars 400m converted debt - that is, previously inside the net but rolled over into longer term loans; and about Dollars 700m unaffected debt, mostly parastatal, that is outside the net). The parastatal debt could theoretically be rolled over but following a brief Indian summer in 1991/2, South Africa is again effectively cut off from world capital markets owing to the high premiums being demanded because of political risk. This saw the cost of borrowing rise from 1.5 percentage points over Libor in the first half of 1992 to three percentage points over Libor in the second half following the Boipatong massacre and the collapse of constitutional talks. Similar premiums are being sought in the aftermath of Mr Hani's assassination in April this year. 'We're not the flavour of the month,' concedes a senior finance ministry official. Government and parastatals are thus redeeming all their maturing debts rather than lending endorsement to the high premiums demanded. Whatever relief gold may provide, it is obviously too volatile to be relied upon. So, while reserves remain at such low levels - the Reserve Bank's target is that reserves should cover three months of imports - there will be no room for easing of monetary or fiscal policy, in spite of the economy's desperate need for some rejuvenation. An obvious way out of this bind would be access to IMF lending facilities, thus obviating the need to run a current account surplus to finance debt repayments. An IMF facility, however, appears unlikely to be offered until an interim government is in place a year or so hence. As one minister observed, the IMF seems to believe democracy in Russia can be ensured only by massive lending, whereas in South Africa the reverse obtains: lending can only begin once democracy has been achieved. Two notes of optimism arise from recent ANC statements that they will not seek to renegotiate debt arrangements and that they will campaign for the lifting of sanctions once an election date has been announced and a transitional executive council is in place. This would be especially important in the US where state and city level sanctions effectively prevent most American and Japanese banks doing business with South Africa. Talks held in London in April saw the South African government reach agreement in principle with foreign creditor banks for a final debt agreement which would see all debts in terms of the standstill repaid by 2000. The agreement will be activated once it has been endorsed by the main political players whose consent is now being sought. Such agreement is unlikely, in the short term, to be accompanied by removal of the financial rand mechanism. Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, has repeatedly made clear that the potential for disruption in the run up to an election, and its aftermath, is too great to contemplate removal of the financial rand which serves as a backstop to the commercial rand. Government officials believe it will probably be removed only when foreign investors are confident that political stability has been achieved. A related issue is whether the country should not undertake a significant devaluation to make its exports more competitive. While there is sympathy in government, no initiative seems likely until there is confidence that it will not spill over into wage and price inflation, and international economic growth suggests such a move is likely to be beneficial.</p>

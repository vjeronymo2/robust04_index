			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Letter: Wandsworth seeks funds for facilities, not new colleges Sir, Wandsworth Council is not seeking City Challenge cash to fund new City Technology Colleges in Battersea ('Doubt over council's schools plan', April 25). The East Battersea Challenge sets out to give a competitive advantage to the whole community - and focuses in particular on developing a wide range of educational and training initiatives for people of all ages. We have this year set up the new Battersea Technology College in the heart of the area. Our bid addresses the critical issue of how we can ensure that local youngsters make the most of the exciting opportunities offered by the new school. City Challenge funding would be used to provide the local primary schools with new technology facilities and allow the introduction of modern language teaching. These and other related initiatives such as after-hours homework clubs and summer schools are additions to our mainstream responsibilities. All, we have been assured by the responsible government officials, are entirely consistent with the City Challenge criteria. At the same time, we are developing a parallel proposal to establish a 'prep' school within Battersea Technology College. This is designed to complement the approach in the existing primary schools. It forms no part of our bid for City Challenge funds. The City Challenge assessors will be examining many imaginative and innovative ideas in the weeks ahead. But for many of the councils concerned it will be their first - and probably last - brush with radicalism. We have a record of making things happen in Wandsworth. This is the context in which our bid will eventually be judged. Edward Lister, chairman, education committee, Wandsworth Borough Council, The Town Hall, Wandsworth High Street, London SW18 2PU</p>

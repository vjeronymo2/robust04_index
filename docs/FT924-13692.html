			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Operations overseas lift Polaroid 25% POLAROID, the US maker of instant cameras, yesterday reported a 25 per cent improvement in third-quarter operating profits on sales which rose by 8 per cent. The company is benefiting from strong overseas business and a favourable exchange rate. Net income comparisons for the quarter were, however, distorted by an extraordinary pre-tax gain of Dollars 925m a year ago from the settlement of litigation with Eastman Kodak. Including one-time items, Polaroid had net earnings of Dollars 27.7m, or 59 cents a share, compared with Dollars 582m, or Dollars 10.47, a year earlier. Operating profit stood at Dollars 59.2m in the latest quarter, against Dollars 47.2m last year while sales advanced to Dollars 514.1m from Dollars 474.6m. Overseas sales climbed nearly 22 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 239.2m from Dollars 196.5m.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENERGY PRICES UP SHARPLY IN REBOUND FROM SELL-OFF  </P> <P> Energy prices rose sharply today in a broad rebound after Wednesday's sell-off,  mostly on concerns over the Middle East.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, the benchmark grade of U.S.  crude, rose $1.37 to $27.29 a barrel at 1 p.m. on the New York Mercantile  Exchange, the world's largest energy market.  </P> <P> On Wednesday prices fell nearly $2 a barrel to their lowest level in three  weeks as OPEC freed its members to increase production during the Mideast  crisis.  </P> <P> But prices snapped back today.  </P> <P> A delay in Iraq's promised release of Western women and children contributed to  fresh worries about tensions in the Persian Gulf. And a temporary shutdown of a  Norwegian oil platform in the North Sea also supported prices, traders said.  </P> <P> Refined product prices also rebounded today after falling along with crude oil  on Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery jumped 6.38 cents to  91.50 cents a gallon after falling 3.81 cents Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ongoing tensions in the Middle East continue to underpin prices, while OPEC's  agreement allowing higher production by members limited gains, traders said.  </P> <P> The agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries freed  heavyweight producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to boost output.  </P> <P> The cartel is trying to ensure that the U.N.-sponsored international embargo  against oil from Iraq and Iraqi-held Kuwait does not create shortages.  </P> <P> Crude oil has soared as high as $32 a barrel since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, from  about $21 a barrel on Aug. 1 and as low as $14 a barrel in May.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, war jitters will keep oil prices above $25 while actual fighting  would push them up another $20, international traders said today.  </P> <P> They said that even with the increase in OPEC output, the market will be short  1 million to 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Industry sources say OPEC could supply an extra 3 million to 3.5 million  barrels daily, compared with 4 million throttled by the embargo on Iraq.  </P></p>

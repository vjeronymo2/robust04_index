			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: IBM terminates distribution contract with Technology INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest personal computer manufacturer, has decided unilaterally to terminate its distribution contract with Technology, a leading UK personal computer reseller which was acquired last week by ICL. A second large computer manufacturer, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of the US, will not renew its contract with the UK distributor in view of the takeover, but is continuing to supply it without contract until the end of September. An urgent meeting has been arranged between Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Shingles, DEC (UK) managing director, to resolve the situation. Mr Derek Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Technology, said IBM had decided to terminate the contract without discussion. He believed IBM was wrong to do so and the company would be contesting the decision legally. He said he was surprised by IBM's response to the change of ownership although he had been aware that the controversial nature of the takeover could cause problems with his existing suppliers. It would have meant that ICL would have been marketing rival products in competition with its own. ICL bought Technology for about Pounds 30m with the intention of becoming the largest supplier of pcs in the UK, ahead of the US makers IBM, Compaq and Dell. Technology's suppliers include Compaq and Toshiba of Japan. Mr Lewis said he understood that ICPI, a wholly-owned IBM subsidiary would be happy to supply Technology with its products. ICL, which is based in the UK but owned by Fujitsu of Japan, has remained profitable throughout the recession while IBM's revenues and profits have declined. IBM was not available last night to discuss the severance of the contract.</p>

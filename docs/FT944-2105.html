			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Russian general refuses to fight Chechen rebels Growing opposition among senior Russian military officers to the invasion of Chechnya reached the front line yesterday when General Ivan Babichev, commander of one of the three divisions sent into the breakaway republic, refused to continue fighting. His statement, made to a crowd of Chechen villagers, directly flouted the orders of President Boris Yeltsin. It is the most damaging blow the Russian administration has suffered since the Chechen crisis began, and signals a dangerously mutinous mood within the officer corps. In Moscow, it was reported that Mr Yeltsin would chair a meeting today of the country's security council which would discuss the crisis and consider what action, if any, to take against the recalcitrant general. Mr Yeltsin has given Chechens until midnight tonight to hand over their arms or face a military crackdown. Gen Babichev, addressing several hundred Chechens near his division, 35 miles west of the capital Grozny, said that 'the Russian leaders can condemn us but we are not going to shoot. We are not going to use our tanks against the people'. His is the westernmost of three divisions sent to Chechnya last Sunday - and one which has appeared demoralised before the resistance it met in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. Only the northern division, reportedly joined by units of the eastern division, has reached positions near Grozny. Chechen fighters were saying yesterday that villagers had with some success appealed to its soldiers not to fight. Gen Babichev, in defying his orders, has joined calls made by the other top-level military refuseniks - General Boris Gromov, deputy defence minister, and General Alexander Lebed, the popular commander of the 14th Army. This week they criticised the intervention, with Gen Lebed saying Russia risked 'getting involved in a war with the entire Moslem world'. However, Gen Babichev's statements are more damaging to Moscow's political authority as they come from an officer in the field. They also give a publicity and morale boost to the leadership of General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, said yesterday he was ready to meet Gen Dudayev. Gen Dudayev repeated his readiness for talks 'at the highest political level'. Though most firing had stopped in Grozny last night and the Chechen fighters had been ordered to disengage and pull back, both sides continue to threaten all-out war. Threats of rebellion, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Aleksandr Udaltsov, a senior Russian diplomat in  charge of relations with the Baltics, told Interfax that the  talks Russian Deputy Foreign Ministers Boris Pastukhov and  Sergey Krylov held Tuesday with their Lithuanian counterpart  Albinas Januska were regarded as useful in the Russian Foreign  Ministry.    Udaltsov said that the talks covered the foreign property of  Lithuania and Russia following the disintegration of the USSR  and issues in the functioning of the Russian embassy in Vilnius  and the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow.    He emphasized that it was the first time the two sides had  discused "this delicate matter. ...One could not expect to have  all the property issues settled in one day. What is important  is that we have come to an understanding of the way these issues  should be discussed."    The diplomat expressed the hope that in further talks, to be  held in Vilnius shortly, the two sides will agree on the  Lithuanian embassy buildings in Rome and Paris that had been  taken over by the USSR in 1940. The Lithuanians want them back.    Another senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, who also  handles Baltic issues, thinks that the outlook for solution of  the "property issue" is "dim."    He told Interfax that there was no solution in sight for the  problem of the Russian embassy in Vilnius. "We would like to  purchase good premises using the cash Lithuania owes for  supplies of natural gas but the Lithuanian authorities remain  ambiguous on that," he said.    The diplomat also said that the Lithuanian ownership rights  of numerous buildings in Moscow "are in serious doubt." In his  words, Lithuanian diplomats have no documents confirming their  rights to use premises they now hold.    He said that Russia owned the former Lithuanian embassy  building in Rome "quite legally" while the situation in Paris  was "more complicated and should become the subject of bilateral  talks, especially because French authorities refused to act as  arbiters."</p>

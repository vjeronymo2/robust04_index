			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / OFT to probe main tour operators: Inquiry into choice of holidays offered by travel agents THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into whether the three largest UK tour operators use their links with four of the country's biggest travel agents to restrict the choice of holidays offered to consumers. The OFT said last night it would investigate the incentives offered by operators Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad to travel agency employees to sell their holidays. It will also look at: Agreements between tour operators and travel agents that restrict the sale of other companies' products; Whether independent tour operators are being prevented from selling their holidays through the large travel agents' chains. The inquiry is a challenge to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who only four months ago rejected an OFT recommendation that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigate the proposed takeover of Owners Abroad by Airtours. The bid failed last March, allowing Owners Abroad to link up instead with Thomas Cook, the travel agent. The OFT said last night that although the Airtours takeover of Owners Abroad did not go ahead, information received at the time had prompted it to look at the industry as a whole. It said the current investigation - expected to take several months - would be broader than the previous inquiry. 'That was only one merger. This is an inquiry into the whole industry,' the OFT said. Thomson, the biggest operator, owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel agents' chain. Airtours owns Pickfords Travel and recently announced the purchase of the Hogg Robinson chain. At the time of the proposed takeover of Owners Abroad, small companies opposing the bid said the five largest travel agents' chains - Lunn Poly, Pickfords, Thomas Cook, Hogg Robinson and AT Mays - handled more than half the holidays sold by travel agents, despite having only 26 per cent of shops. AT Mays is now the only one of the five not linked to a large UK tour operator. Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, last night welcomed the OFT's inquiry. He said small tour operators were often asked for 15 per cent commissions from the large travel agents' chains, compared with 10 per cent or less paid by large operators. He said independent operators could either accept lower profit margins or raise prices - making their holidays less attractive. Mr Josephides said that, at the very least, the large agents should be required to tell customers they were part of the same organisation as the big tour operators and preferred to sell their holidays. Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, questioned the need for a new inquiry. He said: 'This was fairly well canvassed by the OFT at the time of the bid. They made a recommendation to Michael Heseltine, who rejected it. 'The only thing that has changed . . . is that Airtours has acquired Hogg Robinson, which was fairly well flagged.'</p>

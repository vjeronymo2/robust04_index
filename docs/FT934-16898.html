			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / A patriarch constrained: Fiat's chairman Gianni Agnelli, faced with criticism of his refinancing plans, talks to Peter Martin and Haig Simonian Gianni Agnelli, l'avvocato, sometimes called the uncrowned king of Italy, hunches forward on the pink sofa in a smart Paris hotel and ponders the question: is he worried? Most people would say he has a lot to be worried about. Fiat, the car company his grandfather founded, is on course to make a pretax loss he puts at 'around L2,000bn' (Dollars 1.25bn) in the current year; he has just had to prop up its finances with Italy's biggest rights issue; like other large groups, it has been implicated in Italy's bribery scandals; its share of a shrinking Italian car market has dropped from 60 per cent a few years ago to around 45 per cent; and he himself, at the age of 72, has had to postpone his retirement from the chair to see the company through its difficulties. Still, there is no real pause before he answers: 'I'm worried about being in the motor car business. I'm not worried about being in Italy, though it's problematic. But I do think that we've done everything necessary to try.' Certainly, he does not seem oppressed by the problems that surround him. His features, once famously handsome, are now broader, more grizzled, the face of a patriarch rather than a playboy. The idiosyncratic Agnelli style of dress, once aped across the continent, has taken on grandfatherly overtones: his wristwatch, still worn over the shirt-cuff, now has larger, easier-to-read numbers. But his conversation is relaxed, his manner unthreatened, his smile as dangerously charming as ever. It comes into play right at the outset, as he starts the interview by attacking his critics. Some stockbrokers' analysts, quoted in the FT and elsewhere, disliked one aspect of last week's capital raising exercise: a deal to sell Fiat's controlling stake in the profitable Rinascente department store chain. Because the sale is not to a third party, but to Ifil, another quoted company in the Agnelli empire and itself a major Fiat shareholder, it seemed an artificial contrivance, and one that threatened to treat at least some of the outside shareholders unfairly. Nonsense, said Mr Agnelli: he was walking a tightrope in trying to deal fairly with all the various interests: Rinascente shareholders, Fiat shareholders, Ifil shareholders. 'I must navigate between Scylla and Charybdis'. In any case, who was to say that the deal would go through? Perhaps another bidder would emerge: 'Once the ball is in the field to play, anybody can play it. If somebody makes a higher price, we're very happy for them to have it.' It is, to be sure, a bad time to be making disposals, but Fiat's financial needs are pressing. The company's problems stem in part from the continental recession, in part from the fiercely competitive nature of the European car market. Six big rivals, all with roughly the same market share, fight one another for sales that are threatened by the surge of Japanese production in Britain. Though the Japanese threat is new, the competition is not. 'Our philosophy, what I've tried to do, is to make Fiat as big as possible.' That accounts, in part, for Fiat's huge market share at home. Surely that is now doomed, thanks to the single market and the changes in restrictions on Japanese imports? Mr Agnelli disagrees politely: 'Of that I'm not so sure. We went down below 45 per cent, now we're back to that and we're not declining. We should be able to hang on to that.' After all, he says, in France the domestic producers, Renault and Peugeot-Citroen, have roughly that figure between them. But Fiat's European market share, like that of most of its competitors, is 12 per cent, 'and that's very little'. So 12 per cent is not a sustainable long term market share? 'That's my impression. I don't think it's the right balance.' As a result, he foresees further sweeping changes in the structure of the European industry, which has already seen the gobbling up of all the second-tier manufacturers and, just this year, the announcement of a full-scale merger between Volvo and Renault. The companies are constantly talking to each other about alliances, says Mr Agnelli. 'First of all when you talk, you discuss is it technically possible, who is it technically feasible with - an American company, a private French company, a state-owned company - what sort of combination are they going to work out? And then you've got to see the industrial logic. So one is always playing with the idea of all these deals. I won't say any further than that.' Surely the mergers up till now have been mainly the strong taking over the weak? Is it feasible to expect mergers between strong companies, especially given the cultural barriers? Yes, says Mr Agnelli, it is - and the cultural barriers to cross-border mergers, for example, have largely disappeared as Europe's younger generation, at least on the continent, becomes used to working with people of other nationalities. What would bring about such a merger? 'Well, I personally think that if something happens, and one producer rises to 24 per cent of the European market, then the whole thing starts moving.' Will he be the one to start that process? 'I don't know when, who, how,' he says. But remember that Volkswagen is already up to 17 per cent market share, and 'before these recent troubles, Volkswagen was pretty imperialistic.' VW's current problems stem in part from overmanning and high costs, which it is now trying to tackle, most spectacularly by importing Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors in Detroit. Some analysts say that Fiat has to take similar steps, though on a less drastic scale. What does Mr Agnelli say to that? 'It can be done. Cost cutting means personnel reduction. We live in a country, Italy, whose philosophy is Catholic, solidaristic, Marxist,' and that imposes limits on any cuts. Still, 'some has been done, and we have to go on. But I surely would never dare say like they did in Daimler-Benz that they have to get rid of 45,000 people.' Would he like to have an equivalent of VW's Mr Lopez? There are lots of efficient cost-cutters at Fiat, he says, 'just not so glamorous.' One question much discussed in Italy is the future of the old Alfa-Romeo plant at Arese, near Milan. Will it be closed? 'Let's just say it doesn't have a growing future.' Not even the Agnelli family is immune from personnel pressures these day. Mr Agnelli's brother, Umberto, is the most recent casualty of blighted expectations, deprived of his planned succession to the chairmanship next summer. Gianni Agnelli will retain the chairmanship; Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, will also stay on. Was the decision to stay as chairman forced on him? And is this the first sign that his freedom of action will increasingly be constrained? Mr Agnelli does not answer the question directly. 'I am going to the market for a huge amount of money, I have partners coming in and they say 'For God's sake, you aren't going to do all this and then leave'.' The partners are Germany's Deutsche Bank, the Italian merchant bank Mediobanca, Italy's largest insurer Generali, and Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group. Between them they will own 10 per cent of Fiat's voting shares, held as part of a 'hard core' of shareholders, including two Agnelli companies, that altogether controls 30 per cent of Fiat votes. Another 10 per cent of Agnelli family interests remain outside the hard core  -so as to avoid swamping the minority partners, says Mr Agnelli. How long will he now stay on as chairman? 'I said three years but what I really mean is that I would like to see it through this difficult moment,' he says. Where does that leave Umberto? 'I am convinced,' says Gianni Agnelli, 'that my brother is the best person to be chairman of Fiat. Everything he does, he's always done much better than me. He's much more serious than me, he's worked much harder than I have, he's 15 years younger - I'm an old man.' But in endorsing Umberto, he said, he was expressing a personal opinion and could not speak for others. 'With the hard core, the chairman will not be elected alone by the family, there will be a consensus of others. I can't see why they would not give their consent, but I can't speak for them.' So how much will the arrangement with the new partners tie his hands? 'We have just started to work together. I am curious to see how much interest they will take.' Won't their presence on a new, slimmed-down, more hands-on board limit his freedom of manoeuvre? 'We will see, working together. I hope that they will give good advice. I don't know how much time they will want to dedicate, how much attention - I hope it will be a lot.' Dr Ulrich Weiss, the Deutsche Bank representative on the board, has been a member for some years. Will his role change? Mr Agnelli says: 'He said to me 'now in these circumstances we're going to ask more questions'.' One subject any board member will find it hard to avoid is Fiat's role in Italy's pervasive political corruption. The company seems to have made some sort of peace with the prosecutors, but senior executives are still under investigation. How does Mr Agnelli feel about his company's involvement? 'I was very ashamed,' he says bluntly. But his shame clearly has limits: 'Ninety per cent of the Fiat trouble came from one company, the construction company Cogefar. If we hadn't taken over that company, (Fiat's involvement) would have been 10 per cent of what it is.' When Fiat took over Cogefar, 'I was very afraid' of the construction industry's notorious reputation for corruption. 'And then it appeared to be exactly what I feared.' Fiat has imposed strict new anti-bribery rules, he says. The corruption scandal has had one beneficial side-effect: the government led by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the central bank, which is starting to tackle some of the country's neglected economic problems. Mr Ciampi is a technocrat, not a politician. 'C'est un commissaire de gestion,' says Mr Agnelli, slipping into French. 'Personally I think that if one could run a country forever like that it would be ideal.' Obviously that isn't possible, he says wistfully. Still, the recent, quite new, budgetary discipline 'shows that this country has got elasticity and capacity of recovery.' There has been one other helpful Italian development: last year's devaluation. Without it, Fiat's losses would have been still more disastrous. 'I was absolutely convinced that we should devalue,' says Mr Agnelli. 'One should aim at a common currency, one should aim at a common central bank,' but this is only feasible at the moment for Germany, France and Benelux, plus Austria and Switzerland. They could form a hard core, he says, which Italy, the UK and Spain could converge towards. So he doesn't have any problems with a two-speed Europe? 'Well, I mean, it is two speeds - what can you do about it?' Does he feel sad that at the end of his career, he is presiding over a company in difficulties? 'No, absolutely not. I've seen such ups and downs, at Fiat and in my life, that I just take that as part of life, part of industrial history. You have very little scope for determining things by yourself.' Does he expect Agnelli family control to survive into the next generation? 'I hope so. Everything finishes in time - but I don't think I will see it finish.'</p>

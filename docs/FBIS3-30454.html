The space between Germany and Russia is to a large extent  unclear and it is up to Central Europe to settle this, Payne  said. Russia has also a solution for Central Europe, but we do  not want to accept it and we are not about to deal with it  again, Payne stated.    In his words, the Czech Republic has a special relationship  to NATO. None of the post-communist countries can be admitted  into NATO without the Czechs, Payne said, adding that there was  no variant whereby the Czech Republic could be ruled out.    Russia says it does not want to divide Europe, but its  policy  is dividing it, and it is creating spheres of interest by  defining "close abroad." The Czech Republic, Austria and  Slovenia are not parts of Russia's "close abroad." This is the  weightiest argument which singles us out from the Visegrad Four  (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary), Payne stated.    We are cooperating with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as much  as possible but we cannot afford to wait for anybody, he added.</p>

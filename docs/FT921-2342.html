			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Microcomputer sales revolution in store - A hard-sell approach to software Would you buy a nuclear power plant from a catalogue or a jet airliner by mail order? No more than you would buy a mainframe computer from a supermarket, you might think. Yet in less than a decade, microcomputers have increased in power and fallen in cost to the point where machines with several times the power of yesterday's mainframes are being piled high and sold cheap in superstores. Computers have become commodities and are being marketed like soap powder, cornflakes, or more accurately, like their simpler electronic cousins  - audio equipment and video recorders. The phenomenon began in the US a couple of years ago but the idea has now spread to Europe. The first UK computer superstore, PC World in Croydon, south London, opened earlier this year. Next week the Business Superstore, the first in what is hoped to be a European chain of stores selling office equipment including computer hardware and software, will open in west London. A second is already planned for Colindale, north west London. Martin Nielsen, Business Superstore chief executive, has spent a year researching ways to give the Business Superstores a European look. CompUSA's store in Dallas, Texas, the first of its chain of more than 20 throughout the US, is typical. A large, low structure on the outskirts of the town, its interior is laid out more like a grocery store than a high technology dealership. A scattering of red-shirted sales assistants give advice when asked. The aisles are lined with processors, monitors, disk drives and keyboards. Microcomputer software is piled up like packets of soup. Cardboard boxes full of hardware form impromptu islands amid the sea of electronic goodies. Prices are keen; in some cases up to 80 per cent below manufacturer's suggested retail prices. Nielsen, a 40-year-old veteran of international retailing, aims for an approach which, he says, respects the technology. The Business Superstore will pay attention to colour, lighting and decor in a way foreign to its US equivalents. Computer superstores are part of a revolution in the distribution of computing products. Ten years ago, the economics of the full-line manufacturer held sway. The microcomputer business was embryonic; the computer industry sold mainframes with a price tag of Dollars 1m (Pounds 578,000) upwards and minicomputers costing from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 1m. The gross profit margins on sales of such systems were large  - at least 70 per cent and sometimes 90 per cent or more. The computer industry justified such prices by providing customers with a complete before-and-after sales service. An information technology strategy might have to be concocted. Special software might have to be written. Training would have to be organised. Today's microcomputers are as effective as minicomputers, yet cost only a fraction of the price  - say, Dollars 5,000 comparedwith Dollars 150,000. The gross margin is low  - 40 per cent or less. Competition between manufacturers is forcing prices down sharply  - between 25 and 40 per cent last year. Computer manufacturers realised early on that they could not distribute microcomputers economically using their direct sales forces. From the beginning they used distributors, dealers and value added resellers  - dealers with the expertise to develop software for their customers. Now the rapidly declining prices and margins are hacking away at the profitability of distributors and the less sophisticated dealerships. There are two principal options for survival; selling in volume with tiny profit margins, as exemplified by the superstores, or finding ways to add value to the basic hardware through software and systems integration. There is already a broad set of variations on the superstore theme in the US. An example is the warehouse club which requires customers to be members but which offers a range of products in their original cardboard cartons at exceptionally low prices  - profit margins of only a few per cent are typical. There is no sales support, training or technological expertise available. According to Personal Technology Research, a US marketing company, more than 52 per cent of personal computer sales will go through retailers by 1995. In 1990, sales of computers and related products through computer superstores reached Dollars 1.15bn compared with Dollars 700m for warehouse clubs. CompUSA reckons to be the leading operator of large format computer superstores in the US. Last year it had sales per store ranging from Dollars 22m to Dollars 80m. But it is proving a precarious business, with operating income in good years averaging 1 to 2 per cent of sales. In the three years since the company has been trading as CompUSA, it has not made an overall profit. Business Superstore in the UK hopes to avoid CompUSA's tough financial experience although Nielson accepts that with more than Dollars 5m invested to date, it will take time for the business to break even.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Ladies' nights, which offer women reduced prices to attract business, violate  laws against sex discrimination, the Iowa Supreme Court said. Although the  ruling was based on a promotion at a greyhound racing track, legal experts said  the ruling could have major implications for restaurants, theaters and other  businesses that offer discounts to members of one sex. The high court ordered  the reinstatement of a lawsuit against Bluffs Run, a Council Bluffs dog racing  track. The Iowa West Racing Assn., operator of Bluffs Run, offered a "Ladies'  Day" promotion every Wednesday from June to September, 1987. Women received  free admission into the grandstand and got discounted prices on food, drinks  and souvenirs.  </P></p>

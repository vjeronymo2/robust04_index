			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (9): Joint venture development - Hong Kong and China: Roads THE drive from Hong Kong to Guangzhou (Canton) currently takes more than 24 hours. By the end of next year this will be reduced to six hours as a result of a new road and the tenacity of Mr Gordon Wu, Hong Kong engineering tycoon and managing director of Hopewell Holdings. The super-highway is one of several big infrastructural projects being undertaken in the Pearl River delta region with strong financial and technical support from the private sector of Hong Kong. The road, constructed by a joint venture between Hopewell and the Chinese authorities, will cut through the economic heartland of China. It will link to the international markets what, according to economists, will be within 10 years the largest manufacturing centre in the world. 'It is probably one of the most important developments in Southern China', said Mr David Whittall, economist at Baring Securities (Hong Kong). Hopewell has been the trail-blazer for Build-Operate-Transfer projects in southern China. Mr Wu spent more than 10 years persuading politicians and bankers of the need for his super-highway. The current change in the business community's attitude towards a more capitalist China, and in particular its economic power-house in the south, suggests his timing could be close to perfect. Phase One of the 304km six-lane toll-way will link the provincial capital of Guangzhou with Shenzhen, China's most affluent city, and will run up to the frontier crossing with Hong Kong. The 128 inspection passages are already constructed. When Phase One is completed, in about December 1993, it will be extended to link with the western side of the delta, via the Boca Tigris bridge across the Pearl River. Phase Two will stretch as far as Jiangmen to the west and will also run south to Zhuhai, another booming Special Economic Zone which borders the Portuguese enclave of Macau. Phase Three is a shorter stretch, joining Guangzhou with Phase Two. The entire project could cost as much as Dollars HK15bn. Mr Wu is already proposing a more ambitious extension, with a 39km bridge crossing the mouth of the Pearl River, to link Zhuhai with Shenzhen's port city of Shekou, at a cost of Dollars 8bn. Hopewell is not alone in its optimism, which is further emphasised by several power station projects it has undertaken. New World Development has taken a 40 per cent stake in the Dollars HK1bn Guangzhou ring road and is also constructing a power station. Sun Hung Kai Properties is involved in a light rail project linking Shenzhen with its new international airport and nearby port. It is no coincidence that the Hong Kong parties involved are all property developers: they have residential developments in China which should become more profitable with the improved infrastructure. These projects help support the most positive post-1997 role for Hong Kong: that of service centre for the booming southern region. But although the rewards may be there, there is also significant bureaucratic hardship to be endured in embarking on private sector infrastructural projects in China, as shown by the time-scale of the Hopewell project. Hopewell's proposals were all but blocked by the political upheaval following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Further delays were experienced in obtaining the road's financing from the Bank Of China, after more than a decade of wrangling with officials both in Beijing and Guangdong Province. As a result of these delays, there has been speculation that local authorities threatened to hand over part of the Phase Two contract to another prominent local business group. Mr Wu is adamant this is untrue. He claimed Phase One would be completed a year ahead of schedule, in June 1993. He has a strong incentive, since this would result in a bonus payment of about Dollars HK1bn.</p>

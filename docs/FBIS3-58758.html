			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vatican City, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II on  Wednesday [19 January] named Nuncio Andrea Cordero Lanza di  Montezemolo as the Vatican's special representative to Israel,  following an agreement to normalise relations.    Di Montezemolo, 68, is currently apostolic delegate to  Jerusalem and Jordan and pro-nuncio to Cyprus.    Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said last month that the  appointee would keep his other functions, as representative of  the Vatican to the local churches, and would reside at the  Franciscan community at Jaffa, near Tel Aviv.    Born in Turin, di Montezemolo is a seasoned Vatican diplomat  and was one of the drafters of the December 30 agreement with  Israel.    In a reciprocal move, Israel on Wednesday appointed Shmuel  Hadas as its representative to the Holy See, the Israeli Foreign  Ministry said.    The Vatican had opposed Israel's first choice, Rabbi David  Rosen, suggesting it preferred a career diplomat for the post.    Hadas was born in Argentina in 1931 and emigrated to Israel  in 1954, settling in the Nir-Am kibbutz, before joining the  foreign service ten years later.    In 1986 he was appointed Israel's first ambassador to Spain.  Since 1987, he has run the Foreign Ministry's Cultural and  Scientific Affairs Department, doubling as adviser to Foreign  Minister Shimon Peres.    Israel and the Vatican have agreed to establish diplomatic  relations at the ambassadorial level within four months of last  month's accord.</p>

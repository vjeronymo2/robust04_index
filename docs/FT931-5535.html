			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Tory chairman unable to block local associations Sir, Your article ('Tory Associations criticise Fowler', March 2) is based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the constitution of the Conservative party. I am the chairman of the Party Organisation, the professional wing of the party. The affairs of the voluntary party are handled by the National Union of Conservative Associations, whose leadership is elected by party members. It is the National Union that decides the agenda at the Conservative party's central council and annual conference. Your article was therefore entirely wrong to state that I had 'blocked' an attempt by a number of constituency associations to call a special meeting of the central council. Not only have I not done so; I have no power to do so. In fact, this request was rejected by the elected National Union Executive Committee by overwhelming majority votes at three separate meetings on the grounds that the actual number of verified requests for a special meeting of central council was well below the 50 required. The article was also wrong to say the debate on Friday morning concerns my plans for Central Office. It does not. It concerns the proposed change in the rules of the National Union, following the admirable report of the chairman of the National Union Executive Committee, Sir Basil Feldman, already passed by that committee. As for feelings about the supposed 'autocratic style' of Central Office, it is precisely in order to address any such concerns within the party that I am setting up a board of management, representing all parts of the party. Three members will come from the National Union and in addition there will be the elected chairman of the 1922 Committee, the elected leader of our MEPs and a leading representative of our elected councillors. As far as I know the so-called Party Reform Steering Committee does not oppose my action in radically cutting spending at Central Office or in appointing a new director general and a new finance director. They do not oppose the establishment of a new Constituency Services Department and indeed they do not oppose the establishment of a management board itself. Nor indeed should they. For these actions were based on the results of the widest consultation with the party yet undertaken. Norman Fowler, Conservative Central Office, 32 Smith Square, Westminster, London SW1P 3HH</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Coca-Cola tries for trade mark Coca-Cola yesterday sought to register its bottle as a trade mark on the first day of applications under the UK Trade Marks Act 1994. The act allows three-dimensional shapes, sounds and smells to be protected as registered trademarks for the first time in the UK. Eight years ago, Coca-Cola failed in a test case under the old Act to register the shape of its bottle. Its new attempt is expected to be accepted. In the first hour yesterday at the Patent Office in Newport, south Wales, 373 applications were made. They included the shape of the chocolate in a Toblerone bar, the red telephone and jingle used in advertisements for Direct Line, the British insurance company, and the smell of roses impregnated into Sumitomo tyres. In all, about 800 applications were made yesterday.</p>

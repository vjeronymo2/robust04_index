			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  presented a controversial proposal here Wednesday [13 April] for  mandatory consultations between multinational companies and  their employees within the EU.    The proposal follows the failure of EU employer and trade  union organisations to reach a voluntary accord on how to  improve ways by which employees are informed and consulted about  a multinational's activities.    The European Commission said its proposed framework would be  mandatory for companies which cannot negotiate a voluntary  accord with their employees within two years, or which refuse  pointblank within six months to start negotiations.    It would apply to companies with at least 1,000 employees,  including at least 100 each in at least two member states -- if  at least 100 employees in at least two countries ask for it in  writing.    EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said the  proposal, which must still be approved by member states, aimed  at maximum flexibility.    He said: "It is designed to trigger off a process of  negotiation between the social partners at company level which  are best suited to their own particular circumstances.    ``It is only in the event of failure to agree that minimum  requirements concerning the nature and content of information  and consultation will apply,'' Flynn added.    But the EU employers' confederation attacked the proposal,  saying that the Commission wanted to impose a "uniform, rigid  and bureaucratic" structure on all EU companies.    The directive, which stems from the social chapter of the  EU's Maastricht union treaty, would apply to all companies,  whether based within the EU or outside, whose European  operations meet the Commission's size criteria.    The only exception is Britain, which negotiated an exemption  from the social chapter when the treaty was negotiated. But the  proposal would apply to affiliates of British-based companies in  other EU countries.</p>

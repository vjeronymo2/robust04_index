			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD  </P> <P> Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou accepted the resignation of all 54  ministers in his Cabinet, clearing the way for a government shake-up in a  political crisis over a bank scandal. The Cabinet reshuffle will be the second  since the $200-million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal involving a  fugitive Greek banker broke five months ago, leading to resignations of eight  Cabinet ministers. Government sources indicated that Papandreou intends to use  the resignations to purge the Socialist government of ministers implicated in  the Bank of Crete scandal and attract waning support for his governing  Panhellenic Socialist Movement. The new Cabinet is expected to be named today.  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Disputes mar launch of WTO - Inauspicious start for new, more powerful, international trade body Trade envoys from more than 120 nations yesterday gave their formal blessing to the creation of the World Trade Organisation on January 1, following ratification of the Uruguay Round trade agreements by 50 countries. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said at least 100 nations were expected to be members of the WTO on its starting date. But the launch celebrations for the new world trade body, which will have much wider powers than Gatt to police fair trade rules and settle disputes, were muted by continued uncertainty over choosing the head of the WTO and over whether China will succeed in its attempt to become a founder member. Trade diplomats said yesterday that the continued stalemate in the three-way contest for the WTO top job made a decision before the end of the year improbable. It now looks virtually certain that Mr Sutherland will be asked to stay on in a caretaker role until his successor is chosen. Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, the European Union candidate, is said to be well ahead of the field, with over half Gatt's 124 members in his favour. But he is far from mobilising the necessary consensus. Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is supported by the US and Latin America, has only just begun his campaign after leaving office as Mexican president at the beginning of this month. Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea, with Japan and most of Asia behind him, is also proving a more formidable candidate than expected. Meanwhile, intensive negotiations this month in Geneva on China's bid to join Gatt and the WTO have made little headway. 'The Chinese are still playing hardball,' Mr Andrew Stoler, deputy US Gatt ambassador, said yesterday, commenting on four days of bilateral talks between China and the US. Mr Hugo Paemen, the EU's top trade negotiator, said China's membership negotiations 'are not in good shape at the moment'. Beijing, which wants WTO founder-member status, is insisting that substantive talks must be completed before the end of the year, after which it will make no more trade concessions. However, the US and other western nations argue that China still appears unprepared to accept fully the fair trading rules that are a condition for Gatt and WTO membership, and has failed to offer sufficient access to its domestic market for foreign goods and services. Apart from the January 1 starting date, the WTO implementation conference yesterday agreed that countries would continue to apply Gatt rules to non-WTO members for a further year. Because of the lengthy fact-finding procedures involved, complaints can be brought under Gatt's anti-dumping and anti-subsidies codes for another two years.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / US signals softer Ukraine line AFTER months of trying to strong-arm Ukraine into surrendering its nuclear missiles, the US appears to be taking a softer line, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The new approach will be unveiled today when Mr Strobe Talbott, Washington's ambassador at large to the former Soviet Union, holds a series of meetings with senior Ukrainian officials and MPs. He will not, however, be meeting either Ukraine's president or its prime minister, a sign of the current coolness in relations with the US. Mr Talbott said he would like to shift the US-Ukrainian relationship from its focus on nuclear weapons to a wider range of issues. 'It is important not to be a one-note Johnny. What we want to do is engage the Ukrainian government in a dialogue about the relationship in all of its aspects, rather than just dwelling on one subject, important as that subject may be.' Mr Talbott also emphasized that the US 'wants to develop a relationship with Ukraine in its own right,' separate from that with Russia. US relations have deteriorated over the past few months as Washington pressed Kiev to fulfil its earlier pledge to become a non-nuclear state.</p>

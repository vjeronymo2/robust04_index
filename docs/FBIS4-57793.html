Figueroa B. and Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>   [Text] Jose Luis Sosa, who is currently one of the  representatives of the president-elect in the transfer of power  commission, will be the director of the State Security and  National Defense Office in the administration that will be  inaugurated on 1 September.    Currently the Public Security and National Defense office,  led by Menalco Solis, former planning minister of the military  regime, is made up of a specialized brigade that uses very  modern communications equipment to keep President Guillermo  Endara informed of everything that is taking place in the  country.    A source linked with President-elect Ernesto Perez  Balladares  announced that tomorrow, Tuesday, Sosa and Gabriel Lewis  Galindo, future foreign minister, will travel to Washington to  meet with ranking U.S. Government officials. The Panamanian  delegation will also meet with U.S. senators and businessmen to  discuss topics related to economic and political relations  between the two countries.    Sosa, an experienced businessman, and Francisco Sanchez  Cardenas represent Perez Balladares in the commission for the  transfer of power. Eduardo Linares and Joaquin Fernando Franco  represent the government in the commission.    In addition to the security office, the Presidency of the  Republic maintains the members of the Institutional Protection  Service (SPI), which is charged with guarding the Palace of the  Herons presidential palace and other state offices.    There are supposedly installations with computerized  equipment in Amador that permit state security members to  compile data and general information on different areas and  topics.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton stressed here today that he expects changes to be made  in his health care reform bill, but he remains adamant that it  must be universal, meaning covering all Americans.    Clinton who is expected to lobby heavily for his health  reform package this week, told a U.S. TV program this morning  that health care doesn't have to be done tomorrow. It ought to  be phased in over a period of just a few years. "But we ought  not to walk away without a bill that provides health care to all  Americans."    The President's health care package is now under siege in  U.S. Congress.    U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick  Moynihan, whose closely watched committee is considered crucial  in shaping a final health reform plan, told a TV program Sunday  [18 June] that there is no chance Congress will pass a bill with  iron clad promises of health insurance for all Americans. But  he held out the prospect of an abridged version in which health  care would be available in about 10 years.    Moynihan and Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking minority member  of the Finance Committee, delivered that message to Clinton last  week.    The U.S. president said that he is aware that tens of  millions of dollars "in special interest money" has been spent  to convince people "that our plan is wrong."    "We needed to make some changes in our plan," Clinton added.  "But I also know that the right thing for America is to do what  every other advanced country has done in guaranteeing  middle-class working people health care that can't be taken  away. All I want to do is to give the American people what the  president and the Congress and the federal government employees  have," he said.</p>

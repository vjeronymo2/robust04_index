			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for Dowding fall DOWDING AND Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, said a third year of recession had cut its full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 5.04m. The board proposes a maintained final dividend of 1.58p giving a total for the year held at 2.5p uncovered by earnings per share of 2.04p (2.65p). 'Although not covered by attributable profits, the total cost of the dividend at Pounds 3.66m is more than covered by normal trading profits before deduction of exceptional costs,' Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said. Turnover for the year ended June 30 rose to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 74.7m) almost entirely on the first full year contribution of a US acquisition made at the end of the previous period. Pre-tax profits were undermined by redundancy costs of Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 165,000) and a Pounds 628,000 one-off write-down of a near 9 per cent stake in Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based engineer, for which Dowding and Mills made an abortive bid, and which has since declined in value. Last year's Pounds 633,000 charge was for costs incurred in bidding for Torday. Operating profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 7.31m) included Pounds 857,000 from the US acquisition. 'Although some sectors of the United Kingdom economy have recently improved, we have not yet seen any positive upturn in the markets where we operate.' Mr Hollings said. Mainland Europe, had had a difficult time, he said, while Australia had been mixed, with reasonable volumes in the company's Queensland branches, but a shortage of work in New South Wales. Tight control of capital expenditure - down to Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 5.9m) - and of cash, had helped reduce gearing to 18.8 per cent (22.8 per cent).</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OCC MUGS A TOO-CUTE 'GODSPELL'  </P> <P> Some musicals fit college stages better than others. "Godspell," with its  no-holds-barred attitude, is an accommodating vehicle for young, maybe raw  performers looking for the chance to try things out.  </P> <P> Stephen Schwartz's (music and lyrics) and John-Michael Tebelak's (book)  retelling of the Gospel According to St. Matthew is carte blanche theater, a  show where the 11th Commandment could be "Thou shalt not commit acts that are  not outlandish." This musical welcomes mugging and just about every trick an  actor or director can come up with.  </P> <P> Director Alex Golson knows that and lets his Orange Coast College cast go at  it. They scamper up the aisles, make big faces, flail at the songs and bring  out one vaudeville shtick after another. These folks are partying.  </P> <P> But what about the audience? Many people at a recent performance did seem to  get swept up by it all, but almost an equal number appeared bewildered, or at  least bored. Such haphazard energy, while always fresh at the outset, can get  numbing fairly early on in the first act.  </P> <P> Besides, there's tone to deal with. When "Godspell" was first produced in 1971  (to thrilled crowds, by the way), it was like nails scratching a blackboard for  many critics. They did not think it was sacrilegious -- "Godspell," in fact, is  generally reverent -- but they did find it thwarted by persistently cute humor.  That has not changed.  </P> <P> Back then, Christ wore a Superman suit and a red clown nose, and the recitation  of biblical parables used various satires, including one on game shows.  </P> <P> Under Golson's direction, "Godspell" is filled with a Pandora's Box of soft  swipes at everything from Shirley MacLaine to the slow-motion running scenes in  "Chariots of Fire." There's even a line about "Batman."  </P> <P> A few are clever: John the Baptist baptizes everybody with a slap of a wet  sponge, and the idea of having a character wheeze out "Rose . . . bud" before  dying was good, tweaking fun. But many are just too corny or repeated to  inanity, as when Christ says a line and the characters say it again, this time  with slapstick emphasis.  </P> <P> As for the voices, they are not exceptional but worthy enough to satisfy the  routine score's needs. Andre de Leon as Christ and Ralph B. Pena as John the  Baptist (he is also Judas later) sing decently, and their acting holds up.  Actually, as both characters are the least overblown in this group, de Leon and  Pena are welcome elements.  </P> <P> The costumes (uncredited) are a mixed bag, sort of a hippie-cosmic chic, which  is appropriate here. Jane Phillips Hobson's lights are jarring at times, but  they get the job done. There is not much to the set (also uncredited), just a  few boxes filled with props atop a stage bearing a large celestial design.  </P> <P> 'GODSPELL'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College production of the Stephen Schwartz/John-Michael Tebelak  musical.

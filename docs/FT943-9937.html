			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: New York After last week's disturbingly strong July employment report, traders and investors will today be wary of more bad news that might spark another interest rate increase. In particular, nerves will be on edge as the market awaits the July inflation data, due on Thursday and Friday. The unexpectedly large jump in non-farm payrolls last month prompted economists to warn that the economy was probably growing faster than expected. Confirmation of that view could come this week when July producer and consumer inflation numbers are published. At the moment, Wall Street is expecting a 0.3 per cent rise in the Producer Prices Index on Thursday and a similar increase in the Consumer Prices Index the next day, but those estimates may be revised upwards in light of the strong July jobs report. If the inflation figures come in above expectations, another sell-off in the Treasury market is likely to follow as investors bet that the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee will sanction an interest rate rise at its next meeting, on August 16 and 17. This week will be especially testing as it includes three big Treasury auctions: Dollars 17.25bn of three-year notes will be sold tomorrow, followed by Dollars 12bn of 10-year notes the next day, and Dollars 11bn of 30-year bonds on Thursday.</p>

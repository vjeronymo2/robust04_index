			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The UN high commissioner for human rights, Mr.  Jose Ayala Lasso, has been in our country since the day before  yesterday. He has come to Rwanda to gather information on the  development of the situation -- in particular the massacres --  and to seek possible solutions to that problem.    He had the opportunity to hold talks with certain government  military leaders, including the chief of general staff and the  principal private secretary at the Defense Ministry. Their  talks touched on the issue of those people now taking refuge in  certain buildings in Kigali, which are surrounded by Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] militia,  notably the Hotel Des Milles Collines, the (Amohoro) hotel, and  King Faisal hospital. The government military leaders, among  them Chief of Staff [COS] Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, reportedly  promised Mr. Ayala Lasso that they would facilitate the  liberation of these people -- but undoubtedly this promise will  not be translated into reality, given the statements made by  this same government army COS this morning on Radio France  Internationale. When RFI correspondents asked him what the  soldiers needed to neutralize the MRND militia [Interahamwe] so  as to prevent the massacre of innocent people, Colonel Bizimungu  answered that it was a lack of soldiers, given that the soldiers  were busy repulsing the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA].

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / IBM Japan chief steps down as profits fall IBM JAPAN, the Japanese arm of International Business Machines of the US, yesterday announced that Mr Takeo Shiina is resigning as chief executive, to be replaced by Mr Kakutaro Kitashiro, the president. The company also unveiled a 90 per cent fall in taxable profits for 1992. It said Mr Shiina's resignation was to make way for a younger generation of executives. He will remain as chairman, but will resign from the executive board, and will leave his post at IBM in the US. The sudden change in top personnel at IBM Japan surprised the local industry, as Mr Shiina has led the company for 15 years. The company also announced a cut in board membership from 30 to 24, and an average 50 per cent reduction in executive bonuses this summer. Head office staff will be reduced to 300 this year by moving 100 employees to marketing divisions. Last year, IBM Japan transferred 1,300 staff from its Tokyo headquarters to marketing and engineering departments. The company reported that pre-tax profits plunged 90 per cent to Y10.56bn (Dollars 90m) for 1992 from Y103.52bn the year before, due to lower personal computers prices, and a sharp fall in sales of its mainframe computers. Operating profits fell 73 per cent to Y38.45bn from Y113.90bn on sales 1.4 per cent lower at Y1,254.5bn. Net profits fell 44.8 per cent to Y31.21bn from Y56.48bn. The fall in sales and profits mirrors depressed earnings at Japanese computer makers, hit by a sharp decline in capital investment by Japanese corporations. Computer hardware sales fell 10 per cent. IBM Japan said it was trying to shift its business focus to software and services, which grew 10 per cent last year. The company was affected by restructuring expenses and the costs of merging Computer Systems Leasing, which it bought last year. IBM Deutschland, IBM's German subsidiary, yesterday announced it would cut nearly 4,000 jobs this year, Reuter reports from Hanover. Mr Bernhard Dorn, chief executive, said IBM planned initially to reduce about 3,000 jobs. 'We need a cost efficient structure as soon as possible.' Since 1988, the number of workers in production in Germany has already dropped to 6,000 from 11,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros; from the "The Morning Paper" </F> newscast]    [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar, Honduran  Armed Forces spokesman, said the military had to handle a report  that turned out to be a false alarm before the inauguration of  the new government.    [Begin recording] [Santos] The Public Security Forces were  alerted to an unidentified object, near the Camosa area, I  understand. Specifically, it was located on the route to  Toncotin Airport. The bomb squad went to the site and  determined it was an empty box. [end recording]    Commenting on the catcalls heard at the Tegucigalpa National  Stadium during the inauguration the moment the Honduran Armed  Forces General Staff members entered, Santos said:    [Begin recording] [Santos] We regard this in a positive  light. This definitely shows you rifles have not served only to  crush the people. The people at any given time are totally at  liberty to express themselves without the fear of being crushed.  We believe this is a situation.... [pauses] We look at it  under a positive light. These situations definitely merit  analysis. This did not happen four years ago, and it happened  now. We hope that in the next four years corrective measures  are taken. That way the situation will be totally different  four years from now.    [Unidentified reporter] Colonel, why do you think the people  in the stadium jeered you?    [Santos] The fact is these things happen to express  disapproval of certain actions that are not conducted by  institutions but are often isolated incidents by individuals who  commit actions that fall outside the law. [end recording]    Santos maintained the catcalls were not directly aimed at  Luis Alonso Discua, the Armed Forces chief.    [Begin Santos recording] This is not a situation against the  Armed Forces chief. It shows disapproval of some actions that  we have acknowledged at the opportune time and have sought to  correct. At any given moment, the important thing is to analyze  them with the goal of amending them so these things do not  happen. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Police raid home of coalition MP Public prosecutors yesterday raided the home and offices of Mr Tadao Otani, a diet member belonging to the Japan Renewal party, the second largest grouping in the government coalition. The raids represent an important development in the continuing drive against political corruption. Until now investigators have focused on local politicians and the business community. If Mr Otani is indicted, he would be the first diet member to be implicated during the current anti-corruption effort. Separately, 23 private individuals filed a complaint with the public prosecutors against Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Japan Renewal party. They accused him of receiving illegal donations from construction companies worth Y5m (Pounds 30,000). In November, Mr Ozawa admitted receiving millions of yen from a top construction company, but insisted the donations were not illegal. Mr Otani's former chief secretary, Mr Susumu Ochiai, has already been charged for facilitating tax evasion. In January he admitted offering supporters receipts for political donations in excess of the amounts given. Under present electoral rules, individuals can receive tax breaks on donations of more than Y10,000 to political groups, and the 62 supporters were able to claim inflated amounts, worth Y52.5m.</p>

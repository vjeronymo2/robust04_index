			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Volodymyr Lanovyy </F> in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] I believe that the president  must begin by repaying the state's debts to its people. In the  first months after my election, I will conduct financial  operations to compensate the population for the loss of bank  savings and the devaluation of possessions. Apart from this, we  will repay all debts in connection with government bonds,  insurance, and payment for farm produce in 1991-93. The main  focus of my activity will be economic recovery. We must give  enterprises a chance to work and cancel all administrative  restrictions, prohibitive taxes, licences, and quotas, which are  smothering enterprises today, hiking up interest rates to  unheard-of proportions, leading to a payment crisis, and  bringing business to a halt. We will ensure financial  stabilization in society, with stable prices, currency exchange  rates, and wages. This will provide the basis for an increase in  production and an increase in pay. Our calculations show that  in six months after these reform measures, we will be able to  raise wages four- and five-fold, taking the average wage up to  the equivalent of $90-$100 monthly. [passage omitted]    We will not be able to make a move forward until we  regionalize our life; that is, grant social and economic  independence to oblasts, the autonomous republic of Crimea, and  local authorities, both in terms of democratic self-government  and necessary financial and tax opportunities, independence in  regulating the investment, and production climate and foreign  trade on their territory. Apart from this, we are faced with a  very important task of ridding ourselves of national  self-isolation we have wound up that smothers us today in  economic and humanitarian terms. We must become active in  international life, profit from foreign trade, and repatriate  hard currency, which is currently kept abroad, depriving us of  economic confidence. We must become an active participant of  the political life. We will, of course, be admitted to the  international community, and we will become one of the civilized  nations in the world. Thank you.</p>

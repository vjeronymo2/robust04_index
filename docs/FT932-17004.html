			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hit Thomas Jourdan Although operating profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 260,000, Thomas Jourdan incurred increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 780,000 in 1992, against Pounds 519,000. Losses were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 699,000 (Pounds 539,000) mainly relating to redundancies and surplus property costs. Turnover for the group, which makes and markets consumer goods, including trouser presses, fireplaces and furniture, came to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 25.5m). Most subsidiaries had traded profitably during the year, the directors said. In view of a relatively encouraging start to this year and improvement from continuing businesses, the recommended final dividend is 0.25p for a total of 0.75p (1.5p). Losses per share were 4.35p (1.47p).</p>

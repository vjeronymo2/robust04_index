			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-STARS START OVER IN DETROIT;  </P> <P> DENNY MCLAIN SINGS, LEON SPINKS TENDS BAR AT SAME CLUB  </P> <P> Just last month, Denny McLain, former Detroit Tigers pitcher, faced his second  prison term.  </P> <P> But McLain, 44, is now playing pop music on a synthesizer at a bar in this  Detroit suburb after receiving 5 years' probation.  </P> <P> Baseball's last 30-game winner -- sentenced in December to probation after  pleading guilty to racketeering and cocaine possession charges -- entertains 5  nights a week at Jovan's, where former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks  tends bar.  </P> <P> Jovan's owner, Al Balooly, said he thought it might be good for business "to  have someone with a name playing here."  </P> <P> Balooly also hired Spinks, the 35-year-old former heavyweight boxing champion,  last week as a combination bartender-greeter.  </P> <P> Monday, the two former big names in Detroit sports met for the first time.  </P> <P> "I told Denny that if anybody gives him any trouble, I'll punch them out,"  Spinks joked.  </P> <P> McLain, who won 31 games with the Tigers in 1968, was convicted in Tampa, Fla.,  of loan-sharking, gambling and cocaine dealing in March 1985, and sentenced to  23 years in prison.  </P> <P> He was released after serving 29 months, when a federal appeals court ruled he  had been treated unfairly by the judge at his trial. He then pleaded guilty to  racketeering and cocaine possession charges as part of a plea-bargain agreement  and began his probation Dec. 15.  </P> <P> "Let's just say I'm glad it's over," McLain said in an interview with the  Detroit Free Press. "It's tough not knowing what your future is going to be. I  didn't even buy a 1989 calendar -- that's how unsure I was of what was going to  happen to me."  </P> <P> McLain and his family now live in Fort Wayne, Ind. He said it hasn't been easy  readjusting to family life.  </P> <P> " . . . You don't realize how much you miss your family until you can't be with  them," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liana Buligan: "And Still the Trade Unions Did </F> Not Sell Out"]    [Text] Under the bombardment of motions and official  complaints, the government has barricaded itself in the Victoria  Palace, besieged more by the internal dangers that it imagines  await it than by those that might come from trade union  insurgents, who are suddenly radicalized at the end of the year.  Government sources, which we do not wish to reveal, declare that  distrust and isolation play havoc among the members of the  executive, who have reached the point of impossibility in making  any decisions in task forces except when direct decisions come  via prescribed channels. The anxiety that overwhelms the  executive team is, however, a faint echo of the stress borne by  the top of the establishment pyramid, that is the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania] and the Presidency, which, instead  of enjoying the time-out created by the signing of the agreement  with the International Monetary Fund, must face a coalition,  inconceivable a few months ago, among the opposition parties,  trade unions, student leagues, and revolutionary associations.  The dance of the motions unfolding in Parliament would remain a  benign aerobic exercise if nearly all Romanian social forces had  not been concentrated behind one of these motions. They decided  to maintain unity around their only common and indisputable  demand: the resignation of the current government and the  formation of a governing coalition excluding the PSM [Socialist  Labor Party] and the PRM [Greater Romanian Party]. In this  context, the PSM motion appears as a slight diversion. It is  "just a joke," as the chief executive recently declared at the  National Confederation of Free Trade Unions, because no matter  how much we could approximate the movement of the electorate to  the left, thanks to the galloping impoverishment of the  population, and consequently, the existence of the voters'  interest forecast by Ilie Verdet [leader of the PSM] in view of  the obvious alliance between the opposition and the trade  unions, any hope for an official socialist restoration is  ludicrous.    The effecting of subversive ideas--according to which the  large trade unions would be divided through a "betrayal" by the  CNSLR-Fratia [National Conference of Free Trade Unions -  Brotherhood] who allegedly entered into an alliance with the  government for the pay of a few deputy ministerial  positions--proved completely false. On the contrary, the  strategy the CNSLR-Fratia used proved to be one of faultless  sophistication. After the meeting in November offered a respite  to the government in order for it to act upon the trade union  demands that it had promised to satisfy, thus leaving the  curtain raised in front of the trade union base and the domestic  and international political forces, in order to see how the  current government acquits itself in the responsible manner of  the promises it made. Thus, no one will be able to accuse the  trade unions of not having exhausted every peaceful negotiating  formula with irrefutable arguments. The government, however,  fulfilled nothing it had promised, and, moreover, it considered  the wish of the trade unions to participate along with employers  and the MMPS [Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare] in a  tripartite administration of the unemployment compensation funds  and social assistance as just an intrusion into the executive's  prerogatives, and therefore the trade union's attempt to  participate in the decisionmaking process was criticized. Proof  of this is the fact that the CNSLR-Fratia declared that,  together with Cartel Alfa, BNS [National Trade Union Bloc], the  student league, and revolutionary associations, it would  organize and participate in the trade union's struggle, which  has already been launched. Thus, we learn that the trade unions  are united and will organize jointly a large meeting in  Timisoara on 16 December, after which they plan to stage strikes  by federations and a general strike. The time for negotiations  has ended exactly in these days of sensitive and deep  remembrance of December 1989. The trade unions' consultations  with the opposition parties are no longer a secret, and, as  Victor Ciorbea, the president of CNSLR-Fratia says, "the motion  brought by the opposition is an approach from the political  point of view toward the government's performance, and it is  complemented on a social level by the beginning of the trade  unions' struggle." In other words, the sanction is applied to  the Vacaroiu government as much by the opposition for the  government's political policy as by the trade unions for the  government's social policy. A government which shows itself to  be politically and socially inept after one year should be  replaced by another government from a broader coalition, from  which, perhaps, the two parties which are considered extremist  and restoration-communist are excluded. This is the point of  view of the trade unions, whose great trump card is the alliance  that has been made. In view of this situation, it is no longer  possible for the government to avoid giving an answer, because  negotiating a pact for social tranquility, which is so  necessary, cannot start without getting rid of the existing  team. These are difficult times for the PDSR, which sees its  alliances and friends as seriously compromised and is placed in  the situation of betraying someone in order to maintain a part  of its power. It remains to be seen who....</p>

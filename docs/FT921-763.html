			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Atlas Mining slips into red ATLAS Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, a leading Philippine mining company which operates the biggest copper and gold mine in the Far East, yesterday reported a 1991 net loss of 490.8m pesos (Dollars 20.197m), compared with a net profit of 309.9m pesos the year before. Net revenues amounted to 4.2bn pesos, down 14.3 per cent, as low metal prices and reduced world demand took their toll on the company's performance. The company, whose shares are traded in Manila and New York, said the 1991 loss could have been higher but for 'drastic cost reductions in all areas, combined with a higher level of efficiency in operations'. It said copper prices were not likely to improve significantly in the short term, so it had refocused its strategies.</p>

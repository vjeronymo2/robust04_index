At a press conference held here this afternoon, Vietnamese  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai issued [a] statement by his  ministry saying the decision meets the approval of the American  and Vietnamese people, and that of many other countries as well.    U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday [3 February]  declared  the embargo on Vietnam at an end, and proposed the mutual  establishment of liaison offices in the two countries.    Le Mai said that improvement in U.S.-Vietnamese relations  would make a significant contribution to peace, friendship, and  cooperation among nations.    The Vietnamese Government reaffirms its policy of attaching  importance to relations with the United States and expresses the  wish for normal relations between the two countries, he  continued.    Officials of the two countries will meet immediately to  discuss the details of setting up liaison offices. Vietnam sees  this development as a transitional step towards full diplomatic  relations between the two countries, he added.    Le Mai also reiterated Vietnam's policy of regarding the  question of Americans missing in action in the war as a  humanitarian concern, and not linked to political issues.    In consonance with their humane tradition and policy, the  Government and people of Vietnam have been, and will be  cooperating in a constructive spirit with the American  Government and people to solve this issue to the fullest  possible extent, he stressed.    The vice minister said that Vietnam is willing to become a  friend of the international community and will work for the sake  of peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia and the  world.    Le Mai said it will be a long and difficult process between  lifting the embargo and normalizing relations, and it is up to  the extent of sincerity shown by both sides to decide whether  there will be obstacles in this process.    He expressed the wish that the United States will look upon  Vietnam as a friend, just as Vietnam looks at the United States  as its friend.    John Cray, head of the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi, today also  told reporters that the lifting of embargo will help strengthen  cooperation between the two countries in solving the MIA issue.</p>

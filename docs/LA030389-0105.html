			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS WITH POLISH REGIME GIVE SOLIDARITY A LIFT;  </P> <P> OUTLAWED TRADE UNION HAS NEW-FOUND LEGITIMACY, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN  </P> <P> The Solidarity spokesmen are on television every night, giving their version of  events. They are interviewed in exhaustive detail, and they provide measured  analyses of the situation.  </P> <P> The state-run television does not call them Solidarity spokesmen, for the  movement is still illegal, or at least unofficial. But the spokesmen generally  hold sheaves of paper or file folders with the union's name clearly in sight.  </P> <P> The matter under examination is the recently opened dialogue, the so-called  round-table discussions, between the outlawed independent trade union and  Poland's Communist government. For three weeks now, in almost daily sessions,  negotiators for the two sides have been meeting in an effort to work out a plan  for Poland's future.  </P> <P> The plan's details are indistinct, and concrete accomplishment remains distant,  but the talks have brought about changes that could be difficult to reverse.  </P> <P> The regular, commonplace appearance of Solidarity officials on television --  impossible four or five weeks ago -- is an example. Journalists from Poland's  "unofficial" press, once accurately described as "underground," show up for  briefings of government spokesman Jerzy Urban and are designated  "representatives of Lech Walesa's press center." Solidarity negotiators at the  table are referred to by the government as "Lech Walesa's organizational  bureau."  </P> <P> In the process, Walesa and the union movement he heads have been legitimized by  the authorities -- even if official sanction of the movement has yet to be  announced. It is a calculated gamble on the part of the authorities, who hope  that Solidarity can be made to share the blame for the country's current mess  while being deprived of the power to significantly change it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snags Encountered  </P> <P> The round-table talks have run into snags in recent days as groups discussing  such issues as youth and the mass media have found themselves in sharp  disagreement. Working groups discussing the economy and politics have also run  into obstacles, with the two sides speaking what sometimes seem like different  languages and pressing toward different goals.  </P> <P> Walesa met Thursday with Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, minister of the interior and  head of the government delegation at the round-table talks, in an apparent  effort to smooth out the differences. Neither side made public any details of  the meeting.  </P> <P> While the talks have gone on, Solidarity activists in factories all over Poland  have been getting organized and, in some cases, reclaiming offices that were  occupied by the state-sanctioned unions after Solidarity was outlawed in 1981.  </P> <P> There is a feeling that time is on Solidarity's side, while the government, by  contrast, is in a race with the calendar and growing public and labor  discontent.  </P> <P> "The pressure now is on the government," a Solidarity activist said. "They want  to get something done in the next two weeks because they are afraid of strikes.  They are also afraid of the students, who are getting more daring and more  impatient. They want to get elections held as early in the summer as possible.  </P> <P> "On our side, we are interested in agreement, but we know from experience that  we have to press for every inch. The authorities do not surrender anything  easily. We have to fight for it. And while the arguing goes on, we get our  organization in shape and we see the sweat on their foreheads."  </P> <P> Since the talks started, Walesa has been touring the country, talking to youth  groups and factory workers. Somewhat ostentatiously, he has been preaching  patience to all audiences, urging activist students to restrain their  demonstrations and workers to resist striking for higher wages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Are Quickly Settled  </P> <P> Small, sporadic strikes have become an almost daily feature of life in Poland  in the last six months, most of them quickly settled by grants of more money  for the workers. And although the threat of large-scale strikes in major  factories has put pressure on the government, an actual outbreak of strikes  could shake the Solidarity leadership as well, possibly eroding Walesa's  moderating influence.  </P> <P> A student demonstration last weekend in Krakow, in which the students ridiculed  the Soviet Union and wound up in a violent clash with the police, brought  expressions of concern from both Solidarity and the government.  </P> <P> Walesa, calling for calm, told the students that Poland could be built "only  through work -- wise, well-organized work."  </P> <P> At a meeting in Lodz, Walesa asked: "Is there any other solution besides the  round-table? What will happen if the agreement doesn't work out? For me, this  is the question: Shall we go the peaceful way, or shall we break heads with  stones, as the young ones want?"  </P></p>

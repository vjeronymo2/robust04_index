			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar shrugs off M3 figures THE DOLLAR remained firm against the D-Mark yesterday in spite of the release of German money data implying that the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut rates at its council meeting today, writes James Blitz. German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent in March after contracting by 0.3 per cent in the previous month. The March figure contrasted with economists' expectations of a 1 per cent rise in M3 money growth. A particular concern for the market was the growth in German bank lending, which showed a rise of 9 per cent when annualised over the last six months. Although the Bundesbank has said it will be holding a press conference after its council meeting today, the data underlined that there would probably be no cut in the discount rate. The news from Germany failed to depress the dollar, however. The US currency closed at DM1.6050 from a previous DM1.6000. But in New York it receded to finish at DM1.5997. In part, this may have been due to continued short-covering of dollar positions by dealers who had oversold the US currency in recent weeks. The market may also have been awaiting the outcome of today's council meeting before deciding what to do. The D-Mark did not strengthen much against most European currencies, in spite of the German money supply figures. The French franc closed at FFr3.377 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.379. Dealers remained optimistic about the parity between the franc and the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism in the run-up to today's summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The pound closed  1/4 pfennig easier against the D-Mark yesterday at DM2.4650. Some dealers said they were waiting for today's unemployment figures and tomorrow's retail sales numbers before deciding what to do about sterling. According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London, the market is expecting the March unemployment figure to be on the high side following February's net drop of 22,000 on the month. The peseta was lower against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, in spite of heavy Bank of Spain intervention to support the currency. Some dealers said comments from the governor of the Bank of Spain, who predicted that the ERM might face further instability, had weakened the Spanish currency. After dropping to Pta72.48 at one stage, the peseta closed at Pta72.37 from a previous Pta72.31. In spite of another strong rally by the yen in Wednesday's Tokyo trading, the dollar managed to recover in Europe, helped by heavy intervention from the Bank of Japan. After hitting another historic high of Y109.90 to the dollar in Tokyo, the yen closed weaker in Europe at Y111.05. In New York it finally stood at Y110.62.</p>

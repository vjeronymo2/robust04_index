			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Stability of interest rate the real need Sir, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was not particularly wise in reminding us that interest rates are now at their lowest level for 15 years  - viz, 1978 ('UK base rates cut to 15-year low', January 27). There are all too many of us who will vividly recall that on November 23 1979 the minimum lending rate, as it was then called, was jacked up to 17.5 per cent (I was driving at the time of the announcement and nearly hit a tree), and from 7.5 per cent in May 1987 to 15 per cent in September 1989. How can the chancellor possibly fail to understand that a reduction to 6 per cent will be of little stimulus to consumption and investment when there is this record behind him? Above all, companies and individuals need to be confident of long-term stability in lending rates before they go out into the market place and commit themselves to expenditure or borrowing on any significant scale.

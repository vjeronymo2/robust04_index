			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Republic advances to Dollars 68.7m REPUBLIC New York, the commercial and savings bank group that is 29 per cent controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, the Geneva-based financier, yesterday said its first-quarter 1993 net income rose by 13.8 per cent to Dollars 68.7m, or Dollars 1.15 a share. The New York bank also said it had signed an agreement to acquire SafraCorp California, a private banking business that was wholly-owned by Mr Safra. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but SafraCorp has three offices in the Los Angeles area and assets of Dollars 83.8m. Mr Walter Weiner, chairman of Republic New York, said the deal represented an opportunity to expand in the California private banking market. Republic's net interest income in the first quarter of 1993 was Dollars 191.5m, up by 13 per cent year-on-year. Bad debt provisions in the quarter were Dollars 25m, compared with Dollars 20m a year ago. Income from trading activities was Dollars 39.2m, compared with Dollars 28.9m a year ago. Interest income from taxable investment securities rose to Dollars 216.7m from Dollars 188.3m. Fleet Financial, the Rhode Island-based banking group, yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 106.3m, or 66 cents a share, more than twice the level a year ago. Mr Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman, said that this was the first quarter since the end of 1989 when all operating subsidiaries had been profitable. The profit performance was driven by a strong net interest margin, lower problem assets and cost savings resulting from the integration of the former Bank of New England network into Fleet's operations. Net interest income was Dollars 513m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 472m a year ago. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 85m, down from Dollars 111m in the first quarter of 1992. Non-interest income was Dollars 324m, up from Dollars 278m a year ago.</p>

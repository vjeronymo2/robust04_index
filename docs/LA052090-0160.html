			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ARNOLD LEADS MORNINGSIDE TO CIF TITLE;  </P> <P> PREP TRACK: SOPHOMORE SPRINTER WINS 100-METER DASH IN MEET SHE MISSED LAST YEAR  BECAUSE OF INJURY.  </P> <P> Sophomore sprinter Santeshia Arnold led the Morningside High girls' track team  to the CIF 2-A Division title at the Southern Section championship meet Friday  at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Arnold won the 100-meter dash, finished second in the 200 meters, anchored the  Lady Monarchs' runner-up 400-meter relay team and ran on their victorious  1,600-meter relay team.  </P> <P> Although results won't be official until Tuesday, pending the finish of the  triple-jump competition, Morningside clinched the championship Friday by  outscoring co-favorite Irvine Woodbridge, 83-46.  </P> <P> Arnold said Morningside didn't lose confidence despite being upset by St.  Bernard in the 400-meter relay.  </P> <P> "We had some problems with the (baton) exchange between the second and third  legs and we still were right there," she said.  </P> <P> Arnold, who won the 100 and 200 meters at the Bay League championships last  spring, missed the 1989 Southern Section finals because of a stress fracture in  her foot, apparently caused by running on her toes too much.  </P> <P> This season Arnold learned a new running style and said it was easy to get  motivated for Friday's meet.  </P> <P> "You think, 'I've got to get first so I can get the 10 points for the team,' "  she said. "And (as an individual) you want to go to the state meet."  </P> <P> The only other South Bay girl to win an individual event Friday was  Morningside's Lisa Leslie, who won the high jump at 5 feet, 5 inches and was  second in the long jump at 17-6 3/4.  </P> <P> St. Bernard's Lisa Moxley anchored the winning 400-meter relay team and  finished fourth in the 100 meters and fourth in the 300-meter low hurdles. She  was responsible for eight of St. Bernard's 24 points.  </P> <P> Moxley said the relay victory was a career highlight. "It meant something extra  to us to beat Morningside," she said.  </P> <P> Morningside's boys had their second consecutive strong outing in the  1,600-meter relay, taking second with a time of 3:23.53 after a season-best  3:21.74 last week.  </P> <P> Sophomore Travion Harris, who is also recovering from a stress fracture, ran  the anchor leg. "Although we have a few injuries, everybody did their best and  performed," he said.  </P> <P> Morningside finished second in the 400-meter relay with a time of 43:10.3.  </P> <P> South Torrance hurdler Steve Smith finished second in the 110-meter high  hurdles at 14.87 and fifth in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles at 40.23.  </P> <P> In the girls' 4-A Division, Torrance's Jennifer Tully took second in the long  jump at 17-7 3/4, and Hawthorne was second to Pasadena Muir in the 4-A  400-meter relay at 47.69.  </P></p>

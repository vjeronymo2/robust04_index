			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: ALMONDS COME IN VARIETY OF FORMS  </P> <P> Question: I would like you to address the subject of almonds -- beginning to  end.  </P> <P> Answer: The beginning poses a challenge since no one knows exactly where  almonds originated or who first cultivated them for use as food. According to  information from the Almond Board of California, however, records do show that  the nuts were growing in Greece 300 years before the time of Christ.  </P> <P> The Romans introduced almonds to Egypt and some Western European countries; the  Moors planted almond trees in Portugal and Spain. New World explorers  transported almonds to Mexico, and from there Franciscan Padres brought them to  California.  </P> <P> Today California is the only area in North America where almonds are grown  commercially. The five major varieties cultivated in a 400-mile stretch from  Red Bluff to Bakersfield account for more than half of the world's supply.  </P> <P> One ounce (20 to 25 nuts) of whole shelled almonds contains 170 calories, six  grams protein, five grams carbohydrates, 14 grams fat and four milligrams  sodium. The following percentage of USRDA for minerals is also present: 15%  phosphorus; 15% copper; 20% magnesium; 8% iron; 8% calcium.  </P> <P> Almonds are sold in a variety of forms:  </P> <P> Whole natural almonds -- shells removed, brown skins still present.  </P> <P> Whole blanched almonds -- shells and skins removed.  </P> <P> Sliced natural almonds -- thinly sliced lengthwise; contain thin band of brown  skin.  </P> <P> Sliced blanced almonds -- blanched and skins removed; thinly sliced lengthwise.  </P> <P> Blanched slivered almonds -- blanched and skins removed; halved, then cut  lengthwise in pieces about the thickness of a match stick.  </P> <P> Roasted blanched slivered almonds -- blanched and skins removed; slivered and  roasted to golden brown.  </P> <P> Chopped natural almonds -- brown-skinned almonds that have been coarsely  chopped.  </P> <P> Diced roasted salted almonds -- finely diced, salted and roasted.  </P> <P> TO BLANCH WHOLE NATURAL ALMONDS:  </P> <P> Cover with boiling water. Let stand three minutes, then test to see if skins  slip off easily. Remove almonds from water one at a time, slip off skins and  let dry on paper towel several hours.  </P> <P> TO TOAST ALMONDS:  </P> <P> Conventional Oven: Spread almonds in a single layer in a shallow pan. Place in  a cold oven and toast at 350 degrees 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. Cool.  </P> <P> Microwave Oven: Spread almonds in a single layer in a shallow glass baking  dish. Microwave on HIGH (100% power) four to five minutes, stirring halfway  through. Cool.  </P> <P> Skillet: Spread almonds in a single layer in large skillet over medium heat.  Cook about 12 to 14 minutes, stirring constantly.  </P> <P> TO CHOP ALMONDS:  </P> <P> Food Processor or Blender: Place in food processor or blender and process  continuously until chopped.  </P> <P> Knife: Warm almonds slightly before chopping to reduce shattering.  </P> <P> TO GRIND ALMONDS:  </P> <P> Food Processor or Blender: Place in food processor or blender and process  continuously until ground.  </P> <P> One cup sliced almonds equals 3 1/4 ounces  </P> <P> One cup slivered almonds equals 4 1/2 ounces  </P> <P> One cup whole almonds (shelled) equals five ounces and will yield approximately  1 1/4 cups when ground in a blender or food processor.  </P> <P> Almonds stored in tightly sealed containers in a cool dry place, such as the  refrigerator, will stay fresh for months. They may be frozen for even longer  periods.  </P></p>

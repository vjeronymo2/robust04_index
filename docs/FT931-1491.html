			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Placing gives QSP Pounds 25m tag Quality Software Products, an accounting software company whose clients include the Bank of England, Commercial Union and WH Smith, comes to the market today by way of a placing which is expected to value the company at about Pounds 25m. QSP's principal product, Olas, is designed to run on mainframe computers and is a direct competitor for leading US software houses like Computer Associates and Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software and SAP, the German house. Formed in 1981, QSP sold its first Olas program the next year. A sales ledger module, it was designed to run on IBM mainframes, the de facto standard for large company accounting in the 1980s. The company has just spent some Pounds 11.8m of its own money over five years to develop a new version of the software - Universal Olas - which will run on a variety of computer hardware systems and operating environments. The need to invest heavily in research and development has inevitably affected recent results. The company turned over Pounds 7.5m in 1990, Pounds 11.1m in 1991 and Pounds 13.1m last year, but pre-tax profits were Pounds 1m, Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 1.2m respectively in the three years.</p>

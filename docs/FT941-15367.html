			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Banks expect rise in rate of job cuts Banks expect to shed jobs at an increasing rate in the first quarter of the year, says a quarterly survey carried out by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm. The survey's release follows announcements of 7,200 extra redundancies this week by Barclays and National Westminster Bank. It found that job reductions in financial services as a whole were expected to be slower than in the final quarter of last year. Income from fees, commissions and trading rose in the fourth quarter of last year at the fastest rate recorded since the survey started in 1989. The survey found activity in financial services had risen markedly in the past three months, with profitability increasing in all sectors. The volume of business was expected to rise more strongly in this quarter. Confidence among financial services companies rose for the fifth successive quarter but securities traders were less optimistic than in September. Mr Angus Hislop, a Coopers partner, said financial services companies were keen to cut costs and staff, even with an upturn in business.</p>

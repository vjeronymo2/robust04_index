			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.G.: "Law on Invalidity of Certain Types of </F> Security Agreements and Loan Agreements in Effect: Managerial  Loans for Those Without `Beautiful Eyes'"]    [Text] Under the adopted law, the beneficiary of a  "beautiful eyes" type of loan is obligated to settle the unpaid  value of the loan with the bank all at once.    The Croatian Fund for Privatization expects that the Law on  the Invalidity of Certain Types of Security Agreements and Loan  Agreements, which went into effect about a month ago, will  change the disposition structure of stock shares and their  owners that is already in place.    In simplified terms, this concerns legal regulation of what  are known as (arbitrary, irregular) managerial loans, so that in  response to Croatian public agitation the government has reacted  with legal propositions to prevent the purchase of enterprises  on credit, which is generally approved, insiders say, because of  "beautiful eyes."    The law expressly states that subscribed stock shares cannot  serve as security to cover claims from loan agreements for the  purchase of enterprises. Thus, loan agreements between banks and  a physical person (primarily managers have come forward) based  on redeemed old foreign exchange savings or on security through  subscribed stock are invalidated. Also invalidated are  agreements entered into with participation less than 10 percent  of the loan value, those entered into for a term longer than  seven years or with an interest rate lower than 5 percent, and  loans agreed to without a foreign exchange clause or if their  "grace period" is longer than 12 months, but also those agreed  to without security from a mortgage on real property where the  appraised value is at least 70 percent of the loan amount.    The beneficiary of a "beautiful eyes" type of loan is  obligated to settle the unpaid value of the loan with the bank  all at once. But if the unpaid portion has not been returned to  the bank by the day on which the agreement is deemed invalid,  the agreement concluded between the loan beneficiary and the  Croatian Fund for Privatization is also invalidated, in which  case the Fund becomes the owner of the stock purchased with that  loan.    This is the part of the legislation that signifies for the  Croatian Fund for Privatization a change in the ownership  structure, because initial assessments indicate that approved  managerial loans in the past period of time have not undergone  additional treatment that would result in their conformance to  the provisions of the law. At least as far as the Split office  of the Croatian Fund for Privatization is concerned, this will  mean a change in the ownership structure of, for example, the  Primosten hotels, or even "Univerzal" or "Kamen" in Split.  Indeed, information on conforming such loans to the norms  imposed by the law has not arrived from "Split Bank."    As Josko Ivacic, the director of the Split office, pointed  out, all the names of people holding managerial loans without  backing will be made public, and that will happen very soon  because it will be necessary to transfer stock purchased with  managerial loans to the Fund's portfolio. In addition, Ivacic  says that it will be interesting to determine the names of the  untried owners, which Ivacic says are primarily people without  party affiliations, which will refute talk of how only one party  is involved in these dealings.    Also bearing the "brunt" of this law's articles are all  agreements concluded since 1 May 1991, naturally if they  conflict with the provisions of this law. The Public  Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Croatia will bring  charges to establish the invalidity of agreements.</p>

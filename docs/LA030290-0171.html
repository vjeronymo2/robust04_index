			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ARTS GROUPS PETITION NATIONAL FUND  </P> <P> Several Orange County arts organizations have begun preliminary negotiations  with the National Arts Stabilization Fund, a private, New York-based  organization that has given millions of dollars to arts institutions around the  country.  </P> <P> Officials at the Stabilization Fund, which awards grants to groups of arts  organizations in distinct communities, look at prospective recipients and their  communities to determine their ability to match grants (of up to $1 million per  arts organization) on a 2-to-1 basis.  </P> <P> The fund's current "local stabilization projects" aid arts groups in Phoenix,  Seattle, Boston and Kansas City, Mo. "We are discussing possible projects with  several other communities, with Orange County no more on the top of the list  than a number of others," said Marcia Thompson, president of the nonprofit  organization, which was established in 1983 with $9 million from the Ford,  Andrew W. Mellon and Rockefeller foundations.  </P> <P> "We haven't even established . . . whether the community has the capability to  put up the (matching) funds," Thompson said.  </P> <P> Henry T. Segerstrom, chairman of the Orange County Performing Arts Center,  started negotiations with the fund to find additional sources of support for  the county's arts organizations, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Late last year, Segerstrom and Kendrick requested financial data from the  Orange County Philharmonic Society, South Coast Repertory, the Pacific Symphony  and Opera Pacific. Together with the Center itself, those groups raised a total  of $122 million over the past decade, according to Kendrick.  </P> <P> Segerstrom and Kendrick then met with officials from the groups (and the  Newport Harbor Art Museum) in January and are now supplying more information to  the Stabilization Fund, Kendrick said. It can take between one and five years  to determine eligibility for funding, Thompson said.  </P> <P> While the Center could receive money from the fund, the grants would  principally benefit arts groups "less (financially) stable than we are,"  Kendrick said, specifically citing Opera Pacific and the Pacific Symphony,  which reportedly has an accumulated deficit of at least $350,000.  </P> <P> The Stabilization Fund, designed in large part to increase organizations'  working capital, allows no more than half of any single grant to be used to  reduce a current (not accumulated) deficit, Thompson said. The rest is intended  to increase cash reserves. None of the grant may be used for annual operations.  </P> <P> Louis G. Spisto, Pacific Symphony executive director, said: "Our five-year  financial plan calls for us eliminating our deficit by 1994 without the  assistance of this fund. With the fund, we'd be able to retire the deficit and  then build a cash reserve of what would probably be in excess of $1 million by  that year."  </P> <P> Shoring up the fiscal strength of local groups that use the Center could  provide indirect benefits to the Center as well. Officials there say they plan  to build an additional concert hall and a smaller theater, both reliant on the  financial stability of local groups that would use them and possibly help pay  for construction.  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Seagram goes hard on soft drinks SEAGRAM, one of the world's biggest producers of hard liquor, has embarked on an ambitious and aggressive drive to become a global player in the orange juice business. The Canadian company - best known for its Glenlivet, Chivas Regal and Martell labels - got into fruit juice in a big way in 1988 with the Dollars 1.2bn acquisition of Tropicana, a leading US producer of orange juice. The deal marked Seagram's first large foray into non-alcoholic drinks. 'It was seen as a longer-term strategic investment, broadening Seagram's base in the beverage business,' says Mr Myron Roeder, president of Tropicana International. Fruit juices and juice-based drinks comprise the second largest grocery category in the US, with retail sales growing by close on 50 per cent over the past 10 years to Dollars 11.3bn last year. Orange juice is worth in excess of Dollars 3bn a year. Ten years ago, ready-to-serve juice accounted for 30 per cent of sales: the rest came from frozen concentrate. Today, ready-to-serve juice has a 56 per cent share of the US market, and Tropicana is the ready-to-serve brand leader. At the time of its takeover, Tropicana had annual sales of Dollars 700m, mainly in the eastern half of the US. By the end of 1990 the brand was being distributed nationally with sales running at about Dollars 1.2bn a year. Tropicana leads the overall orange juice market in the US with an estimated volume share last year of 22 per cent. It claims to buy a quarter of Florida's orange crop. But the brand has been extended successfully across other fruit drinks, notably a combination of orange with cranberry and mango. Latterly, Tropicana has been pushing hard into international markets with aggressive sales drives into Japan and Canada. Tropicana has entered the Dollars 1.9bn UK market and ventured into France, but a pan-European framework has been established in anticipation of the single European market next year. A headquarters team has been set up in Paris. In France, Tropicana acquired Maxime Delrue, a company which has handled its bottled juice exports for 25 years, and has signed a distribution agreement with Cedilac, a leading dairy company. Tropicana has high hopes for Europe: the market is generally fragmented and unbranded, and annual consumption per head is barely half the 40 litres of the US. Mr Roeder sees no reason why similar growth should not be secured. 'In every country we enter, our first aim is to be the leading advertiser in the category.' That makes Tropicana's expansion an expensive business and this is fully reflected in operating profits. In spite of strong sales, profits have been flat for the past three years. After restructuring charges of Dollars 24m last year, Seagram's income from the total juices, mixers and coolers operations amounted to Dollars 79m against Dollars 895m from spirits and wines.</p>

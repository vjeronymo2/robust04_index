			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Former Paladin directors rapped THE Hong Kong Committee on Takeovers and Mergers yesterday publicly censured four former directors of Paladin, a listed property company, for failing to disclose to shareholders sensitive financial information concerning bid target New Zealand Equities (NZE). NZE was acquired by Paladin in 1989 and went into receivership seven months later. Paladin advisers Schroders Asia and Richards Butler were not censured, but the report was highly critical of their actions. Schroders is facing a HKDollars 101m (USDollars 13.06m) lawsuit from Paladin, claiming damages for its role as financial adviser to its former directors. Those censured yesterday were Mr Anthony Van der Linden, Mr Peter Francis, Mr Avon Carpenter and Mr Peter Fredricson. Messrs Francis and Van der Linden have already been censured by the committee for acting in concert to consolidate control of Paladin; they have also been banned from taking directorships in Hong Kong listed companies. Schroders was also accused of breaching the code, while the report said Richards Butler was not 'blameless' in a further breach. Schroders said the committee's comments on its role were 'entirely unjustified'.</p>

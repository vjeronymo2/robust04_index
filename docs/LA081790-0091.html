			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURF CHIC;  </P> <P> FOR FICKLE OP PRO CROWD, FASHION BECOMES ECLECTIC  </P> <P> Epic waves, surfing's elite and cash prizes totaling a hefty $90,000 were  almost overshadowed at Huntington Beach by a massive crowd making an eclectic  fashion statement during this summer's biggest surfing competition and beach  bash, the OP Pro.  </P> <P> Bandannas, baseball caps worn backward and lifeguard hats -- big-brim straws  with fringed edges -- turned out to be the summer's newest trends in men's  headgear.  </P> <P> Rubber sandals that resemble leather huaraches, especially when worn with white  athletic socks, also made a strong fashion impact at the four-day event, held  during the last week of July. Puka shell necklaces were other leading looks.  </P> <P> But all told, the fickle crowd had a tough time defining what exactly was hot  and what was not. Case in point: Dozens of young women wore Rio-inspired,  thong-style, almost-bare-backed swimsuits, unofficially referred to as the  dental floss model. "The tan lines are the greatest," said 21-year-old Mariann  Martin of Anaheim, pointing to her barely there black thong suit. A group of  women a few feet away frowned and declared the suit distasteful.  </P> <P> For the hard-core beach crowd, neon was the worst fashion faux pas. Craig Owens  of Torrance, 16, in his all-black wet suit, said, "Forget flashy colors, I let  my surfing do the talking."  </P> <P> For men, long, silky blond hair and dreadlocks were the most fashionable 'dos.  Derrick Taylor of Orange, 22, was the epitome of cool, wearing dreads, Lycra  cycling pants over volley shorts, cyclists shoes and a tiny diamond earring.  </P> <P> Pro snow-boarder Lee Johnson, 19, of Newport Beach, wore diamond-studded,  cat's-eye sunglasses, a wild Bali-print headband he'd borrowed from his  girlfriend, and baggy trunks. "Style? I didn't know I had one," he said.  </P></p>

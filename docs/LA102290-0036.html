Police searched the store for copies of "As  Nasty as They Wanna Be" and ordered all customers to leave. Police also ordered  the removal of all posters and advertising material for the album. Earlier this  year, Canadian record store chains pulled copies of the record off the shelves  after police threatened to press obscenity charges. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

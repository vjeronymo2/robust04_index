			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hitachi, Texas Instruments in R&amp;D venture HITACHI, the Japanese electronics and electrical manufacturer, and Texas Instruments, the US high-technology group, are joining forces in the research and development of next-generation advanced computer memory chips, the companies said yesterday. Hitachi and Texas Instruments will pool their finances and human resources to begin basic research into the development of 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (dRAM) chips, which would store 16 times the amount of information that can be stored in currently available 16-Megabit dRAMs. In a similar move, NEC of Japan and AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, are moving closer to agreeing to join forces on the development of the 256-Megabit dRAM. NEC said yesterday that it was likely to agree with AT&amp;T to develop jointly 0.25 micron processing technology which is essential for the mass production of 256-Megabit chips. AT&amp;T does not manufacture dRAMs but has conducted advanced research in processing technology.</p>

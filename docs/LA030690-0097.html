			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG 3 CAR SALES PLUMMET 10.8% IN LATE FEBRUARY  </P> <P> Late-February domestic sales of cars and light trucks by the Big Three auto  makers tumbled 10.8% this year compared to the same period last year, when  expiring incentives attracted buyers to showrooms, the companies said Monday.  </P> <P> New incentives are in effect this year, but they did not generate the  excitement during late February that was evident in sales figures a year ago.  </P> <P> General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they sold cars and  trucks at an average daily rate of 37,143 units during the Feb. 21-28 period  this year compared to a daily average of 41,624 during the same time last year.  </P> <P> Big Three car sales were down 11.9%, and truck sales declined 8.9%.  </P> <P> Vehicle sales during the first two months of this year were running 1.9% behind  last year's pace, with a 3.5% rise in truck sales being offset by a 5.2%  decline in car sales.  </P> <P> With the notable exception of incentives on Chrysler's popular minivans, which  were in effect only in January, cash rebates and low-interest financing haven't  sparked buying like they did in the first two months of 1989.  </P> <P> Auto makers are waiting to see if purchasing rates pick up in March and April  as they usually do. Springtime normally is a good sales period for the auto  makers as winter weather begins to break and Americans hit the road.  </P> <P> Last year, the incentive in January and February drained demand from the spring  buying period.  </P> <P> Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said the company's 19.1% decline in late-February  car and truck sales stemmed from strong fleet sales a year ago, compared to a  normal period this year. Car sales by the nation's No. 2 auto maker fell 24.5%  during the period and truck sales were off 10.8%.  </P> <P> For the first two months of the year, Ford's cars and trucks were selling at a  pace 6.6% behind last year's rate, with car sales down 8.7% and truck sales  falling by 3.6%.  </P> <P> Chrysler said its late-February car sales fell 11.6% and truck sales were off  21.3%, compared to a year ago, combining for a 16% decline in vehicle sales.  For the year, Chrysler's car and truck sales, which got a big boost from the  minivan incentives in January, were up 2%.  </P> <P> GM's car and truck sales for late February ran 2.4% behind last year's pace,  with car sales off 3.8% and truck sales up 0.9%. For the entire year, GM  vehicles sold at a pace 0.2% ahead of last year.  </P> <P> VEHICLE SALES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.77IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Feb. 21-28 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GM*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 134,165  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> - 2.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 81,423  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -19.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chrysler*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44,416  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -16.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Honda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16,096  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +38.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,014  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +125.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> NissanU.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8,726  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -27.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Toyota U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10,833  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +47.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mazda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,104  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +39.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 298,817  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -7.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Includes light truck sales.  </P> <P> There were 7 selling days in the selling period this year and last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: GE Capital buys car leasing group GE Capital, the US financial services group, has expanded its international fleet management business by acquiring Triathalon Leasing, Canada's biggest vehicle leasing company. GE will pay CDollars 225m (USDollars 170m) for Triathalon, which is owned by Trilon, a holding company controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family. The Triathalon sale is the latest in a string of divestitures over the past year by the hard-pressed Bronfman empire. Trilon said it would use the proceeds to repay debt, and expected to post a small gain on the deal. Triathalon has 47,000 vehicles under lease or management to 1,600 corporate customers. GE Capital, wholly-owned by General Electric, has a large presence in Canada, with about 27,000 vehicles on its books. The combined fleets will make up about 12 per cent of GE's worldwide business. GE named Mr Rolf Rueqq as president of its enlarged Canadian operation. Mr Rueqq is general manager of Avis Fleet Services, GE's European vehicle-services arm. CT Financial Services, which own Canada's biggest trust company, posted a 66 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net profits to CDollars 45m or 32 cents a share, but profit for all of 1993 was down 14 per cent to CDollars 166m or CDollars 1.22, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The fourth-quarter upturn was due to lower loss provisions and strong mutual funds sales. CT is controlled by Imasco, the tobacco, fast food and retailing giant, which is in turn 40 per cent held by Britain's BAT Industries. Canada Trust, with CDollars 38bn of assets, is one of two surviving independent trust companies and is not for sale, Imasco says. It increased market share 1 per cent last year and the company said its performance in 1994 will depend on recovery in Canada and the US, where the company controls a large savings and loan unit.</p>

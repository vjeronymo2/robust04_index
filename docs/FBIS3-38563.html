The seven were all  employed by Sisde, the domestic intelligence agency, including  former Sisde director Riccardo Malpica, his secretary Matilde  Martucci, and Sisde's former comptroller Maurizio Broccoletti.    The missing money was tracked down through bank accounts in  San Marino whence much of it was said to have been whisked away  to South America. Preventive detention warrants were issued in  the case from June last year.    The suspects were released, but further enquiries turned up  new facts and new warrants were issued. Judicial sources said  Malpica's had changed as a result of recent testimony.  Initially, he was believed not have touched any of the money  himself, but he is now said to be one of the team of embezzlers.    The new evidence was said to have come in particular from  Broccoletti, who was taken into custody on June 25 and whose  testimony claimed that Interior Ministers over 10 years,  including President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, were in on secret  service scams.    Preliminary Investigations Magistrate Vincenzo Terranova is  now being asked to file formal indictments for association to  commit embezzlement and reuse the money through banking and real  estate investments.</p>

After negotiations between the carriers and the government  delegations failed, the climate of "peaceful actions"  deteriorated into a riot atmosphere without police intervening  to restore order.    Gustavo Aguiluz, spokesman for the powerful National  Transportation Commission, reported that a dozen taxi drivers  were detained by the Managua police and that one of them was  even beaten in the confusing situation.    Parrales Vallejos Cooperative buses blocked the Portozuelo  freeway in Managua's northeastern area. On several streets,  bonfires blocked traffic and bottlenecked buses and taxis.    Tonight, the strikers closed off city exits to Leon and  Chinandega and partially closed off the routes to the country's  east.    It has been reported from Esteli that bottlenecks impeded  free traffic toward the Honduran border. The strike worsened  when the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers and the  National Transportation Commission decided to keep pressing  their demands as long as the goverment fails to negotiate a  reduction of prices on oil byproducts and other socioeconomic  benefits.    The government has not yet clearly stated its position  regarding the carriers' demands. Meanwhile, the strike is  spreading and people who use public transportation vehicles must  walk to get to work.</p>

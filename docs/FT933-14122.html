			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German rates ease THE Bundesbank kept the markets guessing yesterday by combining a limited cut in its repo rate with a generous injection of funds in this week's tender, writes Stephanie Flanders. The slight easing of monetary conditions brought German call money rates down a fraction. Pressure on the French franc persisted, however, since few now expect a more substantial loosening of policy at today's Bundesbank council meeting. In all, the German central bank injected an extra DM9.5bn of funds into the domestic money markets. Traders had been ready to interpret any net addition of more than DM7bn as a supportive gesture towards the French authorities. However, most of the funds were allocated at 7.28 per cent, only 2 basis points lower than last week's fixed repo rate of 7.30 per cent. 'The Bundesbank really only did all that it had to,' commented one London-based trader. 'No repo rate reduction would have been tantamount to hanging the franc out to dry.' In holiday trading by Paris commercial banks, French one-month money market rates rose 20 basis points to 8.40 per cent, although three-month rates were steady at 7.50 per cent. In London, a large Pounds 2.55bn shortage which had been widely anticipated proved easy to despatch. The Bank of England offered more than Pounds 2.1bn in the first round, of which the majority was offered for repurchase. Although this took some of the pressure off short rates, overnight rates went as high as 6 3/4 per cent before falling to a low of 5 3/4 . Elsewhere in sterling money markets, the news that British retail price inflation for June had been the lowest for nearly 30 years helped to balance the inflationary concern produced by yesterday's strong output data. Three-month sterling money market rates stayed steady at 6 per cent. Trading in sterling futures reflected the view that the combination of the output and inflation figures left the British government in a position to cut interest rates at its leisure. 'It is still almost 99.9 per cent certain that interest rates will fall before the end of the year,' said a London analyst. 'But there is considerably more upside potential for a cut before December than before September, because the politicians are in a position to play it long.' The September and December sterling contracts rose nearly 10 basis points in the morning, before finishing a net 5 basis points up at around 94.21 and 94.44 respectively.</p>

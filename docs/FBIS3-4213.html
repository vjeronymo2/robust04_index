			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Report on Current Events" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF]  continued their talks on the afternoon of 27 February. The  working-level talks continued to center on the three issues  originally planned for discussion. The ARATS presented a number  of new proposals based on its study of the SEF's views.  However, the two sides were not able to narrow their  differences and reach an agreement.    After the talks, ARATS Deputy Secretary General Sun Yafu  told  reporters:    [Begin recording] Personnel of the two sides held general  discussions this afternoon touching on the three issues  discussed in the last couple of days. The first issue concerns  the repatriation of personnel who entered the areas of the other  side in violation of the relevant regulations. On this issue,  each side essentially discussed matters that need to be  considered by the other side.    The second issue concerns the repatriation of hijackers  across the Taiwan Strait. [passage omitted]    The third issue concerns settling fishing disputes. [passage  omitted] [end recording]    Sun Yafu gave his views on the talks held during the last  several days. He said he believed that although the two sides  encountered difficulties, the ARATS is willing to continue the  talks. He said:    [Begin recording] These working-level talks were based on  the  common understanding reached between the persons in charge of  the ARATS and SEF during their previous talks in Beijing. They  pledged to honor the understanding and hoped that agreement  could be reached as soon as possible. It should be pointed out  that the two sides did not reach a common understanding on all  issues. They clearly reached a common understanding on certain  issues while approaching agreement on others. It is our hope  that the two sides will conduct the current working-level talks  based on the Beijing talks. During the talks, both the SEF and  ARATS may also talk about additional issues raised by the other  side. This is a question of following the rules on contacts and  talks between the two sides. To make the talks successful, we  are willing to continue the talks. [end recording]    It was learned that the ARATS and SEF will decide through  discussions on the evening of 27 March whether or not to  continue the talks. SEF Deputy Secretary General Xu Huiyou [Hsu  Hui-yu] said that SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Chiping [Shih  Chi-ping] was not able to arrive in Beijing on schedule and that  the date of his arrival would be decided by Taipei.</p>

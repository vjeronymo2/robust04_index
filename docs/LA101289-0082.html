			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> ARSONISTS STRIKE MEDICAL BUILDING FOR 4TH TIME  </P> <P> A three-alarm blaze Tuesday night -- the fourth since August in the same  Hawaiian Gardens medical building -- was the work of an arsonist, say  investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> There are no suspects and it is not known if the arsonist broke into the  building, said Deputy Rafael Estrada, a department spokesman. Damage to the  structure was estimated at $500,000, he said. Estrada would not say what led  investigators to determine that the fire was deliberately set.  </P> <P> About 70 Los Angeles County firefighters battled the flames that broke out on  the second floor of the medical office building at 21530 S. Pioneer Blvd. on  the grounds of Charter Community Hospital. The south wing of the building  houses a clinic run by Family Health Plan, the health corporation that manages  the hospital.  </P> <P> The fire started, as it did three times before, in the largely vacant north end  of the building, where a handful of private doctors rent office space. During  the blaze, which was reported about 11:45 p.m., the roof of the structure  reportedly collapsed and firefighters had to be pulled back for a time. No  injuries were reported.  </P></p>

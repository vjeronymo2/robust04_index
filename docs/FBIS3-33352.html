A Colombian Foreign Ministry press communique stated Mrs.  Casas, "prior to her marriage, worked for the Foreign Ministry  in the post of civilian attache 1 EX in the Colombian Embassy in  Mexico."    It was reported in Washington today Casas worked as a "paid  CIA agent in Mexico, where she worked as a cultural attache in a  foreign embassy." The U.S. Justice Department announced on 21  February the arrest of Casas and her husband, Aldrick Ames, a  high-ranking CIA official, for allegedly spying for the  dissolved Soviet Union and Russia. It is said they were "double  agents," because they also "sold information" to the Russian KGB  since 1985 for $1.5 million.    The Foreign Ministry added in the communique issued in Santa  Fe de Bogota that "the Colombian Government is waiting for  official confirmation about Mrs. Casas' alleged links to the  U.S. CIA during the time when she worked as an official of the  Colombian Embassy in Mexico."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Rinayeva, with military-political analysis </F> by Arkadiy Moshes and Dmitriy Danilov: "The Last Thrust to the  South Might Really Be the Last for Russia--If Zhirinovskiy  Becomes President"]    [Text] The legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin is  very frightening. He was offended and in order to get revenge he  lured all of the children out of the city by playing his pipe.  Nobody ever heard from them again. I think the rat catcher  simply killed them. He led them into a swamp. They, the poor  things, saw that there was a quagmire underfoot and they were  squelching through it but still they walked--listening to the  pipe....    Oh if only they had believed their own wet socks rather  than the sweet grace notes!    Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is a brilliant rat  catcher of our time. His pipe is big and loud. When hearing it a  person does not want to look under his feet. Force  yourself--look. Through Vladimir Volfovich's book, "The Last  Thrust To the South."  <H5>  How To Save the Russian Nation </H5>   "There absolutely must be a war with the Turks. They  killed my uncle!" (Schweik).    Foreign policy, as we know, is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's favorite  subject. The theme of foreign policy runs through his book as a  leitmotif.    "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical  concept," writes Vladimir Volfovich. "I do not want to give it a  name like, say, the Zhirinovskiy formula, but the last "Thrust"  to the south, Russia's approach to the shores of the Indian  Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea--these are indeed tasks for the  salvation of the Russian nation...this solves all the problems  at once."    Deciphering the idea of the "Last Thrust": Russia must again  include within its borders not only the former republics of the  Transcaucasus and Tajikistan, but also--the main  thing!--Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey.    Vladimir Volfovich explains: All the great powers have  spheres of influence, which only bolsters their world prestige:  the United States--Latin America, France--North Africa...our  southern neighbors must become this kind of "soft underbelly"  for us.    The advantages, in Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion, are obvious.  In the first place, he asserts, we would eliminate the threat to  Russia from the south: Afghanistan is already sending armed  detachments to Tajikistan and Ankara is already dreaming of a  Turkish state that has swallowed up Azerbaijan, the Northern  Caucasus, and Georgia. Our borders would become peaceful, and  there would be stability in the south. Moreover, a slight  rearrangement of the Near East "would also prevent a third  world war."    Then the Thrust would strengthen the legs of the Russian  army, which were about to give out. "The new armed forces  will be able to recuperate only through combat operations,"  -- notes Zhirinovskiy.    For Vladimir Volfovich the movement southward is as simple  as  can be, natural and pleasant. Instead of "moving Russia  into the tundra where there can only be mineral resources, where  nothing can live and develop,"--forward in striped  swimsuits to the Indian Ocean! After the Turkish textiles!    I can just imagine how on a dank, rainy evening Mr.  Zhirinovskiy bit on his quill pen, shivered from the cold, and  wrote: "How I dream about having Russian soldiers wash  their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean and change  into summer uniforms forever. Light shoes, light trousers,  short-sleeved T-shirts, no ties, and open collars." And  following--"recreation bases, youth camps, sanitoriums,  preventive treatment facilities"... The Russian language  and the Russian ruble would prevail, there would be no column  for "nationality" in passports, and everyone would have human  rights. God, a paradise!    It seems that so far people have gotten into paradise only  after they are dead....  <H5>  How Is the Crow Like an Office Desk? </H5>   "Do not be shy, boys! Right at your heels    Rolls a whole cartload of money,    Clop, clop, clop!    A whole cartload of money, a kitchen with farina,    Well, where is there a regiment happier than ours?"    (Schweik).    Let us take a look at the consistency of Vladimir  Volfovich's  ethical maxims. It reminds us very much of Bolvanshchik's  riddle, to which the author himself did not know the answer:  "How is a crow like an office desk?"    On the one hand, Zhirinovskiy dons the feathers of the dove  of peace and takes the olive branch between his teeth.    "It is impossible to recognize democracy when it is  bathed in blood" V.V. says quite correctly. "It is  necessary to form in people's minds and create institutions of  power so as to preclude obscurantism when a whole region is  covered with blood." It is necessary "To preclude a  situation whereby arms are used to solve all problems." "Do not  kill. Do not steal. Do not deceive. Do not commit violence...all  grandmothers and grandfathers of the world teach their  grandchildren to do good," Vladimir Volfovich  sentimentalizes.    Apparently they did not teach him.    There is an engraving of Durer's. It is shocking. Little Red  Riding Hood and the wolf are lying under the same blanket. She  is innocence itself and he is the essence of loathsomeness. They  are lying there, however, peacefully. In the same bed. Just  think: Is it possible for them to lie there, under the blanket,  in one body?    In any case, Zhirinovskiy has two heads. We listen to the  first one, the innocent one. We are also listening to the second  one--in which the wolf's teeth are chattering. They are  chattering a melody as old as the world: In general one must  not, but I can, and only this one time.    "If we begin to block Afghanistan, Iran, and  Turkey--possibly some of the residents of these countries will  be dissatisfied. But the whole world should understand that  since Russia has to do this, it is all right." Chatter!  "Medicine is not always sweet. Perhaps somebody in Kabul,  Tehran, or Ankara might not like it. But it will make things  better for millions of people." Chatter! We have already  heard these speeches somewhere before: Was it not for the good  of our people that the best of them rotted away in camps? Was it  not for the happiness of the German nation that the chambers of  the furnaces we all know about never stopped burning? How many  times have we weighed and weighed again a child's tear against  the well-being of mankind, and all this is new to Vladimir  Volfovich!    And the farther you go, the purer it is. "Nothing will  happen to the world even if the Turkish nation does die out."  "Some of the population (of the southern regions),  unfortunately, will die because the South does not now have  sufficient medicines or a sufficient level of culture. Therefore  there will be a natural survival, assimilation, and adaptation.  This is a natural process."    One can confidently replace "they will die" with "they will  be destroyed": Perhaps it is impossible to build the path to the  warm seas and oceans with an olive branch. An opponent of  violence, Zhirinovskiy in his voluptuous descriptions of  blue-eyed soldiers in the New South, emphasizes this detail: In  their hands will be "a small modern Russian automatic  produced by the Izhevsk Plant. These automatics are much better  than Uzis. So any platoon of Russian soldiers could impose order  in any space." Vladimir Volfovich sees "Russian  commanders...marking out routes for movements of troop  formations...aircraft...submarines that travel to the shores of  the Indian Ocean, landing craft suitable for the shores to which  soldiers of the Russian army are already marching...."    How is a crow like an office desk? What do nonviolence and  the last Thrust to the south have in common? Answer, you crazy  Bolvanshchik.  <H5>  There Will Be No Paradise </H5>   "Do you like Turks?-    Schweik asked    The tractor operator Palivets.--    Those simple ones? But do you not?"    Let us turn to the facts and figures. Let them tell us: Is a  Last Thrust to the South possible? Is it possible for us to swim  in the Indian Ocean and vacation peacefully in Iranian  sanitoriums?    There is only one answer: Alas, gentlemen, there will be no  swimming paradise. One wise woman said: "The first night with a  man means nothing. If he remains with you after the second--you  have won!"    Zhirinovskiy forgets that if you go in the direction of the  warmer regions you must not only set out for there--you must  also keep them under control.    Yes, Vladimir Volfovich has learned well the main lesson of  history, which is that it does not teach us anything. Why recall  that immediately after the death of Alexander of Macedonia the  empire he had created fell apart. That the Greeks, whose  garrisons were based throughout an immense expanse--from Egypt  to Central Asia--disappeared without a trace in the mass of the  local population. That Napoleon's Egyptian adventure ended  ingloriously. And after two bloody wars in Afghanistan the  English were still unable to add even one diamond to the  imperial throne.    During the golden days of the victorious tsarist army it  took  76 years to subdue the mountain peoples of the Caucasus. The  penetration into Central Asia, which began under Peter I, did  not end until 1884. And before the revolution the Cossacks  resumed the war against the Tsarist troops while Bukhara  remained a vassal of the state almost until the middle of the  twenties....    If today the Algerian Muslims are sowing bloody terror  against nonfundamentalist foreigners, what will be the reaction  of the Muslim world to an invasion by orthodox believers?!  (Zhirinovskiy, incidentally, also hears "the ringing of  the bells of the Russian Orthodox Church on the shore of the  Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.")    No, there will be no paradise. And peace in the captured  territories will be possible in only one way: with barbed wire,  barracks, guard dogs, and mountains of corpses--both from one  side and from the other....    Now about the military actions themselves. Vladimir  Volfovich  allows as how we might be the first to be attacked. But experts  say that at the present time there is no justification for  saying that there is a Turkish (or "pan-Turkish") threat against  Russia. Moreover, the secular nature of the modern Turkish state  and its cautious policy in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia  show an obvious unwillingness on Turkey's part to be drawn into  even a slight resemblance of a military confrontation with  Russia.    So we ourselves will have to attack.    Let us imagine the year 1996. Zhirinovskiy takes the  presidential oath on the new Constitution. And he does  everything he can to unleash war.    It is quite obvious that Russia will begin it in an  exceptionally disadvantageous military-political situation. Our  troops will be opposed by forces of Turkey and Iran, Afghan  formations, and the army of Pakistan (taking into account its  involvement in Afghan events and the fact that Zhirinovskiy is  secretly counting on friendly behavior from India).    Invasion of Turkey, which is a member of NATO, will bring up  the question of the adoption of countermeasures by all the rest  of the states of the bloc and the rendering of military  assistance to the anti-Russian coalition (provided that the  offended parties organize it). Let us even say that the NATO  countries will not move their divisions toward Russia's western  borders. In any case the American, British, and French units now  stationed in Turkey will be reinforced.    Vladimir Volfovich's reliance on an alliance with the Arab  states is not justified. On the contrary, any "bow" to Saddam  Husayn, whom Mr. Zhirinovskiy likes so much (his portrait hangs  in the propaganda room of the staff headquarters of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia) will immediately restore the  anti-Iraqi coalition of the times of the war in the Persian Gulf.    The knot of conflicts that is growing ever tighter in the  Transcaucasus makes it impossible for either Zhirinovskiy or  anybody else to look for strong allies there. Rather, drawing  the peoples of the region into the orbit of large-scale military  actions will bring about a war of everyone against everyone  else, which is much more destructive and irrational than the one  in Afghanistan.    It is clear that Vladimir Volfovich's "Thrust" will make the  southern boundaries of Russia not a peaceful region but a  gigantic cauldron of war in which we will have to fight alone  against practically all the rest of the world.  <H5>  Malbruk Made Ready for a Campaign... </H5>   "During the summer, under the shade of the acacias, it  is pleasant to dream about being posted." (Kozma Prutkov).    Can we hope for victory? Elementary arithmetic gives us the  answer: We cannot.    Here are the military potentials of the sides. Just Turkey,  Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan together have more than 2  million enlisted men and officers, 8,600 basic combat tanks,  7,300 armored vehicles, 12,500 guns and mortars, 1,700 combat  airplanes, and 400 combat helicopters. In their actual trained  reserves they have another 1.7 million people, not counting  Afghanistan, where only babies do not carry weapons.    The military potential of the Arab part of the anti-Iraqi  coalition and Israel amounts to another 900,000 people (with an  equal number in reserve), 10,775 tanks, 16,000 armored vehicles,  about 6,300 guns and mortars, and 2,000 combat airplanes and  helicopters.    We are still not taking into account all the NATO forces and  the armies of other European states, which are not likely to  remain tolerant of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's pranks....    But what about Russia? Russia, according to the calculations  of the authors, realistically has in the North Caucasus Military  District, the Transcaucasian Group of Forces, and the states of  Central Asia...no more than 87,500 people, 1,700 tanks, 3,820  armored vehicles, 2,050 guns and mortars, and up to 500  aircraft--and most of them belong to air defense. Not very many?  And even this equipment is subject to partial reduction--under  the Agreement on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.    No strategist could attack under these conditions, even a  genius. Well, all right, let us say the units are transferred,  the reservists are called up, and all the long-distance aircraft  and forces of the Black Sea and Caspian fleets would make it  possible to increase the figures that were given threefold,  fivefold, or 10-fold. That would still be clearly inadequate.    A fresh example comes to mind. In order to overcome the  resistance of the Iraqi grouping of 183,000 (not 2 or 3  million!), members of the coalition had to concentrate 750,000  people, 4,000 tanks, 3,700 rifles and mine throwers, 2,000  airplanes, and more than 100 ships, including several shock  aircraft carriers, in the region. And what forces would Russia  have to put in motion?    People who are possessed frequently push right on through to  the breaking point. Let us assume that Zhirinovskiy has decided  to call up a million reservists, whose combat readiness is the  subject for a separate discussion, and begins to concentrate  forces.    Where?    --On the operationally narrow section between the Volga and  the Don and along the border with Kazakhstan. After that it will  also be necessary to get over the Caucasian Mountains, the  Steppes, and the desert.    How?    --By the railroad, which cannot even take the flood of  vacationers, by an air bridge, which would not have a sufficient  number of airfields, or...under their own steam?    All right, good. Let us assume that we got there. But is it  possible to attack on several fronts that are thousands of  kilometers long in a theater of war with which the army is not  familiar? How do we bring in ammunition, and reinforcements, how  do we evacuate the wounded? It is easy to bomb railroads, and  temporary airfields--even easier....    What about communications and troop control? In modern  warfare, especially in mountainous regions, their effectiveness  depends largely on satellite systems. The troops of the  anti-Iraqi coalition in 1991 utilized about 60 military  satellites. We have a couple of dozen of them...etc., etc.    Finally, will Vladimir Volfovich, following the  adventuristic  logic of his Thrust, not have to dig into the cherished nuclear  suitcase? To strike a blow to enemy cities, to destroy nuclear  power plants, oil wells, irrigation systems? And receive a  response--with nuclear weapons? Chemical? Bacteriological? And  not only on the Russian army but also on its territory. The  result: the destruction of the army, population, and the Russian  State itself.    Let us imagine the Russian soldier who has reached the  Indian  Ocean. And is washing his boots in it. In warm water. Somewhere  far away is the depopulated Russia with its ruined economy.  Right behind his back is the scorched desert. Under his feet--a  narrow strip of ocean shore. Ahead....  <H5>  The Role of Swimming Trunks in Geopolitics </H5>   "Although we shame the Russian name, we serve only  ourselves." (Kozma Prutkov).    A couple of days ago an argument about Zhirinovskiy broke  out  on the trolley. "He is only concerned about Russia!"--shouted an  old woman. Oh, old woman, is he concerned! He is ready to drown  in blood--that is true. To put some people in jail and others to  shoot. Every device will be used.    It is strange--Vladimir Volfovich increasingly reminds me of  Fat Vaska. We had a person like that in our section of the  apartment building. First everyone beat him, but then he got  hold of a switchblade knife somewhere and, on the contrary, he  began to stick it to the offenders.    And what if Mr. Zhirinovskiy did not invent his absurd plans  for conquering Turkey out of concern for Russia? What if he all  the time has recalled how some Turks once offended him, the poor  thing? Here is what the Istanbul newspaper MILLIYET wrote in  1969: "The Soviet translator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was put  in jail in the city of Iskenderun for communist propaganda. The  local authorities warned him repeatedly that this would not be  allowed. But he, paying no attention to the advice and warnings,  not only distributed badges depicting Lenin and Marx among  Turkish workers and engineers, but even agitated for a communist  way of life." A couple of days later for a significant  dollar bribe V.V. was brought to the USSR embassy in Ankara and  a couple of days later he left Turkey....    One wonders if Zhirinovskiy were caught in the States if he  would declare war on them? And would he press the nuclear  button? In order to get revenge for an insult?    Politics without personal ambitions is not politics. But it  is terrible when a person is bruised in childhood and does not  receive his bread and then begins take revenge against millions.    The first part of "Last Thrust to the South" is  biographical.  Here Vladimir Volvofovich discusses only bruises and meager  bread rations. And his failures at sex. Here, for example, is  what happened on the beach when Zhirinovskiy was 17: "I  was lying there with a girl, she was in a swimming suit, our  relations were normal, friendly. I asked her to take off the  bottom of her swimsuit. But what kind of girl takes off her  swimsuit the very first thing. I did not know that I was  supposed to do that myself, to help her, and I was embarrassed  too. So we lay there until somebody disturbed us."    And later: "If I had been born into a well-off family,  in a Russian city, among Russian people...I would have had  childhood friends nearby, a girlfriend--then, perhaps, I would  not have taken up politics."    Lord, why did she not take off her swimsuit then!</p>

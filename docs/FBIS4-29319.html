			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Grint, an expert of the  International Relations Institute of Britain, said that it is a  big mistake to think "sanctions" can bring North Korea to its  knees, according to Radio Voice of America on June 11.    He said that 30 years have passed since the United States  took a step for a total trade embargo against Cuba, but it has  still failed to overthrow Cuba.    North Korea has undergone more strict trade embargo  sanctions  by the United States for nearly 50 years than Cuba, he said,  adding:    In fact, North Korea is a communist state subjected to  pressure and sanctions of the U.S. and the West for the longest  period. Therefore, North Koreans will never be frightened by any  "sanctions".</p>

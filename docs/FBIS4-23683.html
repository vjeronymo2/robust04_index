			<p>BFN     [Text] The insecure situation in rural Bujumbura has caused  a sizable movement of the population toward the town of  Bujumbura. First, the refugees went to Kamenge zone. Others  went toward the Saint Michel church, the unity monument, and the  residence of the papal representative. According to the [words  indistinct] contacted by telephone, the residence of the papal  representative alone has been housing around 700 displaced  people for the last two days -- around two-thirds are children.  The residence is not prepared for this amount of people and was  obliged to call for help from UNICEF, which has just finished  distributing protein biscuits.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Maher the books crusader signs off MR TERRY MAHER, the consumers' champion who tried to kill off book publishers' 100-year old price maintenance agreement, said yesterday he would quit as chairman and chief executive of Pentos, the UK's second largest bookseller. He will step down before the end of the year from the group which embraces Dillons and Hatchards bookshops, the Ryman stationery and office equipment supplier and Athena posters. His decision, announced yesterday alongside the group's first ever losses, was not unexpected given the recent weak performance and concerns about rapid expansion and aggressive accounting. While some publishers might be relieved that they are losing the chief critic of their Net Book Agreement, shareholders are likely to have mixed feelings. Mr Maher, a working class, Irish-Catholic, Mancunian accountant, has built Pentos into a retailing force. But the Pentos share price has plunged from 170p to just over 40p in the last two years. He will be replaced by a non-executive chairman, yet to be named, and a chief executive who is likely to be a retail specialist appointed from outside. In the meantime, Sir Kit McMahon, former Midland Bank chairman, will take over as deputy chairman. City criticism of Pentos' acquisition strategy and accounting policies flared up last month when Mr Maher conducted a public slanging match with one analyst over a research note entitled 'Pentosaurus'. The analyst had questioned whether Dillons' high cost base was up to the challenge. Nevertheless his departure from the company he founded in 1972 as a Pounds 100 'off the shelf company' will mark the end of an era in book selling. The tough and prickly Mr Maher, 57, who has called the NBA 'an organised conspiracy against the pubic's interest', has made repeated attempts to cut book prices. Defenders of the NBA argue its destruction would kill off small booksellers and reduce readers' choice. An avid reader of authors ranging from Truman Capote to Anthony Burgess, who went to the same Manchester grammar school, Mr Maher yesterday uncharacteristically tried to avoid greater public exposure.

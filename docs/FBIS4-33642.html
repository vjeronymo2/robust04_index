			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  stressed on 6 June that his administration "has demonstrated,  with facts, our respect for and our belief in the freedom of the  press." He noted that the freedom of the press "is incompatible  with any type of totalitarianism."    Menem also asked journalists "to report in a responsible  way." He said the media's credibility "is linked to its  commitment to the truth."    The president made these remarks during a speech he  delivered  in Government House's White Hall while signing the Chapultepec  Declaration, a list of principles for freedom of the press that  was released on 11 March by the Inter-American Press Association  [IAPA] in Chapultepec.    During the signing ceremony, which was attended by  publishers  from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and the United States, IAPA  President Raul Kraiselburd delivered a speech. Kraiselburd  noted: "In the great battles fought in the continent to preserve  the democratic system, the restoration of freedom of the press  represented a goal for very different and competing groups."    Menem stressed that "the freedom of respect and of the  press"  prevailing under his administration "has not been and will not  be changed because we understand there cannot be any democratic  system without freedom of the press."    Menem pointed out: "We heartily support Thomas Jefferson's  remark that `it is preferable to have freedom of the press  without a government than a government without freedom of the  press' and, in this regard, we demonstrated our belief by  accepting, without any type of censorship, the harshest and most  pungent criticism ever received by any president in the  Argentine Republic."    Menem stressed: "The gates to information were always open.  If there was any friction and, sometimes, bumps with the  journalists, it was more because of abundant information than  lack of information."    Menem added that the Chapultepec Declaration "therefore  represents for us a logical result, supported by the goal of  having this freedom of the press now prevailing in Argentina  equally prevail in all American countries and in the entire  world as a basic guarantee for human rights."    Menem stressed: "The freedom of the press is incompatible  with any type of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism cannot  tolerate freedom of the press because it would be tantamount to  tolerating criticism, and history has demonstrated to us that  totalitarianism are more prone to self-criticism, which always  comes late and in a more cushioned way."    Concerning the Chapultepec Declaration, Menem emphasized  that  "no one will be allowed to force a journalist to reveal his or  her sources of information" and that "no one may impair or deny  the right to seek or receive information, that there may not be  any censorship before publication, that there may not be any  forced association, and that the freedom of the press may not be  impaired through tariff policies or paper and advertising  control policies."    Menem pointed out: "Nevertheless, this declaration also  points out that the media's credibility is linked to its  commitment to the truth."    At the end of his message, Menem said: "Some day I will no  longer be president. I will have to resume my private  activities. We basically want democracy to continue prevailing  and liberty to continue increasing, and, within this framework,  we want Argentina to regain the place it was able to occupy in  other periods of its institutional life."</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                  Opposition from officials in Japan's key economic ministries  appears to be slowing the Japanese Government's progress in  drawing up measures to deregulate the Japanese economy and open  Japanese markets. The ruling coalition is searching for ways to  undercut this opposition, but so far appears to have had little  success.  The coalition may ultimately be able to gain some  leverage against the bureaucrats by drawing on support from those  in Japan's business community who see the relaxation of some  regulations as a means to jumpstart the Japanese economy and who  are increasingly critical of the Japanese bureaucracy for  resisting deregulation.                            END SUMMARY     Some elements of the Japanese bureaucracy appear to be trying to  limit the scope of the measures the Japanese Government is  attempting to draw up as part of the detailed market opening  package it has promised to announce by the end of June.     -- According to the 12 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, at a 12 May  meeting of the Working Group on Import Promotion, Market Access  Improvement, and Distribution--one of the subpanels under the  prime minister's Administrative Reform Council charged with  compiling detailed proposals for deregulation--bureau chiefs from  ministries and agencies involved in deregulation efforts gave  briefings in which they stressed that it would be difficult to  relax many of the regulations under review.     -- At another meeting of the same group on 18 May, the directors  general of the Ministries of Finance, International Trade and  Industry, and Transport reportedly attempted to defend many of  the current regulations governing commodity distribution, the  granting of permits, and import procedures.  The 18 May Nihon  Keizai Shimbun said that most of the officials at the meeting  argued that, "under present conditions," they could not abolish  many of these regulations.     -- When the private sector recently submitted a package of 71  deregulation proposals to the Working Group, the ministries and  agencies involved reportedly rejected the vast majority of them  in whole or in part.  According to a report compiled by the  working group, summarized in the 22 May Yomiuri Shimbun, the  government offices indicated that they were prepared to fully  implement only two of the proposals--suggestions for shortening  the time required to obtain a license to engage in the food  business and for relaxing regulations governing foreign  investment in certain telecommunications projects.  The  ministries said they would "consider" 29 of the remaining  proposals--including a suggestion for simplifying the procedures  for obtaining a license to deal in antiques.  They refused to act  on 25 of the proposals because they argued they were "based on  misunderstandings."  On the 15 remaining suggestions, they  asserted that some action had already been taken, making further  steps unnecessary.     -- Some of the private sector proposals that the ministries  reportedly rejected--such as a plan to lift restrictions on the  establishment of holding companies--were also reported to be in  the guidelines the ruling coalition drew up to guide  intragovernmental discussions of deregulation (Nihon Keizai  Shimbun, 4 May), suggesting that the bureaucracy is also  resisting parts of the government guidelines.     The resistance from sections of the bureaucracy appears to be  significantly slowing the government's efforts to draw up  detailed deregulation proposals in some areas.  In an article in  the 23 May Nikkei Weekly, Shojiro Makino, a businessman who  serves on the Working Group on Import Promotion, Market Access  Improvement, and Distribution, described how a Transport Ministry  official held up work at a recent working group meeting by  arguing at length with panel members over the merits of a rather  minor change that would allow individuals to operate trucking  businesses.  Whenever panel members tried to support the change  by citing other areas where individuals were allowed to operate  businesses, the official countered with a host of reasons why the  precedents did not apply.  Iwao Nakatani, a professor at  Hitotsubashi University and member of the working group, wrote in  the 23 May Yomiuri Shimbun that he thought the working group  would not be able to "hammer out fundamental deregulation  measures that can meet expectations both at home and abroad"  because of the "government offices' posture of defending  regulations."     Government Countermeasures     Leaders of the ruling coalition appear to be searching for ways  to circumvent the bureaucracy, pressuring the ministers in charge  of the key economic ministries to play a more active role in  guiding the deliberations on deregulation and overruling  bureaucrats if necessary.  At a 12 May news conference, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reportedly warned that  deregulation could not be left in the hands of bureaucrats, who  would "drag their feet" over the issue, according to the 12 May  Asahi Shimbun.  He added that "all ministers must make every  possible effort to achieve deregulation even if this means  risking their political careers."  Several days later, on 17 May,  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reportedly held a special meeting  with key economic ministers at which he urged them to take the  initiative in formulating deregulation measures (Kyodo, 17 May).  On 19 May, Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and  Coordination Agency, held talks on deregulation with six key  cabinet members, according to the 20 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun.  Speaking with Ishida later in the day, Prime Minister Hata  appeared to allude to the need to overcome bureaucratic  opposition to deregulation by commenting that Ishida should  "spread determination to promote deregulation among various  ministries and agencies."     The ruling coalition, however, appears to have made little  progress so far.  According to a 17 May Kyodo report, Economic  Planning Agency head Yoshio Terasawa acknowledged to reporters  after Prime Minister Hata's 17 May meeting with key economic  ministers that the ministers had not been able to formulate any  specific plans for handling deregulation.     Business Support for Deregulation     Although the ruling coalition is politically weak, it may be able  to draw on support in the Japanese business community--which sees  deregulation as a way to stimulate the moribund Japanese economy-  -to gain leverage with the bureaucracy.  Several leading Japanese  business groups have actively lobbied the government in favor of  deregulation, particularly in areas where these groups see  deregulation as benefiting Japanese business.  For example,  Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan's second largest business group,  the Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) met with  Prime Minister Hata on 1O May to urge him to vigorously promote  economic reform and deregulation, which Hayami described as  "vital" to Japan's economic recovery.  On 13 May, Japan's largest  business organization, the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren), reportedly sent a letter supporting deregulation to  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai (Kyodo, 13 May).  The  same day, Keidanren presented Prime Minister Hata with a 196-  point proposal for deregulating such areas as land and housing  regulations, communications, distribution, and agriculture, and  Keidanren Vice Chairman Nakauchi met with Hata to discuss his  views on deregulation (Kyodo, 13 May; Yomiuri Shimbun, 15 May).     Business leaders who support deregulation have also been  increasingly critical of the bureaucracy for resisting reform.  According to the 12 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a group of  businessmen represented on the Working Group on Import Promotion,  Market Access Improvement, and Distribution--including Keidanren  Vice Chairman Nakauchi--sharply criticized senior government  bureaucrats attending the working group's 12 May meeting for  failing to vigorously promote deregulation.  Nihon Keizai Shimbun  quoted one private sector representative as stating that the  panel--composed of businessmen and scholars--believed that "it is  time for the ministries and agencies concerned to pool their  wisdom and announce plans for productive deregulation."  At the  18 May meeting of the panel, private sector members reportedly  once again upbraided senior officials briefing the group,  accusing them of foot-dragging.  According to the 18 May Nihon  Keizai Shimbun, private sector representatives told the officials  that they "must change their attitude of arguing that regulations  are justified by Japan's special circumstances."  The same day,  Keidanren Vice Chairman Nakauchi reportedly sent a letter to  various ministries, criticizing them for "trying to protect their  authority" by resisting deregulation.     Business support for some aspects of deregulation appears to have  had some success in getting the government to consider more  extensive changes than it originally planned.  For example, the 4  May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the government originally  planned to include in its deregulation package some modifications  of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law that regulates the operation  of larger retail outlets.  When influential parts of the business  community began to call for the abolition of the law, however,  the government began to examine the possibility of gradually  phasing it out.     Outlook     Because of opposition from the bureaucracy, the Japanese  government will probably be able to draw up only a relatively  unambitious package of deregulation measures by the June  deadline.  Although some of the politicians in the ruling  coalition appear committed to deregulation, most have only a  general knowledge of the regulations they seek to abolish and are  heavily dependent on the bureaucracy to supply the details needed  to draw up and carry out a comprehensive program of deregulation.  In addition, the coalition is currently preoccupied with a number  of other concerns, including the volatile political climate in  Japan and the government's shaky political standing, and may be  unable to focus sufficient attention on breaking the logjam over  deregulation.  Business community support for deregulation may  provide leverage against bureaucratic opposition and secure more  extensive reforms in some instances.  However, the government  will probably be able to count on this support only in areas  where deregulation serves the interests of Japanese business, and  not in those areas where business sees deregulation as less  beneficial or even harmful.

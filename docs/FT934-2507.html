			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Ministers confident bills will pass Ministers are confident that they will get two important pieces of revenue-raising legislation through the Commons this week despite Labour disapproval of the speed with which MPs will debate the measures. The government wants the bills - one reducing the statutory sick pay subsidy to some employers, the other raising employees' National Insurance contributions by 1 per cent - to go through all Commons stages by Thursday night, and to be on the statute book early in the new year. It is not unusual for legislation to pass through the Commons at this speed, but Labour claims it is almost unprecedented so early in a parliamentary session. Last week, Labour vented its anger by ending the arrangement by which MPs 'pair off' with opponents so that both can be absent during divisions. Mr Derek Foster, Labour's chief whip, believes this may make life difficult for government whips, who will have to ensure that sufficient MPs are in the Commons to vote the measures through. They may also have to take account of some backbench unease about the impact of the measures. Today, the government will introduce a 'guillotine' motion, proposing a limited debate on both bills. If this is passed, the Statutory Sick Pay Bill will be debated for no more than six hours tomorrow, with MPs voting at 10 pm. The debate raising the National Insurance contribution will go through the same curtailed procedures on Thursday. Ministers said yesterday the sick pay and National Insurance legislation had to be on the statute book quickly so that employers could make provision for the changes. The measures will raise about Pounds 2.5bn for the Exchequer next year. Ministers claimed that Labour's decision to end the pairing arrangement was a bout of 'sour grapes' following a failure to call for a separate Commons vote on the proposed compensation package for VAT on fuel last week. Labour MPs said the bills had to be rushed because of a timetabling mess created by the Budget, which has left the government only four months between last month's Budget and the implementation of some measures. Labour also claimed that some of the legislation would be resisted by Tory backbenchers.</p>

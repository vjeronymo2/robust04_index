			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ole Bang Nielsen "Background" article: "Nordic Block Vote </F> Possible"]    [Text] Brussels -- If the other three Nordic countries  become members of the EU [European Union], from 1995 the Nordic  countries will have a total voting strength in the Council of  Ministers corresponding to 15 percent.    This is not enough for the Nordic countries alone to be able  to block EU proposals which run counter to Nordic interests --  for that 70 percent of votes would be needed -- but it does mean  that the Nordic countries could represent a power factor  together with other EU countries in areas such as environmental  policy, consumer policy, and on the question of free trade.    Denmark has had difficulty in promoting the stated Danish  interest in high standards in the environmental and consumer  fields -- as demonstrated most recently in connection with  issues such as the EU's directive on the recycling of packaging  materials and the directive on food additives. Hitherto  Denmark, together with the Netherlands and Germany, has formed a  block vote in the Council of Ministers and has fought for higher  environmental standards. But the three countries have not had  enough votes to stand firm on this policy. With votes from  Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway -- which are expected to  pursue a similar environmental policy line in the EU -- a solid  block has now been created that could at least block proposed  directives that are designed to water down environmental policy.    But apart from in the environmental field it is at present  difficult to see how the admission of the new members could  alter the balance in the Council of Ministers.    Yesterday Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical  Liberal) himself mentioned environmental policy as an important  area for Nordic cooperation.    "There is a core of issues on which the Nordic countries  have  a common stance," he said. He also mentioned the question of  greater openness in EU cooperation and the prospect of increased  cooperation with the countries of East Europe.    "In the case of East Europe I see a real possibility of  close  Nordic cooperation involving new initiatives that could benefit  the East Europeans." Niels Helveg Petersen takes the view that  the Nordic countries have a shared desire and a common interest  in getting the East Europeans linked to the EU as swiftly as  possible.    "But there is the prospect of other openings in the field of  security and foreign policy, and along with all this comes the  prospect that the Nordic area will have a common foreign policy  through the EU," Niels Helveg Petersen pointed out. Since World  War II the Nordic countries have gone their separate ways in the  field of security policy. Denmark and Norway have been members  of NATO, for the last 22 years Denmark has also been a member of  the EU, Sweden has been neutral, while up to the collapse of the  Soviet Union, Finland had forced on it a neutrality that mostly  satisfied Soviet interests.    In the economic field, however, there are doubts about the  creation of a Nordic block vote. In the agricultural field  Denmark's interests run directly counter to those of the other  Nordic countries, and it is also doubtful whether the potential  new members will back the liberal trade line that Denmark has  traditionally pursued in the EU.</p>

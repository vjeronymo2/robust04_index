			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY: WORKING MOTHERS PAY $14 BILLION FOR CHILD CARE  </P> <P> Working mothers spent $14 billion in 1986 on care for children younger than 15,  with poor women paying disproportionately high percentages of their family  income, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.  </P> <P> In the most detailed survey of working women's child-care arrangements yet  conducted, the bureau spotlighted disparities that are fueling a drive on  Capitol Hill toward some kind of child-care help for poor families.  </P> <P> About one-third of the 18.2 million working mothers with children under 15 made  cash payments for child care, paying on average $45 a week, or 6% of their  monthly family income, the survey found. But women in poverty who paid for  child care devoted 22% of their income -- about $32 a week -- to it.  </P> <P> More than 29 million children -- 9 million of them younger than age five -- had  mothers who worked full or part time in 1986, said Martin O'Connell, chief of  the Census Bureau's fertility statistics branch. There are now 52 million  children under age 15 in the U.S. population, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A $750 Tax Credit  </P> <P> While both parties support helping financially struggling families pay for  child care, two competing Senate bills use different methods for reaching the  same goal, and the debate has split largely along partisan lines.  </P> <P> Most Senate Democrats and a few Republicans support the $1.75-billion "Act for  Better Child Care," known as ABC. Along with tax credits and refunds, the ABC  would subsidize low-income parents with children in day care and set up  programs to improve the quality and availability of child-care services.  </P> <P> Most Republicans support a plan that gives up to a $750 tax credit to families  with small children, whether or not the mothers work, and provides $400 million  a year for block grants to help states expand and improve services.  </P> <P> ABC supporters said the Census Bureau survey illustrated why the government  must channel more money toward day care. While the poorest women in the survey  paid $32 a week, the wealthiest families, with income of more than $3,750 a  month -- paid $58 a week.  </P> <P> "I'd be concerned about what (the women in poverty) are buying," said Helen  Blank, director of child care for the Children's Defense Fund. "Poor people are  stretching all they can. I don't think poor people prefer the cheapest day  care."  </P> <P> But William Maddox, director of policy analysis for the Family Research Center,  said the survey is misleading because it focuses solely on working mothers.  When both working and non-working mothers are considered, he said, "Less than  one child in five is in a paid care situation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TV as Babysitter  </P> <P> Maddox also said the poorest families may pay less because they rely on  church-subsidized day care or pay for fewer hours. The survey found that only  21% of poor mothers paid for child-care services of any kind. The center  supports tax credits for poor families with children regardless of whether the  mother works.  </P> <P> Based on a weighted statistical survey of 1,650 working mothers conducted  nationwide between September and November, 1986, the survey also found that 28%  of children under five whose mothers work are cared for in their own home,  while 42% are cared for in someone else's home and 21% are in formal day-care  facilities.  </P> <P> Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), who introduced the ABC bill, said these  statistics underscored the need for the ABC. "If you're putting (children) in  someone else's home, often you're putting them in front of a television set.  You're not putting them in the kind of environment you'd like."  </P> <P> The survey also identified important seasonal differences in the way mothers  care for children aged five to 14. During the school year, 70% of these  children were in school while their mothers worked, and 5% cared for  themselves, the survey found. But in the summer, 13.2% of the five to 14 year  olds -- or an extra 1.6 million children -- were on their own.  </P></p>

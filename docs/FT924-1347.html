			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Barclays writes off Pounds 240m on Imry debt BARCLAYS Bank has provided Pounds 240m to cover possible losses on its Pounds 422m exposure to Imry, a property group, in one of the largest individual debt write-offs in UK banking history. The provision, of which Pounds 196m has been written off entirely, resulted from Barclay's role in financing a highly leveraged takeover of a quoted property company in 1989, just before the commercial property market went into its sharpest decline in living memory. The announcement of the record provision, which had been expected by the City, accompanied details of a financial restructuring in which Barclays swapped some of Imry's debt into preference shares and also became owner of the business. Barclays' involvement in Imry dates from 1989, when it lent Pounds 214m to Marketchief (later renamed Chester), a consortium which paid Pounds 314m for Imry. Two years later, it increased its exposure to Pounds 440m. Barclays has written off its entire Pounds 196m exposure to Chester. Total provisions including this write-off are Pounds 240m, of which Pounds 75m was taken in its results for the first half of 1992. Barclays has also converted Pounds 100m of debt in Imry into redeemable preference shares. Barclay's exposure to the Imry Group, excluding the preference shares, is now Pounds 76m of drawn facilities, Pounds 30m of undrawn facilities and Pounds 20m of guarantees. Mr Martin Myers, chief executive of Imry, blamed the company's difficulties wholly on its acquisition by Marketchief, which drained about Pounds 115m in interest and capital payments from the Imry subsidiary. 'If Marketchief had never happened, we would not be in any trouble whatsoever,' he said. He added that the restructuring gave Imry a 'positive and stable base from which to go forward'. Imry's net assets, which include a shopping centre in Leicester, total about Pounds 70m. Mr David Davies, chairman of Johnson Matthey, the metals group, will be Imry's chairman, a post he occupied before the 1989 takeover. Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, former chairman of the group, resigned six weeks ago after selling his equity to the Imry management. He controlled Castor Holdings, an international finance group, which collapsed last summer. Banks' downgrade, Page 22; Lex, Page 14; London Stock Exchange, Page 34</p>

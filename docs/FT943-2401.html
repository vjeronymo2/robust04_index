			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Result leaves markets nervous Fears that Sweden's new Social Democratic government would not be strong enough to push through tough spending cuts yesterday alarmed financial markets. The weak electoral showing by the Liberal party also disappointed the markets, where it had been hoped its influence would strengthen the government's resolve to push through strong measures to tackle Sweden's yawning budget deficit. 'This is the worst possible scenario,' said Mr Christian Diebitsch, analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. 'We have a weak left-wing government which isn't strong enough to implement spending cuts on its own and a Liberal party which isn't strong enough to support them.' He said the market was looking for a budget strengthening package of between SKr100bn (Pounds 8.3bn) and SKr150bn, compared with the SKr61bn package outlined by the Social Democrats before the election. In early market reaction, long-term interest rates rose, share prices tumbled and the krona weakened, before rallying. The general stock exchange index closed 0.38 percentage points lower at 1424.9.</p>

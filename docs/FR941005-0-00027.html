The 15 percent leeway provided to the Regional Director to make adjustments in standard PRRs without further rulemaking is inadequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Changes in management measures sometimes have effects that are not anticipated. Notice-and-comment procedures provide the agency and the public the opportunity to determine what such effects might be. There is no limit to the change in a PRR that may be made in any one year. The Regional Director may make changes to a PRR without providing opportunity for prior public comment as long as the aggregate change in any one year does not exceed 15 percent. Changes to a PRR which, when aggregated with all other changes made during that same calendar year, are greater than 15 percent require notice and opportunity for prior public comment to ensure that all data and all possible effects are considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS, having reviewed the purpose of this rule and comments received, has determined that it is necessary for fishery conservation and management. Standard PRRs, rather than recovery rates provided by vessel operators, are necessary to estimate the round-weight equivalent of retained species: (1) To assign vessels to fisheries for purposes of monitoring fishery specific bycatch allowances of prohibited species; (2) to monitor vessel compliance with fishery specific bycatch rate standards set forth under the VIP to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates; and (3) to calculate round-weight equivalents for purposes of assessing fees under the Research Plan. This rule is also necessary to promote compliance with regulations that prohibit pollock roe stripping as intended by the Magnuson Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis as part of the EA/RIR/FRFA, which concludes that this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA may be obtained from the Regional Director (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gary Matlock,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

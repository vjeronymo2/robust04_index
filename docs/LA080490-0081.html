			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner's lawyers said a letter sent to 18 limited partners wasn't  an attempt by the New York Yankee owner to defy commissioner Fay Vincent and  maintain control of the team.  </P> <P> Kaufman and Steinbrenner's tax lawyer, Daniel McCarthy, responded to a New York  Daily News report of a letter McCarthy sent to the Yankees' limited partners  this week after Vincent barred Steinbrenner from running the club.  </P> <P> The letter asked the limited partners to allow Steinbrenner to remain involved  in "all financial, tax and other business purposes" of the Yankees even after  he gives up majority interest in the team later this month. Kaufman and  McCarthy said the letter was designed to smooth the transition when  Steinbrenner moves from general to limited partner.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: 'Lodger cover' blow for a puzzled landlady JANE ANDREWS* has had a number of surprises since she decided to take in a lodger in February. She wanted to take advantage of the government's rent-a-room scheme, under which people who let a furnished room in their home are not be taxed on the first Pounds 3,250 of rent. The scheme is one of the government's measures aimed at reviving the private rental sector. She wrote to Halifax building society, her mortgage lender, to let them know that she was taking in a lodger. Halifax requested details of her tax office and national insurance number to check with the Inland Revenue that her eligibility for tax relief would not be lost. Her first surprise came when she received a letter from the society consenting 'to your request to allow another person (the Lodger) to share occupation of your mortgaged property with you.' 'My letter was written to advise them of a change - not requesting their permission,' said Andrews. A further surprise was to come in the last paragraph of the letter: a request for a Pounds 50 administration fee. When she called her branch manager to protest, he said that she had been sent a standard letter and did not need to pay the Pounds 50. 'He also said that if customers like myself telephoned to query the charge, they were told they did not have to pay and if customers sent a cheque, then they accepted it]' said Andrews. Halifax said this week that the Pounds 50 charge is to cover administration costs when the society consents to borrowers for establishing a tenancy agreement, or to lodgers staying at the property. It said that the information given to Andrews 'was unfortunately incorrect and for this we apologise.' Andrews also wrote to her insurance company, Commercial Union, to let it know that she had taken in a lodger. After two months she received a letter which said her existing Key home contents policy could not be continued and enclosed details instead of a new policy - Guesthouse. Andrews was distressed since the letter gave her the impression that her policy had been cancelled. Moreover, the new Guesthouse policy seemed unsuitable since she did not have a liquor licence and was only taking in one lodger. 'They said they were sorry if my letter was misleading as they had not cancelled my policy but an endorsement had been imposed, which stated that loss or damage caused by theft would not be covered unless violent means were used to enter the home,' she said. This endorsement is standard practice in the insurance industry. 'I find it ridiculous that my lodger can insure his goods against me but I cannot get an all-risks cover, even though I am prepared to pay more for it,' said Andrews. 'On the one hand, the government encourages people to take in lodgers by relaxing the tax rules, yet on the other hand, insurance companies block this by not taking the risk.' Of the 10 companies approached (see table), Royal Insurance indicated the greatest flexibility by being prepared to maintain the same level of cover on a case by case basis. *Jane Andrews is a pseudonym for a reader who did not wish to be named.</p>

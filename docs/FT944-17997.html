			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada A weak opening for the Toronto market turned into a rout later as the program selling in New York sparked a freefall in share prices. The TSE 300 index plunged 70.45 to 4,274.26 and falls led rises by 542 to 238 after volume of 58.9m shares valued at CDollars 862m. The TSE got off to a bad start, rocked by a drop in the overnight spot price for gold that sparked more profit-taking in gold shares, which are heavily weighted in the TSE 300. An edging up of yields after yesterday morning's T-bill auction added to weakness in Canadian stocks.</p>

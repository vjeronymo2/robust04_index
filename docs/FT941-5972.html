			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Johannesburg finished off earlier hopeful highs as the market reacted to gold's continued weakness and an easing in initial euphoria about political developments, on the view that the market needed more concrete steps towards Inkatha's participation in elections before running higher. The overall index added 1 at 4,881 and industrials advanced 19 to 5,633, but golds retreated 63 to 1,923. Anglos moved ahead R2 to R204 and De Beers R1.50 to R106.50.</p>

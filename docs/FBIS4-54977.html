			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Three articles in two recent issues of  the Belgrade weekly VREME discuss the public admission by Nikola  Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of internal affairs, that Serb  and Muslim refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina had been deported  from Montenegro to Serbian-held territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    VREME's 4 April issue published a letter dated 18 September  1992 written by Pejakovic in response to an inquiry by Daniela  Stupar-Titoric, a Bosnia- Herzegovina refugee in Montenegro,  about the fate of her husband. In the letter Pejakovic admitted  to Stupar-Titoric that her husband, Alemko Titoric, from Novo  Sarajevo, had been arrested in Herceg Novi, Montenegro, on 26  May 1992 together with 34 other persons, and, at the request of  the republic of Srpska [RS], the self-proclaimed Serb state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, handed over to Srebrenica Secretariat of  Internal Affairs [SUP] officials, who in turn handed the  refugees over to Bosnian Muslim military police at the  Territorial Defense headquarters in Bratunac in exchange for RS  prisoners. Pejakovic stated in the letter that he had no other  information on the fate of the deported individuals.    The 11 April issue of VREME contended that Pejakovic's  letter  finally confirmed the suspicions of the Montenegrin opposition  that what is at issue are "acts that have the character of war  crimes against a civilian population." The weekly noted that  opposition delegates in the Montenegrin Assembly had been  demanding an investigation of the deportation of refugees since  the "first half of 1992." These demands contributed to the  "satanization" of the opposition in the Montenegrin press, VREME  said, adding that the press viewed the arrested individuals as  "Alija's fighters and perpetrators of diversionary tactics" who  "came to Montenegro disguised as refugees" intending to "provoke  a war in this area." In talks with opposition party delegations,  however, Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic gave his  assurance that the deportation of refugees would cease and that  each case would be investigated, VREME reported, adding that a  parliamentary commission had been formed to conduct an  investigation. VREME listed the names of 85 ethnic Muslim and  Serb deportees who it said were identified by Pejakovic in his  April 1993 official response to the parliamentary commission.  According to the information provided by Pejakovic, groups of  refugees were turned over to the republic of Srpska on 19, 24,  25, and 27 May 1992.    The same issue of VREME criticized the deportation of  refugees and cited a statement by Nebojsa Vucinic, professor at  the law faculty of the university in Podgorica, that "what is at  issue is the violation of the Convention on the Status of  Refugees, which Yugoslavia signed and ratified.... The basic  right of refugees is that they not be returned to the state from  which they escaped and in which their lives are in danger....  The basic duty of a state is to offer protection to the  refugees, and if someone among them has committed a war crime or  a crime against humanity, he is to answer before a regular court  and through regular court proceedings."    VREME also quoted Stevan Lilic, professor of constitutional  law at Belgrade University, who viewed Pejakovic's letter to  Daniela Stupar-Titoric as "proof of the clinical death of a  legal state." Lilic stated that the police violated both the  Constitution of Montenegro and the Constitution and Criminal  Code of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. He cited  Article 23 of the FRY Constitution, which maintains that no one  should be deprived of freedom except persons who have committed  criminal acts; Article 154 of the Criminal Code of Yugoslavia,  which calls for a five-year prison sentence for persons who  violate human rights on the basis of ethnic, racial, or other  differences; and Article 142 of the Code, according to which the  taking of hostages is considered a war crime. Lilic asked: "Is  the Montenegrin Ministry of Internal Affairs in the service of  the republic of Srpska, and is Montenegro conducting on its  territory a manhunt for people of another state and on behalf of  that state? Thus, a state is violating its own constitution in  order to do a service for another state.... This act is not only  unconstitutional, it is totally immoral."    VREME maintains that Pejakovic's "cool public admission" of  the deportation amounts to an attempt to institutionalize  lawlessness and to proclaim the manhunt for refugees a normal  police procedure. Thus, the weekly concludes, this kind of  lawlessness could be repeated again and again.</p>

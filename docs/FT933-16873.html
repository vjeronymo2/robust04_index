			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil calls for Pounds 29m via rights issue HARDY Oil and Gas has launched a rights issue which will raise Pounds 29.1m net enabling it to acquire more producing oil and gas fields and improve its cash flow. The directors said the issue was partly prompted by changes in North Sea oil taxes. Hardy is issuing 22m new shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 133p each. At yesterday's close the shares fell 3p at 159p. 'We want to bulk up our cash flow and boost the profit and loss account and the best way to do it is to buy current production in the UK and overseas', said Mr Peter Elwes, chief executive. Building up cash flow will put the company in better position to take on the heavy costs of financing future field development in the UK. Its share of development costs for the Elgin and Banff fields could be as much as Pounds 120m, with work on Elgin expected to begin in 1995 and Banff the following year. The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes will have a short-term effect on the profit and loss account - by removing a tax credit of nearly Pounds 7m enjoyed last year. The government's transitional relief will reduce the impact on cash flow. Mr Elwes said the rights issue would help the company cope with the change in taxes in the next two years, after which the reduced PRT rate will make its stakes in producing fields, such as the Forties, more profitable. Proceeds will be used to buy more interests in the North Sea and possibly the Wytch Farm offshore development near Bournemouth. Hardy is also looking to increase its position in Canada where oil production costs are as low as Dollars 3 a barrel and buy some exposure to the North American gas market. These assets will generate cash flow immediately which will help finance future growth. The debt to equity ratio was 44 per cent at the end of March and the rights issue will bring it down to 38 per cent. The rights has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers and brokers are Cazenove and Kleinwort Benson Securities.</p>

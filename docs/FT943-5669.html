			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cattle's restricted by Pounds 1.76m closure costs A good performance from its consumer credit business helped Cattle's (Holdings) lift interim pre-tax profits, before exceptional items, by 22 per cent to Pounds 8.45m, against Pounds 6.9m. However, after taking a Pounds 1.76m charge against the closure of its lossmaking Swinton insurance franchise operation, the outcome showed a slight decline to Pounds 6.69m. Consumer credit turnover rose 11 per cent and contributed Pounds 86.1m (Pounds 77.8m) to a total of Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 98.7m), an increase of 6 per cent. Mr Edward Cran, managing director, said that the continued improvement in the Shopacheck home collected credit business reflected a slow return of confidence among the group's 260,000 households. Cattle's has an estimated 20 per cent of the weekly collected credit market. Mr Cran added that the closure of its Swinton operations was likely to be followed by the run-down of its other non-core activities, such as a small travel agency business. 'We have positioned ourselves firmly in financial services and plan to continue this process,' he said. Earnings per share slid to 3.7p (4.3p). An interim dividend of 2.15p (1.9p) is declared.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R.L.: "Taxes Higher Than Annual Income"] </F>   [Text] The newly introduced republic tax with which one  virtually pays for the right to work (from 100 to 10,000 dinars  depending on the type of activity), at least judging from the  first reactions, has embittered many. Are there good reasons  for this?    "This is the greatest stupidity that could have been  adopted," Duka Samardzic, in charge of the private sector in the  Economic Chamber of Belgrade, says. "Judging from the text of  this decree, several provisions in it are logically hard to  explain and to understand. For example, it calls for  representative offices of foreign firms to pay the highest tax  amount of 10,000 dinars. Do we want in this way to chase away  even the few such offices that are in our country? I had  thought that it was in our interest to keep foreign firms in our  country, to be in contact with the world through them, and now I  see that the people in the government think differently."  Samardzic believes that this decree especially affects the  owners of private firms. The majority of firms are registered to  conduct several types of business activity, including, for  example, foreign trade. The authors of the decree call for firms  to pay taxes based on the business activity for which, according  to this decree, the highest tax amount is set. Thus, the  majority of private businessmen will have to pay the 5,000  dinars set for foreign trade, although they did not transact a  single business deal in this sector, having worked mostly in the  services sector, for which the prescribed tax is only one-fifth  as much.    Samardzic says that this decree will also affect those who  have recently registered their firms and so far not carried out  any business deals: "If they have not managed to earn anything  yet, how will they pay these 5,000 dinars? This equals 5,000  German marks. This is a lot of money today, and it is not easy  to pay it just so that one might gain the right to work. Anyway,  many do not manage to make that much money even in a whole year,  so how can they pay this amount?"    To make the problem worse, the closing of a firm is not a  way  out for those affected by this decree, because the procedure for  closing a firm can cost even more. "At this moment it is really  difficult to be wise and advise people on what they should do,"  Samardzic says.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT THE COMPROMISE  </P> <P> The agreement that could free California from its financial straitjacket is at  grave risk. The education community did not get everything it wanted when the  governor and state Legislature reached this agreement and now may not support  the complex package when it goes before the voters as a constitutional  amendment next June. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig says, "The  whole deal is up in the air." A California Teachers Assn. official describes  the group's position as "probably more hostile neutral than neutral neutral."  Those attitudes are indefensible.  </P> <P> In the long run, everyone benefits from giving the state more fiscal  maneuvering room -- the schools included. Therefore, everyone should work  together to encourage voters to pass the financing agreement -- schools  included.  </P> <P> The artificial spending limits imposed on the state by the 1979 Gann initiative  have severely restricted the state's ability to finance health-care and  mental-health programs as well as provide services for poor people. At last  there is the opportunity to relax the rigid Gann limits and increase the  gasoline tax to meet critical transportation needs while increasing school  spending with an unexpected tax windfall.  </P> <P> As negotiators strained to reach this agreement last month, Honig was at first  a help, then a hindrance. He compromised when legislators from rural and  suburban school districts wanted a larger share of education money, and he was  even willing to give up some of the potential gains for schools that voters had  passed under Proposition 98.  </P> <P> Then he objected to deleting several guarantees in the agreement, including one  that would have built any future state surplus money into the schools' basic  budget for the following year as called for in Proposition 98. But it is  important to remember that schools still will receive more money than they did  before Proposition 98 passed, although not as large a share of the surplus as  they would have received before 98 was modified.  </P> <P> Honig said as much himself in withdrawing his opposition to the settlement the  day it was announced. The negotiators did not make "the very extreme changes in  Proposition 98 that were being considered," Honig said then. "Basically, we  were successful in beating back efforts to gut 98."  </P> <P> California is a state in search of a financial solution for a host of problems,  only one of which is the critical need for better education for its youngsters.  In this constitutional amendment, it has the start of that solution, a  compromise that deserves the widest possible public support.  </P></p>

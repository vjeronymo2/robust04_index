			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The BCCI Indictments: Global trail of bribery - Richard Donkin traces worldwide fraud and corruption alleged in yesterday's charges BCCI was involved in a vast web of corruption across the Third World, according to US indictments yesterday. Court documents listed 12 countries, three organisations and numerous officials as beneficiaries of the fraud which spirited away some Dollars 5bn from BCCI coffers, including money from depositors. The documents outlined a number of deceptions perpetrated on the World Bank and the IMF. In one of these schemes BCCI officials enlisted the help of Pakistani government officials in 1979 to hoodwink the IMF into believing Pakistani national reserves were higher than they were. A secret BCCI loan to the government enabled it to avoid credit restrictions and a devaluation of the rupee. In another Pakistan-based scheme BCCI violated Pakistani central bank controls to earn preferential banking rates. The main fraud indictment said that from BCCI's inception, the group had been undercapitalised and had granted large and numerous loans to favoured associates of the defendants. The documents named Sheikh Kamal Adham and Mr Sayed Jawhary, Mr Adham's accountant, as the beneficiaries of some of these uncollectable loans. The alleged schemes are said to have included frauds on the regulators of Washington-based Financial General Bankshares, the National Bank of Georgia, the Independence Bank of Encino, and Banco Mercantil in Colombia. Members of the criminal enterprise at BCCI, said prosecutors, made systematic efforts to intimidate and influence the press with pay-offs. They spent depositors' money on charities to garner public praise and increase the political power of BCCI. They hired politicians and officials to court influence in countries where they wanted to set up operations. At the same time assets, it is alleged, were being bought with depositors' funds and maintained separately from the BCCI group. They are said to have been bought in the names of Mr Adham, Mr Jawhary, Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, Mr Faisal Saud Al Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman, and Mr Mohammed M. Hammoud, a Lebanese businessman who, the indictment said, 'reportedly died' in 1990. 'When the major BCCI group banks were closed in July 1991,' the indictment said, 'these nominees were in a position to assert title to the assets purchased with depositors' funds. Assets purchased by the BCCI group in this manner included US banks, real estate, and a major oil company in Pakistan.' Two BCCI-controlled Cayman entities, ICIC Overseas and ICIC Holdings, were allegedly used to maintain the sham. ICIC Overseas was used to create false records concealing BCCI group liabilities and presenting false assets; ICIC Holdings to hide stolen money. According to the US documents, the fiddling of BCCI's loan books appears to have run the whole gamut of fraud. Records listing some loan agreements were prepared for auditors but the picture was distorted and disguised. Deposits were not always recorded and others were incorrectly recorded. During the period covered by the indictment, September 1 1977 to August 18 1991 - intriguingly, after the date that the Bank of England moved to close down BCCI - it is alleged that members of BCCI enabled nations such as Pakistan, Senegal, Zambia and Nigeria to evade fiscal restraints placed upon them by the World Bank and the IMF. Against this background, BCCI officials, specifically the founder, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, his right-hand man, were plotting to deliver cash and other benefits to various finance ministers, heads of state, central banks and senior executives of international and regional organisations, all with the aim of increasing deposits - the life-blood of the fraud. While the indictment did not name names, it matched the catalogue of corrupted officials to the Congo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and the Ivory Coast, Argentina and Peru. The indictments against Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his Washington law firm partner, outlined how they ran First American Bank. The documents list when Mr Abedi or Mr Naqvi at BCCI were involved in the appointment executives at the Washington bank and the selection of board members. Among the bribes Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were charged with taking from BCCI were Dollars 10m of share profits, sham loans, and Dollars 16m of money denominated as legal fees. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman are also being sued in a civil suit by the Manhattan district attorney for the return of more than Dollars 40m in alleged bribes and illicit profits which they are alleged to have obtained.</p>

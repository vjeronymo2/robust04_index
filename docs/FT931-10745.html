			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris 7.7% better on week as bourses celebrate INTEREST-rate sensitive bourses, particularly Paris, Frankfurt and a partly obscured Brussels, continued to reflect the cut in German interest rates yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed with the CAC-40 index above 1,900 for the first time since June 30: up 53.80, or 2.9 per cent on the day at 1,908.18, and 7.7 per cent better on the week after a fall of 4.6 per cent in January. Turnover stayed unusually strong, climbing again to over FFr5bn as financials, and shares in heavily indebted companies extended Thursday's gains. Poliet, the building materials group controlled by Paribas, gained FFr21 or 9.1 per cent to FFr251; Paribas itself put on FFr22.40 or 5.7 per cent to FFr414.90 in 324,000 shares and Credit Local, the municipal finance bank, ended FFr22, or 6.4 per cent higher at FFr367. Suez rose FFr8.50 to FFr283 in 766,000 and the deeply indebted Eurotunnel picked up FFr1.25, or 3.5 per cent to FFr37.65 in very heavy volume of 3.5m shares. FRANKFURT left the DAX index up 4.4 per cent on the week. Turnover, on a rising trend all week, rose from DM7.1bn to DM9.9bn. Domestic investors, particularly, were attracted to financials, said Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt. They liked their interest-rate sensitivity, the bonus to the banks in the release of DM32bn of interest fee reserves, and the implied improvement in German banking competitiveness. Steels and some engineers were relatively, or actually depressed. Krupp Hoesch, closing one of its blast furnaces temporarily because of weak demand, fell DM1 to DM112. MILAN's Comit index rose 6.07 to 504.21, a 3.5 per cent rise on the week. Confirmation that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's coalition government had won yesterday's confidence vote was the cue for renewed foreign buying in a market already well supported by domestic investors. Trading continued to be buoyed by this week's interest rate cuts, and hopes of another in Italy soon. Telecoms found strong support after the postal minister, Mr Maurizio Pagani, reaffirmed plans to reorganise the sector and cut the state's stake below 50 per cent. Stet fixed L60 higher at L2,270 and rose to L2,290 after hours while SIP put on L73 to L1,685. AMSTERDAM finished broadly firmer after the traumas of recent days, buoyed by the higher dollar, lower interest rates and firmer overseas stock markets. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.80 to 97.70 for a half per cent rise on the week. Daf rose 55 cents to Fl 2.50 as it resumed unofficial trading after its suspension late on Thursday. But very high volume surprised some analysts who suggested that speculators were having a final fling. There was also better news for Fokker, Fl 1.90 cents ahead at Fl 10.60, as the Dutch government put compromise proposals for the takeover of the aircraft maker to Deutsche Aerospace. KLM rose Fl 2.70 to Fl 28 with investors apparently more impressed by its plans to cut costs than concerned about the airline's sharply higher third quarter losses. ZURICH was firmer, but off the day's high after an easier dollar and a weaker start on Wall Street left blue chips slightly lower. The market had earlier profited from the positive tone in other European bourses and the SMI index finished 9.9 higher at 2,133.6, 2 per cent ahead on the week. Some switching was seen out of Swiss bank shares into industrials or German bank shares, on the assumption that lower interest rates were already discounted in current Swiss bank share prices. Beneficiaries included Roche certificates, up SFr30 at SFr4,160. BRUSSELS had to contend with Petrofina's 72 per cent drop in profits, and a 2.1 per cent drop in the oil group's shares which closed BFr160 lower at BFr7,370. However, the Bel-20 index still rose 6.67 to 1,226.91, 3.3 per cent up on the week as Belgium's holding companies improved their standing, and Kredietbank put on BFr250, or 4.1 per cent to BFr6,400. COPENHAGEN suffered foreign selling and profit-taking that took the KFX index down 2.47 to 83.70. STOCKHOLM rose on hopes of lower interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index added 19.4 to 928.2.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 5                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1125.44     1126.51     1125.69     1127.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1191.11     1190.33     1188.91     1189.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1129.12     1128.36     1128.92     1129.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1189.39     1188.83     1190.43     1189.21  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 4     Feb 3     Feb 2     Feb 1    Jan 29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1113.35   1097.03   1089.43   1088.01   1079.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1183.60   1171.25   1155.59   1158.83   1148.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1130.23 ; 200 - 1191.87 Low/day: 100 - 1125.29  200 - 1185.06.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

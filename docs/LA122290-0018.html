			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT EVERYONE THINKS ROBINSON IS THE PROBLEM  </P> <P> Come on, L.A. sportswriters. If you can't find fault with John Robinson the  coach, you surely can comment on his erudition.  </P> <P> When he talked about Cleveland Gary's fumbling problems, he said: "We might  have to give him some time to recover his ground."  </P> <P> When commenting on the remainder of the season for the Rams, he said. "This is  a team that has to see itself on a larger concept." Now what does all that  mean?  </P> <P> If verbiage were a snowflake, Robinson would be a blizzard.  </P> <P> R.A.

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUICIDE WATCH PUT ON SLAYING SUSPECT;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE MAN, WHO ALLEGEDLY SHOT HIS DAUGHTER AND HER BOYFRIEND, IS BEING  HELD IN A PSYCHIATRIC WING OF COUNTY JAIL. HE HAD LEFT A NOTE AT HOME  THREATENING TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.  </P> <P> A gunman who walked into the sheriff's substation in the City of Industry --  apparently to confess that he had shot his daughter and her boyfriend -- on  Tuesday was being held in a psychiatric wing of County Jail to guard against a  suicide attempt, officers said.  </P> <P> Detectives said Jimmy Joe Gregory, 56, who was arrested Monday after a  90-minute standoff with deputies in the station, had left a note in his West  Covina home threatening to take his own life.  </P> <P> The bodies of his daughter, Vera Nadine Gregory, 27, and her boyfriend, Charles  A. Franklin Jr., 40, both of whom lived with the suspect, were found in a car  parked in a handicapped space outside the station.  </P> <P> The gunman was a heavy drinker and had been receiving disability payments for a  range of medical problems, said Mike Scott, sheriff's homicide investigator.  His wife, who had been out of town, told deputies that Gregory had been  distraught over financial and family difficulties, Scott said.  </P> <P> "He just gave us the feeling that he wanted to talk to someone," said Deputy  Brett Lisle, who was in the station at the time. "He said his family members  didn't need him anymore."  </P> <P> Another deputy, Ron Cross, told the Associated Press that he helped break the  ice during the standoff by offering the gunman a drink of whiskey.  </P> <P> "I never had to try and form a rapport with someone and keep in mind I may have  to kill him," Cross said. "I made a deal with him," Cross continued. "I  promised to get him Jim Beam and Coke if he would put the gun down."  </P> <P> When Gregory agreed, deputies rushed to a store to buy the beverages. Gregory  unloaded the gun and put it down after he was given the drink, though he  promptly picked it up and and reloaded it, Cross said. Gregory put the gun down  again at 7 p.m., Cross grabbed it, and Gregory was arrested.  </P> <P> Relatives at Gregory's home declined to comment.  </P> <P> The shooting Monday marked at least the fourth time in the last week that a Los  Angeles County man, troubled by domestic woes, had allegedly resorted to  murder.  </P> <P> The alleged perpetrators ranged from a 40-year-old Hollywood butcher who  apparently shot himself after killing his wife and three children to a Van Nuys  restaurant owner who shot his wife, then himself, after she served him with  divorce papers.  </P> <P> Although the cases were not connected, psychologists theorized that the crimes  shared a common denominator.  </P> <P> Kris Mohandie, a psychological assistant for the Los Angeles Police Department,  said suicides and murders occasionally occur in clusters.  </P> <P> "Sometimes there's an element of seeing other people resolving their problems  this way," he said. "All of a sudden, it becomes one of the options."  </P> <P> "There's a lot hopelessness and helplessness out there," added Sidney Brown, an  Encino psychologist and vice president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of  the National Council on Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency.  </P> <P> "Homicide and suicide are the last desperate acts of protest against not  getting one's needs met."  </P></p>

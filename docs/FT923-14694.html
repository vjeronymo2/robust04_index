			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Jakarta reforms a blow to donors A LONG-AWAITED package of economic deregulation unveiled yesterday by the Indonesian government failed to effect many of the changes requested by donors. The donors meet on July 16 in Paris to pledge financial aid to the country. Steel imports are to be liberalised but reform in other sectors was conspicuously absent. Donors, including the World Bank, had argued for restrictions on the import of wheat, sugar and cement to be modified and for market forces, not the government, to set domestic prices. 'The time is not ripe for deregulation (in wheat, sugar and cement),' said Mr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister. State and politically well-connected private companies enjoy virtual monopolies over the three sectors. Donors are still expected to pledge about Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 2.5bn) to Indonesia for the year ahead but are likely to seek government reassurance that the pace of economic reform will be enhanced. They will find cheer in export figures for the first four months of the year which, excluding oil and gas, show a 24 per cent rise over 1991 to Dollars 6.5bn. The new rules governing steel imports allow companies to import directly, instead of having to seek the approval of the state-owned Krakatau Steel company. Krakatau, with a 2.5m tonne a year capacity, dominates the sector and, bankers say, is subsidised by government. However, the company only operates at about 70 per cent capacity and the change in regulations should ease supply constraints and cut the price of steel in the domestic market. The deregulation package also replaces non-tariff barriers with tariffs on more than 200 products ranging from batik material to mineral water.</p>

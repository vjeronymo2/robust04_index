			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Azeris lose key town AZERI troops yesterday pulled out of a key town near the Iranian border yesterday in another victory for Armenian forces from the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Moscow. Spokesmen for both the Azerbaijan Defence Ministry and the Nagorno-Karabakh administration said the defenders withdrew overnight from Fuzuli, a town of 40,000 people under siege for days by Armenians occupying the hills on three sides. The latest victory brought the Armenians closer to cutting off the entire south-western corner of Azerbaijan, home to some 200,000 people, and risked angering neighbouring Iran. The Iranian border is just 25km from Fuzuli and the fighting has sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing towards it. Iran denounced the Armenian offensive last week, saying it believed in the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Fuzuli is the third big town just outside Nagorno-Karabakh seized by the Armenians in recent weeks, after Agdam to the east and Cebrayil further to the south-west. The Azeris say they recaptured Cebrayil at the weekend. The Armenians, whose military advances have fuelled political turmoil in Azerbaijan, say they have to drive back the Azeri troops to protect Karabakh from shelling. The Azeri Defence Ministry said the Armenians had entered Fuzuli after the withdrawal. But a spokesman for the Nagorno- Karabakh administration said its forces were holding back. The Karabakh spokesman said Azeri military aircraft had bombed villages in the Martuni and Gadrut districts of Karabakh overnight, killing five civilians and wounding 17. An Azeri Defence Ministry spokesman denied the report. 'This is false information,' he said. 'The Armenians report Azeri air-raids while taking Azeri towns.' Conflicting reports of the fighting have been a notable characteristic of the five-year-old conflict, which has taken several thousand lives. Armenia officially denies taking part in the war, although it supplies diplomatic support for the enclave's claim to independence and the Karabakh Armenians obtain arms andvolunteer soldiers from Armenia.</p>

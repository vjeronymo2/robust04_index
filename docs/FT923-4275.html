			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / People: Wolff leaves Rudolf Wolff John Wolff is to leave Rudolf Wolff, the metal and commodity broker where he is marketing director and which his family sold to Noranda, the Canadian natural resources group in 1981. His departure at the end of December means he also has to give up the chairmanship of the London Metal Exchange, where he is the third member of his family to hold an executive position in the management of the exchange since his great-grandfather, Rudolf, helped to form it in 1877. Wolff, now 52, joined the family company at the age of 18. He said yesterday: 'When you have been brought up in an entrepreneurial family company the changes involved in becoming part of a huge, public group - the systems and planning - inevitably grate slightly.' So, 'after a lot of hard thinking', he has decided the time has come to go-it-alone. He is to provide investment advice and merchant banking services on the metals business. 'I have been in the business for 32 years and I will be selling my expertise to people who want to tap into it.' The company also announced that Bill Harker, 52, who joined Wolff as managing director from the Royal Trust, Canada's largest trust bank, in January is to succeed Francis Holford as Wolff's chief executive with responsibility for its direction and management. Holford, 54, who married into the Wolff family, stays on as chairman. John Wolff insisted last night there had been no row and that his departure was amicable. 'You have only one life and I have decided I must get on and change mine now.' Observer, Page 23</p>

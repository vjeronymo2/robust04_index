			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 CHARGED WITH LINK TO DRUG MONEY  </P> <P> Five Los Angeles-area men were charged Friday with laundering at least $68  million in illicit drug money through the downtown jewelry district and local  banks as part of an international narcotics ring.  </P> <P> A sixth man, who is an Argentine citizen, was charged with playing a key role  in the scheme but authorities would not disclose whether he has been taken into  custody.  </P> <P> According to documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the men were  involved in laundering close to $250 million, but $180 million of that is the  subject of another criminal case filed last year.  </P> <P> Friday's arrests stemmed from a lengthy, multi-agency money laundering  investigation called "Polar Cap."  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark J. Werksman, the lead prosecutor in the case, said  that more information on the scope of the laundering operation would be  forthcoming. "The numbers are stratospheric," he said.  </P> <P> The original "Polar Cap" arrests were made in Los Angeles in February, 1989,  when federal agents swept through the downtown jewelry district and arrested 31  people, charging them with operating perhaps the most elaborate money  laundering scheme ever uncovered in the United States.  </P> <P> Ten of those people are currently on trial in federal court, charged with  laundering about $350 million in drug proceeds through a downtown jewelry  company called Andonian Bros., headquartered at 220 W. 5th St.  </P> <P> Trial is pending for 12 others charged with laundering $312 million through  another downtown jewelry called Ropex Corp., which was headquartered at 550 S.  Hill St.  </P> <P> Additionally, several of the individuals arrested last year have pleaded guilty  to money laundering and are now cooperating with federal investigators. An  affidavit filed by FBI agent Bruce Stephens, in connection with Friday's  arrests, reveals that those persons have provided considerable information to  the government.  </P> <P> Documents filed Friday state that the defendants in the new case were  co-conspirators with the owners of Ropex Corp.  </P> <P> The complaint, prepared by prosecutor Werksman, states that during the past  four years people in the ring collected cartons of drug money packed like  bricks and shipped by armored car from narcotics dealers in Los Angeles, New  York City and Houston.  </P> <P> Once the money arrived in Los Angeles, the defendants counted cocaine proceeds  utilizing high-speed money-counting machines, and repacked the currency into  boxes, catalogue cases and other packages. The defendants then hand-carried or  used armored cars to transport the money to local banks.  </P> <P> After the money was deposited, the defendants had it wired to bank accounts in  New York City, Panama, Uruguay and other places, in an attempt to "conceal the  nature, source, location and ownership of the cocaine proceeds, and to place  the proceeds outside the United States."  </P> <P> "Unknown co-conspirators located in Colombia, in turn, utilized these narcotics  proceeds to pay the expenses of the narcotics enterprise, and to finance  additional large shipments of cocaine to be imported into the United States,"  according to the complaint filed Friday.  </P> <P> On Thursday and Friday, federal agents arrested Sarkis P. Tanijian, 32, of  Northridge, Vartkes Jirair Agop Magarian, 56, of Van Nuys and Coroun M.  Arslanian, 53, of Glendale. Also arrested were Jean J. Mahroukian, 41, and  George Atik, 41, whose addresses were not available. Werksman said all the men  were arrested in Los Angeles County and defense lawyers said some of them had  been arrested at their offices in the downtown jewelry district.  </P> <P> Also charged but not present in court Friday was Celio Merkin, 57, an Argentine  citizen, whose family lives in Montevideo, Uruguay. Werksman would not say if  Merkin was in custody there.  </P> <P> However, Errol H. Stambler, a lawyer for one of the cooperating defendants,  Sergio Hochman, said he thought it was highly likely that Merkin had been  arrested in Uruguay.  </P> <P> "There is no way the government would have released this complaint against  Merkin unless they had him in custody," Stambler said. The complaint originally  was filed, under seal, in March.  </P> <P> Stambler said he thought that the U.S. government would attempt to have Merkin  extradited from Uruguay, the same procedure used to bring defendant Raul Vivas,  also an Argentinian captured in Uruguay, to this country last December.  </P> <P> The six men named Friday are accused of money laundering and of aiding and  abetting others in the distribution of cocaine. They face long prison terms if  convicted.  </P> <P> The documents allege that Astro Jewelers, located at 610 S. Broadway and  operated by Mahroukian and his brother, Albert Mahroukian, laundered $28  million between 1987 and February, 1989. The documents also allege that  Universal Gold Exchange, located at 650 S. Hill and owned by Atik, laundered  $32 million between 1987 and February, 1989.  </P> <P> Additionally, Atik laundered another $8.8 million between April and July 13 of  this year, according to the documents.  </P> <P> Stephens' affidavit also describes wiretaps and video surveillance of the  defendants, lists huge numbers of bank transactions and includes a description  of information provided by the individuals who pleaded guilty in the other  money laundering cases that stemmed from the same investigation.  </P> <P> For example, Hochman, a Uruguyan, told FBI agents that he, Merkin and Vivas,  who is a defendant in the $350-million money laundering case now on trial,  first met in Uruguay to discuss the money laundering business in April, 1986.  Hochman said that he opened Cambio Italia, a money exchange business in  Montevideo with money put up by Merkin and Jorge Masihy, a Chilean.  </P> <P> Hochman said he came to Los Angeles in July, 1986, at Vivas' request to work on  money collection and transport. He told the FBI that in 1988 Merkin broke off  from Vivas and started his own money laundering enterprise.  </P> <P> Manouk Demirjian, who owned a wholesale jewelry business in Los Angeles, and  participated in the money laundering scheme for three years, is also  cooperating with the government, after pleading guilty. So are Peter (Pepe)  Fuentes, who was one of the coordinators of drug money collection in New York,  Los Angeles and Miami, and Eduardo Ortiz, one of Merkin's money couriers,  according to Stephens' affidavit.  </P> <P> Ortiz told FBI agent Bryan Tepper that he delivered money to Ropex and Astro  Jewelers in late 1988. Ortiz also said that during the month of January, 1989,  he made more than 15 deliveries of currency to Tanijian's residence in  Northridge.  </P></p>

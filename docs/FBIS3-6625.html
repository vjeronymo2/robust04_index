			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to results of JIJI PRESS AGENCY's monthly  poll revealed on 18 March, the support rate for the Hosokawa  cabinet dropped to 49.7 percent, an 8.9-point decline compared  with the previous survey held in February. This is the first  time that the Hosokawa cabinet's support rate dropped below 50  percent. The most common reason given by those interviewed in a  survey conducted last August, when the Hosokawa administration  was inaugurated, was that "we trust the prime minister." In the  recent poll, however, the number of respondents who cited the  same reason declined to 11.9 percent, showing decreasing public  trust in the Hosokawa cabinet.    This is a serious situation for Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who has been relying on the high support rate most for  dealing with the political situation. The drop may also  negatively affect the stalled Diet session.    As for political parties, support rate for the three  coalition parties -- including the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ], which opposed the cabinet reshuffle and insisted  on joining "the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist Pary, and liberal  forces" -- grew.    The poll was conducted from 10 to 13 March by interviewing  2,000 men and women and 68.9 percent of them responded.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Telebras plans placement of ADRs TELEBRAS, the Brazilian state-owned telecommunications holding company, has received government authorisation to make a foreign equities offering of up to Dollars 500m. It plans to ask the US Securities and Exchange Commission for approval of a placement of American depository receipts (ADRs) this month and hopes to make the issue by the end of the year. To meet that deadline, Telebras is expected to make a private placement under the SEC's 144A provision. It would be the first such offering by a Brazilian company, said Mr Juarez Cordeiro Ribeiro, assistant finance director. In May, Aracruz Celulose, a leading pulp and paper exporter, became the first Brazilian company to be traded on Wall Street by making a Dollars 132.5m ADR offering. The 144A process is quicker than the level three, used by Aracruz, because company books do not have to be adapted to meet SEC standards. The offering will help to finance Dollars 3bn of investments for 1992 which include 933,000 additional lines for the country's telephone system. Mr Ribeiro said Telebras expected to make its fourth Eurobond issue of the year shortly.</p>

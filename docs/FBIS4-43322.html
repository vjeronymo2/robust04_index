			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Talamona: "The Tremonti Curve"] </F>   [Text] There is no need to emphasize the importance of the  decisions adopted by yesterday's Council of Ministers, which  represent the initial nucleus of the "100 days" program of  Silvio Berlusconi's government in the economic and social policy  area. With the launching of Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti's  promised tax decree, and with the forthcoming (but perhaps less  easy) measures relating to the flexibility and functional  character of the labor market in sight, the new government is  demonstrating its intention of doing a serious job.    The objective that it is pursuing with determination, given  its urgency -- that of simultaneously stimulating the recovery  which is becoming visible, and the possible and necessary  expansion of job opportunities -- is aimed at removing obstacles  and hindrances to growth, which have for too long paralyzed  Italy's economy.    Also in terms of method, yesterday's tax "package" has  nothing of the chronic emergency approach, nor of the comforting  but useless remedies to which bitter experience has too long  accustomed us. And the consequences of which are visible to us.    Whilst representing solely a relatively limited "advance" on  the tax reforms which the government intends to develop, over  time, into a major edifice of simplification and efficiency, the  measures which have been adopted can have a certain efficacy in  the current economic situation. But right now, they touch,  within a relatively short time frame, on certain key points of  the functioning, or more accurately, the -- in the long term  paralyzing and unbearable -- malfunctioning of the very  structure of the Italian economy.    Moreover, the package consists, to a large extent, of  provisions which together seek to create a (minimal)  relationship of trust between the state and taxpayers. As first  steps on the road toward rationalizing tax structures and a  gradual shift of the tax burden from direct to indirect  taxation, in particular in support of production and hence of  jobs, these provisions mark out the route which the government  will be taking. Moreover, not a few of the measures which have  been adopted reflect the need to begin to move decisively toward  a substantial modernization of the system in a European  direction. To the immediate objective of providing incentives  to improve companies' capacity to generate new productive  thrusts, new employment, new income, and to providing immediate  incentives to the formation of new entrepreneurship (also in the  form of self-employment), is added to the partial detaxing of  reinvested profits and the introduction of the "dry dividend  tax" on stock exchange listed companies.  <H5>  Tax Parity </H5>   They are the first steps too in the direction of the  essential tax parity of financial activities, in favor of  companies and, more generally, of productive investment. One  may wonder whether these initial measures, aimed at creating  jobs, may not perchance threaten the other essential target to  be attained: that of reducing the budget deficit and,  indirectly, achieving monetary stability and the lowering of  interest rates.    The conviction (and the commitment to ensure) that this will  not happen, as a result of the increase in income and hence of  the tax base as a result of the stimuli to expansion and the  economic efficiency of the tax reductions contained in the  government's measures, lead us to hope for the arrival, also in  theory, of a "Tremonti curve" in place of the Laffer curve.</p>

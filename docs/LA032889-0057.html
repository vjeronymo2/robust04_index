The report from Common Cause, a self-styled public interest group,  showed that the 789 candidates who ran for the House in the general election  raised $240.9 million and spent $204.3 million. PACs contributed a record $99.6  million. The 408 incumbents in the election raised $174.2 million, of which  $82.1 million came from PACs, and spent $141.8 million, the study found. The  328 challengers, meanwhile, raised $38.9 million, of which $9 million came from  PACs, and spent $36.4 million. The 53 candidates who sought open seats raised  $27.7 million, $8.4 million from PACs, and spent $26 million. Eventually, 98.6%  of House incumbents were reelected.  </P></p>

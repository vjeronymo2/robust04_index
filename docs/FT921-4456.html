			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Fiddling while Russia burns THE RUSSIAN government must feel very lonely. Apart from the formidable support of President Boris Yeltsin, it seems to have nothing but enemies at home and lukewarm friends abroad. The unhappiness of the former is not surprising. But the dilatory and complacent approach of the leading industrial countries is less forgiveable. If they do not soon put up the relatively small sums needed to secure reform, there may be no reform left to secure. The scale of the problems inherited at the end of last year convinced the Russian government that it had to act swiftly. The die was cast when the government introduced the first stage of price liberalisation in early January. What is now unfolding in Russia, as a result of that decision, is the first and, quite possibly, last attempt at market-oriented reform within a democratic political context. Nor has that effort yet failed. As Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister, noted in the FT last week, prices rose by 250 per cent at once, but then stabilised. Monetary policy has also been tightened - the Russian central bank chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, notwithstanding  - and the free market value of the rouble has even strengthened a little. The government has decided it must maintain momentum. Accordingly, the next phase of price reform is to be introduced by the end of April, when almost all prices will be freed. Energy prices alone are expected to rise six-fold. Wage-price spiral These price increases have to occur without leading to a wage-price spiral. Preventing such a spiral requires stabilisation of the rouble above a level so low that wages would be virtually worthless. Such an over-devaluation would not only be socially destructive, but would be otiose from the point of view of incentives to produce. It is for this reason that the Russian government is looking for western support of about Dollars 5bn for currency stabilisation. Also sought are Dollars 6bn in humanitarian assistance and a similar sum for imports to keep the factories running. Finally, the government seeks further relief on debt service. Unfortunately, Russia is unlikely to receive what it needs and, least of all, to receive it in time. The group of seven leading industrial countries has preferred to wait for the International Monetary Fund. But even if everything were to go perfectly, membership of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States would only be discussed by the IMF board in mid-April. It would then take until late May, at the earliest, before they could join the IMF and until late summer before the first lending operation. Likely delays Even this timetable could prove too optimistic. The G7 is talking of a combined CIS quota of 4.5 per cent of the total. But the Russian government wants more than the 2 to 2.5 per cent that would be its likely share. Given this disagreement, further delay is perfectly likely. A far better course would be for the G7 to provide the funds itself, while using the IMF as its executive arm. By imposing clear conditions in this way, the donors should be able to assuage their understandable doubts about the ability of the Russian government to carry the programme through. By providing assistance, however, they would increase the government's effectiveness, above all by supplying it with leverage over the recalcitrant forces ranged against it. Even with G7 support, Russia's reforms could fail; and even without it, they might succeed. But assistance must make success more likely. Equally certain are the benefits that would accrue to the world as a whole if Russia's economy were to be reformed. When what is at stake is a mere Dollars 20bn or so, about a twentieth of what the west spent to defend itself against the Soviet Union in one year, the ratio of probable reward to certain cost is overwhelmingly in favour of the former. Throughout the Gorbachev era, the west complained that he did too little and acted too late. If the west does not act decisively in the next few weeks, it will be judged guilty of precisely the same mistake.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> REAGAN MAKING LAST STAB AT SELLING NAVAL OIL RESERVE  </P> <P> President Reagan is making one last stab at selling off the Naval Petroleum  Reserve, telling Congress to unload it or else.  </P> <P> After eight years of trying unsuccessfully to persuade Congress that the  government should get out of the oil business, Reagan in his final budget this  week tied the sale of the reserves to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  </P> <P> "He is telling Congress that if they don't sell (the Naval Petroleum Reserve),  they had better find the money somewhere else to fill up the SPR," a  congressional staffer said.  </P> <P> The Reagan proposal will be endorsed by President-elect Bush when he takes over  later this month, Administration sources said.  </P> <P> The White House plan calls for the sale in fiscal year 1990 of the Naval  Petroleum Reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo., for a bonus  payment of $1 billion. Under the proposed terms, the purchaser would be  required to deliver 50,000 barrels per day for five years to the SPR salt domes  along the Gulf Coast. Additionally, the buyer would also have to provide 10  million barrels of oil to a newly established Defense Petroleum Reserve.  </P> <P> If Congress balks at selling the Naval Reserves, so-called because they were  established to keep Navy ships in fuel in emergencies, the SPR would be filled  at a rate of only 22,000 barrels a day in fiscal 1990 under Reagan's plan since  the Energy Department would get only $127 million for this purpose.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As is discussed below in Section II.c., EPA cannot at this time make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that each set of CARB standards is, in the aggregate, at least as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective as the federal standards that apply to CFVs. Therefore, this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgates the emission standards and requirements for CFVs found in sections 242  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 243 of the CAA. EPA's reasoning to support this conclusion is included in Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II.c.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, CAA section 244 provides requirements regarding the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement of CFV exhaust emission standards. In the event that numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards for CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR are the same under the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and California LEV program, EPA is to administer and enforce those standards in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same manner and with the same flexibility as CARB does under the California LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. This requires utilizing the same interpretations and policy judgments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including, but not limited to, requirements regarding certification, production-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, and in-use compliance. The application of California's administration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement practices does not depend on whether EPA replaces federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements with California requirements under section 243(e). If the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that adopting California's administration and enforcement approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not meet the criteria for a waiver under section 209, then federal administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement procedures and interpretations would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CARB's Low-Emission Vehicle Standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to CAA section 209, the State of California applied to EPA for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver on October 4, 1991 for its ``Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations''. EPA granted the waiver on January 7, 1993 (58 FR 4166, January 13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993). (Although states are generally preempted by CAA section 209 from adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own motor vehicle standards, California may adopt its own standards provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA waivers the preemption provision of section 209.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's regulations establish four new levels of vehicle emission standards, termed ``vehicle emission categories'', for LDVs, LDTs, and medium-duty trucks (MDTs). <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  These new standards are effective with 1994 model year vehicles. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The California emission categories are, in order of increasing stringency: TLEV (Transitional Low Emission Vehicle); LEV (Low Emission Vehicle); ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle); and ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle). The TLEV exhaust emission standards for NMOG, CO, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , PM, and HCHO are identical to the federal Phase I CFV standards described above. The LEV exhaust emission standards are identical to the federal Phase II CFV standards. The California ULEV and ZEV standards are the same as the federal ULEV and ZEV categories, established for purposes of the CFF and Pilot program credit programs. CARB defines a ZEV as: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The medium-duty truck class is a vehicle class unique to CARB and includes trucks between 6,000 and 14,000 lbs GVWR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See CARB's Proposed Regulations for Low-Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels, Staff Report, available in EPA Air Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;any vehicle which is certified *&blank;*&blank;* to produce zero emissions of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria pollutants under any and all possible operational modes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. A ZEV may be equipped with a fuel fired heater provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the fuel fired heater cannot be operated at ambient temperatures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and the heater is demonstrated to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zero evaporative emissions under any and all possible operational modes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conditions. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> California Code of Regualtions, Title 13, Definitions Section, Paragraph 15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CARB is allowing the use of intermediate in-use compliance standards that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to facilitate compliance by vehicle manufacturers. These in-use standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are numerically half way between the certification standards of the new emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category and the old emission category (e.g., half way between TLEV and LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards). These intermediate standards will be effective through MY 1995 for TLEVs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and through MY 1998 for LEVs and ULEVs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparison of CAA and CARB Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, CAA section 243(e) provides that CARB's standards shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace the federal CFV and other motor vehicle standards if the CARB standards are,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. While EPA believes that Congress preferred that the statutory standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be replaced with the CARB standards, EPA cannot at this time make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that CARB standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal standards. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, EPA is at this time establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal standards that will apply to CFVs in the CFF and Pilot program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the proposal, EPA believes that section 243(e)(2) requires a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate comparison of federal Phase I and Phase II standards to CARB standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the least stringent set of federal CFV standards (the Phase I standards), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate comparison is to the least stringent set of California CFV standards (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TLEV standards). Similarly, the appropriate comparison for the federal Phase II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is with the California LEV standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Phase I standards will apply to the Pilot program in the 1996 MY. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase II standards will apply to the CFF program in the 1998 MY, and to the Pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in the 2001 MY. Therefore, the federal Phase I standards will not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any federal CFV program after MY 2001. For this reason, EPA considers the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California LEV standards to be the least stringent set of qualifying California standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after MY 2001, and currently intends to apply the California LEV standard to the CFF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Pilot programs at that time if replacement of the federal Phase II standards is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted under section 243(e)(2). EPA requested comment in the proposal on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of the CAA and no adverse comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

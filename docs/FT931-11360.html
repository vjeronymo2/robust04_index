			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Polluters may monitor themselves: Environment INDUSTRY could be allowed to monitor its own pollution, under yesterday's proposals for cutting through environmental red tape. Environmentalists attacked the suggestion by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, that the pollution inspectorate could supervise industrial discharges by taking 'sample audits' of a few companies. Mr Andrew Lees of Friends of the Earth, the campaign group, said: 'Lifting the burden of regulation is good for chaos, not good for business. Regulation creates a level playing field and rewards companies which strive towards higher environmental standards.' The 1990 Environmental Protection Act, under a framework known as Integrated Pollution Control, requires some industries to demonstrate to the inspectorate they are using the best environmental technology that is also economic. Mr Lees said Mr Howard's statement was 'compromising' the case-by-case approach because the pollution inspectorate was 'so under-resourced'. The environment department also plans to simplify the planning system 'to reduce the burden on businesses' and Mr Howard believes it should give designers and building control authorities 'greater flexibility' too. The department intends to abolish the legal definition of architects, after a report by the Architects Registration Council of the UK concluded that statutory registration had 'brought no added benefit to the public, to consumers, or to the profession'. The Ministry of Agriculture is planning a deregulation, programme, including reform of land tenure, with legislation, possibly in the next session of Parliament.</p>

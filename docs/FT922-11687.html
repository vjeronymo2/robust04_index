			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Letter: Bookmakers closer than the polls Sir, Much has been written recently about opinion polls, and during the weeks prior to the election our lives were governed by them. Some people say the conclusions of opinion polls are so inaccurate that they should not be taken seriously. My letter to you is written as a bookmaker running one of the larger betting shop businesses in the country. I believe that the odds the bookmakers quoted were much more accurate than the variety of margins given by so many different opinion polls. On the morning of the election, most bookmakers had the Conservatives as slight favourites, which was a good indication and so much more accurate than either the opinion polls or the exit polls. Carrying my profession a little bit further forward, I believe opinion polls can influence electors, and also believe that if they are not stopped entirely, they should certainly not be permitted during the last few weeks of an election campaign.

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: IT invasion of eastern Europe - Technically Speaking THE dilemma facing the east European states is an uncomfortable one. Beset with problems over food supply, galloping inflation, rising unemployment and the collapse of foreign currency earnings, they are struggling to enter the world free market and compete on an equal footing with western nations. However, to compete they must have internal infrastructures that allow them some sort of parity with their trading partners. At present, these infrastructures simply do not exist. The dilemma is evident: countries must either invest large sums of precious foreign currency and update their information technology systems to create fundamental necessities such as efficient banking systems, or forego such expenditure and address their chronic social problems. It is an unenviable decision. The east European states really have no choice - they have to look to the future and make funds available for IT to develop the infrastructures needed to build a modern capitalist state. The experience of Germany in its drive to make reunification work illustrates the problem perfectly. How can companies in former East Germany hope to match their counterparts from the west in terms of efficiency if they still rely, for example, on antiquated billing methods for customers? Until this is changed, west German business will continue to be leaner, more efficient and more profitable because of its more advanced IT-based systems. The argument for investment in effective IT is just as valid at the macro level of the country as for businesses within it. To give an example: without the effective collection of funds from taxation that IT systems allow, public expenditure will be limited. If a state's revenue stream is low, it will not be able to afford vital infrastructures such as road and railway networks. In short, it is precisely the application of appropriate technology solutions that will help guarantee a stable economy and prosperous future for central and eastern Europe. The new states have recognised this and are now prepared to invest in IT infrastructure projects in the belief that they will reap the benefits. Understandably, the actual payment for the technology is a central issue for all the east European countries. But it need not be as difficult as might first appear. For instance, grants, particularly for government projects, are relatively easy to secure from international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and EC. Clearly, the installation of hardware systems is not the end of the story. It is also not simply a matter of dumping cheap or obsolete hardware - as some have tried to do - on countries where IT skills are in relatively short supply and where computer literacy, which the west now takes for granted, is not highly advanced. Instead, a more strategic and consultative approach is required. Perhaps it is a simplistic analogy, but I often use a comparison with Rip Van Winkle when discussing the east European states because they too have, figuratively, been asleep for a number of years and are only now just waking up. This dormancy and isolation has meant that, typically, they hold little knowledge of modern IT. They know what they want it to do for them but do not appreciate exactly how to achieve the results. It is, therefore, the responsibility of western IT suppliers not only to sell the solutions that will help create future prosperity, but also to give comprehensive guidance on how these solutions can be used most effectively. The reality is that without the introduction of IT, east European countries will not be able to enter the world economy as equal partners. Using IT to build an infrastructure capable of rebuilding economies shackled by decades of state control will allow these countries to generate wealth and play a competitive role in the world market.

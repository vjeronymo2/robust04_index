			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: Babi Yar &amp; Busqueda - Concerts Steve Martland and James MacMillan (both b. 1959) are two of the most prominent and assertive young voices of British music. On two successive evenings, last weekend, each was the figurehead composer to launch two important and exciting new musical initiatives at the Festival Hall. Such juxtapositions, no doubt coincidental, encourage the making of too-easy critical comparisons, convenient but unnatural linkages; nevertheless, there are similarities in the use of these two compositional voices which seem both elating and disturbing. Both insist on the social dimension of their music, on its popular-culture roots, on their abhorrence of the ivory-tower composer remote from 'real life'. These two London premieres made all those points. Martland's Babi Yar, given on Sunday by the BBC Symphony under Andrew Davis (and also broadcast on Radio 3), was first heard - amid strong controversy - in Liverpool in 1985. It is a 35-minute assault on polite audience sensibilities, by a composer whose enrage image is carefully cultivated (by, for instance, his appearance on the Festival Hall platform in braces and bovver-boots), and whose stated belief is that 'one of the functions of art is confronting reality. Maybe that's why this music is often so aggressive - and loud]' Indeed. The idiom builds hard-piled sonorities (including synthesizer and vast batteries of brass and percussion) into chordal battering-rams. After a long-sustained start their attack proves increasingly violent, as their pounding impact is developed into a kind of machine-process that grinds on unrelentingly. (Although the orchestra is divided into three ensembles, the effect for much of the way is essentially of unison.) Eventually, the machine winds down, and in its aftermath four horn players - who take up stations ever further from the orchestral platform - regularly sound out fanfares possessed of an 'individual-voice' (though hardly lyrical) character. Babi Yar, Martland's first (and so far only) composition for large orchestra, has no artistic relationship with either the famous Yevtushenko poem or its symphony-setting by Shostakovich. The title is used as 'metaphor for . . . infamy'; and the music is intended as a disquisition on human iniquity and violence with the affirmation of a 'fragile hope' as its epilogue. The rebarbative denseness and monotony of the scoring were admitted by Martland (in a disarming pre-performance podium conversation with Nicholas Kenyon, Radio Three chief); he has learned to restrain his forces since then. The strongest assets of the work are a large-scale vision, starkly dramatic, and a deep-rooted musicality which enables so much of it to be established in purely musical terms. The general weaknesses - repetitiveness, monotony - seem to result from Martland's belief that impassioned vociferation, emotional slamming-home of points, can legitimately take the place of reasoned argument. A similar general criticism may perhaps be permitted of MacMillan's music-theatre piece Busqueda (1988), given the previous evening by 17 players from the Philharmonia under the composer himself. Using a speaker (Diana Quick), an octet of supporting actors and a trio of female singers, he laces together poems written by the mothers of the Argentinian 'disappeared ones' and quotations from the Latin Mass ordinary; the text is layered above a continuous musical form drawing on various 'popular' sources (including Scottish folk) subjected to various kinds of transformation. MacMillan has a native gift for musical drama. The most affecting parts of Busqueda - apart, that is, from the poems themselves, heart-rendingly direct in their impact - are the quietly and beautifully tender interweavings between small groups of instrumental and human voices. But the louder and more forceful dramatic gestures seem not the less obvious for being heartfelt: the climax of the piece combines ugly amplified group shouting and triple-fortissimo in the manner of poster art. Babi Yar was the first item in a concert (also including Britten's Four Sea Interludes and Vaughan Williams's Fourth Symphony) that was itself first in the BBC Symphony's new 'British Line' series. The tickets are single-price (low), the seats unreserved, and the presentation betokens a new user-friendly attitude that may well succeed in boosting audience numbers for the BBC Symphony's South Bank concerts. Busqueda formed an early-evening overture to the Philharmonia's Dream of Gerontius (movingly conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov, and superbly played and sung); it also formed the first of the orchestra's excellent new 'Music of Today' series, of which MacMillan is artistic director.

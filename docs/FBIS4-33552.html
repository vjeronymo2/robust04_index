			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Jun (AFP) -- Talking to reporters  in Santo Domingo on Tuesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio  Herrera Cabral urged the United Nations to provide a list of  supplies exempted from the embargo imposed on the Haitian  military regime in order to avoid a "genocide."    Herrera Cabral said that if the absolute blockade is  maintained along the border between the Dominican Republic and  Haiti, "an induced and announced genocide" would be fostered.  The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of  Hispaniola.    Until recently, food, medicine, and other goods for stores  and factories flowed from the Dominican Republic into Haiti  despite the embargo ordered by the United Nations to force the  ousting of the military and the return of President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was toppled on 30 September 1991.    A systematic contraband supply of gasoline joined those  "humanitarian" supplies along the Haitian border, prompting  Washington and the United Nations to pressure Dominican  President Joaquin Balaguer to make effective the total closure  of the border posts. Balaguer agreed and since then a military  cordon along the border strip, measuring 300 km in length, has  been set established.    Herrera Cabral said he discussed the matter with Balaguer  but  declined to comment on the outcome of the meeting with the  president, who is a steadfast opponent of the embargo for fear  of a massive invasion of Haitians into the Dominican Republic.    Reports from the border area indicate that hundreds of  Haitians living in nearby villages try to cross the border every  day to obtain supplies in Dominican stores. Until now, the  Dominican controls along the border have resulted in the death  of one Haitian at the hands of a Dominican soldier.    The deputy foreign minister said UN negotiator Dante Caputo  promised to provide the Dominican authorities a list of the  products that may be sent to Haiti, but the Dominican Foreign  Ministry has yet to receive it. "There is a quantity of food  ready to be sent to Haiti, and I hope that the matter is  resolved today or tomorrow," Herrera Cabral stated. The  official warned that "the time will come when the patience of  armed soldiers will not let Haitians have an open field because  that would be dangerous for the country."    He concluded by saying he did not know the date of the  arrival of a mission of UN observers and logistical support,  including U.S. helicopters, to monitor compliance with the  embargo along the border.</p>

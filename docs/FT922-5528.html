			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Morland's bid defence bolstered by large holder THE ATTEMPT by Morland, the Oxfordshire-based brewery, to maintain its independence in the face of a Pounds 104m hostile bid from Greene King was helped yesterday by a statement from one of its large institutional shareholders. Royal Insurance Asset Management, which holds 7.7 per cent of Morland's shares, said it would reject the offer which it said 'considerably undervalues the future prospects of the company'. Mr Michael Taylor, head of RIAM's UK equities, said Morland was a strong independent brewing company. It was well managed and had done a good deal in buying 100 pubs from Courage last year. 'The offer is on the low side.' He believed that there was an element of 'forced sale' on the part of Whitbread Investment Company, which had to reduce its 43.4 per cent stake in Morland to satisfy Monopolies and Mergers Commission requirements. WIC has sold a 28.5 per cent holding to Greene King for accept the offer for its remaining 14.9 per cent. Hence Morland's welcome for Royal's support. Greene King, which produces Abbot and IPA ales, issued its offer document on Thursday. The terms of the paper offer are nine convertible preference shares for every two Morland ordinary, valuing the target's shares at about 490p each, compared with yesterday's 485p. There is a cash alternative of 450p. The offer is final unless a rival emerges and Mr Simon Redman, chairman, said yesterday that one would have done so by now as WIC's need to sell shares had been known for some time. He also expressed surprise at Royal making a decision at this stage, before full details had been given by both sides. The offer document points to the premiums over prices prevailing for Morland earlier this year, a historic multiple of 20 to 21 times earnings and also questions the values Morland attached to its pubs. It claims Morland's brands, which include Old Speckled Hen, are weak and has said it would close the Abingdon brewery. Morland, which will issue its defence document within the next seven days, described the attempt to find weakness in its business as futile.</p>

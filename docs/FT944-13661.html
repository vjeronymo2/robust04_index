			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Minister quits to party relief and surprise There was a palpable sense of relief among Conservative MPs yesterday as the news spread that Mr Neil Hamilton had agreed to resign as corporate affairs minister. But there was astonishment when the reason was announced. Until Mr John Major started his statement to the Commons at 3.30pm it was widely assumed that Mr Hamilton had been forced to resign because of a defiant statement issued to local newspapers in Cheshire. The prime minister's revelation that he had agreed to resign because the impact of fresh allegations made on Monday 'disables him from carrying out his responsibilities' stunned MPs on both sides of the House. Mr Hamilton, a colourful rightwinger, had earlier appeared determined to fight on against allegations that he asked Commons questions for Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods, in return for cash and a week at the Paris Ritz. Mr Hamilton said in his statement: 'Since my appointment as a DTI minister I have sought to undertake my responsibilities with scrupulous integrity and I am dismayed by and resent these wild and false accusations.' He said he had asked just three parliamentary questions relating to Mr Fayed's House of Fraser and three relating to Lonrho - which had also sought to purchase Harrods - after the trip to the Ritz. The questions were prompted by a long-standing interest in competition policy and 'my sympathy for House of Fraser's position', he said. Mr Hamilton said he was advised when he became corporate affairs minister in 1992 that there was no legal reason why he should not perform ministerial functions in relation to House of Fraser. But 'in view of my partisan involvement . . . I specifically instructed my officials that they were not to show me any papers relevant to the House of Fraser, not to involve me in meetings, and to have any ministerial decisions made by other ministers', he said. Mr Hamilton's comments on the allegations were regarded by most Tory MPs as typically robust. But there was widespread dismay and embarrassment about his reasons for refusing to leave office to pursue a libel action against The Guardian. He said: 'Of course I could resign and fight a libel action from the back benches. But the same argument could have applied to the prime minister in respect of his action against the scurrilous Scallywag magazine, or against other ministers who have fought libel actions. 'There is no reason whatsoever why a minister of the crown should not remain in office whilst undertaking libel proceedings. Indeed the prime minister did just that - and quite rightly so,' he said. 'In Britain, it is the established principle that a person is innocent unless proved guilty. It is for the courts to decide upon these matters, not the media or indeed anyone else.' This appeared to have sealed Mr Hamilton's fate as a minister. In particular, Tory MPs were aghast at his reference to Mr Major's successful libel action against the New Statesman magazine, which reported unfounded allegations in Scallywag that the prime minister had had an affair with a Downing Street caterer, Ms Clare Latimer. When it emerged in mid-morning that Mr Hamilton had cancelled an engagement and was returning to London, it was widely assumed that he was about to be sacked for issuing the statement without government approval. In fact, Mr Hamilton had been called not to Number 10 but to Number 12 Downing Street, the home of Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip. He was informed of the fresh allegations and agreed immediately to step down.</p>

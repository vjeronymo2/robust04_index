			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Algiers, 12 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has warned that Israel's nonadherence to a faithful and  meticulous implementation of its agreement with the Palestinians  will lead to general disorder in the region. He pointed out  that the Palestinians will not be the only party to lose from  this disorder. He said that failing to implement the agreement  will have a serious impact on the overall regional situation.    In an interview with the Algerian newspaper AL-SHA'B  published today, 'Arafat announced that the world must know that  this agreement is not merely a Palestinian-Israeli agreement,  because it was signed by the U.S. secretary of state and the  Russian foreign minister representing the sponsor countries and  supervised by President Clinton.    'Arafat voiced regret that the peace sponsors have failed to  act.    He reiterated his praise of the Egyptian role in promoting  the peace process, declaring that it helped to resume the  negotiations after they reached a deadlock in Oslo, Paris, and  Cairo.    'Arafat hinted that Israel obtained full reward from the  United States in return for signing the agreement, illustrated  by fresh supplies of modern weapons, the largest computer in the  world, "the giant computer," $240 million to cover its  redeployment costs, and $10 billion in loan guarantees. Noting  that it also obtained recognition by various countries, most  recently the Vatican, he said it is now seeking to avoid what it  has signed after getting the reward.    'Arafat remarked that the negotiations reached a deadlock  because of Israel's ploys and its erroneous interpretations of  the agreement's clauses. He explained that the Israelis  maintain that withdrawal means redeployment and want to control  the border crossings on the pretext of protecting their external  security, which would mean that the Palestinians would live in  "Bantustans," something that is unacceptable.    'Arafat continued: The Israelis cannot set traps for us. We  know how to deal with these issues. We tell them that if they  believe they can shirk implementing the agreement, then the  region will go up in flames.    He pointed out that the attempt to resume settlement  activity  in Jerusalem with the Israeli Government's total support  violates the agreement.    'Arafat remarked: They want to change Jerusalem's landmarks  to make it Jewish. I say it belongs to Muslims and Christians  everywhere. This is the first Qiblah [direction in which  Muslims turn to pray] and the third holy mosque.    Commenting on the forthcoming summit between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton, 'Arafat said it seeks to reach an agreement  on the Golan Heights and Lebanon and that it will carry no  surprises.    Asked about inter-PLO relations, 'Arafat explained that the  Palestinian democratic model is known. Every party, he said,  has the right to express its view.    He added: We are dealing with each other well. No one  should try to outbid the Palestinian sacrifices in blood.    He declared: We have endorsed pluralism and democracy. We  defend them and fight for their sake. In this context, every  party can express its views.    Asked if the Israeli stance might be backed by some Arab  parties, 'Arafat said it could be, because the Israelis are  trying to benefit from inter-Arab differences.    The Palestinian president revealed that the Palestinian  leadership expected Israel to try to back away from the  Washington agreement, noting that the first sign of a retraction  occurred during the Israeli election, which brought down Shamir  and his political program.    'Arafat declared that when he concluded an agreement with  the  Israelis he meant a "peace of the brave," adding that if they  don't understand what "the peace of the brave" means, then there  are many ways of making them understand.</p>

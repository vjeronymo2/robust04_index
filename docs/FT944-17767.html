			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Swiss investors warm to Sudelektra - The group's shares have soared in the past year It took Swiss investors a while to get to like Sudelektra, the industrial holding company controlled by Glencore International, formerly Marc Rich &amp; Co. But in the past nine months, they have made the company one of Switzerland's best performing stocks. Sudelektra shares, which were split two-for-one on Monday, have soared to SFr895 from SFr370 at the end of last year. The main attraction, apart from a sharp improvement in recent earnings, is the potential for synergy between Glencore and Sudelektra. Glencore is primarily a commodity trader, but since 1985 it has invested more in the production of the raw materials and commodities it sells. Now it has decided that any further industrial assets it takes on will be put into Sudelektra. Mr Willy Strothotte, chairman of both companies, says the ownership of commodity production can be an advantage to a trader. 'It elevates you to a different level of co-operation with your trade partners,' he says. He cites the example of stainless steelmakers, who need a reliable supply of ferrochrome. They are more likely to establish a long-term contractual relationship with a trader that has some captive capacity, he argues. For Sudelektra, which has just taken over a South African chrome mine and ferrochrome smelter from Glencore, being associated with one of the world's best commodity marketers should yield considerable benefits. For one thing, it enables the mine and plant managers to concentrate solely on production. Glencore traders assure the supply of raw materials they need and the sales of the output. And, since Glencore looks for long-term sales contracts, Sudelektra should be a less volatile performer than other producers. 'We try for a steady return rather than to pick the top of the cycle,' Mr Strothotte says. Finally, Glencore's worldwide market presence and industrial intelligence helps Sudelektra to spot potential acquisitions. All this is a long way from Sudelektra's beginnings in 1926 when it was set up by Swiss investors to finance infrastructure projects in South America. After the second world war, electric power projects in Peru and Argentina in which it was involved were nationalised, converting the company perforce into an investment fund. Marc Rich bought a 53 per cent stake from Union Bank of Switzerland in 1990, saying it would turn Sudelektra into an industrial holding company. Investors were either unimpressed or took little notice, because the shares scarcely reacted to this change of control and direction. Nor did they move after the company announced its first large industrial investment - a 35 per cent stake in the Santa Cruz petroleum and natural gas project in Argentina for Dollars 27m in December 1991. A year later, Mr Marc Rich revealed that the property was producing 5,000 barrels of oil and 30m cubic feet of gas a day from 50 wells. Sudelektra had recovered over a fifth of its investment, he said, and potential reserves were much larger than initially anticipated. Still the shares remained in the doldrums. In fairness, net income in the year to 30 April 1993 at SFr17.4m (Dollars 13.5m) was not much higher than the SFr14.8m recorded two years earlier. The balance sheet had doubled to SFr187.9m, but much of that was due to the publication of consolidated figures and the realisation of capital gains, as well as the Santa Cruz cash flow. Then in November of last year, the group forecast that it would report a marked increase in profits in the year to April 1994. By the time it revealed in early June that its 1993-94 net income was over SFr28m, a 65 per cent advance, the shares were trading at SFr1,320. It launched a two-for-one rights issue at SFr1,000 to raise SFr150m to finance the purchase of two industrial properties developed by Glencore. One, Chromecorp Technology, operates a South African chrome smelter with its own mine and the other, Forestal del Sur in Chile, produces wood chips. Mr Strothotte says Sudelektra will only invest in producing commodities that Glencore trades, and that the scale of its production will be well within Glencore's trading volumes. He points out that Sudelektra is debt-free, has Dollars 100m in liquid funds in its war chest and further authorised capital of SFr170m.</p>

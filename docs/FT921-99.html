			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Clinton's smoke draws little fire THE two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have finally agreed on something. Mr Jerry Brown asserted on Sunday night that Mr Bill Clinton's confessed use of marijuana while a student at Oxford in the late 1960s was 'not relevant' to the current campaign. In response to a question in a televised debate shown in New York, which holds its primary a week from today, Mr Clinton said: 'When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it, and I didn't inhale and I never tried it again.' He added he had never broken any US state drugs law. Mr Brown, appearing via satellite from Wisconsin, said he had never used marijuana but went on: 'I agree with Clinton, why don't you lay off this stuff? What you did 20 years ago is not relevant.' There was some criticism yesterday that Mr Clinton had chosen to defend himself on the narrow grounds that he had broken no US law, not mentioning that smoking marijuana was still illegal in Britain. A more general concern for the Arkansas governor may be the extent to which his admission reinforces other well-aired doubts about his 'character' - less among his generation but more among older Americans to whom the 'sex, drugs and rock n'roll' revolution always was unpalatable. His confession attracted front-page treatment yesterday in the mainstream media, with the New York tabloids typically having a field day.</p>

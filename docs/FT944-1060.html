			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mortgage element has a role in prices index Sir, As he indicated in his article 'How to miss on the inflation target' (December 19), since he joined the Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee two and a half years ago Samuel Brittan has strongly advocated the removal of mortgage interest payments from the index. After reviewing all the arguments, including consideration of papers by distinguished academics, the majority of the committee took the opposite point of view, one factor being the unique role played by mortgage interest payments in the structure of housing finance in Britain. We are proposing to continue this, somewhat modified, to give greater weight to new house prices. In other words, Samuel Brittan lost the argument, partly because he refused  -and still does - to address the strengths of the case for the mortgage interest payments system. The advisory committee has for many years been responsible for modifications to the index - most recently, for example, designing a formula to cover holidays abroad - and the index undoubtedly has very wide acceptance. Unlike its equivalent in a number of OECD countries - and indeed unlike the unemployment statistics in the UK (which are not reviewed by an advisory committee such as the RPlAC) - the RPI has not been a source of political controversy in Britain. Long may that remain so. It is a fact of life that the RPI is used for a wide range of different purposes. By a process akin the Darwinian survival of the fittest, it has seen off other media inspired indices - just the sort of process which Samuel Brittan would normally describe as the proper result of market forces.

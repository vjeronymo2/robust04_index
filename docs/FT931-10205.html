			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Business as usual for Euro-free Swiss: Fears of splendid mountain isolation proved unfounded FOR THOSE who believe that markets are always right, the Swiss made a brilliant decision last December in rejecting a plan to move closer to the European Community. Since the no-vote in the referendum on joining the European Economic Area (EEA), and contrary to the expectations of most analysts, the stock market has risen more than 10 per cent. Swiss interest rates have fallen by more than a point, the Swiss franc is firm and flight capital is flooding back into the country. Even shares of middle-sized, export-intensive machinery companies, which many said would be hard hit if the country excluded itself from the European single market, have performed well. Government and business leaders remain worried about the dangers of isolation. Swiss scientists have already received letters from Brussels advising them that they must abandon their seats on European project planning committees. Swissair, the national airline, is suddenly contemplating mergers with EEA-based airlines to ensure it retains fair access to airports in EC cities. And exporters fear that customs officials in EC countries will deliberately entangle incoming Swiss goods in red tape. But for the moment, the predominant sentiment in most quarters appears to be a puzzled relief that the negative vote has not yet brought any negative consequences. Apart from economic worries, there was, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, concern about the sharp divide it exposed between French-speaking Swiss, who massively supported the EAA, and German and Italian speakers, who opposed it. There were comical scenes in parliament in December with anxious German speakers trying to assuage their fellow citizens by deliberately speaking stilted French. The federal government quickly promised more motorway construction in Romandy and civic leaders in Lucerne launched a 'Salut les Romands' programme, inviting French Swiss to stay in the city's hotels for half price. While the linguistic cleavage remains worrying, it has been softened somewhat by closer analysis of the voting, revealing that the German and Italian Swiss were not giving vent to any anti-Romand sentiment. It was rather a case of still not wanting to get too close to their formerly belligerent neighbours, Germany and Italy. There were also important divisions between city and country - all the main cities in German-speaking Switzerland produced majorities in favour of the EEA - and between those, such as farmers and merchants, who benefit from subsidies and other forms of protection from foreign competition, and those who do not. Perhaps the surprise, one western diplomat said this week, is that so many Swiss - only a fraction under 50 per cent - voted in favour of the EEA. A couple of years ago, the notion that Switzerland should move closer to the EC would have been overwhelmingly rejected. As recently as 1986, a majority vetoed a government recommendation that the country join the United Nations. The relative strength of the pro-European vote is one reason the government feels it need not jettison its pro-EC integration policy. Mr Adolf Ogi, the president, has flatly refused the demand of Mr Christoph Blocher, the charismatic anti-EC leader, that the country's application to join the EC itself be withdrawn, even though he admits that it is unlikely to be acted upon for several years. The government's strategy now is unilaterally to take the steps to bring Swiss law and practices into harmony with those of the EC that it would have had to do if it joined the EEA. It hopes that neighbouring countries will recognise these moves and that Swiss people and exporters will not face discrimination in EEA countries. But it is unlikely that the so-called Eurolex package of some 60 measures will pass intact. Car dealers, construction contractors and scores of other entrepreneurs who benefit from high levels of protection will fight it all the way. Bern will also seek bilateral negotiations with the EC on the most pressing matters, such as air traffic and some technical trade issues. But Swiss officials are under no illusions about the difficulties they face. As representatives of a small country, they have little bargaining power with the EC. They will not even be able to complain publicly if Brussels is intransigent for fear of reinforcing anti-EC sentiment among the Swiss public. For their part, EC officials have made clear that they are not willing to negotiate a bespoke EEA just for Switzerland. On the political front, EEA advocates have already launched petition campaigns to oblige the government to hold another referendum in the near future. But even strongly pro-EC political leaders agree that it would be insulting to the people to stage another referendum quickly, and the result would probably be counter-productive, not just in Switzerland, but also in Europe. 'We think that Europe cannot afford any more negative votes,' says Mr Bruno Spinner, head of the government's integration bureau. Cynics say that the next vote should not be held until unemployment, already at post-war record levels, has become much worse and several Swiss companies have announced plans to shift production to EC countries. But all this is hypothetical. Swiss financial markets are in fine shape and economists are beginning to talk about an economic recovery late in the year. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust and a former central bank economist, shrugs off exporters' worries. He points to the remarkable recovery of the watch industry in the past decade and concludes, 'Swiss manufacturers always perform well under pressure.' If he turns out to be right, the need and the desire to move closer to the EC could recede indefinitely.</p>

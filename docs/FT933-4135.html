			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / N Korea rejects N-talks Negotiations to resolve suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme reached an apparent impasse yesterday after Pyongyang rejected talks on the issue with Seoul, writes John Burton in Seoul. North Korea said it would not hold discussions with South Korea until Seoul accepted conditions it has already rejected. The demands from Pyongyang include Seoul ending military exercises with the US. It also says it wants South Korea to stop seeking international co-operation on the nuclear issue, apparently to isolate Seoul from US support. Seoul wants to conduct mutual nuclear inspections, which the two Koreas agreed to conduct when they signed a non-nuclear pact in late 1991.</p>

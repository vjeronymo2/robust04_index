			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock in Pounds 50m flotation HOZELOCK, the manufacturer of garden equipment, is to be floated on the stock market in November at an estimated value of Pounds 50m. The company, which is forecasting a 30 per cent increase in operating profits from Pounds 3.8m in the 12 months to September 25 1992 to Pounds 5m this year, hopes to raise up to Pounds 20m to fund expansion and reduce gearing. Mr David Codling, managing director, said the company needed to come to the market to strengthen its balance sheet. The proceeds will repay bank loans and redeem existing preference shares. 'Our aim is to raise enough capital to have very conservative gearing, so that if an acquisition came along we wouldn't have to go back to the bank,' Mr Codling said. He expected many of Hozelock's customers in the UK, where the market in garden products is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 1.5bn, to become investors. Sales to such customers have grown by more than 10 per cent a year since a Pounds 24m management buy-out from Ropner in 1990. This year turnover is expected to grow to Pounds 32m, against Pounds 27.3m last time. Although the proportion of the share capital coming to the market has yet to be finalised, the team of 20 executives who led the buy-out could see the total value of their shareholdings increase to Pounds 8m if the market capitalisation is set at Pounds 50m. The company hopes a listing will help it expand operations overseas, where sales this year are expected to exceed Pounds 8m. Manufacturing of the group's 300 products is due to increase next year when it moves its main plant from Aston, Birmingham, to a new Pounds 8.5m factory on the other side of the city. The flotation will be sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and James Capel will act as brokers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given]    [Text] I will by no means be partner to government  measures that would unilaterally damage the situation of  society's decisive majority, Gyula Horn, chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told MAGYAR HIRLAP. The prime  minister-designate said that equally serious problems are  waiting to be solved in all ministries.    [Szombathy] After the signing of the coalition agreement  between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you  said that you were expecting a congress of clarifying debates on  26 June. Were you surprised that there were hardly any  objections and the coalition agreement was ratified with an  overwhelming majority?    [Horn] There must be a misunderstanding here because the  ratification of the coalition agreement was the chief goal of  this congress. We made this clear at the very beginning,  indicating that it is impossible to change the text of the  agreement, that it can only be rejected or accepted. Naturally,  debates on accepting the text and on the document must not be  banned at a congress; in fact, it is actually positive to give  ground to this since this is a democratic and highest level  party forum. Many contributors expressed doubts but the  skeptical people also supported the agreement. The debates had  taken place prior to this because the coalition agreement was a  result of a very serious teamwork in the background, it was not  prepared by two or three people. In February, we were given  authorization to assert the party's program in the talks.    [Szombathy] Previously, it was said that, as opposed to the  SZDSZ delegation's mandate, the MSZP's leadership would also  have to have the list of political state secretaries approved by  the congress.    [Horn] This remark is justified but I asked the congress to  grant me some time to select the political state secretaries.  The coordination talks are under way, therefore, the congress  gave authorization, so I will submit the list of political state  secretarial names to the national board of directors. The  postponement has simple reasons: It was decided at the last  minute which party will provide the ministers and state  secretaries in the various ministries, and personnel issues were  decided at the last minute. These issues cannot be ignored when  the political state secretaries are selected. I would like the  Socialist ministers themselves to decide whom they wish as  MSZP-member state secretaries and with whom they would prefer to  work together.    [Szombathy] On 26 June, MSZP members to fill the positions  in parliamentary committees were also selected. Why did Matyas  Szuros, former Socialist chairman of the parliament, not get any  positions in any of the committees?    [Horn] The nominating committee drew up the list of names of  committee officers and members. In the course of this, Szuros  was not nominated for any of the positions. It would be good if  Szuros could, for example, think about representing or leading  the Hungarian section of the Interparliamentary Union, but this  will be his decision.    [Szombathy] It might have been noticed that Janos Hajdu,  whose running in the elections created a big stir, was not given  a position either.    [Horn] I cannot determine this because I was not part of the  nominating committee. I do not know if his name was raised at  all.    [Szombathy] You have indicated that the new government might  still have surprises when the country's economic situation is  examined. If this is so, is it possible that the government's  room for maneuver will become narrower, and can operational  problems arise? Will unpopular measures be inevitable?    [Horn] They cannot influence the government's operation -- I  did not mean these kinds of surprises -- only its room for  maneuver. I could not by any means accept measures that reduce  our popularity because, however bad the country's situation is,  it is not so catastrophic that the only solution would be  unpopular measures. There is a way out, a possibility to solve  the problems but only through emphasizing social sensitivity. I  will not by any means be a partner to any such measures that  would unilaterally damage the situation of the society's  decisive majority. On the basis of what I have learned so far,  we will not take such measures. One factor has to be taken into  consideration: The situation of citizens and their equality of  opportunity will not improve to the extent they would expect.  If they have faith in the new government then the tasks can be  resolved step by step. People can be certain that their  situation, living conditions, and sense of security will  significantly improve within four years. Achieving this would  indicate the government's successful operation.    [Szombathy] As a result of the coalition agreement, the MSZP  received a large number of ministries that control critical  areas and are interested in distribution. In your position as  prime minister, at which ministries and between which ministries  do you expect the biggest debates or crises?    [Horn] I do not think that I could name any ministries that  do not have difficulties at the moment, be it defense, industry,  or the environmental ministry. The problems are big and the  demands are huge everywhere. The expert public has great  expectations and it is difficult to meet these. All ministries  have serious problems awaiting urgent measures. The level of  these difficulties is the same in all areas and ministries.</p>

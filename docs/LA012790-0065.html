			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IRANIAN GUARDS KILL 4 HIJACKERS IN SHOOT-OUT  </P> <P> Four men armed with grenades and handguns tried to hijack an Iranian airliner  during a domestic flight, but security guards killed them in a midair  shoot-out, Iranian news reports said Friday.  </P> <P> Tehran Radio, in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia, said the gunmen tried to  seize Flight 133 on Thursday night after it took off from the city of Shiraz in  southwest Iran en route to the port city of Bandar Abbas on the Strait of  Hormuz.  </P> <P> "By the alertness and swift action of flight security guards of the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard, the four hijackers were killed and the plane landed safely  with all the passengers unhurt," the radio said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard told Tehran Radio that the hijackers  took a flight attendant hostage before the guards moved in.  </P> <P> Spokesman Alireza Afshar, who said that the hijackers had demanded to go to  Israel or Iraq, conceded that check-in procedures had been relaxed recently and  that the hijackers apparently took advantage of this and were able to smuggle  weapons aboard the plane.  </P> <P> A Revolutionary Guard statement quoted earlier by the radio described the  hijackers of the Boeing 727 as "mercenaries of America," a catch-all phrase for  opposition groups fighting to overthrow the Islamic government.  </P> <P> The gunmen were not further identified. However, a reference in the statement  that said the gunmen misused "responsibilities to search passengers" implied  they may have been dissident members of the Revolutionary Guard employed in  flight security.  </P> <P> The Revolutionary Guard, an elite paramilitary force, set up a special unit of  sky marshals in 1984 after several Iranian passenger planes were hijacked and  flown out of the country by dissident groups.  </P> <P> This special unit has since foiled 16 hijack attempts on Iran Air domestic  flights, including Thursday's, the news reports said.  </P></p>

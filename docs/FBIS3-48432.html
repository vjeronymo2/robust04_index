Branding this as a deliberate move to incite hostile  feelings  against and confrontation with the North and aggravate the  North-South relations, a MINJU CHOSON analyst says:    It is the South Korean puppets who are aggravating the  North-South relations and rendering the situation on the Korean  peninsula tense.    Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam group has staged war  exercises against the North almost every day and is crying that  in case the "Team Spirit" joint manouevres are suspended, it  would hold an integrated war game of "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" on  a larger scale with the United States.    The puppets are these days zealously resorting to  North-South  confrontation and anti-communist war racket. This is their  desperate attempt to get out of the serious crisis.    The Kim Yong-sam group, driven to an acute crisis in less  than one year after its seizure of power, seeks to divert  elsewhere the attention of the people by a more acute  North-South confrontation and frantic anti-communist war racket  and keep its power at whatever cost in reliance upon outside  forces.    North-South confrontation and war adventure, however, cannot  be a way out of the crisis. It is as foolish as jumping from  the frying pan into the fire.</p>

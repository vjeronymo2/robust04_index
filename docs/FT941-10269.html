			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sold on the back of a bus - London's public transport system is a lucrative medium To The Gap, there is nothing more attractive than the back of a bus. When the US clothing retailer moved into the British market, it was looking for an advertising medium that would reach upmarket young adults. Buying poster space on London's buses, says the company, 'gave us the appearance of owning the town'. Younger, wealthier adults were also the target of Ballygowan, the Irish spring water company, when it expanded into the UK. Beginning with a London launch, it paired a colour magazine campaign with poster advertising on London Underground. Ballygowan took 'across track' sites on the Tube - research suggests that travellers spend an average of 3.5 minutes a journey staring at tunnel walls while they wait for trains. The biggest names are also attracted to London's public transport system as an advertising medium: Coca-Cola, American Express, Nike, Nestle, Virgin Records, Marks and Spencer and IBM have all advertised on the buses, the Tube or both. A one-month campaign on the Underground is said to reach 3m adults who are heavily weighted towards the upper end of the market; the potential daily audience for London bus advertising is about 8m. Those advertisers wishing to attract the attention of tourists can concentrate resources in certain parts of town. For London Transport Advertising, the London Transport subsidiary, all this means Pounds 23m worth of business a year, making LTA, with 30 per cent of the London market, the capital's biggest poster contractor. Overall, LTA is among the UK's top four poster companies. Now LTA is up for sale: around 40 interested parties, including media companies and poster contractors in the UK and France, are thought to be studying the confidential sales information memorandum which went out last month; offers from prospective purchasers are due by mid-April and selection of the purchaser is expected by late May. Among the interested parties are the 250 staff who currently work for LTA - they have announced that they are attempting a management and employee buy-out. Brian Robinson, managing director, who is leading the buy-out, together with John Swainson, finance director, and Bob Haynes, operations director, describes the sale as a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to acquire what is one of the largest advertising franchises in the world. The buy-out team can hardly be alone in wanting to expand outside London and to start competing to sell poster advertising in other cities. Such a move, which has been difficult until now because of restrictions on London Transport's areas of operation, would enable the company to make fuller use of its sales force - one of the largest in the poster business - and advanced computer system. The most innovative of its computer facilities is the 'visualisation' system which allows potential advertisers to gauge what their posters would look like in a variety of situations, without having to tramp around stations and down tunnels. LTA has transferred video camera stills of the inside of Underground stations - complete with authentic piles of litter - on to a database. Advertisers can sit at the screen, select a station, look at the sites available within it, and even try out different sizes of poster. Above ground, there may, after all, be something more beautiful than the back of a bus. LTA is now selling the 'super rear' which is the whole back of a bus, rather than just a panel. For this 'largest, most eye-catching' site LTA says an advertiser can expect to pay a modest Pounds 200 per double-deck bus for a month.</p>

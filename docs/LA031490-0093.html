			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAIA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PLAYS TOUGH IN OPENER, 102-82  </P> <P> Bill Reynolds stood in the tunnel of Kemper Arena Tuesday night fretting over  the physical play going on down on the court.  </P> <P> "These Midwest teams are very physical, and the officials seem to be letting  them play," the Southern California College coach said.  </P> <P> "We're more of a finesse team. We're going to have to take it up a notch to be  competitive."  </P> <P> A couple of hours later, the Vanguards (26-8) had elevated their level of play  several notches in a 102-82 victory over Washburn University of Topeka, Kan.,  in the first round of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics men's  basketball tournament.  </P> <P> Washburn (20-12) won this tournament in 1987 and although the Ichabods were  unseeded, they are moving up to NCAA Division II next year, and nine of their  previous 11 losses this season were against Division-II schools.  </P> <P> The 15th-seeded Vanguards, who meet second-seeded Wisconsin Eau Claire Thursday  in the second round, shot 63% from the field in the second half to turn a 44-44  halftime tie into a rout. Forward Terry Scruggs made 12 of 17 shots from the  field -- including five of seven three-pointers -- to lead SCC with 32 points.  </P> <P> "Any game could be my last," said Scruggs, a senior, "and I'm not ready to quit  yet."  </P> <P> The difference in the game came in two spurts. The Southern California  outscored Washburn, 14-2, early in the first half to turn a 7-2 deficit into a  16-9 lead. Five minutes into the second half with the scored tied, 55-55, the  Vanguards went on a 20-2 run.  </P> <P> Washburn Coach Bob Chipman said he felt the turning point came with 14:48 to  play when 6-foot-7 Ichabod center Jeff Markray, who finished with 30 points and  11 rebounds, picked up his fourth foul.  </P></p>

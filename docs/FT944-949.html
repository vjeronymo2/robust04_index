			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Walesa attacks 'easy options' President Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday criticised the leftist government for choosing 'easy solutions' and overlooking the real problems of the people. Mr Walesa was meeting leaders of the Polish Peasant's party and the Democratic Left Alliance, comprising former communists, as well as senior members of the cabinet. The two-hour debate, broadcast live on state radio and television, focused mainly on government budget policy and public spending. Earlier in the day, Mr Walesa vetoed a government bill on public sector wages, criticised by the Solidarity trade union as not ensuring parity to wages among industrial workers. He urged the government to look for additional sources of government revenue which could enable higher public spending. However, the cabinet is pressing to have its 1995 spending plan approved by parliament by the year's end, seeing it as a basis for economic stability that would allow further reforms. Opposition leaders have also criticised the budget as inflationary and a threat to further economic growth through its excessive taxes. Mr Walesa suggested the government could find additional resources by expanding the privatisation process, which could improve the condition of many ailing state enterprises and thus increase tax revenues.</p>

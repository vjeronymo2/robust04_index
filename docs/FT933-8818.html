			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Love Lessons 1993 - Dance Prague Festival Ballet is a small group of classically trained dancers - they are members of companies at the Vienna Volksoper, in Brno and Prague - who unite for occasional performances under their rather grandiose title. The troupe's very existence serves as some indication of the quest in Eastern Europe for free (and free-enterprise) artistic ventures. They look, inevitably, to the West for examples. What shackled creativity in the unhappy past was clogged socialist realism - Soviet-style - or, rather curiously, ill-digested Bejart. The percolation of any fresher dance ideas has been slow, and hampered by few opportunities to see and absorb innovative Western work. So the concept of 'modern' ballet is often a matter of emotion rather than step: the choreographic adventures we accept as inevitable are largely unknown. Angst rather than abstraction is the norm, and an out-of-date vocabulary is burdened with themes and messages it cannot sustain in movement. This Prague troupe - returning to London after a brief visit last year  - is eager with good intentions, but sadly limited in ways of expressing them. Of three pieces on view on Wednesday, one, Silent Whispers, was devoted to folk-song and dance, and was quaint to a point far out of sight. Some of its Moravian folk-tunes were fascinating; the dance, by David Slobaspyckyj was not. The two other offerings - Mr Slobaspyckyj's Love Lessons and Alice Necsea's Serenade - were lethargic. Palm Court music for the first (including the tango Jealousy) received Palm Court dancing, ineffably winsome and distinctly un-challenging. Miss Necsea's view of a serenade by the distinguished Slovak composer Eugen Suchon was no less relaxed in its demands: the dancers behaved as if it were impolite to sweat in public. Plotless dance of this kind - which invokes in programme notes the name of Balanchine - should take heed of Mr B's question to a sluggish dancer in class: 'What are you saving yourself for?' The motto and, I believe, the duty for Western ballet is 'Go East', to help dance there find a way into the latter half of our century. Queen Elizabeth Hall.

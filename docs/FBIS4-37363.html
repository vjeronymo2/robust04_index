			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 21 (AFP) -- The  Palestinian police have arrested four PLO guerrillas, two on  charges of killing a Jewish settler last year, according to a  group of dissident fighters.    Two cousins, 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sittah, are accused by  Israel  of murdering a Gaza settler on March 8, 1993.    "We appeal to the Palestinian authority to release those who  our enemies want to kill," said the Abu-al-Rish group, named in  memory of a guerrilla killed by the Israelis after he laid down  his weapons for autonomy.    The small group is made up of fighters from the Hawks of  Fatah, the mainstream PLO movement, who decided to pursue the  armed struggle.    "Even though none of our men has carried out any acts or  crimes against the peace process, the Palestinian police has  arrested 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sitta without reason, as well as  'Ali Al-Dali et 'Abda-al-Salam Al-Qasaf," the group said in a  statement.    "It is a crime to arrest any one who gave his life for the  homeland, who resisted occupation with all his strength. We  demand their release."    The Abu-Sittas enlisted in the new police force in May but  walked out before the end of the month claiming they were not  protected against Israeli agents who wanted to kill them.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Manchester Ship lifts operating profit 23% MANCHESTER Ship Canal reported a 48 per cent fall in annual profits as an improvement in port operations along the 36-mile canal failed to offset an 85 per cent drop in income from exceptional property dealings. Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 20.7m), but the previous year's results included nearly Pounds 12m of exceptional net income from the sale of canalside land near Warrington for waste disposal. Port operating profit expanded 23 per cent to Pounds 5.25m (Pounds 4.27m) on turnover almost unchanged at Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.8m) and less tonnage handled. Mr Robert Hough, chairman, described the results as 'very satisfactory' because profits before exceptional income and expenditure were a record Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 9.55m). With property income only marginally up at Pounds 4.65m, investment income 38 per cent down at Pounds 1.43m and interest charges higher, the improvement came from better port operations, where staffing costs and operating charges have been reduced by 27 per cent in four years. About two thirds of the company's shares are now owned by Peel Holdings, whose chairman, Mr John Whittaker, took control of the canal through a private company after a bitter takeover battle in 1987. Mr Whittaker's original policy was to plough back all profits, but Manchester Ship eventually returned to the dividend list last year. The dividend is unchanged at 4.5p.</p>

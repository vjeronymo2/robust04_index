Sahay: "RSS To Stress `Swadeshi' Move"] </F>   [Text] Patna, April 18--The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  (RSS) has decided not to give top priority to the agitation  against the Dunkel draft in its programme of action for the  present. Instead, it plans to accelerate the pace of the  swadeshi movement in the country, the national RSS  chief, Mr Rajendra Singh, told a crowded news conference here  today.    He described the signing of the Dunkel draft as a symbol of  economic slavery but said the RSS did not want to deploy its  full strength to oppose it as the country was passing through  more serious crises which warranted urgent solutions. Growing  corruption and a marked deterioration had been causing immense  harm to the country. The RSS would confront these problems at  all levels in public life and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch was  educating the masses against these evils as well as helping to  counter the dangers of economic slavery of the multinationals,  he maintained.    Mr Singh reaffirmed RSS support to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad  (VHP) for the liberation of Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura. He,  however, opined that the agitation for Kashi or Mathura should  be taken up after the commencement of the temple construction  work at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. It would not be  strategically befitting to open three fronts at a time. He said  that even the socialist leader, the late Ram Manohar Lohia, had  advocated the liberation of all these religious places while  addressing the Ramayan Mela at Chitrakut in 1967-68. Mr Lohia,  he recalled, had called for launching a civil obedience movement  if the situation so warranted.    Replying to a question, Mr Singh denied that the RSS was  opposed to Muslims. The RSS, he claimed, had always been trying  to enthuse Muslims to join the shakhas but the  response was very poor. Even those who joined shakhas  had to withdraw themselves under pressure from leaders of their  community. He, however, admitted that a handful of Muslim youths  who had joined the shakhas at various places for a  brief period were not attracted by the ideology of the RSS but  by the morning drills and physical trainings.    Replying to another question, he alleged that Pakistan's  Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) with the support of some  traitors was trying to consolidate its foothold in different  parts of the country. In Kashmir, the ultras had the support of  some local disgruntled elements and hence the situation was  explosive despite the best efforts from the Indian security  forces, he said.    Mr Singh denied that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had  been distancing itself from the RSS. But at the same time the  RSS did not try to inject any political ideology into the BJP.  Both the organisations were like-minded so far as the Hindutva  and Swadeshi approach were concerned. The BJP, he said, was free  to plan any action to confront the national issues including the  Dunkel draft. The party looked upon the Ayodhya controversy as a  national issue and never as a religious issue, he added. The  pradesh RSS chief, Mr Krishna Ballabh Prasad Narayan Singh, was  also present at the conference.    In Jammu, the RSS general secretary, Mr H.V. Sheshadri,  today  said his organisation will lend full support to the Dharam  Sansad for starting a satyagraha if the Centre  failed to hand over possession of the disputed land at Ram  Janambhoomi site in Ayodhya soon.    Addressing a press conference here, Mr Sheshadri blamed the  Narasimha Rao government for delaying a decision on the issue  and of playing "vote bank politics."</p>

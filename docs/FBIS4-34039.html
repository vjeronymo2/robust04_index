			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vatican denies having signed an agreement with  the government of Judge Emile Jonassaint to supply wheat to  Haiti, contrary to what Port-au-Prince has announced. It is an  unfounded assertion, stated Vatican spokesman (Joaquin Navarro).    It should be recalled that on 13 June, the Information  Ministry announced the Vatican signed an agreement on 27 May to  supply 75,000 tons of wheat, worth $32 million, with the  provisional government of Judge Emile Jonassaint. According to  the Ministry, this agreement was signed in Italy by the foreign  minister and by Charles David for the Jonassaint government.    The Vatican's spokesman, (Joaquin Navarro), asserted,  however, that no political representative from Haiti was  received in the Vatican.</p>

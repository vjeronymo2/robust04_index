			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric] </F>   [Text] For the third day in a row, the majority of entries  in the bulletin of the Serbian Krajina army press center refers  to the activities of Krajina fighters in expelling Croatian  combatants who had attacked a section of the region of  Teslingrad in Lika. This morning, the report that the Cupovac  region has been regained was confirmed. Yesterday's report said  that what is in fact involved is the area between Jurkovic and  (Bartic) Poljana, which was briefly occupied by the Croatian  combatants. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops should have  control over it, as was precisely stated in the Vance plan.    The headquarters of the Serbian Krajina army has announced  the liberation of the (?facility) of (Trlo), also on the  Teslingrad front. In the battles, Krajina fighters suffered no  losses, but Croatian losses are claimed to be great. It is  interesting to note that Croatian radio does not report on these  battles, but has even carried reports that it is allegedly calm  on the Gospic front.    According to the press center of the Serbian Krajina army  headquarters, there have also been some Croatian Army  provocations on the (Plascan) section of the Lika front, and  attacks on Kricko and Zitnic near Drnis, as well as Otesic in  the Vrlika region. These provocations by the Croatian Army drew  a response.</p>

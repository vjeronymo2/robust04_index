			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C looks to UK for first time Foreign &amp; Colonial is launching its first purely UK-based investment trust in its 125 year history. The Income Growth Investment Trust aims to achieve long-term income growth above the rate of inflation, and capital growth greater than the FT-SE A 350 index. 'Many British companies have now strengthened their financial position and improved their ability to pay higher dividends over the longer term,' said Mr Jeremy Tigue, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Management. Companies included in the FT-SE A 350 index were best placed to benefit from an upturn in the UK and its trading partners. The fund is targeted at private investors wanting to hold shares in a personal equity plan. Dividends will be paid quarterly, and the warrants, issued on a 1-for-5 basis, will be traded as a unit with the shares for the first 43 days. The public offer period is from March 1 to 22, and dealings in the units start on March 29. The fund will have an initial life of 10 years.</p>

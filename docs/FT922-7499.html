			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Mellor targets BBC bureaucracy MR DAVID MELLOR, the national heritage secretary, said yesterday that tackling the BBC's 'complex welter of bureaucracy' would be one of the key issues in the debate over the corporation's future. On TV-am's David Frost programme he said: 'The BBC bureaucracy looks increasingly isolated in a world where perhaps most other management organisations have moved on from that kind of bureaucracy.' Mr Mellor questioned whether the licence payer should have to pay for the corporation's bureaucracy in its present form. The BBC is investigating how much can be saved from overheads costing Pounds 330m a year as part of the Producer Choice policy that gives programme producers the right to buy services from outside. Mr Mellor emphasised that he was open to new ideas about funding the BBC but conceded that he had not found one with the simplicity of the licence fee. He said: 'I don't see how we can move away from the universal principle (of payment) without moving away from the concept of the BBC with a public-service broadcasting obligation serving the whole nation.' In the debate about the corporation's role, the continued existence of the BBC and the need for high-quality broadcasting had to be separated from 'a rather absurd defence of everything the BBC does and the way that it does it'. The BBC admitted yesterday that the individual new business units being set up under Producer Choice, which have an obligation to break even, might have a total deficit of Pounds 100m next year if overheads were not brought down. Overall, however, the BBC is not budgeting for a deficit next year. Mr Mellor will address a conference of BBC governors and top managment later this week. He will put forward his own proposals for the future of the corporation in a discussion document to be published towards the end of this year.</p>

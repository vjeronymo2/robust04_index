			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (6): Reputation for liberal tax laws - New US-Dutch treaty after a decade of complex negotiations THE world's oldest double taxation treaty, the 1948 treaty between the Netherlands and the US, is to give way to a new document believed to be the most complex tax agreement ever concluded between two countries. The new US-Netherlands treaty will replace an existing treaty dating from 1948. After more than 10 years of exhaustive negotiations, the two countries signed a draft treaty in December 1992. If ratification proceeds smoothly - and this is by no means certain - the treaty will take force on January 1, 1994, with companies given a one-year transitional phase before they need to comply with its stipulations. The revised treaty is attracting considerable international attention, not because of any changes in withholding tax rates, but because of its complicated Article 26, which sets out the 'limitations of benefits' and, effectively, narrows the range of companies that are able to invoke protection against double taxation. The US, which is keen to counter 'treaty shopping' by companies seeking to reduce their tax bills, is expected to use the treaty with the Netherlands as a model for its future tax treaty relations with other industrialised countries. The Netherlands, for its part, has attempted to retain as many features of the old treaty as possible, underlining its reputation as a country willing to forego tax on interest payments, profits and royalties generated in third countries. This stance has given the Netherlands, though hardly a tax 'paradise' for its own citizens and residents, a reputation for liberal tax laws for international businesses. The Netherlands' attempts to preserve this reputation and the US's desire to rein in treaty shopping account for the long, arduous negotiations over the new treaty's text, which runs to 100 pages, excluding a 35-page appendix. The new US-Dutch treaty will make it difficult for 'mailbox' and 'brass-plate' companies to carry on benefiting from double taxation rules. This is because the draft treaty includes exhaustive tests of how rooted a company is in the Netherlands. Previously, mere residence in the Netherlands was enough to enable a foreign company to draw on the Netherlands-US tax treaty benefits. Now, eligibility will have to be established by any of a variety of means, ranging from an ownership and business activity test to a 'publicly traded' and 'headquarters operations' test. Although lawyers and consultants continue to pore over the document, the treaty will probably have few practical consequences for those companies that have substantial business or administrative activities in either the US or the Netherlands. The only drawback for them of the new treaty is that they may face greater administrative burdens proving that they are eligible to take advantage of the treaty's provisions. However, two broad categories of companies are likely to be most affected by the changed US-Dutch tax rules: companies which use Dutch companies as a channel for investment into the US because their own countries, such as those in the Middle East, have no tax treaty of their own with the US; and UK companies which use a 'mixer' sub-holding in the Netherlands to blend their tax liabilities in various countries before remitting profits to Britain. Particularly for companies in the 'mixer' category, minor or even wide-scale restructuring of their corporate structure in the Netherlands may be necessary if they are to continue to draw on the treaty. If they lose their eligibility, companies will face an increase in US withholding tax on dividends from 5 per cent to 30 per cent and on interest payments from nil to 30 per cent. In another change, the treaty will effectively force the Netherlands to alter the ability of Dutch resident companies to use tax-haven companies and branches in places like the Netherlands Antilles. The treaty stipulates that if the Netherlands does not revise its laws on this point, the two countries will handle the issue in a protocol to the treaty. Despite the changes brought by the treaty, the Netherlands is expected to remain an attractive tax regime for foreign companies, though competition continues to increase within Europe, especially from the 'co-ordination centre' facilities allowed by neighbouring Belgium.</p>

[Al-Ghusayn] The peace agreement between Israel and the PLO  only concerns the Palestinians in the occupied territories and  the Palestinian exiles who were living there in June 1967,  during the war. Under the terms of the Treaty of Washington,  the rest -- some 3 million people -- are not authorized to  return, at least not for the time being. The fate of the  Palestinians of the diaspora and those who left after 1967 will  be the subject of the final phase of negotiations with Israel.  I believe that many of the Palestinians living abroad will  invest their money in the territories. But before they do this  they are waiting for the Israelis to withdraw and for durable  peace to be established in the region. In order to gain a  general idea of the future of Palestine, the other problems must  first be solved: the 1948 refugees, the issue of water,  borders, and Jerusalem. Its future is also linked to the kind  of relations established with neighboring countries. Economic  cooperation and development will be a logical follow-up to peace.    [Rozen] Must the diaspora make donations or investments?    [Al-Ghusayn] The effect of donations is limited. We need  investments. We want to set up a market economy in which the  private sector -- rather than just the public sector -- will  play a predominant role. We also want to limit bureaucracy in  the new state, which could form part of a confederation along  with Jordan.    [Rozen] Will the PLO go ahead with nationalizations?    [Al-Ghusayn] The days of socialism and nationalizations have  definitely come to an end. Today, everyone is busy privatizing.  We want to create a free zone in Gaza with peace, security, and  no bureaucratic restrictions, so that investors will be inclined  to set up shop in these territories.    [Rozen] How will you finance the budget of the Gaza-Jericho  unit?    [Al-Ghusayn] During the two-year transitional period, our  budget will have to be financed by the international community.  Meanwhile, we shall have to establish an efficient system for  collecting taxes and customs duties. We could also benefit from  some of the taxes collected by the Israelis during the  occupation. As you know, Palestinian resources are extremely  limited. Our main assets are our well-trained laborers and the  tourist potential.    [Rozen] What does the future hold for the local  administration?    [Al-Ghusayn] The current administration of the territories  could serve as a kind of nucleus. It will have to be  revitalized and modernized by professionals and using  technology. We want to build a government machine that is  lightweight and efficient. The inhabitants of the territories  will be responsible for the administration, not the expatriate  executives in Tunisia. They must have priority regarding  employment, because they are living there and are aware of the  local problems.    [Rozen] Do you intend to return to the country?    [Al-Ghusayn] Every Palestinian is an uprooted individual who  remains attached to his homeland.    [Rozen] Why do you favor the political dimension?    [Al-Ghusayn] The psychological environment is of key  importance when it comes to establishing good cooperation. When  you take on an associate in the business world, the  understanding is based on trust, reciprocity, and equality  between the two parties. How do you intend to build a future if  you distrust each other? That is why we must first settle the  political problems, the main one being the refugee issue.    [Rozen] Is Yasir 'Arafat motivated by economic issues?    [Al-Ghusayn] Being a trained engineer, Yasir 'Arafat was an  entrepreneur in Kuwait before he became chairman of the PLO. He  knows the significance of free enterprise and the free movement  of capital.</p>

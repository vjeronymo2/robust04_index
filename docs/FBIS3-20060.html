On Friday [25 March], Ignatz Bubis, chairman  of the Central Council of the Jews in Germany, reacted with  these words to the arson attack on the synagogue in Luebeck.  Such actions are not least due to the "mental arsonists" who  create the climate for it with virulent campaigns and hate  slogans, Bubis told DPA. For him, the real arsonists are  extreme right parties, such as the Republikaner, the German  People's Union, the National Democratic Party of Germany, and  others of a total of 82 rightist groups and parties.    Bubis said that the fact that synagogues are targets of  attacks by extreme right groups is new. In the past two years,  Jewish graves and memorials were desecrated, but no synagogues.  As a consequence of the incident in Luebeck, Bubis called for  more severe social ostracism of "arsonists" and stricter  punishment of the perpetrators. "Authorities and courts still  have not understood that warnings and educational measures are  not enough to deter right-wing extremists from such actions,"  the chairman of the Central Council said.</p>

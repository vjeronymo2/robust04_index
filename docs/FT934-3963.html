			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Education bill faces rebellion by Tory peers Opposition peers expect the government to have difficulty getting its new education bill through parliament in its current form because of a growing rebellion by Tory peers. The bill, which would reform the organisation of teacher training and end compulsory membership of student unions, will be debated by parliament for the first time today, when it receives its second reading in the upper chamber. An ominous sign for the government yesterday was that more than 30 peers had applied to speak in the second reading debate, about three times the usual number for such an event. Baroness David, who speaks for the opposition on education, said that she expected most of the speeches to be against the bill, and that there would be a lot of pressure to amend it during and after its committee stage next year. Several Tory peers have already said that they will be speaking against the legislation while a Labour whip yesterday promised that the bill's passage through the chamber would turn into a 'marathon' for the government. Department for Education officials are also admitting privately that the legislation on student unions will be one of the most hotly contested legislative issues in the new session. Vice-chancellors oppose it because, they say, it is too prescriptive. Under the bill the management of teacher training will be passed to an agency responsible for its funding. It will be expected to move funds from university departments to schools as part of 'school-based training'. Professor Peter Mortimore, director of London University's Institute of Education, said the move would be expensive, as it would create several thousand providers of teacher-training, rather than the 90 at present. He suggested that quality would also suffer, because of the added difficulties of regulating so many schools, each of which would have a teacher-training capacity. He added that the government's ability to control the supply of teachers would be damaged by the measure. Sex must be placed in the context of morals and family values in school lessons, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. He added: 'Sex education, like moral education, should begin in the home.' Parents will be allowed to withdraw their children from any lesson including sex education.</p>

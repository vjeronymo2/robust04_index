			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Latvia in crisis as troop deadline nears Ten days before the last Russian troops are due to leave the tiny Baltic state of Latvia, the country is in the grip of an acute political crisis, with no government and little chance of this changing soon, Reuter reports from Riga. Efforts by President Guntis Ulmanis to patch together a formula to end government paralysis collapsed on August 18 when parliament withheld endorsement of a conservative minority team. Political observers said the 54-year-old president was unlikely to call early elections. But he was also not likely to be able to get a permanent government in place this month. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said Ulmanis would probably ask Latvian Way, the largest parliament faction, to form a government after a political crisis triggered when the Farmers' Union abandoned a previous coalition. But the agency said other parties were likely to set conditions for the return of the party, which backs free market economics, privatisation and tough monetary policies. The political crisis has hit Latvia as it seeks to appease the international community and Russia over a controversial citizenship law and looks anxiously to the final stage of a Russian military withdrawal. In parallel operations signalling the end of the Russian military presence in the Baltics, Moscow has undertaken to remove all its remaining 7,000 fighting men from Latvia and its 2,000 from Estonia by August 31. In spite of an institutionalised mistrust of Russian intentions, few in Latvia doubt Moscow will honour that commitment. But a deal to let the Russian early warning station at Skundra function for another four years and a concession to give residency rights to thousands of ethnic Russian army pensioners still rankles with many in the Latvian political establishment. Ethnic Russians, most of whom arrived after the Soviet Union annexed Latvia in 1940, make up 33 per cent of the 2.56m population. Reaching a decision about their future acceptable to Russia and the international community while reviving Latvian national identity has been a challenge for post-independence governments. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not reneged on the troop withdrawal commitment, but he has hinted at some form of economic retaliation. In an attempt to resolve the government crisis, Ulmanis asked Andrejs Krastins, a member of the National Conservative Party (LNNK), to form a new government. But parliament refused to approve his team, in part because of fears it might embark on nationalist policies that would upset the Russians further at a crucial moment. The LNNK, which has taken a tough line on ties with Moscow and on the rights of the Russian-speaking population, has only 15 seats in the 100-seat parliament and was trying to form a government without Latvian Way. Liberals said a LNNK government would seek to undo agreement on Russian troop withdrawals, on citizens' rights and on a free trade accord with the European Union reached by the old government of Valdis Birkavs. But others in Latvia, where suspicions of Russian mischief run deep, say it was necessary to have a strong leadership in place in the run-up to August 31 and the immediate aftermath.</p>

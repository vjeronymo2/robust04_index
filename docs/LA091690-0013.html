			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVINA CODE OFFICER USES 'WICKED STICK'  </P> <P> It takes more than Municipal Code sections to clean up suburban blight.  </P> <P> That's where Valerie V. Ver Kuilen comes in.  </P> <P> She carries a badge. Also a "wicked stick," she says.  </P> <P> She is the first and only official employee of Covina's new code enforcement  division, created Nov. 1 as a branch of the Community Development Department.  </P> <P> Her job includes investigating alleged violations of city planning,  development, fire and building codes. The complaints range from illegal parking  on residential property to substandard housing.  </P> <P> During investigations of abandoned houses, she has found drug paraphernalia,  knee-deep trash, a mattress and baby clothes in a swimming pool, and raw sewage  in a front yard.  </P> <P> "Code enforcement used to be hit or miss," she said. "Before, if there were  major complaints, a planner or the Community Service Department worked a couple  of hours a day, and would go out and take a look."  </P> <P> But for Ver Kuilen, it is a full-time job. And sometimes she wishes she had  help. When she first started, she said, she sat on the floor in her small  office and sifted through boxes of files containing 400 Municipal Code  violations -- about two years' worth.  </P> <P> "It was a mess," she said. "There were stacks of files, and no rhyme or reason  to the filing system."  </P> <P> The first thing she did was obtain file cabinets and folders and organize  complaints by street names.  </P> <P> When she receives a complaint, she investigates it and, if necessary, leaves a  warning notice with a 10-day deadline for compliance. If the violation  continues, the property owner is allowed 10 more days to correct it. A  conference with the district attorney's office is scheduled if the violation  persists.  </P> <P> Since she started, Ver Kuilen has pursued criminal charges against two property  owners -- the first such cases in the city. One will go to trial in October; no  trial date has been set for the other. She has 11 other cases pending in which  criminal charges may also be filed.  </P> <P> She rips down illegal signs from telephone poles with the help of what she  calls her "wicked stick," which is four feet long and pointed. She removed it  from an illegal campaign sign, she said.  </P> <P> Ver Kuilen is also certified to make arrests and to carry a gun, although she  chooses not to. Still, the job is not without its risks.  </P> <P> "One man told me that if I came on his property, he would blow me away," she  said. "Another time I was sitting in my car when a man grabbed my arm, yelling  and screaming: 'It's my property! I can do what I want!' I get a lot of yelling  and screaming."  </P></p>

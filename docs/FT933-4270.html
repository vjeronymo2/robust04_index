			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kraft, Jacobs Suchard to link PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco and food company, is to merge Kraft General Foods Europe and Jacobs Suchard, its two main European food businesses. The link-up creates a group with sales this year of about Dollars 9bn in 20 countries. The group, to be called Kraft Jacobs Suchard (KJS), will be Europe's third largest food manufacturer after Nestle and Unilever, and will have particularly strong positions in coffee, confectionery and cheese. Integration of the two businesses, which will be phased over the rest of the year, is designed to improve productivity, cut costs, streamline management, and unify marketing in the face of increasingly tough competition in Europe, company executives said. Mr Raymond Viault has been named president and chief executive of KJS. He previously headed Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery and coffee company which Philip Morris acquired three years ago for Dollars 3.8bn. Jacobs Suchard has until now operated almost separately from Kraft General Foods Europe, which was formed out of Philip Morris' acquisitions of Kraft and General Foods of the US in the 1980s. The two businesses' headquarters will be merged in one office in Zurich, Switzerland, and their operations in most countries combined under one management. Mr Viault said the reorganisation would create 'some redundancies' among the group's 32,000 staff in 20 countries. He said the merger, which has been under discussion for five months, was expected to achieve some 'fairly significant savings', particularly in purchasing, distribution and warehousing.</p>

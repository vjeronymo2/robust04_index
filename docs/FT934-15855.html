			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Pirate cards breach Sky defences THE Financial Times yesterday obtained in the UK an unauthorised 'smart card' to unscramble British Sky Broadcasting subscription channels such as Sky Movies and Sky Sports. The card arrived by post, with a Cheshire postmark, from Satellite Decoder Systems of Warrington, a branch of an Irish business run by Mr David Lyons. The card worked perfectly and produced pictures that were indistinguishable from the 'real' thing - except that the pirate card produced the unscrambled pictures more quickly, probably because the authorisation process had been circumvented. SDS said yesterday, after meeting with trading standards officers in Cheshire, that it would continue to export the cards to the UK from Ireland. Mr Geoff Holland, Cheshire's principal trading standards officer, said it was illegal to import the cards and that if the importing was done directly by customers they would be breaking the law. He also made it clear that it was illegal under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to use the unauthorised cards in the UK if, in doing so, the user intended to avoid paying for the channel he was watching. Mr Holland said he would examine the legal position on advertising and suggested that SDS advertisements might breach the advertising code. Mr Lyons said yesterday that SDS would contest a writ from BSkyB imposing a restraining order on SDS carrying out any activities laid down as illegal under the copyright laws. The satellite company, in which Pearson, publisher of the FT, has a stake, will also seek damages. Mr Lyons said: 'We contest that we have done none of the things they are trying to take action on. All we have done is advertise in the UK.' In the meantime SDS is continuing to challenge the ability of BSkyB's engineers to neutralise its cards. 'Sky is running out of things to do,' said Mr Lyons. 'We know all the information in their chip and if they call their card in we already have the information they will be using on their next card.' The Motion Picture Export Association of America had already drawn up proposals on the growing problem of unauthorised satellite cards across Europe to submit to the European Commission for action.</p>

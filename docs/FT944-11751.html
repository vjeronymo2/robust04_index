			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Decision time Tough times for the editors of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspapers. Kelvin MacKenzie, the hugely successful editor of The Sun, was shuffled sideways into Murdoch's BSkyB and then quit because he couldn't get on with his new boss. Now it seems that Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, is also on the point of quitting the Murdoch empire because his bid to set up the US equivalent of BBC TV's Panorama programme - called On Assignment - has been scrapped. Neil has apparently been offered a Pounds 2m-a- year job as editor of a new five-day-a-week late-night news programme. The money sounds good - but it could prove to be a bit of a treadmill and interfere with Neil's extramural activities. A nail-biting time for John Witherow, acting editor of The Sunday Times, and the publishers of Neil's memoirs.</p>

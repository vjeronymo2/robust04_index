Liability Periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the CAAA of 1990, ORVR controls for new LDVs must have useful lives of 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,000 km) or the equivalent, with recall testing allowed up to 7 years or 75,000 miles (120,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first (CAA section 202(d)(1); 42 U.S.C. 7521(d)(1)). LDTs with loaded vehicle weight up to 3,750 pounds (1,700 kg) have the same useful life requirement as LDVs. All other LDTs have a useful life requirement of 11 years or 120,000 miles (190,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. Pursuant to section 207(i), expected designs for ORVR controls are not ``specified major emission control components,'' because they cost less than $200. Therefore, unless more expensive components are utilized, manufacturers need only warrant them for 2 years or 24,000 miles (39,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. If, at some time in the future, the Administrator should determine that the ORVR controls are ``specified major emission control components,'' manufacturers must warrant them for 8 years or 80,000 miles (130,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first (CAA section 207(i)(2); 42 U.S.C. 7541(i)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Selective Enforcement Audit Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to CAA section 206(b), the Administrator is authorized to test new motor vehicles in order to determine whether vehicles being manufactured do in fact conform to the regulations with respect to which a certificate of conformity was issued. Therefore, LDVs and LDTs that are certified to meet the refueling emission standard are subject to this standard in a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1987 NPRM, EPA discussed two testing issues which resulted from performing the refueling test on newly built motor vehicles. The first issue regarded the possible influence of new vehicle background evaporative emissions (i.e., hydrocarbon emissions from such things as the fresh paint on a new vehicle which has not fully cured) on refueling emission measurements. Historically, EPA has not conducted SEA testing for evaporative emissions due to the relatively large non-fuel background emissions emitted from newly built vehicles. However, EPA expected that background emissions would not significantly affect refueling emission measurements because the actual time for background evaporative losses to occur would be very short (refueling emission measurements have a duration of less than five minutes). Also, refueling measurements would be taken at an ambient temperature of approximately 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F, so fuel and non-fuel evaporative emissions would not be increased by heating of the tank, engine, or other subsystems, as would occur during the usual evaporative emissions test. However, to address any concerns over the effects of background emissions, EPA proposed an additional SEA testing procedure where background emissions would be measured and then subtracted from the refueling emissions measurement. This additional procedure would be used if manufacturers provided evidence that newly built vehicle background emissions would significantly exceed in-use vehicle background emissions, which were intended to be included in the refueling standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because manufacturers' comments raised concerns about conducting the refueling test without measuring for background emissions, and about the extra time needed for the measurement, this final rule will include the new vehicle background emissions measurement proposed in the 1987 NPRM as an optional procedure. However, this decision must be made before SEA testing is conducted. It will apply to all vehicles tested. EPA realizes that when this background procedure is performed, in-use background emissions, which are included in the refueling standard, will also be subtracted from the refueling measurement. At this time, EPA has no way of separating new vehicle background emissions from in-use background emissions. For purposes of SEA testing only, both may therefore be subtracted off. Background emissions from the refueling measurements during in-use testing will not be subtracted since the standard includes measurement of such emissions and there is no concern regarding the higher background emissions from new vehicles. Additionally, upon approval by EPA, a manufacturer may develop and use its own background emissions measurement procedure for use during SEA testing. Revisions to 40 CFR part 86, subpart G, &sect;86.608 (for LDVs) and to subpart K, &sect;86.1008 (for LDTs) incorporate this additional procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Doing farming on a scientific and technological basis on the  principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop  on the right soil, they set down to the sowing of seed rice on  cold-frame beds in good time.    In Yonbaek, Jaeryong, Yoltusamcholli and other plain areas,  the granaries on the west coast of the country, the first day  sowing quotas were overfulfilled with the help of various kinds  of highly efficient machines including seed rice sowing and  manuring machines.    The cooperative farms there have more than doubled their  work speed daily by scrupulously organizing workforce according  to different processes of the sowing.    The rural communities in North Phyongan and North Hwanghae  Provinces chose fast-growing and high-yielding strains and are  strictly meeting the technical requirements in sowing.    The sowing of seed rice on cold beds takes more than ten  days. It is a very important farming process in Korea.    Meanwhile, the preparation of humus-potted maize seedlings  is  in full swing in rural communities throughout the country.

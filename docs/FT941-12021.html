			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Yen rises against dollar The yen yesterday gained ground on the back of a strong surge in Japanese equity markets following the passage over the weekend of a compromise package of political reforms, writes Philip Gawith. With the political impasse of recent weeks now removed, the Japanese government is expected by the end of the week to announce a large fiscal stimulus of Y11-15trillion (million million). Anticipation of the benefits of this package caused the Nikkei to rise nearly 8 per cent, with the benefits spilling over into a stronger yen. The state of US-Japanese trade talks overshadowed the appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress yesterday. The yen closed at Y109.005 to the dollar in London, up about  1/2 yen. It finished in New York at Y108.55. Although the dominant view in the market is that the large fiscal package will be good for the Japanese economy, many observers believe the implications for the currency are less obvious. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said the fiscal package could be a 'double-edged sword'. On the one hand, it will be good for the Nikkei, and hence for the yen. On the other, it should diminish any inclination on the part of the US to talk up the yen as a means of trying to curb the trade gap between the two countries. Analysts said there was quite a lot of positive market sentiment towards the yen. This creates the ironic situation that only now, when the US administration has less reason to talk up the yen, has the market decided to move the Japanese currency higher. Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, said two other seasonal factors lent strength to the yen: the large current account surpluses which normally occur in February and March; and the substantial capital repatriation which, for the past four years, has tended to take place at this time. He predicts that when these factors disappear in April/May the yen will weaken and this will be a truer measure of the currency's position. With the political reforms now passed, the focus has turned to the fiscal package and trade talks. 'The reason Mr Hosokawa was so desperate to get the package through was the trade talks' said Mr Hawkins. 'There would have been a lot of flak if he had gone to the talks without an economic package to show.' Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said the reform package would have a 'very positive' impact on US trade with Japan. The importance the US attaches to the trade issue was illustrated when President Clinton yesterday dispatched US trade representative Mr Mickey Kantor to Japan in an effort to hasten progress in the framework trade talks. Mr Greenspan's testimony yesterday had a mixed effect on the dollar. His observations that he considered real interest rates to be abnormally low, implying a likely tightening of policy, caused the currency to rise initially. When it became clear, however, that no early rate increase was imminent, the dollar lost ground. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said the message of Mr Greenspan's appearance was that, although the Fed 'has its finger on the trigger' to raise rates, inflation is the key indicator being watched and recent data show it is currently well contained. Mr Gunner said sentiment towards the dollar was 'pretty sour now'. Another observer noted: 'If I was a dollar bull I would be worried now.' Mr Gunner said that from a technical perspective the dollar had reached a point where investors were saying that, if it was unable to move higher on good news, then it had to move lower. Accordingly, the currency was being sold. After rising above DM1.7440 during the afternoon, the dollar slipped to DM1.7360 by the evening. Mr Gunner said the dollar had 'hit a brick wall' and needed something beyond the string of recent strong data to take it higher. It ended in New York at DM1.7341. Sterling had a quiet day, underpinned by expectations of a possible German rate cut later this week. There was little reaction to the release of M0 money supply figures, which rose a lower than expected 5.3 per cent in the year to January. The pound finished in London at DM2.6145, nearly two pfennigs up from Friday's close of DM2.5971. Analysts said the pound was trading surprisingly well considering the political pressure the government was under. One observer commented: 'It is almost as if the market is trying to say the quicker we get rid of John Major, the better.' A different gloss on the political angle is that international investors are unconcerned by the current squabbles. The Belgian franc breached its central ERM rate of BFr20.6255 to the D-Mark in a positive reaction to rate cuts announced earlier. Mr Hawkins said the currency's response to the rate cut confirmed the view that, 'at the moment, investors see interest rate cuts within the EMS as being bullish for growth and for the currency.' The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 295m of late liquidity at unspecified rates yesterday. This took total assistance for the day to Pounds 669m, compared with its final estimate of an Pounds 800m liquidity shortage.</p>

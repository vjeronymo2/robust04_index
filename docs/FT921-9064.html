			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / OECD sees gains for Portugal in ERM entry EARLY Portuguese membership of the European Monetary System would help bring down inflation and curb the country's growing economic imbalances, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggests today. In its latest report on the Portuguese economy, the OECD pinpoints the failure to meet inflation targets as a principal weak point in its generally good economic performance since joining the EC in 1986. The Paris-based secretariat suggested that the discipline of entry into the EC's system of exchange rate management 'could help to ease the costs of lowering inflation'. It would prepare Portugal for the eventual goal of European Monetary Union. However, the OECD recognised the difficulties of bringing the escudo into the ERM during a period of high inflation. Consumer price inflation stood at 11.4 per cent last year - compared with an EC average of 4.8 per cent. It is likely to fall only slowly to 10.5 per cent this year and 9.9 per cent in 1993, well above the government's target of 8 per cent. Steady growth of gross domestic product is expected over the next two years  -2.6 per cent this year, and 2.7 per cent in 1993. Last year's growth of 2.7 per cent represented a sharp fall compared with the average growth of 4.5 per cent in the preceding five years. Although the OECD praised Portugal's 'excellent output performance' since EC membership, it pointed to increasing imbalances as a result of high wage growth and booming private consumption. Real wages rose 5 per cent in 1991 and would continue to outstrip productivity in the short term, the OECD said. The visible trade deficit, already 11.5 per cent of GDP in 1991, is likely to widen further, leading to a growing shortfall on current account - forecast at 2.5 per cent of GDP next year.</p>

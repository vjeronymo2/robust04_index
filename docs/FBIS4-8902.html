			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Maribor, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia's former  Interior Minister Igor Bavcar has confirmed that well-organised  channels had been delivering arms to Moslems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina via Slovenia in spite of the embargo on arms  exports to the entire territory of former Yugoslavia.    Speaking at a trial to the smugglers of 120 tons of arms  discovered at the Maribor airport last summer, Bavcar said that  the Slovenian Interior Ministry had sent to Slovenian border  authorities permits for free passage of arms for  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Slovenia's retired intelligence service number two man Janez  Piber confirmed in court that Slovenian President Milan Kucan  and Bavcar had introduced him to Hasan Cengic, who had been  authorised by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic to obtain  arms.    Piber said he had been told to assist Cengic even before the  outbreak of armed conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

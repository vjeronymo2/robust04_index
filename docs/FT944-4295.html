			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Time to end sky-high property price system Japan's sky-high land and property prices are to blame for some of its most pressing economic problems, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its latest report on Japan argues that more deregulation of the property market would increase quality of life and boost consumption. The need to lay aside nine times average annual income, at today's prices, to buy a small home helps to keep Japan's savings rate the highest in the world, so inflating its politically troublesome current account surplus, says the OECD. High land prices also explain why Japan's infrastructure is well behind its economic wealth. Only 44 per cent of homes are connected to sewers and Tokyoites have only 2.5 square metres of parkland a head, less than a tenth of the green space available to Londoners, says the report. The cost of commercial space is a barrier to investment by small and medium-sized foreign companies, one reason why foreign corporate investment in Japan runs at one twentieth of Japanese investment abroad. By any measure, Japanese land prices are further above international norms than its consumer prices, even after the one-third fall in property values since the collapse of the asset price bubble in 1991. At Dollars 1,800 a square metre, the mean price of Japanese residential land is more than 12 times that of the UK, the most expensive in Europe, says the OECD. To achieve the Japanese government's target of reducing house prices to five times average income from the current nine times, another 21 per cent fall in prices is needed, estimates the OECD. Radical changes to the tax system, to encourage a more liquid property market, are required. The OECD also calls for more flexible land leasing laws, to make it easier for landlords to change the use of properties. This would enable a more efficient, and concentrated, use of land. Contrary to popular myth, Japanese cities are not particularly crowded, just poorly planned. Tokyo's population density, for example, is less than one-sixth that of central New York City. Astonishingly, 15 per cent of Japan's three largest cities is farmland, double the housing area. On top of that comes a substantial acreage of vacant parking areas and derelict industrial sites. City populations are high because cities are more spread out than their OECD counterparts. Japan's largest cities sprawl across an acreage equivalent to half its farmland; the ratio for the rest of the OECD is 8 per cent. Urban Japan's underused expanses exist partly because capital gains taxes on land decline the longer it is held, the annual rax on fixed assets is very low and land transaction taxes are high. So land is cheap to hold and expensive to sell. The law continues to give landlords no guarantee of being able to repossess property at the end of a lease, so hindering better use of underused land.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            JAPANESE HOUSE PRICES COMPARED INTERNATIONALLY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990 or 1991                          Japan      France     Germany  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Detached house,* nationwide Price (Dollars)                     442,000                 262,100 Ratio to average annaual earnings      15.5                     9.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Detached house, capital city** Price (Dollars)                     660,100                 436,800 Ratio to average annaual earnings      20.6                    16.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apartment,*** capital city Price (Dollars)                     457,000     263,000     156,100 Ratio to average annaual earnings      13.5        11.4         5.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990 or 1991                      Netherlands       UK          US  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Detached house,* nationwide Price (Dollars)                     159,100     168,800     103,300 Ratio to average annaual earnings       5.5         7.5         3.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Detached house, capital city** Price (Dollars)                     179,400     244,100 Ratio to average annaual earnings       6.2        10.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apartment,*** capital city Price (Dollars)                      56,300     140,200 Ratio to average annaual earnings       1.9         6.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *  An individual house standing on its own plot of land ** Or most expensive region in the case of the Netherlands ***Terraced house in the case of the UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources:  Deiterich, Williams and Woods (1993);           OECD; US Bureau of the Census  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

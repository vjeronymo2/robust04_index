			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation President's Court of Appeal for </F> Information Disputes Statement No. 1 "On I. Andronov's  Publication in the Newspaper ZAVTRA"]    [Text] The Russian Federation President's court of appeal  for information disputes, having examined the content of several  items published in the mass media, television programs, and  other information items, considers it necessary to issue the  following statement.    While Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin has advanced  and is implementing the nationwide unifying idea of civil peace  and accord, the consolidation of the Russian state on this  basis, and the promotion of reforms and democracy -- an idea  which is encountering increasing support in society -- some mass  media have adopted a drastically destructive stance.    The use of rumors, stories, and reports based on unverified  facts and leading to the fueling of tragic interethnic  conflicts, overt immorality, the groundless and unproven  defamation of Russia's institutions of statehood, and as a whole  the abuse of freedom of speech have unfortunately become the  trademark of several publications and television and radio  programs.    These items aimed at destabilizing the sociopolitical  situation in Russia include I. Andronov's article "Secrets of  the Kremlin" published in the newspaper ZAVTRA, issue no. 11 for  16 March 1994.    The author tries to discredit, diminish, and hurt the  Russian  Federation president with profoundly immoral and malicious  speculations on the subject of his health and, not spurning the  basest methods, is seeking to introduce into the public  consciousness the idea that the head of state is an incapable  and incapacitated politician.    I. Andronov adorned his article with numerous quotations,  unfounded and taken out of context, from various sources, mainly  foreign ones, and mixed them with rumors and conversations known  only to himself, providing the whole with his own unseemly  comments.    Taking advantage of the fact that the press services of  federal state organs do not always promptly cover the work and  state of health of Russia's top statesmen and do not promptly  deny various insinuations in this field, the author voice  completely unfounded speculations, spreads absurd stories, and  draws far-fetched historical parallels -- and all this to sow  alarm and lack of confidence, to pile up obstacles on the path  to civil accord.    But for his own highly dubious publicity he uses cock and  bull stories which obviously have nothing to do with the author  about his importance, the attempts made on his life, and similar  "detective thriller" stories.    Assessing I. Andronov's item, the court of people realizes  that, of course, it is futile to reason with and appeal to the  conscience of the editor of a newspaper of the "spiritual  opposition," which prints such items. At the same time it would  also be wrong to leave them unheeded and unassessed, and that  includes the odious item produced by I. Andronov.    A legal barrier should be erected against flagrant,  shameless, and unjustified attacks on Russia's institutions of  statehood and on their leaders and representatives and here  ethical values should be used.    The court of appeal believes that I. Andronov's article  "Secrets of the Kremlin" is an abuse of the free mass media and  violates article 4 of the law on the mass media and universally  accepted ethical norms and serves as justification for warning  the chief editor that the newspaper ZAVTRA could cease  publication.    The court of appeal is sending its statement to the Russian  Federation Committee for the Press for the adoption of the  measures stipulated by the law against the newspaper ZAVTRA.    [Signed] A. Vengerov, chairman of the court of appeal, 4  April 1994, Moscow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  on Friday [27 May] said the coming weeks would be "decisive" and  that France would totally revamp its policy on Bosnia by July if  peace talks made no progress.    "Before the summer, the month of July, we must know if we  are  moving ahead or marking time. If everyone continues to refuse  every diplomatic breakthrough, particularly a ceasfire, we must  go ahead with a thorough review of our policy," Juppe said on  French radio.    France has threatened to pull out all its 6,800 UN troops in  former Yugoslavia, where they form the backbone of the UN  Protection Force there.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, after a meeting here  Thursday with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, also said Britian  had no desire to maintain its troops indefinitely in Bosnia.    Juppe said the "consequences must be weighed."    "While we will not be able to say that we did not foresee  the  threats of a military escalation and a spread of the conflict,  we cannot indefinitely stay where we are for several years."    He said the deadlock in Bosnia must be broken in the  framework of what is being proposed by an international contact  group on Bosnia: "a ceasefire, an institutional and territorial  arrangement within the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a  reconstruction process."    France hosted two-days of talks between the Contact Group --  the European Union, Russia and the United States -- and the  three warring sides Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine  hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva.    The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round  was scheduled in the French resort town on June 6 and 7.    The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the  factions to agree to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a  European plan for partition that would give 51 percent of  territory to the Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to the  Serbs.</p>

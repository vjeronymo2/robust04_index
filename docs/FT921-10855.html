			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Nigeria warns of elaborate fraud NIGERIA yesterday warned foreign businesses of an elaborate fraud scandal involving bogus officials and documents, state radio said, Reuter reports from Lagos. Police are investigating more than 1,000 complaints of fraud, from as far afield as Europe and Australia, Deputy Inspector-General Perry Osayande said. He urged foreigners seeking business in Nigeria to check out prospective partners through their embassies. A diplomat said: 'We estimate that up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 552m) might have been extracted from people in the past few years.' The warning was the second to be issued by Nigeria in six months. In September, Nigeria's central bank said swindlers using Nigerian names had extorted millions of dollars from people in America, Asia and Europe under the guise of transferring cash. Mr Osayande gave no details of the latest fraud.</p>

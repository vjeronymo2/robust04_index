			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Travel: The jolly 'Swiss' of Argentina - Tom Lynch crosses the Andes, European style SAN CARLOS de Bariloche is a make-believe Swiss chocolate-box resort in the Andes, an Argentinian town that makes woollen goods and chocolate, takes fondue and strudel seriously and has a natty line in log architecture. The town square is a confident, dark-brown Swiss pastiche overlooking Lago Nahuel Huapi. The concrete hotels have chalet-style wooden roofs and shutters and telephone boxes on street corners have steep-pitched roofs. However, yodelling is not encouraged. Images of jolly Swiss peasants in costume are used to sell everything - especially chocolate, fondue and woollens - to the tourists who are the town's reason for existing. Bariloche is Argentina's main skiing resort, and is busy with sightseers and hikers when the snow melts. Whatever an architect might think of Bariloche, it is one of the best bases to explore the Argentinian lake district, and the starting point for a spectacular route across the Andes, using three boats and four buses on a 12-hour trip to Puerto Montt in Chile. Sidetrips include chairlifts on the Cerro campanario and Cerro Catedral for views of Nahuel Huapi and Lago Moreno, and drives through dramatic valleys to cold, green lakes. Inland is El Bolson, a little town in a deep, gentle bowl among the mountains, a three-hour drive over high passes on unpredictable gravel roads, past remote wooden houses - some are shacks like the shanties of South American cities, some are sturdy cabins like the ones Wild West heroes used to retire to with their best girl when their days of chasin' outlaws was done. El Bolson lies among orchards and trout rivers, and appears to be a refuge for hippies who sell each other woollen and leather goods, wooden toys, chocolate cake and wholefood in a street market under the massive, jagged, gap-toothed Cerro Piltriquitron. The trip to Chile from Bariloche starts at dawn, with a bus ride along the shore of Lago Nahuel Huapi to Puerto Panuelos and a large catamaran across the lake to Puerto Blest. A bus on a dirt road over a pass meets a more basic ferry on Lago Frias, a deep, narrow, chilly, green gash in the mountains, trees clinging to the steep sides. At the end of the lake is Puerto Frias, no more than the Argentinian frontier post and a log cabin for the guards. Another bus goes over another pass, the shoulder of Cerro Tronador, a three-peaked extinct volcano - one peak in Chile, one in Argentina and one split by the border - and runs down to the Chilean frontier post on the edge of the village of Peulla, in an altogether more pastoral landscape. In winter, the trip cannot be done in one day. Peulla is the only place where non-campers can stay the night, in B&amp;B's or in the wooden hotel, where a brightly-painted traction engine is parked incongruously in the forecourt  -made by Mitchells of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in 1909. About 300 years ago, a bunch of Jesuits, looking for people to convert, reached the top of a ridge in the Andes and looked down on a long green-blue lake, calm and cold between the snow- capped mountains and volcanoes of what is now the Chilean Lake District. It was All Saints' Day, so they called it Lago Todos los Santos, though the more secular Lago Esmeralda is now gaining ground. The lake steamer from Peulla to Petrohue doubles as local ferry and post-bus. By the time the area became a national park, some people had settled to graze livestock on the rich volcanic fields and take fish from the clear lake. Their houses are still there. The steamer stops to meet small boats, to pick up or drop parcels and people. All the time, Osorno, the first of the great volcanoes of the Chilean firebelt, grows larger, snow-covered with a plume of white smoke drifting into the blue sky, steam escaping from a fissure on the slope. At the end of the lake, where the boat pulls in to a pier beside a national parks cabin, the cone of Osorno fills the sky and the road west is blasted through red and black layers of cooled lava. Travellers can turn north into the lake district, with its forests, and volcanoes, or continue west past black volcanic beaches, through the forests of alerces, the slowest-growing trees in the world, weird-shaped, as if struck by lightning, which take up to 1,800 years to reach maturity. The Germans who settled the area around the turn of the century enthusiastically chopped the alerces down to build their cabins, until they discovered how long it would take to renew them. Now the trees are protected and forests of conifers are grown to build the wooden houses. The little towns of the lakes still carry the German stamp, with houses, shops and hotels straight out of inter-war central Europe. Fritz, who flies the flag of Berlin outside his guest house in Villarica, tells with relief how he was sent to Chile to work in early 1939. The end of the road south and west is the fishing port of Puero Montt, with the gloomy Club Alemane drinking den and a neo-brutalist concrete railway station. By the harbour, beyond the craft market, is a row of canteen shacks. Outside each, a pot bubbles, full of mysterious seafood. The women shout at passers-by, inviting them to taste the brew and come inside and eat. Travellers with less than absolute confidence in their digestions should head for the more recognisable seafood in the town's traditional cafes and restaurants. The cross-Andes trip was undertaken during a round-the-world journey arranged through Trailfinders. London-Rio, overland to Santiago, Easter Island, Tahiti, Sydney, Darwin, Cairns, Bangkok and London. Pounds 2,393.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Knives out for pirates - A New York company is taking legal action against Bangkok's copycats For a couple of years it seemed like a good idea: Izabel Lam, a growing New York jewellery and tableware design company, farmed out production of some of its cutlery to contractors in Thailand, where metalworking skills were available more cheaply than in the US. Now the cost-cutting plan has turned sour. Tim McCarthy, Izabel Lam president, says Thai factories have been churning out hundreds of thousands of copies of his company's knives, forks, spoons and serving plates. McCarthy reckons the pirates have cost Izabel Lam Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 4.3m) of lost business and Dollars 250,000 in legal fees as it attempts to remedy the problem with a torrent of litigation: 'Sales of our (genuine) cutlery have dropped 90 per cent in the last three months.' Pirated copies of Izabel Lam cutlery have been exported to Japan, the US and Europe. As many as five Thai companies and 50 distributors in 20 countries are involved, McCarthy says. 'Thailand has become the copying capital of the world,' he says. 'Contracts generally are not respected.' There is no doubt that intellectual piracy is rampant in Thailand. It is easy to buy pirated computer software, music cassettes and videos on the streets of Bangkok, although some items become temporarily hard to find when the US is making its annual assessment of Thailand's enforcement of copyright rules. Copies of clothes and luggage by leading French and Italian designers are also openly on display at street stalls, as are 'Rolex' watches costing a mere Dollars 10 each. Most of these products are known to be copies or fakes by the people who buy them in Bangkok. By contrast, exports from Thailand to the west which may be in breach of international copyright conventions - or manufactured secretly by contractors in addition to their licensed production for legitimate brand names - are much more difficult to identify. McCarthy values the total turnover of table-top products, including cutlery, at Dollars 18bn-Dollars 20bn in the industrialised countries, and he says about Dollars 5bn of this is accounted for by pirated merchandise from Thailand and elsewhere. Unlike most other designers, Izabel Lam has taken the unusual step of making a public fuss about its piracy claims, and it has begun legal action in Thailand, Germany and France after finding what it regards as copies of its designs in shops in Europe and Thailand and on display at Thai stands during recent trade fairs in Frankfurt and Paris. At the centre of the controversy is a product called Sphere cutlery, a design characterised by wavy handles culminating in bulbous ends. Izabel Lam, a Hong Kong Chinese designer who founded her Brooklyn-based company in 1980, was inspired by wavy underwater sea-grass while scuba-diving, McCarthy says. 'It's unique . . . so there couldn't be a case of somebody mistaking the design.' Since May this year, Izabel Lam has served 'cease and desist' notices against shops and traders in France, Germany and Thailand selling what it believes are copies of its designs, and some have co-operated with Izabel Lam's investigations by suspending sales of the products and naming their suppliers. The company has also obtained German and French court injunctions against Thai companies and a Thai government department promoting exports at trade fairs in Frankfurt and Paris. 'Virtually every major trade fair is being used by Thai companies to ship out bogus product,' says McCarthy. Successful action against pirates is rare, but not unknown. Izabel Lam was encouraged by the expulsion of an Indonesian company from a Frankfurt textile fair in May after it was accused of copying US and European designs. At a Frankfurt fair in August, according to McCarthy, no fewer than seven outlets were offering variants of Izabel Lam designs. He says he was told repeatedly that he would be killed if he attempted to pursue the matter in Bangkok - not an unusual threat in the Thai business world. In Paris in September, Izabel Lam found one of its Thai sub-contractors, NV Aranyik, a company based in Ayudhya, north of Bangkok, selling a design similar to Sphere under the auspices of the Thai department of industrial promotion. The Paris trade fair brochure shows cutlery similar but not identical to Sphere, with the handle-ends in the form of a loop rather than a bulb, but NV Aranyik denies copyright violation. 'We are not copying anything,' says Somchai Wangsilabat, a director. Izabel Lam is forming a new pressure group to campaign for the rights of designers. Known as TOP Design (True, Original, Protected), it will be funded by Dollars 10,000 from each member company. McCarthy also intends to pursue legal action in Europe and Thailand, but the impact in Thailand is likely to be limited by the difficulty of proving design theft for commonplace household items such as cutlery and by the small fines awarded in Thai courts for breach of copyright. Thai government officials say that the maximum award made so far has been Bt200,000 (Pounds 5,065). Until research, development and design in Thailand grow to the point where Thai companies have an interest in copyright protection, intellectual piracy is likely to remain a problem. Nantabhat Bhukkanasut, an official of the Thai Department of Intellectual Property, says Thai courts have yet to decide whether cutlery should be covered by universal copyright protection or by patents for industrial designs. Izabel Lam, he says, should have registered its design in Thailand before starting production. McCarthy replies that bureaucracy makes it impossible for a small company to register every new design in every country, but Nantabhat insists that Izabel Lam erred in assuming that its design would be protected by world copyright. 'It was a false assumption,' he says.</p>

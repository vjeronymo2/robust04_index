He said  that there is no new developments from what the Police  Department director general has said. Police officers will  follow up the case closely in accordance with their preliminary  assumption, which is based on the evidence. Further information  will be sought. Although preventive measures have been regularly  reviewed and implemented, there are still some loopholes, he  noted.    Commenting on the same incident, Deputy Prime Minister  Bunchu  Rotchanasathian said the National Security Council has followed  up the issue. He admitted that it is fortunate that the  explosives were discovered before a serious incident occurred.  Regarding this, he believes it will not be difficult to find  the culprits.    To prevent such an event from happening is difficult, he  went  on to say. For example, in other countries, despite stringent  preventive measures, these sorts of incidents are still  possible. On the question of whether stringent measures will be  imposed on incoming and outgoing passengers at Bangkok  International Airport, Bunchu said officials are prepared to  catch the suspects there and he believes the offenders are still  in Thailand. Judging from the purposes of the offenders, no  Thais are believed to be involved in the operations, but the  offenders may have some connection in Thailand.</p>

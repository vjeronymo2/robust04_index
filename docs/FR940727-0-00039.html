			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(C), Undeveloped land use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief). The Director finds that Ohio's proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is not less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133 and the Federal definition of ``land use'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(8), Undeveloped land use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish and wildlife habitat category. The proposed deletion of this paragraph is consistent with revised paragraphs (B)(2) and (C) which clarify that undeveloped land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletion of paragraph (D)(8) will not render the Ohio rule less effective than the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(C) (9) and (10), Forestland and Fish and Wildlife Habitat <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production of wood or wood products. The Director finds that the revised rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133 and the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(1), Agency review of postmining land uses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other required changes. The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(c) impose no similar requirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of these requirements will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wild not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided in accordance with OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management agencies. There are no Federal counterparts at 30&hyph;CFR 816/817.133. Therefore, the Director finds that the revisions do not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(9), Agency review of postmining land use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief. The Federal requirements at 30 CFR 816/817.133 do not impose a similar requirement. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this requirement will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(2), Design of postmining land use plans by an engineer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under the general supervision of a registered engineer or other appropriate professional. There are no similar Federal requirements at 30 CFR 816/817.133. The Director, therefore, finds that the deletion of paragraph (D)(2) will not render the Ohio program less effective that the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that it does not recommend that any forestland be grazed as indicated in paragraph (C)(3) of OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17. The only change proposed by Ohio at paragraph (C)(3) was to clarify the title of the approved postmining land use. Therefore, the Director will not address this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Bulk of BCE gain comes from telephone offshoot BCE, the telecommunications holding company, reported higher first-quarter earnings with larger contributions from Bell Canada, the telephone utility, and Northern Telecom, the equipment manufacturer. The Canadian company's earnings were CDollars 293m (USDollars 252.5m), or 88 cents a share, up 11 per cent from CDollars 265m, or 82 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 4.7bn, against CDollars 4.4bn. Bell Canada contributed CDollars 227m, or 74 cents a share, against CDollars 220m, or 73 cents, a year earlier, and paid preferred dividends of CDollars 17m in both periods. Its local service revenues were up 4 per cent but long-distance fell 2.6 per cent because of a slow economy. Operating expenses dipped 3 per cent. Montreal Trustco and TransCanada PipeLines made lower contributions. Shell Canada posted a CDollars 35m loss in the first quarter, blaming a sharp drop in refined products prices and the recession. A year earlier it earned CDollars 63m, or 56 cents. The company will continue rationalisation while spending heavily to develop the big Caroline natural gas field in Alberta. This should be generating revenue early in 1993. United Westburne, controlled by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France, had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 8.2m on revenues of CDollars 489m, against a profit of CDollars 2m, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 591m. The wholesale plumbing, heating and electrical supplies group will continue regional expansion in the US. The shutdown of two Ontario uranium mines and weak metals distribution markets reduced Rio Algom's sales and earnings in the first quarter. But the company's potash operations improved with better international prices while higher production increased returns from Rio's western coal venture. Overall, the main Canadian arm of Britain's RTZ Group earned CDollars 14m, or 31 cents a share, down from CDollars 20.1m, or 44 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 265m, against CDollars 355m. Copper earnings were stable, while the tin mining operation offset lower prices with higher output.</p>

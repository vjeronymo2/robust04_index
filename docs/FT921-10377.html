			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Russian military adviser calls for army to defend country's interests THE military adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin has called for the formation of a Russian army to defend the country's national interests, writes John Lloyd. The call comes as the Ministry of Defence, theoretically serving forces united under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States, drafts a document on control of the military ahead of the next CIS meeting in Minsk on February 14. Few give it much chance of success. Mr Yeltsin's adviser, General Konstantin Kobets, said yesterday in an article that 'an uncontrollable process was now beginning' in the armed forces and that clear decisions had to be taken. 'We must state that Russia has its own interests and will defend them with force,' Gen Kobets warned.</p>

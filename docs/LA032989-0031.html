			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS GENERATION GAP IS BUILT ON REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> They were talking about real estate. It is, to be frank, one of their favorite  subjects.  </P> <P> Each of them had a story to tell. One had bought a house in 1973 for $40,000.  It had just been valued at $265,000. Another had a neighbor who sold her house,  tripling her money in 10 years -- the right 10 years. A third figured carefully  the inflated value of his home into his retirement plans.  </P> <P> They did not brag, these couples in late middle age, of having had any special  prescience about a real-estate boom. They had put money down on a house in the  1960s or '70s and won the jackpot of the '80s. There were no oil wells in their  back yards, but the homes had made a more spectacular return than any gusher.  </P> <P> They simply rode the real-estate boom to a certain measure of paper profit. The  houses they chose to live in were also investments to live off. They were now  middle-income and house-rich. So conversations like these make them feel good  or at least lucky.  </P> <P> But then the subject turned to their children, grown children. Could their  children afford to buy the houses they had grown up in? A second set of stories  poured out, more troubled than the first.  </P> <P> They had working children wholly unable to save a down payment that might equal  the parents' entire first mortgage. They had married children who needed two  jobs to afford what they had supported with one. Most of their offspring were  double-income and house-poor.  </P> <P> To this eavesdropper, there was no news bulletin in this exchange. These days  the economic gap between generations is built on the private turf of real  estate. A space has grown between those who have houses and those who do not.  </P> <P> More people over 65 and fewer people under 35 own their own homes these days.  In 1977, 11.5% of new home-buyers were in their early 20s. In 1987, only 4.2%  of these buyers were that young. More than one-half of new mortgages depend on  second incomes.  </P> <P> The gap grew through the vagaries of supply and demand. Over the past 15 years,  incomes fell behind inflation and houses sped ahead. Tax breaks have gone to  those with mortgages, and so-called tax revolts made generational differences  even more striking. In California's famed Proposition 13 froze property taxes  at 1978 rates -- but only for those who already owned homes. A new neighbor now  may pay vastly more than the older couple in an identical house next door.  </P> <P> There are other very real effects of real estate on these two generations.  Generations find common ground in the family. There, the house-rich middle  class increasingly is called upon to help its house-poor children.  </P> <P> I am told that standard equipment for any mortgage lender's office includes at  least four chairs: two for the couple and two for the parents who help bankroll  the sale. As many as half of the first-time young buyers are getting help from  their parents. If I am to judge by my listening sample, these elders feel both  duty-bound and willing to share their good fortune. But another of their  favorite conversations echoes concern about the long-term dependence of "kids  these days."  </P> <P> The "kids" of 25 and 30 have in turn become awkwardly conscious of the way that  real estate has solidified the two-class structure. The have and have-nots of  their own age are often those who either have or have not parents with home  equity.  </P> <P> I don't want to turn a real-estate boom into a sociological bust. The windfall  is a large component of an older generation's improved economic status. Their  independence is a boon to their children as well.  </P> <P> But it is also a major reason why the scales are tipping, why grandparents  often live better than grandchildren. It's why there is a need to build more  affordable housing, tax more of the capital gains that came to those who rode  the real-estate boom and allot the money to help families buy into the market.  </P> <P> Rising real estate makes for great conversation. I can attest to that from my  listening post. But a younger generation is being left out of the lucky  dialogue. It looks as if the family homestead rests on very shaky ground.  </P></p>

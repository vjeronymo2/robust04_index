They  were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment. Let us  follow a report by Leke Musolli:    [Musolli] On Thursday, the Serbian Court of Prishtina region  made up of a jury of five and presided over by Zoran Zavanic  pronounced the verdicts on a group of 19 Albanians charged with  collaboration with the intention of hostile activity and  territorial infringement toward Yugoslavia. The prosecutor gave  up the indictment against one defendant, while another was set  apart from the penal procedure for health reasons. Meanwhile,  17 others were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment.    During this trial, about which numerous remarks were made,  there were no witnesses at all to support, with even one word,  the criminal act with which the Albanian defendants were  charged. That is why we should nevertheless stress that this  fact itself and the numerous violations of procedure against the  defendants, both in the prosecutor's office or outside it,  testify that this trial was completely a trumped-up political  endeavor to convict as well as compromise the peaceful policy  that the Albanian people in Kosova are following.    We should finally say that during the last 10 days alone,  the  Serbian communist justice sentenced 26 Albanians, nine in Peje  and 17 in Prishtina, to a total of 120 years of imprisonment,  something which testifies to the brutality and banality of a  regime which denounces even the silent thought of Albanians.</p>

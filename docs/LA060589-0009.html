			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITY HIRING ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> Thompson's column caught my eye. The writer discusses minority hiring in  colleges -- this is a problem, even in private institutions. As a student at a  private graduate school, I found myself, a black, older woman, pretty much  excluded, even in the classroom.  </P> <P> Issues were discussed in relation to the white population. As a black, older  woman it was as though I did not exist. If I asked a question it was not given  serious consideration -- it was "entertained" shall we say, and then it was  time to get down to "serious" questions.  </P> <P> There is a pervasive attitude in the schools of learning toward women. They are  not looked upon as prospective "professors." One white woman in the class who  was about 60 was treated as though she was possessed of dementia. Her questions  were deferred and demurred.  </P> <P> What is at issue here is that minorities -- and that includes women of all  colors -- are discriminated against in colleges and graduate schools when it  comes to faculty hiring.  </P> <P> The colleges and graduate schools want their tuition monies but they do not  want to hire them. But comes the fund-raising from the alumni-alumnae -- we are  brothers all of us and we must support the venerable institutions of learning.  Let us pray!  </P> <P> ELINORA WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

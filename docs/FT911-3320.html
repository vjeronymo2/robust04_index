			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Refining side boosts Chevron earnings A JUMP in Chevron's first-quarter refining and marketing income more than offset a decline in US exploration and production, resulting in an 18 per cent rise in net earnings for the San Francisco-based energy producer. Earnings climbed to Dollars 557m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from Dollars 473m, or Dollars 1.33, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.8bn from Dollars 9.3bn. Despite the sharp increase for the period as a whole, Mr Ken Derr, Chevron chief executive, noted that earnings slid at the end of the period as crude oil prices settled at lower levels, US refining margins began to erode and prices and demand for natural gas fell. Refining and marketing income soared to Dollars 233m from Dollars 130m. This year's profits would have been higher without a Dollars 47m charge for environmental provisions and asset write-offs. Sales of natural gas in the US edged down to just less than 3m cubic feet a day, from 3.1m cu ft last year. Income from chemicals dipped to Dollars 73m from Dollars 123m, but last year's figure included a Dollars 59m gain from chemicals licensing agreements. Operating earnings increased by 14 per cent.</p>

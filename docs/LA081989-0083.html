			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREEN IS FIRED, DENT PROMOTED BY YANKEES  </P> <P> It was on a quiet morning in spring training that Dallas Green reflected on the  fact he brought to the New York Yankees a blustery personality similar to that  of the team owner.  </P> <P> Green said it was a volatile situation that would create an inevitable  confrontion.  </P> <P> The inevitability recently became a reality, leading Friday to another  inevitability: Green's firing as manager of the Yankees for apparently refusing  to make coaching changes that the owner, George Steinbrenner, demanded.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner announced that former shortstop Bucky Dent, manager of the club's  triple-A affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, for the last three years, will replace  Green, who was removed with a year remaining on his two-year contract.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner also fired four of Green's coaches -- Pat Corrales, Lee Elia,  Charlie Fox and Frank Howard -- although Howard was first offered Dent's job at  Columbus, which he turned down. Rick Down, a roving hitting instructor who  formerly coached with the Angels, was selected to replace Dent at Columbus.  </P> <P> Two of Green's staff -- bullpen coach John Stearns and pitching coach Billy  Connors -- were retained by Steinbrenner to work with Dent, while Mike Ferraro  and Gene Michael were reassigned by the organization and will coach first and  third base, respectively. Champ Summers, a minor league hitting instructor,  will join the major league staff in a similar capacity.  </P> <P> The managerial change, coming with the sixth-place Yankees at 56-65 and 7 1/2  games behind the first-place Baltimore Orioles in the American League East, is  the 17th since Steinbrenner purchased the team in 1973. Dent became  Steinbrenner's 11th different manager.  </P> <P> Four of the others -- Billy Martin, Lou Piniella, Clyde King and Michael -- are  still employed by the Yankees in various capacities.  </P> <P> "Some things never change," Green said Friday, alluding to his firing and the  Yankees' instability.  </P> <P> Said relief ace Dave Righetti: "I respected Dallas and his coaches. They worked  hard and I appreciated that. But this just goes with the territory here. We've  never had it any other way. To me, this is normal -- and that's no joke."  </P> <P> Added first baseman/designated hitter Ken Phelps: "There are six weeks left in  the season. If they were going to do this, it would have made more sense to  bring back (former managers) Billy (Martin) or Lou (Piniella), someone more  familiar with the team."  </P> <P> The latest change took shape two weeks ago when Steinbrenner publicly derided  Green and his coaching staff for aligning fielders in the wrong places and for  what he perceived to be a lack of effort by the team.  </P> <P> The outspoken Green refused to back away, calling Steinbrenner "manager George"  and a second-guesser. Green predicted at the time that he would be fired.  </P> <P> Neither Green nor Steinbrenner were available for more than brief statements  Friday, but Green confirmed that his firing revolved around Steinbrenner's  desire to make changes in the coaching staff.  </P> <P> "I told him, as I always told him, that if he's going to do that, the head  honcho, the manager, has to go first," Green said, hurrying to leave the team's  Detroit hotel Friday morning.  </P> <P> Said Steinbrenner, in a statement released through the team's publicity  department: "We welcome Bucky, who has worked hard for this chance. I still  consider Dallas to be a close friend."  </P> <P> Later, while refusing to answer questions, Steinbrenner added: "I made a  change. I've got nothing critical at all to say about Dallas Green. Perhaps  there were things I did that disappointed him and things he did that  disappointed me. I'm sorry that Dallas and I aren't going to see this thing  through together."  </P> <P> Green, who managed the Philadelphia Phillies to a World Series victory in 1980  and helped the Chicago Cubs win an Eastern Division title in 1984 as general  manager, was hired to manage the Yankees on Oct. 7, 1988.  </P> <P> He was the first manager selected by Steinbrenner from outside the organization  and, with the owner's urging, promised a new discipline and team ethic.  </P> <P> The Yankees opened the season with a victory in Minnesota, lost their next  seven games, and have never been more than two games above .500.  </P> <P> Free-agent pitcher Andy Hawkins has been the only constant in a rotation that  had to be rebuilt after the release of Tommy John and Richard Dotson, injuries  to Dave LaPoint and John Candelaria and the trade of Al Leiter. The Yankee  pitching staff had a 4.54 earned-run average -- the American League's worst --  going into Friday night's game at Detroit, which New York lost, 7-3.  </P> <P> The offense -- decimated by the injury to Dave Winfield, the trade of Jack  Clark and the free-agent departure of Claudell Washington -- has also been  inconsistent, with the Yankees trading for Mel Hall, Jesse Barfield and Steve  Balboni in a modest attempt to improve the production, then finally trading  Rickey Henderson in hopes of strengthening the pitching.  </P> <P> Of Green's firing, second baseman Steve Sax said: "I respect Dallas and feel  sorry for him. It's been tough with all the injuries and changes. I thought he  did a good job."  </P> <P> Said first baseman Don Mattingly: "Dallas worked hard and he never gave up on  us. In his heart, I think he really believed we were going to win it. It's too  early to talk about the timing of this thing. We'll have to see if the change  turns it around."  </P> <P> Dent, 37, had a 68-62 record this season at Columbus. Dent, who has a 367-344  record in five seasons of managing -- three at Columbus and two at Class-A Ft.  Lauderdale, retired as a player in 1984 after 12 seasons in the majors, six  with the Yankees.  </P> <P> He had a career batting average of .247, delivering his biggest hit -- a  three-run homer off Mike Torrez -- in the Yankees' 5-4 victory over the Boston  Red Sox in the one-game playoff for the 1978 division title, the year the  Yankees won their last World Series.  </P> <P> New York trailed by 14 games in August of that summer, and Dent said Friday  that he was confident the 1989 team can overcome its deficit.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about the opportunity and realistic about the pressure and  problems," he said. "I can only try and do my best for as long as it lasts. I  know the track record here. I know there are no guarantees."  </P> <P> It was only last February, in fact, that George Steinbrenner was saying that  Dallas Green faced no problems, that he would still be managing the New York  Yankees when they won the World Series in October.  </P> <P> </P> <P> YANKEE MANAGERS  </P> <P> Yankee managerial changes under George Steinbrenner's ownership:  </P> <P> Sept. 30, 1973 -- Ralph Houk resigned.  </P> <P> Jan. 3, 1974 -- Bill Virdon named.  </P> <P> Aug. 1, 1975 -- Virdon fired.

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> UCI MEDICAL CENTER PICKETED OVER TALKS  </P> <P> About 30 medical technicians and supporters picketed UCI Medical Center for an  hour Tuesday to demand a raise.  </P> <P> At one point a security guard threatened to have demonstrators arrested for  disturbing the peace, but the pickets dispersed peacefully, said psychiatric  technician Les Lyon, president of the technicians' union.  </P> <P> The technicians carried signs that said: "First Class Hospital -- Second Class  Wages," and "Mary Piccione -- You Got A Good Raise. Now We'd Like One."  </P> <P> Piccione, director of the medical center, earned $136,163 annually until  December, when her pay was boosted to $143,600 a year, a medical center  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Lyon said, the 714 members of his union -- a mix of licensed  vocational nurses, ward clerks and medical technicians -- earn $1,400 to $3,000  a month.  </P> <P> Talks reached an impasse March 30, with union leaders seeking a 6% wage  increase and administrators offering an average of 2.9%, Lyon said. Medical  center officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Lyon vowed to picket again soon if there is no movement in talks: "We've got to  call some attention to this. This is my third year without a raise, and I'm  looking at a 1% increase in salary. There's reason enough to be angry." LANIE  JONES  </P></p>

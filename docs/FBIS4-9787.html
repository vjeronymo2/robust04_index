			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 3 Apr (DPA) -- Today, Cuban Ambassador  to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera said the government of Cuban  President Fidel Castro may be willing to allow foreign investors  to play a greater role in the country's enterprises. The  diplomatic spokesman added, "We in the Castro administration are  resorting to mechanisms that are even more flexible than those  adopted by the PRC when it began implementing its economic  reforms. The mechanisms are so flexible that we may even  consider making some exceptions."    Aguilera, who recently took office, pointed out that  although  Cuba insists on maintaining its position of using "mostly Cuban  capital" within the majority of joint enterprises, "we are  willing to make exceptions in cases of national interest."    In an interview granted to LA REPUBLICA newspaper, Aguilera  stressed, "there could be a case of a joint enterprise in which  the state would not own most of the stock; that is, most of the  capital would come from a foreign firm or from several foreign  firms." As for Cuba's opposition to implementing a free market  economy, Aguilera explained that in order to move forward, "we  must create innovative methods that allow us not only to retain  the ownership of our basic means of production and resources,  but also to unleash certain forces [liberen determinadas  fuerzas]." Havana's representative in Montevideo said that the  unleashing of these forces "will create a tangible Cuban  presence in international markets by way of joint enterprises.  This is why we are opening the country (Cuba) to foreign  capital; we need resources, technology, and markets."    Aguilera's statements were disclosed just before Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's 4 April arrival. Robaina is  scheduled to make a three-day official visit to Uruguay.  Uruguayan political circles are viewing Robaina's arrival with  heightened interest because a foreign minister under the Castro  administration has not visited this South American country since  1986, when former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti was in  power. The last trip made by a Cuban foreign minister to Uruguay  took place 20 years after the two countries broke off bilateral  diplomatic relations. One diplomatic source in Montevideo  reported that after meeting with Uruguayan President Luis  Lacalle and other prominent individuals, Robaina will visit  Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>

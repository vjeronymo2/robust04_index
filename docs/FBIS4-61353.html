			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 28, RIA -- Russia's active  participation in all the European processes was high on the  agenda at the inter-parliamentary seminar, "Will Europe Exist  Without Russia?" in a RIA interview, Vice-Speaker Valentin  Kovalev said: "The world has become one-polar, which creates  additional problems for Russia and Europe. Russia's current role  in the European process is obviously not in keeping with its  potential."    The Russian MP [Member of Parliament] pointed to the need of  Russia's joining all European political and economic structures.  "The promptness with which Russia may occupy its due place in  Europe will largely depend on the solution of internal  problems," said Kovalev.    The inter-parliamentary seminar, which opened today at the  Moscow-based Russian Academy of Sciences, was organised by  Europarliament and the National Assembly of France. Deputies of  the State Duma take part.</p>

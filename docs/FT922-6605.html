			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology: Crossing the lines - Hugo Dixon explains the commotion surrounding the way Britain's telephone numbers are allocated It is easy to see why Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is annoyed. Eight months after announcing a new telephone numbering system for the UK with full backing of the industry, the consensus which underpinned its decision is unravelling. The ensuing furore is complicating Sir Bryan Carsberg's last days as Oftel's Director General before he leaves to head the Office of Fair Trading next month. He would like to resolve the dispute but is anxious not to rush into a decision which might in several years be seen as a ghastly error. The unravelling of the original consensus is almost entirely the work of Richard Cox, a Cardiff-based telecommunications consultant. Over the past year, he has unearthed information which challenges some of the premises on which Oftel's decision was based. 'If the information now available had been provided two years ago, there would never have been any question of approval being given to the number change,' he claims. The planned number change involves putting a '1' after the initial '0' in each telephone code. For example, York's 0904 code would become 01904. The idea is to create more numbers to deal with a shortage caused by the growth of new services. The Telecommunications Managers Association (TMA), which represents large users, has taken up Cox's arguments. In a confidential paper to Oftel earlier this year, it said that the total cost of the code change would be Pounds 3bn, as equipment was modified or even scrapped, stationery reprinted and the public informed. Moreover, the TMA argued that the change would be anti-competitive and would not even achieve its objective. It has urged Oftel to delay the change from 1994 until 1996 and to review the plan from scratch. But the Telecommunications Users' Association, another user group, and BT, Britain's largest telecommunications group, strongly back the original decision. And, although Oftel has had to pause to reassess details of the code change such as whether it could be phased in to reduce disruption to customers, it believes there is no better alternative. Those supporting the change argue that delay will confuse customers and stifle the growth of telecommunications services because it would be impossible to find new numbers. They also say that the TMA's costings are exaggerated - Oftel has put the total cost at only Pounds 1bn - and that this cost would be incurred even if there were a delay. But what has most annoyed Oftel is its view that critics have reneged on a consensus that was reached after three years' discussion in the Telephone Numbering Administration Board (TNAB), a group which included the TMA. Although there is little chance of the scheme being scrapped, the storm has exposed defects in the way Oftel operates. The most important of these is the climate of secrecy. 'It is difficult to see how (TNAB), operating with undue secrecy and with no formal channel of accountability, can be seen as having achieved open consultation,' the TMA said in its paper to Oftel. TNAB met behind closed doors and for long periods Oftel refused to tell journalists what was happening. Moreover, data to support the main contention that the UK is running out of numbers and a full explanation of how the code change will solve the alleged problem have still not been made public. At first sight, the idea that the UK is running out of numbers seems odd. The current numbering system - consisting of a '0' followed by up to nine digits - has a theoretical capacity of 1bn numbers of which only 30m are being used. The reason for this inefficiency is that numbers are allocated in two stages. First, codes are given to cities, rural communities and non-geographical services such as mobile communications and freephone services. Then numbers are given to customers. The problem is that the numbers are unevenly spread, with some cities packed full and rural areas almost empty. Moreover, there are few unused codes left for new services and overflowing cities. Critics of the change say the shortage is not too severe because customers could be fairly easily moved from codes which are little used, freeing up extra codes for busy cities. A code such as 0393 for Foula in Scotland, which now has 25 customers, could theoretically accommodate 1m. Advocates of the change say this type of 'code recovery' is expensive and would not create enough numbers. But this claim is difficult to judge because Oftel has refused to publish information on either the future demand for numbers or the state of supply. The only person who has is Cox and his figures (see graph) seem to support the contention that 'code recovery' could buy breathing space. Cox's other contention is that the code change will not solve the numbers shortage. It will only be the first step in a series of changes which will cause further disruption. The essential point is that putting a '1' after the initial '0' will in itself achieve nothing except make numbers longer. It is only when other digits such as 2, 3 and 4 are inserted that the supply of numbers increases. But no decision has been taken on how these other digits will be used. And there has been no public debate on what the numbering system will eventually look like. Will Britain move to a uniform system of 10 digits as in the US or continue with the current system where some numbers have more digits than others? What will happen to cities that run out of numbers? Five - Leeds, Nottingham, Bristol, Sheffield and Leicester - have nearly run out. BT has put forward a plan that would involve such cities changing both their numbers and codes. Oftel believes it is premature to answer such questions because it is unclear how technology and the market will develop in the future. The main aim should be to build enough flexibility into the system so that it can last for perhaps half a century. The snag is that by taking a decision which sets the framework for the future without thinking through the consequences, Oftel may soon find itself boxed in. Although the code change will be flexible in the sense of providing many options for future development, it may be that none is particularly palatable.  -----------------------------------------------              UK TELEPHONE CODES  ----------------------------------------------- Top 20 Codes Code       Location                Customers  ----------------------------------------------- 71      London (incl. 81)           5,500,000 61      Manchester                   835,000 21      Birmingham                   719,000 51      Liverpool                    562,000 41      Glasgow                      487,000  ----------------------------------------------- 912     Tyneside (incl. 914)          380,000 532     Leeds                        316,000 602     Nottingham                   290,000 31      Edinburgh                    279,000 272     Bristol                      260,000  ----------------------------------------------- 742     Sheffield                    256,000 533     Leicester                    224,000 202     Bournemouth                  204,000 232     Belfast                      197,000 273     Brighton                     195,000  ----------------------------------------------- 203     Coventry                     188,000 703     Southampton                  185,000 782     Stoke-on-Trent               180,000 642     Middlesborough               176,000 222     Cardiff                      176,000  ----------------------------------------------- Bottom 20 Codes Code       Location                Customers  ----------------------------------------------- 393     Foula                             25 351     Fair Isle                         50 951     Colonsay                         100 528     Laggan                           200 972     Glenborrodale                    200  ----------------------------------------------- 809     Tomdoun                          200 936     Crewe (outer)                    200 601     Northampton (outer)              300 906     Worthing                         350 882     Kinloch Rannoch                  400  ----------------------------------------------- 680     Craignure                        400 966     Hawkshead                        400 657     Millom                           400 681     Fionnphort                       400 808     Tomatin                          400  ----------------------------------------------- 468     Hornby                           400 879     Scarinish                        500 571     Lochinver                        500 431     Helmsdale                        500 838     Dalmally                         500  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Mandarin Technology  -----------------------------------------------</p>

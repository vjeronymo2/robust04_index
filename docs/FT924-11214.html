			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Two principles for Hong Kong FOR A COUNTRY more than 3,000 years old, four years and eight months is a very short time. In angrily dismissing the modest plans of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, for political reform and threatening to reverse them when it regains sovereignty over the territory on July 1 1997, China has signalled that it is quite prepared to wait him out. For Beijing, this is merely the last irritating chapter in its attempts to wrest the best harbour on its coast back from duplicitous Britain. For Mr Patten, however, failure by China to respond in any way to his proposals would be damaging, despite his bold challenge to Beijing to come up with better ones. Hong Kong people will increasingly feel that the broadening of the democratic base is pointless if, instead of being on the 'through train' to Chinese rule which negotiators have been attempting to create, they seem to be accelerating straight into a set of buffers. China's position may be bluster. Mr Patten will have expected a hostile response in Beijing - though perhaps not the degree of vilification whipped up by the Chinese press - but his gamble must remain that China will feel bound either to negotiate or to acquiesce. Popular support The best reason for hope that it will eventually respond is that it is in China's political and economic interests to do so. By overtly seeking - and apparently winning - broad popular support in Hong Kong, Mr Patten has touched Beijing on a very raw nerve. The integration of the Hong Kong economy with that of the neighbouring regions of China should have progressed still further by 1997. The Communist party wants the region to be the next industrialising tiger while remaining under its control, already a difficult balancing act. The last thing Beijing wants is militant opposition among the best-off 6m people at the heart of it. The sacrifices involved in precipitate action by Beijing would be far greater than at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Popular support is Mr Patten's strongest weapon - which makes it all the more important that he do everything he can to carry all quarters of Hong Kong society with him. Support from ordinary Hong Kong people is important in order to keep the goad in China's back. Backing from the business community, which appeared to be showing the first signs of anxiety yesterday, is equally important. Many pillars of that community have favoured a softly, softly approach to China, feeling that this best safeguarded their future. Mr Patten's view is that prosperity would be best protected by his proposed changes. He will have to convince them that he is right. Airport row Two principles are involved in planning Hong Kong's future: first, that its citizens should be as free as possible; and second, that prosperity should be assured. Mr Patten is right to bind them together, but some in Hong Kong worry that the first will get in the way of the second. The main symbol of future prosperity for many local businessmen is Hong Kong's Pounds 13bn airport project. It, too, has become embroiled in the current political row. China's reaction to Mr Patten's proposals clouds the prospects for a quick agreement on airport financing, and that must mean that the project's future is in doubt. This would not, however, be the disaster that people in the business community are likely to paint it. Hong Kong already has a good - if crowded  -airport, and others are being built nearby. Hong Kong does not need a new airport at any price. Britain's change of style in dealing with China comes very late. It may be seen by history as the last, possibly futile, gesture in a botched withdrawal which has done little justice to the citizens of one of the most successful parts of Britain's former empire. But Mr Patten's attempt to boost democratic choice within the framework of Britain's agreement with China deserves support. The effort, however late and limited, is worthwhile. The fact is that it is in China's interest that Hong Kong people should be confident about the future and have a new airport. Mr Patten has not acted unilaterally. He has made proposals. Beijing should discuss them with him instead of abusing him.</p>

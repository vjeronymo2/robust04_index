			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nestle offers rights issue to US institutional investors NESTLE is arranging for US institutional investors to participate in its imminent rights issue. It is a pioneering initiative which is likely to be followed by other large European companies. Nestle, the world's largest foods company, is invoking a 1990 US Securities and Exchange Commission rule which permits non-US registered companies to make offerings to 'qualified institutional buyers'. Rule 144A has been used to enable non-US registered companies to float new debt and equity issues in the US. Nestle is the first to use it for a rights issue. Nestle believes 15 per cent of its shares are held by US investors, most of them institutions. Until now, these investors have not been allowed to participate in the group's rights issues because of US legal restrictions on fund raising by non-US-registered companies. 'This was not very fair and it depressed the market for the rights,' Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said at the group's annual press conference yesterday. Mr Helmut Maucher, the chairman, told the meeting that first-quarter group sales rose 6 per cent to SFr13.5bn (Dollars 9bn). Only 1 per cent of the growth was volume, with another 1 per cent from monetary effects and the rest from acquisitions. However, Mr Maucher was confident that the group would have 'a decent profit and sales increase this year'. In 1992, Nestle net income was SFr2.7bn on sales of SFr54.5bn. Mr Domeniconi said the extension of the rights issue to US institutional shareholders would be done in the guise of a private placement lead managed by Lehman Brothers International. Individual US Nestle shareholders still cannot exercise their rights. The rights issue was launched following last year's FFr13.3bn (Dollars 2.5bn) takeover of the Perrier mineral water group which has been financed by short-term borrowing. The rights will be on a 1-for-25 basis at a price to be set after May 27. Mr Domeniconi said the issue would raise more than SFr1bn. The Perrier acquisition was largely responsible for the sharp rise in the group's net debt to SFr9.9bn at the end of last year, 67.7 per cent of total capital, from SFr4.5bn at the end of 1991. However, imminent sales of some Perrier subsidiaries would bring the final acquisition cost down to about SFr2.3bn. Nestle is one of a few big European companies considering applying for a listing on the New York stock exchange. However, Mr Domeniconi argued that meeting SEC disclosure requirements would require a 'tremendous effort' without giving shareholders better information than they get now.</p>

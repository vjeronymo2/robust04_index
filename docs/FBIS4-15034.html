			<p>BFN     [Text] Last month Russian border guards detained 250  persons for illegally crossing the border. The total figure  since the beginning of the year exceeds 900. This was disclosed  in a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX by the chief of the  information department of the Russian Border Force Major-General  Aleksandr Manilov. He said that last month together with  customs officials border guards seized over 120 kilos of drugs  and 100 firearms in seven instances.    Manilov said the situation remains worst on the Tajik-Afghan  border where 18 attempts by militants to break through were  foiled last March. Frontier posts and pickets came under fire  11 times, in three cases from the territory of Afghanistan.    The general expects a rise in the activeness of militants on  the border, primarily on the Pyandzh, Moskovsky and Horog  sections, and a simultaneous rise in terrorism on the Tajik side  of the frontier.    If the talks between the Tajik Government and opposition  fail, Manilov said, the so-called government in exile will  evidently launch coordinated actions in the areas of Kalai-Hum,  Horog and Ishkashim.    Manilov described the situation on other sections of the  border as "relatively stable".</p>

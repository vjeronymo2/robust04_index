			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 54-year-old man has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for producing  sexually explicit videotapes and photos of children and for trying to bring the  materials into the United States, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William Enright sentenced Richard Helwig, 54, of San  Francisco, to the 14-year term on Tuesday, Asst. U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Joan P. Weber said. Helwig had been convicted last September of two  pornography-related charges and a third count of jumping bail after his initial  arrest, Weber said.  </P> <P> Helwig was arrested last March at the San Ysidro border crossing when U.S.  Customs officials found more than 130 photos showing children in sexually  explicit poses, Weber said. Officers also found photographic film and  videotapes that depicted a small girl in explicit poses, Weber said. Through  papers found in Helwig's camper, customs agents traced the girl -- who turned  out to be 9 years old and deaf -- to a small village near the Mexican resort of  Puerto Vallarta where Helwig lived part-time, Weber said.  </P> <P> Helwig was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison for the central  charge against him, formally called "sexual exploitation of children," Weber  said. Enright imposed a separate three-year term for transporting material  involving the sexual exploitation of children and another separate term, one  year, for bail jumping, Weber said.  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Down the greasy pole - Autumn Fiction DOCTOR CRIMINALE by Malcolm Bradbury Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 344 pages NOW YOU KNOW by Michael Frayn Viking Pounds 14.99, 282 pages THE world of Malcolm Bradbury's disappointingly uneven novel is post-modern and deeply flawed; its leading characters are shallow, devious and cravenly ambitious. The Doctor Criminale of the title is a feted east European polymath who jets around the international conference circuit leaving a trail of abandoned wives and lovers besides, it transpires, a good deal more than dirty bed-linen. On his heels is the appallingly chinless Francis Jay, striving to write a television profile of the great man and make his own mark. The satire, if that is what it is, is heavy-handed. The philosopher-critic Criminale is an unlikely chimera of the likes of Steiner and Eco, while Jay is an amalgam of any number of upwardly mobile young journalists who flit eagerly from the 'style' pages of one broadsheet newspaper to the next. The jokes are thinly scattered and the book's set-pieces spill across all the frontiers of the new Europe of the 1990s. Fact and fiction are mingled lubriciously; Susan Sontag and Martin Amis, unlikely soulmates, seem to pop up everywhere. In the opening and closing pages, the humour is targeted much more carefully. The beginning, at a Booker prize dinner, is genuinely funny and its awful vignettes - with every publisher's promotion manager called Fiona and every presenter of the BBC's Late Show heavily pregnant - will strike chords with anyone who has watched even five minutes of the ritual on TV. In between, though, the effect is much more diffuse; Bradbury sets up too many targets and falls short of all of them. Perhaps his novel really is an honest attempt to get to grips with the chaos of post-cold war thought, the onward march of the European superstate, the sheer vapidity of TV culture. But it reads much more like a trawl through Bradbury's own fond memories of lavish academic freebies. Of course, there may be a profound post-modern irony buried somewhere in all the gush; if so, it sailed over my head. Michael Frayn's altogether tighter fable attempts far less and achieves far more. Its world is carefully circumscribed, almost claustrophobic, its grip on characters relentless and revealing. Which does not necessarily make it all that convincing: Hilary, the studious young civil servant who throws over her career in the Home Office to work for a left-wing civil liberties organisation while having an affair with its curiously charismatic leader Terry, never comes fully to life. Her motivations always remain something of a mystery; everyone has another life outside the office, yet hers never quite coalesces, never fits the final piece into the jigsaw. Yet, Frayn's ear for dialogue is unfailing as the story unfolds through the eyes and ears of all the staff of this murky outfit. He cuts from one voice to the next with consummate skill, catching every subtlety of language and tone; when the whole organisation begins to tear itself apart, the internal frictions, the tiny niggles, are mapped precisely. In its own way it is a tour de force, even if the sum of all the parts is finally rather modest.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / In the 27 years since the last great flood, there has been a lot of discussion but little action to save one of the world's great treasures, write David Lascelles and Robert Graham It was in November 1966 that Venice was swamped by the worst floods for several centuries. The disaster woke the world to the perils facing one of the treasures of western civilisation. But today, more than 27 years later, not a stone has been laid to prevent a recurrence of the disaster, in spite of the combined problems of subsidence and rising sea levels which threaten the city. 'La citta non ha fatto nulla. The city has done nothing,' says Rinio Bruttomesso, director of Citta d'Acqua, the Venice-based association of waterfront cities. 'The Dutch have built new barrages, London has built the Thames barrier. This city has nothing, only plans.' Bruttomesso is certainly right about the plans. In a spacious palazzo on the Campo San Stefano near the Accademia bridge, Francesco Bandarin, an architect, has a detailed design for Venice's sea defences. He works for the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, the government-appointed consortium of building and engineering companies which was charged nine years ago with the task of protecting Venice from floods. He knows the problem in minute detail: the tidal currents, the type of barrage needed, the cost, the timescale for construction. The plan is for an elaborate system of barriers to close off the three large entrances to the lagoon, consisting of rows of giant hollow metal boxes fixed to hinges on the sea floor. When high tides threatened, they would be filled with air and swung up to hold the water back. Across the square, Bandarin's colleague, Paolo Baschieri, occupies a building full of computers into which has been fed a mass of information about the Venice lagoon: depth, temperature, concentrations of pollutants, tidal charts. At the push of a button he can print-out maps showing whatever the inquirer wants to know. But apart from a working model of the proposed barrage, the practical application has got no further. 'We've already spent more time waiting for this project than it will actually take to build,' says Bandarin. Like much of what happens - or does not happen - in Italy, the blame for this state of affairs can be laid at the door of the politicians. In the aftermath of the 1966 disaster, the Rome government made a prompt response: it declared the city's fate a matter of national interest, and provided money to enable work to start not just on flood protection but also cleaning up the lagoon and restoring buildings. Much has been achieved in these last two areas, partly with international support. Many fine palazzos and churches have been re-opened. Shipping channels have been dredged, and water treatment plants built on the edge of the lagoon. But Venice's problems have become increasingly caught up in the chaos and corruption of Italian politics. At the national level, Rome created a proliferation of laws and agencies to deal with its problems, but persistently postponed the big decisions. When the Consorzio produced its barrage proposals in 1989, the government sent them back because they were too intrusive. Rome wanted a barrier that lay entirely hidden underwater. So, in 1992, the Consorzio sent in revised plans which met these criteria. The plans are still in the government's in-tray. At the local level, the highly politicised Venetian administration fought for state aid, not so much to protect the city as to have the money to disburse patronage and influence. During the latter part of the 1980s, Venice was cynically carved up between the Christian Democrats and Socialists with a tacit deal to let the voluble Gianni De Michelis, the Socialist foreign minister, become a latter-day Doge. He, along with his entire Venice network, has been swept aside by the corruption scandals which have rocked Italy in the past two years. Several of these related directly to Venice: at one stage last year De Michelis was assailed by a hostile crowd. But politics is not the whole story. The longer the delay, the more doubts have grown as to whether the grand barrier scheme is really the answer to Venice's problems. Time has enlarged people's understanding of Venice's predicament. Other perils have come to be viewed as equally threatening as the famous floods. The position has become much more complex, the priorities less clear. Venice is now seen not just as a jewel to be saved but as part of a vast environmental and economic system represented by the Venetian lagoon. Any solution to Venice's particular problems must be balanced with regard to other interests. This 550 sq km of water, for example, is home to Italy's largest petrochemical complex, at Mestre, upon which 15,000 jobs depend. Anything that interferes with the free movement of traffic in the lagoon or activity on its shores could threaten their livelihoods. The lagoon also receives the run-offs - and thus the mess - from nearly 2,000 sq km of the surrounding watershed. Then there are the less well-known problems of Venice itself: the shortage of housing and jobs which is driving away young people; lack of money to dredge the canals; absence of a proper sewage system. The key point in the new phase of the debate is whether the barrage should be the top priority - whether it is even necessary. The Consorzio argues that it is. According to Bandarin, Venice now suffers from a mild form of flooding called alta acqua (high tide) more than 40 times a year, compared with only six times at the start of the century. This is partly because of rising sea levels, partly because Mestre's industries have sucked out the ground water and caused Venice's foundations to sink. The combined effect has been to leave Venice 23cm lower in the water. Water laps above the impermeable Istrian stone which the resourceful Venetians used to build their foundations, and soaks the brickwork, allowing the damp to rise and attack the walls and plaster. Bandarin calculates that the chances of a catastrophic flood have increased from once every 800 years to once every 200. But is that a sufficient risk to justify a project equivalent to half a Eurotunnel? Paolo Costa, rector of the University of Venice, who occupies an office in one of the palazzos overlooking the Grand Canal, says: 'The idea of defending Venice from the sea is declining. It's technically difficult, and there is uncertainty about the size of the risk.' People have learnt to live with high tides, he says. They move their precious things upstairs and put barricades across their doorways to hold the water back. People have also begun to challenge the Consorzio's interest in the issue. They accuse it of deliberately stirring up fears of floods in order to win government contracting business for its members. It is certainly the case, as the Consorzio concedes, that Venice's sinking problem appears to have eased now that steps have been taken to halt the depletion of the aquifers. But Bandarin raises the threat of global warming and the melting of the polar ice caps. 'Do you see the sea being higher or lower in the years ahead?' He also rejects criticism of the Consorzio's 'big business' approach. 'There's been a noticeable cultural shift in this office away from big engineering to incorporate environmental factors,' he says. Some 60 per cent of the Consorzio's budget goes on environmental work, such as restoring wetlands and bringing lost sediment back into the lagoon. But even among those who share the Consorzio's view that floods are the greatest threat, there is scepticism as to whether a barrage is the best answer. They fear the project would upset the ecology and tidal flows of the lagoon. Alternatives have been canvassed, such as filling in the shipping channels to staunch the flood tides, but, as Bandarin points out, the largest channel did not even exist at the time of the 1966 floods. If support for the barrage is waning, what priorities are taking its place? The clean-up of the lagoon is the strongest contender. Although much has already been done to stop discharges of raw sewage and industrial effluent, water quality is still poor, even filthy at times. The problem lies not just with the local municipalities which are within Venice's control, but with distant towns and villages bordering rivers which feed the lagoon. Much of this pollution is agricultural nutrient which causes eutrification - unnatural growth of algae - and threatens fish life. Would it not be better if the right standards were applied across the watershed? Much of the clean-up campaign has also targeted Mestre's petrochemical and oil refining industries, and the large tankers which have to enter the lagoon to serve them. Last year, Carlo Ripa di Meana, then the environment minister, visited the site and suggested that it would be good if industry moved out. His remarks caused a furore and led to a demonstration by industrial workers in the Grand Canal. His words reinforced a body of opinion which argues that Mestre's industry is inappropriate to the locality, and should be replaced with commerce and light industry. Rinio Bruttomesso at Citta d'Acqua, for example, says Venice would be better off if these 'dying industries' were replaced by a commercial shipping terminal and a science and technology park. There is also support for educational establishments to complement the two universities in Venice itself. But the management and workers at the state-owned Enichem plant are fighting back. Lucio Pisani, the director, says the company has spent L125bn (Pounds 50m) on environmental improvements over the last three years, and now returns water to the lagoon that is cleaner than that it took out. It is only because Enichem is so big, he says, that it can afford such hefty environmental investments. 'The problem of the lagoon is not petrochemicals,' he says. 'We are a living demonstration that a petrochemical plant can live alongside a historic city.' Environmentalists would go a stage further and have the whole Venice lagoon declared a national park. 'The lagoon is a very complex ecosystem,' says Alberto Bargossi of Legambiente Veneto, a local environmental pressure group. 'Each part can't be separated from the whole system and the problems can't be solved separately. We have to face all the problems at the same time.' But he adds: 'First of all we must stop polluting the water.' Venice's fate is caught up in Italy's fast-changing political scene. Much will depend on the outcome of the March 27 general elections, but already the campaign against corruption, and public pressure for sound government are having an effect, as the drubbing of De Michelis showed. In this climate, Venice's future stands a better chance of being weighed on its merits than of being bent to political ends. The outgoing Ciampi government has taken an important step which should begin to rationalise the bodies with a hand in Venice's future. In January, a decree was approved to create a company with a L80bn capital which will be majority-owned by the state, the rest split between the Veneto region, Venice itself (which includes Mestre) and the coastal town of Chioggia. The company will have responsibility for all conservation and environmental activity related to the lagoon. This means that the Consorzio will be downgraded and limited to studies and construction work relating to the tides. Italian local administration has also been opened up with new municipal laws which enable mayors to be elected directly rather than chosen in smoke-filled rooms. Last December, Massimo Cacciari, a philosophy professor from Venice's Architecture University, was elected mayor under these rules, heading a broad 'progressive' alliance backed by the Party of the Democratic Left, formerly the communist party, and the green vote. The city is waiting to see how he balances the pressures of the environment with the region's social and economic demands. Marino Folin, rector of the Architecture University, who knows Cacciari well, says he expects him to put the development of Mestre and housing at the top of the list. Cacciari has welcomed the new company because he wants to ensure that environmental protection is better co-ordinated. He says: 'With this single bridge from which to command, things can be pushed forward much faster and more efficiently.' Where this leaves the barrage is hard to say. Dr Luigi Zanda, the president of the Consorzio, says the elections 'will have very positive repercussions' by bringing much-needed stability to the political scene. 'We think 1994 will be a very important year for Venice because of the new mayor,' he says, 'and the fact that the government is creating the new agency to safeguard Venice.' He still thinks the barrage can be built by the end of the century.</p>

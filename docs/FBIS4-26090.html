			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The Business  Coalition on U.S.-China Trade issued a statement today strongly  opposing a congressional bill seeking to re-establish links  between the bilateral trade and human rights.    The bill, introduced today by four democrats, including  Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy  Pelosy, advocates imposing sanctions on products made by the  Chinese Liberation Army, defense-related companies and certain  state-owned enterprises.    Any such sanctions bill will undermine the president's  leadership on China policy and cripple the ability of American  companies to compete successfully in the fast-growing China  market, affirmed the business coalition in its statement.    Mitchell and Pelosy have been trying to revoke President  Bill  Clinton's decision on May 26 of renewing China's MFN  [most-favored nation] status unconditionally and delinking trade  and human rights.    They had also played a leading role in the Bush  administration in attempting to impose conditions on China's MFN.    Approval of this bill could send confusing signals about the  reliability of American suppliers and undermine the efforts of  American companies to create exports, markets, and additional  U.S. jobs, the business coalition declared.    "We are prepared to work with the White House and our  Democratic and Republican allies in Congress to fight any  legislation that threatens to undermine the president's policy,"  it added.    The Business Coalition on U.S.-China Trade is an umbrella  organization of American companies and trade associations,  representing thousands of large and small American businesses,  farm organizations, and consumer groups that support continued  U.S. trade with China.    Nearly 800 American companies and associations signed the  coalition's letter to the president early last month urging that  MFN be separated from human rights issues.    A week ago, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president  for economic policy, said that if there was any further debate  in the congress on the issue of China's MFN, the administration  would oppose any effort to reverse the decision the president  had taken.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / SFO suffers fresh setback as brokers are acquitted THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday suffered a further setback to its efforts to prosecute alleged City crimes in the criminal courts with the acquittal of two stockbrokers accused of trying to deceive the industry's regulators in order to remain in business. Mr Andrew Leslie Kent, 46, and Mr Patrick Mahon, 53, were, respectively, the corporate development manager and managing director of the City firm TC Coombs. Both had also been charged with conspiracy to defraud and Mr Mahon was charged with attempting to obtain property by deception. Dismissing all charges against the two men at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court, Judge Clark said: 'This sort of inquiry, in a case where there has been no financial loss to any individual, would be far better left to the regulatory jurisdiction of the appropriate bodies, rather than a full blown criminal trial.' Judge Clark called the SFO's case speculative, but said: 'I make no possible criticism of the SFO in this case.' He noted that 'if the SFO had known as much as they know now they would not have brought the case'. The SFO case was based on documents supplied by a Swiss bank, Rahn and Bodmer. However, several months ago, following a judge's order, the bank turned over many more documents which cast new light. The judge ordered the prosecution to pay the defendants' costs. The City's self-regulatory body for the stockbroking industry, at the time known as The Securities Association, had declined to authorise TC Coombs in 1988 to conduct investment business, on the grounds that it was inadequately capitalised by the standards set out by regulators. In late 1988, TC Coombs won the right to conduct investment business but regulators questioned its capitalisation up until the time the SFO raided its offices in November 1990. TC Coombs went into liquidation in February 1991. Both men are considering applying to the Securities and Futures Authority to re-enter the securities business. Mr Robert Alun-Jones QC, acting for Mr Kent, said his client would be pursuing claims against Rahn and Bodmer for defamation and malicious prosecution. Lawyers for both men said they were also considering whether they could take action against any regulatory bodies.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: MCC administrators submit plan for reorganisation to US and UK courts PRICE WATERHOUSE, the court-appointed administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, yesterday filed with a New York bankruptcy court a reorganisation plan for MCC that was accompanied by a separate filing required by UK insolvency rules. The filing of the proposed sale of MCC assets under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, and the filing of a scheme of arrangement under the 1985 UK Companies Act, represents the first time that an insolvent company's reorganisation plan has been submitted to jurisdictions in two different countries. Price Waterhouse said the actions were 'unprecedented in international insolvency.' Price Waterhouse is seeking buyers for MCC's main assets, which include the publishing house Macmillan and the Official Airlines Guide. Together they are expected to raise at least Dollars 1.1bn. The full details of how Price Waterhouse intends to sell the MCC assets will be revealed in a disclosure statement to be filed in the New York court at the end of this month.</p>

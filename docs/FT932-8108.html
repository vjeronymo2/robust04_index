			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Full weight of the law Officially, the Serious Fraud Office is doing everything in its power to recapture fugitive entrepreneur Asil Nadir now holed up in northern Cyprus. Secretly, however, the SFO may be less than heartbroken if Nadir does not return. There may be nowhere to hold his trial. The former Polly Peck chairman was due to stand trial in September in one of the two courtrooms built specially to cater for the peculiar requirements of long and complex fraud cases. The courtrooms used for the year-long Blue Arrow trial and the Barlow Clowes prosecution, are in Chichester Rents in London's Chancery Lane. But now it seems the building may be structurally unsound. The Department of Environment is concerned that the floor loadings may not be up to building specifications. Investigatory work will start soon and the hope is that any repairs can be done by September - if possible. Just goes to show what can happen when the full weight of the law is brought to bear.</p>

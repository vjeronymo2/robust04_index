			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Report by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The eighth round of the Moldovan-Russian talks on  the status and the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army scheduled  for February 16-17 has been postponed for an indefinite period,  Interfax was told by the Moldovan Ambassador, chief Moldovan  negotiator Anatol Taranu.    He gave no comment to the talks rescheduling.    He said that the invitation to the Russian side was sent on  time. Russia insists on further work by expert teams because it  believes the plenary meeting was not prepared completely.    Taranu believes the Russian delegation to be using this  pretext so as to wait for the results of the parliamentary  elections in Moldova and change the position concerning the  Russian army in line with the results.    Local observers believe Moscow expects pro-Russian parties  to  come to power in Moldova. Such a result would strengthen  Russia's negotiating position.    Taranu said that if Moldova's principled position concerning  the schedule for the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army is  changed, he will refuse to head the Moldovan delegation at the  talks.    Moldova insists on the complete withdrawal of the 14th  Russian Army before July 1, 1994. The Russian delegation  believes in the mean time, that the army withdrawal should be  conditioned by the adoption of a special status for the  Transdniestrian region.</p>

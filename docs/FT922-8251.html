			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: Turnage's 'Leaving' Among the younger generation of British composers none has found himself a more privileged position than Mark-Anthony Turnage. As Radcliffe Composer in Association to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra he has not only a fine orchestra and concert hall at his disposal, but also the possibility to try out his new works while they are still at the drawing-board stage. The latest score to come off the drawing-board is Leaving, which had its first performance at Symphony Hall in Birmingham on Saturday. As it happens, this is not an orchestral work at all, but a choral piece, sombre and dignified, a mature and fully polished undertaking in every way. The young gun who ambushed audiences unprepared for the ferocity of his opera Greek has here given way to the serious and unhurried thinker. His theme is the brevity of man's life, explored through the words of five poets from John Donne to Sylvia Plath. As in the best of such pieces there is a variety of styles and attitudes: a haunting lullaby to a poem by WH Auden, conjuring its nocturnal spell over an irregular rocking rhythm, is followed by a crisp and sardonic Stevie Smith setting. The skill on Turnage's part is to give the whole a convincing unity of mood. The score is also well organised, with that special gift so important in a young composer of hitting upon a recognisable musical idea and using it to its full value. In Stevie Smith's 'Drowning' a swirling motif holds the movement together, working its way up through the instruments, starting on piano, trumpets and xylophone, until it creates turbulent waters that overwhelm the music, leaving only the distant cry of the drowning man. Those growling low sonorities and occasional outbursts from unfettered saxophones are fingerprints of the Turnage we know already. He throws adventurous sounds the way of the instruments in his small orchestra, more than he does to the choir, and it is unlikely that the relatively straightforward choral parts in Leaving posed many problems to the CBSO Chorus under Simon Halsey. The two solo voices were Helen Walker and Andrew King, soprano and tenor. The new work's depth of feeling, a public warmth of spirit reminiscent of Tippett, lingered through the interval. Then, in the second half, the CBSO and Sian Edwards dispelled it all too quickly with Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony, not very well played, as the orchestra was coming on cold. The performance only took off where speed beckoned and then it became fast and furious with almost careless abandon.</p>

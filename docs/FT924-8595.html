			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Man with a mission to accentuate the positive - Citicorp's problems should be put into perspective, vice-chairman Dr Onno Ruding tells Robert Peston DR ONNO Ruding is on a mission to explain. In his monthly trips to Europe, he is keen to put Citicorp's problems into perspective and to point out that the European operations of the US's biggest bank are proving surprisingly resilient. The former Dutch finance minister has for the past eight months been Citicorp's vice-chairman, with responsibility for global finance activities, which provide financial products and advice to big companies. His appointment surprised some bankers because he is not American and has spent much of his career in government. In the early 1970s, however, he was a joint general manager of the Dutch Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (now part of ABN Amro) and joined its board in 1981. In an interview with the Financial Times, his positive message was that Citicorp's commercial banking operations, which serve big companies, are continuing to increase their share of the European market, according to an authoritative survey. . The report shows the bank is strong in providing clearing services and in foreign exchange trading. The strength of its London-based foreign exchange trading floor has been particularly valuable recently. The bank's most recent quarterly results included a Dollars 171m increase in foreign exchange revenues, which Dr Ruding said was partly attributable to the increased volume of business since Black Wednesday, September 16, when the UK withdrew from the European exchange rate mechanism. But Citicorp's progress in Europe has been overshadowed by its problems in the US, which stemmed from its aggressive lending policy in the 1980s. In October 1991, Citicorp, whose main subsidiary is Citibank, ceased payment of its dividend for the first time in its 179-year history after an Dollars 885m after-tax loss for the three months to 30 September. Its ratio of tier one or core capital to assets had slipped to 3.67 per cent, so the bank redoubled its efforts to cut costs. There has been a recovery. In the third quarter of the current year, Citicorp announced a Dollars 116m profit and said the tier one ratio was 4.25 per cent. However, there was no resumption of dividend payments. The losses in 1991 stemmed largely from commercial property loans which went bad. These losses have diminished, but Citicorp has recently faced rising consumer bad debts. Dr Ruding said write-offs of property and commercial loans would probably fall to an average quarterly rate of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m next year, compared with Dollars 521m in the three months to 30 September. However, he added that consumer debt write-offs, which were Dollars 860m in the quarter, would continue 'at a high level', although they would probably not rise any more. He is concerned that the lending mistakes should not be repeated. 'I have spent quite some time since I came here on the question of how to improve credit quality,' he said. 'There were not enough checks and balances (against imprudent lending) in that if you had line responsibility you had a high responsibility for new credits.' He said the bank had introduced new limits on what managers 'can decide for themselves'. The amount that a manager can lend on a short-term basis to triple-A rated companies - the most financially strong companies - without getting approval from senior executives has been increased, but long-term loans and loans to low-rated companies are more tightly controlled. Dr Ruding said it was also important that Citicorp's management committee should not 'all the time give in to requests from managers (for permission to make a loan)'. He is also concerned that Citicorp's remuneration system encouraged managers to increase lending while not checking the quality of the loans sufficiently. 'That was not good at Citicorp', he said. 'It has now improved'. Nonetheless, US bank regulators have been taking a close interest in Citicorp. In February, the bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the US Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency agreeing that they would monitor its affairs more closely. The MOU committed Citicorp to increase its ratio of capital to assets significantly, which Dr Ruding said the bank was planning anyway. 'We want a 6 per cent tier one ratio in 1994,' he said. The MOU also prevented the bank from adding to its assets without the approval of the regulators. 'We are still in close touch with the regulators. They were understandably concerned about certain matters . . . I am in full agreement myself with what they have said in the MOU,' Dr Ruding said. The need to seek approval from the regulators before adding to assets would be a constraint if Citicorp were planning 'the purchase of a large organisation', he said. But, he added, such a move was not being contemplated: 'We think we are big enough.' The disclosure of the regulators' close involvement in Citicorp's affairs was one rude shock for shareholders this year. The other was the resignation a month ago of Mr Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president who was widely viewed as a possible successor to Mr John Reed, the bank's chairman. Dr Ruding said Mr Braddock's departure should not have been a surprise. 'People have not followed (our affairs) sufficiently. The cornerstone of his resignation was laid in January this year with the reorganisation of top management, which meant that few executive vice-presidents were reporting to him any more.' At that time, Mr Braddock gave up responsibility for running retail banking operations to Mr Pei-yuan Chia. Mr Braddock then concentrated on cutting Citicorp's costs. 'His cost-cutting was completed successfully, but his previous job had been filled by Mr Pei-yuan Chia,' Dr Ruding said. 'You can't have two bosses (of consumer banking).' The timing of Mr Braddock's departure was determined by Citicorp's attempts to raise Dollars 1.1bn of capital by the issue of preferred shares, or Percs. 'You can't announce something like that (a resignation) during a stock issue,' he said. However, Dr Ruding described Mr Braddock as 'highly valuable'. 'I am pretty sure he will find a good job in the US'. On the other hand, some European and US bankers profess themselves surprised Mr Reed has kept his job through Citicorp's well-publicised problems. But Dr Ruding uttered a stout defence of Mr Reed. 'John had and has the full support of the board including the non-executives,' he said. 'He has also introduced a series of very important and comprehensive measures to correct and remedy a number of shortcomings. 'He took action in a very aggressive way which I think has worked well,' he concluded. Citicorp's shareholders will probably only concur wholeheartedly when the bank resumes payment of its dividend.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Societe Generale to support state sales SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest banks, plans to raise its minority stakes in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, as part of the French government's privatisation drive. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said in an interview with Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that his bank was 'definitely interested in strengthening our investment position' in Rhone-Poulenc. He also envisaged increasing Societe Generale's holding in AGF, which he regarded as a 'well-run business'. Since it first unveiled its privatisation plans, the new centre-right French government has made it clear that it hopes to enlist noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholders, to take long-term stakes in former state-controlled companies. The noyaux durs are part of corporate tradition in France, where the state has historically played a prominent part in industrial ownership and strategy. Societe Generale, privatised in the mid-1980s by the last conservative French government, was one of the first companies to declare an interest in acting as a noyau dur. It already holds stakes of under 5 per cent in both Rhone-Poulenc and AGF. Mr Vienot said those holdings would be increased. However, he stressed that Societe Generale planned to stick to its present policy, of spending between FFr2bn and FFr3bn (Dollars 534m) a year on investments. A number of other prospective noyaux durs have already emerged in the run-up to the French privatisations. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the first candidate for sale, will continue its cross-shareholding agreements with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer, and Dresdner Bank of Germany. Matra-Hachette, the electronics and media group, has indicated its interest in Renault, the car company due to merge with Sweden's Volvo.</p>

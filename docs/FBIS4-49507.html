			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Yong (1776 0516)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 6 May (XINHUA) -- A six-member  delegation headed by Zhang Dengyi, secretary general of the  State Science and Technology Commission, yesterday held a report  meeting at the Chinese Embassy in Washington to brief U.S.  Government officials and people from U.S. enterprise and  environmental protection circles on the contents of the "China  21st Century Agenda."    The agenda, which was recently approved by the State  Council,  is a detailed program of action prepared by the Chinese  Government for implementing the strategy of sustained  development decided on in June 1992 by the UN Conference on the  Environment and Development. It is the first document submitted  in response to the "21st Century Agenda" adopted by the UN  conference.    In his speech, Zhang Dengyi said: The central idea of the  "China 21st Century Agenda" is to carry through the strategy of  sustained development, and, in light of China's reality, to  establish unified policies on economic construction, social  work, environmental protection, natural resources utilization,  human resources development, and other important issues, in  order to achieve comprehensive results in every aspect and to  attain the most desirable objectives.    Zhang Dengyi added: China has decided to inject the  substance  of the agenda, especially the important principles in it, into  actual practices in all sectors. In particular, we will  incorporate some key programs outlined in the agenda in the  Ninth "Five-Year Plan for Economic Development" and in other  plans whose duration is longer.    He stressed: China has determined to take concrete measures  in the hope that it will become the first country to fulfill the  "21st Century Agenda." To fulfill this hope, we must cooperate  with other countries.    He said that China welcomes the more than 30 attendees of  the  report meeting to attend a high-level roundtable meeting on the  "China 21st Century Agenda" -- to be held in Beijing on 9 July  -- to discuss ways to carry out the strategy of sustained  development and to study the possibility of international  cooperation in this field with broad prospects.    The delegation arrived in Washington on 4 May at the  invitation of the U.S. Presidential Committee on Sustained  Development. The delegation yesterday called on host officials  and visited the World Bank and the World Resources Study Center.  While in New York, the delegation called on three UN deputy  secretaries general and other UN officials, in winning some  international organs' support for carrying out the "China 21st  Century Agenda."    After its U.S. visit, the delegation will fly to Ottawa, the  capital of Canada, on 8 May.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Output fall casts doubt on strength of UK recovery: Jobless total up for first time since January DOUBTS ABOUT the strength of the UK economic recovery increased yesterday with the news that manufacturing output fell steeply in June while unemployment rose slightly last month. Although the figures are unlikely to indicate a reversal in the UK's economic fortunes, they highlight the patchy nature of the recovery. Manufacturing output fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.1 per cent in June compared with the previous month. The drop more than offset a 1.8 per cent rise in May and took output back to roughly the same level as in February. Other official figures showed that the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose a seasonally-adjusted 200 last month after a revised fall of 4,800 in June. The increase, the first since January, took the jobless total to 2.91m, a rate of 10.4 per cent. Unadjusted, unemployment rose by 64,000 to 2.92m. Average earnings growth slowed again, underlining the weakness of employee wage negotiators, in spite of recent falls in unemployment. Earnings rose an underlying 3 1/2 per cent in the year to June from 3 3/4 per cent in May, pushed lower by the 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector pay settlements. The pound slipped back on the worse-than-expected economic news to close 1 1/4 pfennigs lower on the day at DM2.5175. Although share price gains were modest, the FT-SE 100 index reached a record close of 3,009.1, up 3 points on the day. The Central Statistical Office said the fall in manufacturing output, the sharpest monthly drop since February 1988, was largely a correction from May's figures inflated by the late bank holiday. The drop was widely spread across industry, although it was slightly sharper for metals and mineral production. In the three months to June, manufacturing output rose by 1.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter but the bigger-than-expected downturn in June will fuel speculation that the recovery may be slowing. Most of the quarterly growth came from higher output of investment goods. Production in this sector rose by 2.4 per cent compared with the three months to March. In the consumer goods sector, output rose 0.7 per cent in the latest three months, with car production the only buoyant category, rising 10.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter. According to the CSO's figures, manufacturing output in the three months to June was 3.1 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. Total industrial production, which includes energy and water supply, fell 0.6 per cent month-on-month but rose by 0.8 per cent over the entire quarter compared with the first three months of the year. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, was optimistic that the latest jobless figures pointed to 'encouraging signs'. 'Although headline unemployment always rises in July as 600,000 school and college leavers start to flood on to the labour market, today's increase of 200 in the seasonally adjusted figure is in marked contrast with this time last year when the figure rose by 36,000,' he said.

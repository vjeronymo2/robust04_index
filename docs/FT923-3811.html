			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Lending institutions and planners can stimulate rented housing sector Sir, John Willman's article clearly indicates that the government wishes to revive the private rented sector. Ministers need to understand that for too many decades the supply side has been tightly controlled by all governments through the planning system and the demand side subsidised by the tax reliefs given to owner/occupiers by way of mortgage interest and freedom from capital gains tax. Houses are a commodity and a fair balance between supply/demand, which existed in Britain in the 1930s and now in many European countries, has to be restored. The best answer is to release more land for housing in areas where people wish to live rather than where government thinks they should. If this is too politically sensitive, then do not give more subsidies, as suggested, to owners/developers but to tenants. Why not balance mortgage interest relief with income tax relief for occupiers paying a rent of, say, up to Pounds 3,500 a year? Norman W Bowie 1 Uplands Close, East Sheen, London SW14 7AS</p>

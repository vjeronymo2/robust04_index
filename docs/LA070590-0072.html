			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5 IN CUSTODY AFTER VIOLENT BUENA PARK CRIME SPREE;  </P> <P> GANGS: POLICE SAY THEY COMMITTED TWO ROBBERIES, STOLE TWO CARS, SMASHED  WINDOWS, SPRAY-PAINTED BUILDINGS AND SHOT AND WOUNDED A DOG.  </P> <P> Police arrested five people Wednesday after a violent crime spree that caused  $1,000 in damage, frightened residents and left a gravely wounded dog in its  wake.  </P> <P> Authorities said the suspects did not appear to target anyone in particular but  simply marauded aimlessly up and down the 7500 block of 9th Street in Buena  Park.  </P> <P> "These guys were just out on what we call gang-bang activities," said Sgt.  Terry Branum of the Buena Park Police Department. "This was a late-night crime  spree, and they were doing it right in their own neighborhood."  </P> <P> In the four or five hours between 2 a.m. and daylight Wednesday, police said,  the group committed two robberies, stole two cars, smashed windows at an auto  parts store, spray-painted a block of buildings and residences and shot a  yellow Labrador retriever three times.  </P> <P> No people were hurt, but the dog does not appear likely to live, Branum said.  </P> <P> "They hit him three times, so it doesn't look too good. . . . The dog got the  worst of it," he said.  </P> <P> Police responded to the dog shooting about 3:30 a.m., but not until after  daylight did they realize that it was related to a slew of other offenses.  </P> <P> Gang graffiti dotted neighborhood residences and businesses along 9th Street  Wednesday morning. Although neighbors had heard the commotion caused by the  group's activities, few realized the extent of the spree until they awoke and  saw the graffiti, police said.  </P> <P> Branum said the graffiti led police to the suspects because they used their  gang nicknames in the spray-painting, which made it possible for police to  identify them quickly.  </P> <P> "They had used their street names, and using those and our contacts, we were  able to track them down," he said.  </P> <P> By 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, five individuals were in custody and being interviewed  by police.  </P> <P> Branum said the suspects will likely face bail of $90,000 each. He added that  police believe they know the identity of a sixth suspect, who was being sought  Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> Three of the five suspects in custody are minors, and their names are being  withheld. The other two were identified as Donald West, 20, and David Morgan,  19, both residents of Buena Park. West is employed as a meat cutter in Cypress,  and Morgan is a self-employed painter, police said.  </P> <P> Branum said all five are being held on suspicion of two counts of robbery, one  count of burglary, two counts of auto theft and one count of felony malicious  mischief.  </P> <P> Although West and Morgan were the oldest suspects under arrest, Branum said,  there is no evidence to suggest that they led the rampage.  </P> <P> "As far as we can tell, there were no leaders in this," Branum said. "This was  a group activity. They were all in it together."  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / AEA calls for new nuclear agency The creation of a single agency to manage the country's nuclear 'liabilities' was called for yesterday by the government division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. The plan would help answer critics who argue there are too many organisations within the industry providing similar services. Liabilities are described in the submission as facilities approaching or reaching the end of their useful life and where decommissioning costs exceed future profits. These include Magnox reactors and fuel plants and the AEA's research facilities. Liabilities are handled by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two main generators, as well as BNFL, the reprocessing company, and the AEA. In the presentation of the AEA government division's evidence to the government's nuclear review, Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive, said a single agency would cut costs for the taxpayer. It would help the nuclear industry by freeing profitable plant for commercial operation and more involvement by the private sector and create a strong decommissioning industry to compete in world markets. The submission also floats the idea of two agencies, each responsible for a number of net liabilities. 'This option would enable government to compare each agency's success and avoid possible misuse of monopoly powers.' The government division, which manages the AEA's liabilities, says it could provide the nucleus for the suggested agency but stresses that no liabilities management organisation should operate or decommission plants itself. Contractors should do it. AEA's proposal to provide the nucleus for the single agency will be greeted with scepticism from other companies in the sector. Estimates for AEA's liabilities were recently doubled to Pounds 8bn. There are doubts about the advisability of putting all liabilities under one management on the grounds that if it made mistakes, the problems would be greater. The submission divides nuclear facilities into net liabilities and net assets. Assets would enable owners to cover the costs of decommissioning out of the plant's income. Nuclear Electric's Sizewell B and advance gas-cooled reactor generators and BNFL's Thorp are examples. The submission says net asset facilities should remain part of the commercial nuclear companies as candidates for privatisation but management of net liability facilities 'needs to be clearly separated'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 10 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman  Demirel said on Thursday [9 June] that the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization was the main pillar of the principle of the  superiority of law, democracy and human rights.    `We wish that the Black Sea, Aegean and Mediterranean will  bring the nations nearer rather than separating them,' he said.    Demirel hosted a dinner for the foreign ministers of the  countries which participated in the NATO foreign ministers  meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace.    In his address Demirel recalled that Turkey had hosted in  1980 a similar meeting.    `I was prime minister at that time, I believe that I am in a  position capable of evaluating developments that occurred in  Europe in politics and security since then,' he said adding that  at that time Europe was divided by hostile blocs and Germany was  divided.    `We've travelled great distances since then. The NATO  meetings took place in a Europe where hostility between the  blocs has been replaced by cooperation for security. Our  continent is no more divided by the abyss of the Cold War,' he  said.    `Globalization is becoming the sole concept for peace,  developments and prosperity,' he added.    Pointing out that the Dolmabahce Palace was situated on the  Bosporus, which overlooks the other continent, Demirel said,  `This is an excellent place for such an occasion because it is a  living symbol of the Turkish society. This is a point where  continents join each other, cultures and civilizations interact  and strategic interests conflict.'    He added that the modern city of Istanbul in Mustafa Kemal  Ataturk's Turkey is a typical symbol of all dynamics which make  Turkey an inseparable part of the West.    `NATO has extended its arm to countries which were our  enemies in the past. Our approach has been expressed in the  initiative of the Partnership for Peace accord which increases  mutual trust, facilitates the filling of the confidence vacuum,  creates a discussion forum and shows our search for a global  peace,' he said.    Demirel went to on say that the massacre in Yugoslavia was a  disgrace and the reluctance of the international community to  bring an end to this ethnic cleansing, was a very dangerous  example.    On terrorism, Demirel said no reason or pretext could  justify  terrorist actions.    `All of us have a responsibility when one of our members  becomes a target of terrorism which targets the territorial  integrity of a country,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Theodore Sindikubgabo, CND speaker </F> and acting president; place and date not given-- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sindikubgabo] As everyone  knows, the death of the president of the Republic was  unfortunately followed by tragic events, during which others,  like Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, were killed. We  convey sincere condolences from the Rwandan Government and  people to the bereaved family.    Finally, in accordance with Article 42 of the Constitution  of  10 June 1991, the vacant post of the president of the Republic  is assumed by the speaker of the National Development Council  [CND]. Rwandans, it is in that capacity that I address you  tonight, given the tragic moments we are experiencing that force  us to take the following urgent measures.    The five political parties taking part in the current  transitional government, namely the National Revolutionary  Movement for Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic  Movement [MDR], the Social Democratic Party [PSD], the Christian  Democratic Party [PDC] and the Liberal Party [PL], have agreed  to put in place a transitional government whose most urgent  tasks are: First, the effective management of state affairs,  notably by restoring order and the security of people and  property; second, the continuation of contacts with the Rwanda  Patriotic Front [RPF] with a view to putting in place the  broad-based transitional government, and this within the  shortest time possible, in any case before the expiration of the  six-week period set by the UN Security Council; third, to seek  ways and means of solving problems related to the famine that  has claimed victims in certain regions of the country as well as  the resettlement of those displaced.    The political parties taking part in the newly formed  transitional government have decided to appoint Mr. (Jean  Kabanda) as prime minister. We have approved this. We have  also approved the list of ministers for his government that he  submitted to us.    They are:     -  (Jerome Bicamumpaka) minister of foreign affairs and  cooperation;    -  Faustin Munyazesa, minister of interior and communal  development;    -  Agnes Ntamabyaliro, minister of justice;    -  Augustin Bizimana, minister of defense;    -  Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of agriculture and livestock;    -  Dr. Andre Rwamakuba, minister of primary and secondary  education;    -  Dr. Daniel Mbangura, minister of higher education, scientific  research and culture;    -  Emmanuel Ndabahizi, minister of finance;    -  Prosper Mugiraneza, minister of civil service;    -  Eliezer Nitegeka, minister of information;    -  Justin Mugenzi, minister of trade, industry and crafts;    -  Dr. Augustin Ngirabatware, minister of planning;    -  Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, minister of health;    -  Andre Ntagerura, minister of transport and communications;    -  Jean de Dieu Habineza, minister of labor and social affairs;    -  Yacinthe Rafiki Nsengiyumva, minister of public works and  energy;    -  Gaspard Ruhumuliza, minister of environment and tourism;    -  Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, minister of family and women's  promotion; and    -  Callixte Nzabonimana, minister of youth.    Rwandans, dear friends of Rwanda, the times we are  experiencing demand that we increase our vigilance twofold. The  security of people and property is a necessity [words  indistinct] the Rwandan Armed Forces in particular. In this  regard, I would like to express the Rwandan people's gratitude  to the members of the Rwandan Armed Forces who continue to take  on their duty with dedication, selflessness and love for their  country. We encourage (?them) to persevere on this path.  [passage omitted]    Issued in Kigali, 8 April 1994;    [Signed] Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, president of the  Republic.</p>

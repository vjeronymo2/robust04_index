			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Total Removal of Nuclear Threat is Vital to </F> Denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- If the Korean peninsula  is to be denuclearized, the nuclear threat must be totally  eliminated from this region, declares NODONG SINMUN in a  by-lined article today.    Eliminating the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula  means,  in essence, removing the U.S. nuclear threat and putting an end  to the nuclear armament of Japan and the South Korean puppets,  the article says, and continues:    What should be done first of all for the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula is to terminate the U.S. nuclear threat.  The elimination of the U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal of  its nuclear threat on the peninsula are the key to its  denuclearization.    It is also necessary for the denuclearization of the  peninsula to put a period to Japan's nuclear armament.    The nuclear armament of Japan poses a nuclear threat to the  DPRK and obstructs the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  Putting an end to Japan's nuclear armament is an urgent demand  arising in the total removal of the nuclear threat in this  region and the denuclearization of the peninsula.    Checking the nuclear arms development by the South Korean  puppets is also imperative. In actuality, the joint declaration  on denuclearization has been reduced to a dead letter and the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula made impossible by the  traitor Kim Yong-sam.    The nuclear threat by the United States, Japan and the South  Korean puppets is contrary to the trend of the time.    The nuclear threat must be totally removed and the Korean  peninsula be turned nuclear free.</p>

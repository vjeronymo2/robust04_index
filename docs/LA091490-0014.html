			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSTON HANDLES TEXAS TECH WITH KLINGLER'S 5 SCORING PASSES  </P> <P> David Klingler, quickly making University of Houston fans forget about 1989  Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, threw five touchdown passes for the second  game in a row as 18th-ranked Houston outlasted Texas Tech, 51-35, in a  Southwest Conference game that lasted nearly four hours and produced 1,014  yards in total offense Thursday night.  </P> <P> Klingler, who watched Ware's near-perfect season last year, said he had a fair  night in Houston's first televised game since the 1988 Aloha Bowl because of  NCAA probation.  </P> <P> "I'm getting better, but my completion ratio was not good," said Klingler, who  completed 29 of 54 passes for 435 yards, increasing his total to 861 yards in  two games. "It's just a matter of time."  </P> <P> Klingler, a junior from Houston, got his chance when Ware abandoned his senior  year to play for the Detroit Lions. Klinger threw a 53-yard scoring pass on the  Cougars' first possession that got them going toward 538 yards of offense.  </P> <P> He took Houston on three 80-yard scoring drives and another of 55 yards for a  28-11 lead.  </P> <P> Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon ran for 121 yards in 18 carries.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 9 KYODO -- The following is the full  text of a proposed resolution concerning the International  Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] call for North Korea to comply  with the nuclear safeguards agreement.    Implementation of the agreement between the Agency and the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the application of  safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT] (infcirc/403)    The board of governors,    (a) recalling the board of governors resolutions gov/2636 of  25 February 1993, gov/2639 of 19 March 1993, gov/2645 of 1 March  1994, and the general conference's resolution gc  (xxxvii)/res/624 of 1 October 1993 finding the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to be in non-compliance with  its safeguards agreement (infcirc/403),    (b) taking account of the fact that the DPRK remains a party  to the NPT and is therefore bound by its safeguards obligations,    (c) recalling also that the board, in accordance with the  statute and the safeguards agreement between the DPRK and the  IAEA, has reported the DPRK's non-compliance to the United  Nations Security Council on 1 April 1993 and on 22 March 1994,  as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance  of international peace and security,    (d) noting with deep regret the director general's written  and oral reports of 2 June 1994 and 3 June 1994 and his  statement to the board on 7 June 1994 in which he reported that  the limited opportunity which remained for the IAEA to select,  segregate and secure fuel rods from the DPRK's five megawatt  reactor for later measurements in accordance with Agency  standards had been lost, and that the Agency's ability to  ascertain, with sufficient confidence, whether nuclear material  from the reactor had been diverted in the past had also been  lost,    (e) recalling further the 30 May 1994 statement by the  president of the Security Council, particularly the request to  the IAEA director general to maintain IAEA inspectors in the  DPRK to monitor activities at the five megawatt reactor,    (f) noting also that the Agency has been able to perform  certain safeguards activities in the DPRK and the director  general's reaffirmation that the secretariat remains available  to conduct inspection activities as required by its safeguards  agreement with the DPRK or requested by the United Nations  Security Council,    (1) deplores the DPRK's failure to implement essential  elements of resolutions of the board and the general conference  concerning its non-compliance with its safeguards agreement  (infcirc/403),    (2) finds that the DPRK continues to widen its  non-compliance  with its safeguards agreement by taking actions which prevent  the Agency from verifying the history of the reactor core and  ascertaining whether nuclear material from the reactor had been  diverted in past years,    (3) strongly supports and commends the tireless efforts by  the director general and the secretariat to implement the  safeguards agreement,    (4) calls on the DPRK immediately to extend full cooperation  to the IAEA secretariat, in particular by providing access to  all safeguards-relevant information and locations,    (5) encourages the director general to continue his efforts  to implement fully the safeguards agreement and, in particular,  to retain all IAEA safeguards measures effectively in place, and  to make available safeguards inspectors and equipment in the  DPRK as requested by the United Nations Security Council,    (6) decides, in conformity with the provisions of article  xii.c. of the statute, to suspend non-medical assistance to the  DPRK being provided by the Agency,    (7) requests the director general to transmit this  resolution  to all members of the agency and to the Security Council and the  General Assembly of the United Nations, and    (8) remains seized of the matter and requests the director  general promptly to report all relevant developments on this  issue to the board.</p>

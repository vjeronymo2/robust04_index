			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: ITT 'unlikely to spin off Hartford' MR Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, said yesterday he was not considering a break-up of the US conglomerate and was also most unlikely to spin off ITT's Hartford insurance company as a separate unit. Mr Araskog was speaking to reporters and analysts in the wake of ITT's announcement this week that it will sell its remaining 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the French telecommunications group, to partner Alcatel Alsthom. Shares in ITT have risen sharply following the Alcatel deal and publication in late February of an interview with Mr Araskog in the Financial Times. This quoted him as saying the company wanted to make itself more exciting to investors. It added that he had been considering the theoretical possibility of separating its financial services operations and its manufacturing operations. Mr Araskog said yesterday that spinning off Hartford was 'not in the realm of likelihood in my time.' He said the business was a critical part of ITT and its largest single revenue and profit producer. During the FT interview, conducted in early February, Mr Araskog had said: 'Now there is always the question as to what would happen if ITT became a service company on the one hand and a manufacturing company on the other.' Asked if he meant by this a possible split up, he replied affirmatively, but went on to note that up till now the board had taken the view there were good strengths back and forth within the group. Yesterday, he promised analysts 'strikingly new and different things' from ITT but refused to be drawn on what these might be, beyond hinting that it might mean the company being a larger player in fewer areas.</p>

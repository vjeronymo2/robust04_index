			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 30 E. GERMANS RISK DASH TO WEST  </P> <P> At least 30 East Germans tired of awaiting permission for a mass exodus to the  West made a risky overnight dash across the Hungarian border into Austria, the  Red Cross said today.  </P> <P> In Bonn, West German officials acknowledged they were making little progress in  changing the minds of Communist East German leaders who intervened with  Hungarian authorities to block the departure of about 5,500 refugees. As many  as 20,000 are said to be waiting to leave.  </P> <P> East German officials on Tuesday set up camp outside a tent community in  Budapest sheltering many of the would-be emigres and began trying to persuade  them to return to East Germany, only to meet with derision.  </P></p>

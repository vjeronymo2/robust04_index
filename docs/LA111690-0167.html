Prices  range from $190 to $600.  </P> <P> Johnson heads a $25-million empire and attends many formal events. She likes to  make an entrance.  </P> <P> "The dress shouldn't draw attention to itself but to its wearer," she says.  </P> <P> "It's part of the whole picture. We notice the woman and say, 'isn't she  glamorous?' " LIZ GARDNER  </P></p>

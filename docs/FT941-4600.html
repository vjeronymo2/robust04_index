			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird shares take off as profits soar Shares in Bluebird Toys surged yesterday as the company reported pre-tax profits for 1993 of Pounds 9.8m on the back of a big increase in sales. The figure compared with Pounds 1.5m a year earlier and was ahead of expectations. The shares, trading on the USM, closed 90p ahead at 833p after touching 842p. Bluebird, which is seeking a full listing for its shares, is proposing to lift the dividend for the year from 4.5p to 16p. Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said the strong performance was the result of three years of hammering overheads. Bluebird was now the only UK toy company selling to most countries in the world. 'The order books are encouraging and we are full of confidence for 1994,' he said. Group turnover rose by nearly 50 per cent, from Pounds 46m to Pounds 68.9m. Overseas sales rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 38.8m. That represented 56 per cent of total turnover, up from 35 per cent previously. The sales increase mainly reflected the continuing success of the Polly Pocket range of miniature dolls, now in its fourth year, and the introduction of Mighty Max, a similar kind of pocket toy based on a mild horror theme and aimed at boys. The group believes the two have a worldwide appeal that will bring in business throughout the year. A television series featuring Mighty Max, made by a French company, has already been successfully shown in the US and has been acquired by the BBC. A further series is in production. Demand for the two toys picked up so strongly in the run-up to Christmas that the company was unable to satisfy all outstanding orders. During the year the group repaid its Pounds 2.5m medium term loan, and ended the period with net cash of Pounds 5.2m, compared with net debt last time of Pounds 3.6m. Fully diluted earnings per share increased to 65.2p (15.4p). The group is proposing a 4-for-1 share split in order to increase liquidity. COMMENT There appears to be no reason why Bluebird, rapidly establishing itself as the UK's leading toy company, should not notch up record profits again this year. The 1993 figures did not have the benefit of a full year's sales from the Mighty Max range. Also, the group believes the Polly Pocket range has plenty of further potential, possibly becoming a classic like Barbie. Those who bought shares at the low of 26p in December 1990 have done very nicely. But if fully diluted earnings hit 80p a share this year, at the top end of forecasts, the prospective p/e is a little more than 10 and still very attractive.</p>

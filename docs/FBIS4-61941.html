			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent learned on 10 May from  sources close to Ukraine's Supreme Council that the working  group preparing for sittings of the new parliament will submit a  draft resolution by the Supreme Council on deputies' groups  (factions) for examination at the first plenary sitting of the  first session of the Supreme Council of the 13th convocation.  In particular the draft envisages that there should be no fewer  than 25 deputies in the composition of each faction. At the  same time a deputy can only belong to one faction. If factions  are formed on party principles, then the name of the party or  parties making up the faction should appear in its name, without  fail. The Supreme Council chairman and his deputies will not  have the right to be in any of the factions. The Supreme Council  secretariat will unite those deputies, who do not express a wish  to be in the composition of any of the recorded factions, into  one mixed deputies' group.    The draft envisages the right of representatives from  recorded factions to proportional representation in all of the  leading Supreme Council bodies (according to a separate draft  resolution, proposed and adopted by a sub-group preparing the  parliament regulations, the leaders of factions should be  included in the composition of the Supreme Council presidium).  It has been determined that every deputies' faction will have a  guaranteed right for its representative to speak on all issues  of the agenda at all sittings of the Supreme Council and its  bodies.    According to the draft, the parliament Speaker will be  obliged to provide those deputies' factions, which number no  fewer than 50-70 deputies (the first session is to determine the  final figures), with premises, the required equipment, and also  assistance from administrative and technical staff. All  materials from officially registered factions will be  disseminated to members of parliament through the secretariat.    In the opinion of one of the Supreme Council officials  involved in preparing the draft, who wished to remain anonymous,  the new regulation on deputies' groups and factions, if adopted  by the first session, will grant considerably more rights to  deputies' associations and give factions the opportunity to  influence parliament's most fundamental decisions, even without  serious amendments to the number of parliamentarians in one or  other faction.    The UNIAN correspondent also learned of the lists of  proposals by working groups regarding the formation of the  credentials and counting commissions at the first session of the  Supreme Council of the 13th convocation. Twenty-five names of  newly elected deputies have been submitted to the list of  persons proposed for the composition of the credentials  commission, and 23 names for the composition of the counting  commission. In accordance with the proposals of the working  groups, these commissions are to be elected at the first plenary  sitting, after Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission, has spoken, and after information on the work of the  preparatory groups has been given.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New RAF Suspicion"] </F>   [Text] Klaus Steinmetz, the spy for the Federal Office for  the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], who brought the  security authorities to the trail of suspected terrorists Birgit  Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams and thus caused the police operation  in Bad Kleinen, is suspected of having perhaps been involved in  crimes committed by the Red Army Faction (RAF) after all. In  February and March, two vehicles were discovered that had been  registered to Steinmetz in the past: a Honda Civic passenger  car and a Suzuki 750 motorcycle. According to the chief federal  prosecutor's office, both vehicles might have been used by the  RAF for attacks.    According to findings by the Hesse police, the motorcycle  might have been used for escape in six bank robberies. In the  car investigators found traces of the explosive element  nitropenta, among others, on gloves that had been left in the  car. Such traces were also found by investigators after the  blowing up of the new prison in Weiterstadt near Darmstadt in  March 1993, for which the RAF claimed responsibility.    At first, Steinmetz told the BfV that he had known about the  attack on the prison. Later on, however, he denied this  self-incrimination and presented an alibi. Since the  authorities do not know which of his versions is correct, there  are comprehensive checks being conducted at the moment. Thus,  it was noticed that traces of saliva on cigarette butts which  were found in Steinmetz' car are identical to traces on butts  which were found in connection with the Weiterstadt case.  Whether the butt really came from the liaison man is now  supposed to be clarified by producing a so-called genetic  fingerprint. The blood sample necessary for that is available:  Some time ago, Steinmetz voluntarily agreed to have a blood  sample taken, because he believed that as a witness he need not  fear anything.    Since the car and the motorcycle were used by many members  of  the autonomous scene before and after the operation in Bad  Kleinen, a new investigation by the chief prosecutor's office is  aimed against unknown persons at the moment. Ex-liaison man  Steinmetz lives in an unknown place with a new identity.</p>

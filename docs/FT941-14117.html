			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hampson jumps 47% and reviews expansion policy Hampson Industries, the West Bromwich-based diversified industrial group, checked the trend of lower profits with a 47 per cent increase in the first half, accompanied by an increased interim dividend. The improvement is encouraging the group, which in the face of difficult markets had been seeking growth organically, to review expansion plans. 'We may bring our acquisitions policy forward somewhat, but there is nothing imminent,' said Mr Ian Walker, managing director. Pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30 were Pounds 2.48m, against Pounds 1.69m, achieved on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 35.2m). Diluted earnings per share rose from 1.5p to 2.16p, while the interim dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 0.5p. The group reported better performances across its four main activities: furniture, precision engineering with a concentration on aircraft refurbishment, cleaning and aluminium refining. The furniture operations were badly hit last year by the devaluation of sterling which suddenly raised imported raw material prices. Changing the source of the materials and introducing new product lines led to a return to profit by last May, Mr Walker said. The improvement has helped reduce gearing. It was 72 per cent at the end of the 1992-93 first half and Mr Walker expects it to be just over 40 per cent by the end of this financial year. Hampson is finding the upturn in its markets 'patchy' but expects 'results for the second half to be an improvement on the corresponding period last year' although it would not forecast the size of a profits increase.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: Economy needs more effective regional policy Sir, The cutback in the coal industry, following close on the announcement of the closure of the Ravenscraig steel works once again highlights this country's absence of regional and industrial policy. Yet, if the UK is committed to the ERM and at sterling's current high and overvalued rate, it is essential that the government make effective use of industrial and fiscal policy to improve the supply-side potential of the economy. This potential will not be realised if strategic industries such as coal and steel are allowed to disappear.

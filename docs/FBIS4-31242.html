			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review of GAZETA WYBORCZA] </F>   [Text] Warsaw, 6 Jun--Boleslaw Sulik, one of the members of  the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT],  returns to the controversy around the activity of this body. We  experienced the first serious conflict with politics in  November, as a result of Wieslaw Walendziak's nomination as  chairman of the new public television, Sulik recalls. In his  view, it is an excessive simplification to perceive the conflict  that then began as a war between Lech Walesa and the National  Council. There are a number of other strategists and tacticians  at the Belweder Palace and elsewhere who are personally engaged  in this rather one-sided war. At its roots there lies the  characteristically Polish shock of discovery that a  constitutional body, born from a law that is democratic in  letter and in spirit and as an independent body, may behave and  function independently.    It transpires irrefutably from the reaction of the Belweder  Palace that our decision disappointed their expectations, Sulik  claims, referring to the granting of the nationwide broadcasting  concession to "PolSat," and stresses that the preferences of the  president and his people were never specified by name. It is  possible to presume, from incidental evidence, that they would  look with favor upon the continued presence in Poland of  "Polonia 1" and UFY, that is the German concern of Bertelsmann,  now associated with Marian Terlecki's "Antena 1."    Instead of having a serious critique of the council's  decision or a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the  various applications, we have a campaign of insinuations,  denunciations, and defamation. It is Sulik's judgment that,  over a year of activity, the council has surely committed not a  few errors, but, in the state's interest, it has bravely  skirmished and continues to skirmish with the greedy and  ruthless pursuit of personal interests. Sulik appeals to his  countrymen who feel anger, if they have maintained the  capability to do so, at glaring cases of cynicism in political  life, which is how democracy is functioning.</p>

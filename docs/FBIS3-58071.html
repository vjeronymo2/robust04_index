Some  of our 72 recommendations must be implemented immediately."  This is how Austrian physicist Wolfgang Kromp summarizes the  contents of the study by Austrian, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian,  and Slovene experts, presented in Ljubljana on Wednesday [5  January] together with two other studies. Krsko is only 80 km  from the Austrian border. These are some of the experts' most  urgent recommendations:     -  An immediate replacement of the  brittle steam generators: Radioactive water is channeled through  them to warm "clean" water for the steam turbines. Many of the  pipes have cracks. If there is a leak, radioactivity will be  released. At the same time, problems with draining the heat  could lead to the reactor overheating.    -  Better protection against  fires, greater powers for the security authorities.    -  Precise  research into the danger of an earthquake in this seismically  active zone as well as measures to improve the power plant's  immunity from earthquakes.    -  Better protection of the power plant  from the war in Bosnia.    Kromp: "Improving Krsko will cost billions and billions. A  small country like Slovenia should think about whether it is not  more economical to close down the plant."    However, this is not a topic for Slovene Environment  Minister  Miha Jazbinsek. "There will be no early closure." He can  envisage an increase in the price of electricity to finance the  measures.    Says Styrian nuclear spokesman Candidus Cortolezis: "Austria  will have to offer financial aid for closing down the plant." A  similar demand is made by Greens nuclear spokesman Rudi  Anschober.    The Styrian research society "Joanneum Research" has already  carried out studies on gradual closure and conversion.  Cortolezis: "However, this alone is not sufficient." If  nothing is done, the accidents will continue. The latest one, a  defect in the electronic equipment, occurred on 26 November  1993. At the moment the fuel elements are being replaced, which  will take until 12 January.</p>

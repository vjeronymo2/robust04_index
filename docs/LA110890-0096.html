			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETIC OFFICIAL SUES USC, ALLEGING RACIAL BIAS  </P> <P> Marvin Cobb, a USC assistant athletic director, claims he was not promoted by  the university because of racial bias, a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior  Court this week contends.  </P> <P> The suit claims that USC Athletic Director Mike McGee passed over Cobb, who is  black, for a promised promotion to associate athletic director because Cobb had  complained about the treatment of black athletes at the university.  </P> <P> McGee said Wednesday night the school has not received a copy of the complaint.  He said he would not comment until he reads the suit.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that when Cobb was hired in 1986 he was told by McGee that he  would have flexible hours and a guaranteed promotion in two years.  </P> <P> After accepting the job, Cobb "complained to USC concerning the treatment of  African-American athletes," the suit said. After that, "McGee complained to  (Cobb) that (he) was not keeping firm office hours."  </P> <P> Cobb contends he worked 10 to 14 hours a day on a regular basis and "performed  at all times his duties in a competent and professional manner."  </P> <P> When two years passed and Cobb was not promoted, he was told it was because of  his lax office hours, the suit said.  </P> <P> Cobb alleged that others in the department also did not keep regular office  hours.  </P> <P> The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, alleged violations of labor laws,  race discrimination and breach of contract.  </P> <P> Cobb, a Trojan starter in football and baseball in the early 1970s, has played  an instrumental role in developing USC's student-athlete academic programs. He  also assists McGee with NCAA compliance, as well as heading the department's  drug education program.  </P> <P> He could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. His attorney, Stephanie  Wells of San Francisco, also could not be reached.  </P></p>

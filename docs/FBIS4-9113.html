			<p>BFN     [Text] Early this afternoon the defenders of the Croat  Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army repelled a  number of furious Serbian attacks supported by over 1,500  artillery shells on the Dubravice-Bodariste-Vranovaca defense  line in the northeast section of the free territory of Brcko,  the political department of the 108th HVO Infantry Brigade  reports.    In the Bodariste area, the HVO defenders have destroyed one  Serbian tank and disabled an estimated several dozen attackers,  the 108th HVO Brigade reports. The defense lines remain  unchanged. There have been no casualties among the fighters.  One civilian has, however, been killed in an artillery attack  on targets of the free territory behind the front line, the HVO  reports.    Apart from this, some 50 shells, ranging from 20 to 203 mm  caliber, land every hour on the free territory against the  backdrop of constant Serbian infantry attacks on the lines of  defense. In the north section of the battlefield the defenders  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army repelled an infantry attack on  the Vitanovici and Bajici area last night. Seven Serbian tanks  supported this attack. The defense lines remain unchanged. We  do not know whether there were any casualties, the 108th HVO  Infantry Brigade reports.</p>

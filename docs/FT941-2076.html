			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Steel producers miss key talks British Steel and Thyssen, the German steel producer, have decided not to attend a key meeting tonight with the European Commission. British steel said it was boycotting the talks between the Commission and big European steel producers because it believed Brussels was taking too soft a line on state subsidies. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen, said his company would not be represented because of 'scheduling difficulties'. The British company has become exasperated about state subsidies following the heavily criticised December agreement under which state-owned producers in Spain, Germany and Italy received government subsidies worth Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.14bn) in return for capacity cuts of more than 5m tonnes. Today's meeting is to discuss the progress of plans by non-aided producers in making voluntary cuts in capacity to help the industry reduce losses. The Commission has told private steelmakers that an Ecu240m fund to ease the cost of redundancies will be withdrawn unless the steel companies come up with the capacity cuts by April. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, wants a further 2m-3m tonnes of cuts in hot-rolled product capacity on top of 13m tonnes of cuts already delivered and 4m tonnes promised.</p>

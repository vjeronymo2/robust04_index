			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: US federal assets and privatisation Sir, Martin Dickson's article, 'America's sale of the century' (June 1), contains some errors that require correction. First, Mr Dickson asserts that the federal government, apart from a few odds and ends, owns very few real assets. Not true. About one third of the land in the US is owned by the federal government. That area is about 12.5 times larger than the entire surface of the UK. Mr Dickson's second error concerns his characterisation of the US as being a bit slow in warming to privatisation. Indeed, he claims that the US is 'roughly a decade behind Britain'. Also not true. As a senior economist on president Reagan's council of economic advisers, I was responsible for the president's privatisation portfolio, and fired the first public shot on that topic in a December 1981 speech. President Reagan followed up in his budget message for the fiscal year 1983, when he stated that 'we will move systematically to reduce the vast holdings of surplus land . . .' That budget message also indicated that Dollars 9bn worth of lands would be privatised within three years. President Reagan's proposal was stopped in its tracks by many of the environmental ideologues who are gathered this week in Rio. This is unfortunate, since the federally-owned lands are much less productive and in worse shape, from an environmental point of view, than comparable private lands. Last week, while I was dining with Prof Milton Friedman in Mexico City, Prof Friedman offered a suggestion worth considering: given the despoliation left by public ownership throughout the world, what we really need isn't an Earth Summit, but rather a Privatisation Summit.

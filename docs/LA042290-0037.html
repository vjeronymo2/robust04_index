			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: LONG, WINDING 'ROAD'  </P> <P> "It's the movie that's trying desperately to get made." That's how producer  Donna Dubrow describes "Road Show," the romantic action-adventure about a  contemporary cattle drive -- that might star Sean Connery and Cher.  </P> <P> "Serious discussions are underway. We're keeping our fingers crossed," reveals  Dubrow, who's teamed on the project with husband John McTiernan (director of  "The Hunt for Red October"), who'll produce and direct for 20th Century-Fox.  </P> <P> Dubrow, senior vice president of production for Nelson Ent., first lassoed  "Road Show" -- based on Robert Day's novel -- in 1977. MGM acquired rights to  the project in the fall of 1978; Martin Ritt and, later, Richard Brooks, were  the talked-about directors.  </P> <P> There was a flurry of casting speculation. Finally, in 1983, after Jack  Nicholson, Timothy Hutton and Mary Steenburgen were set to star, MGM -- which  had undergone a change of management -- canceled the project. After much  litigation, Dubrow got a settlement -- and her project back. Robert Getchell  ("Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore") scripts.  </P> <P> "Road Show," which Dubrow dubs " 'The African Queen' on the range" -- is  expected to roll this summer in Montana and Wyoming. "Hopefully with Sean and  Cher," says Dubrow. "Just the idea of it! The sparks will fly!" Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AUDIT OF ELY'S COLLEGE DISTRICT EXPENSES NOT YET COMPLETED  </P> <P> Ventura Community College District Chancellor Barbara Derryberry said Tuesday  that an investigation of board member Tom Ely's district expense records has  not yet been completed.  </P> <P> The board decided last month to hire an independent auditor after learning of  Ely's alleged gambling activities and after a disclosure that he used his  district telephones to call hotels and casinos in Nevada.  </P> <P> Derryberry said Ely received a copy of a draft report Friday of the auditor's  findings. But Derryberry said she didn't know when a final report would be  completed. Ely has said he needs more time to review the report before he can  comment on it.  </P> <P> During a board meeting Tuesday, Oxnard College Prof. Patrick Hughes appealed to  board members to be fair to Ely.  </P> <P> "I came to speak in favor of a sense of justice on the part of the board,"  Hughes said. "Much of the materials which have been published regard Dr. Ely's  own private life. And while it makes a good smear, it has nothing to do with  justice."  </P> <P> Ely has admitted that he made personal telephone calls to Las Vegas on his  district phone in the past, but said the nature of the calls were no one's  business but his own. He said he would be happy to reimburse the district for  the calls.  </P> <P> Ely, a candidate for county supervisor, has been dogged by controversy since it  was revealed last month that he owed $3,000 in gambling debts to the Edgewater  Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., and that he was sued in February by the  Golden Nugget in Las Vegas over $8,000 in alleged debts.  </P> <P> In addition, a law enforcement source told The Times that Ely had amassed  $40,000 in gambling debts at a number of Las Vegas casinos and hotels.  </P> <P> Ely, who was scheduled to address the board Tuesday, has admitted some debts  but said his losses have been exaggerated.  </P></p>

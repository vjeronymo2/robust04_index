			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / TV advertising rules to change The Independent Television Commission has decided to allow a system of 'Chinese walls' in television advertising sales following the spate of ITV merger proposals. This means, for example, that if Granada succeeds in taking over London Weekend Television, it will still be able to own LWT's sales house Laser and its 50 per cent stake in The Time Exchange, subject to stringent conditions. The Time Exchange sells advertising for Granada, Scottish, Grampian and Border. Laser sells for LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. Together the two sales houses account for about 40 per cent of total ITV revenue, far in excess of the ITC's present 25 per cent limit. A joint ownership, the ITC warns, would be possible only if neither Granada nor LWT exercised any control over The Time Exchange nor had a director on its board. No one from either company could even discuss business deals with The Time Exchange. The ITC has written to four TV companies involved in takeovers - Carlton Communications, Central Independent Television, Granada and LWT - and intends to write to the two latest contenders MAI and Anglia, spelling out conditions for advertising sales in future. Copies of the letters have been sent to the Office of Fair Trading and could be influential in the OFT's attitude to Granada's hostile bid for LWT. One of the central issues is the effect on advertising sales of a Granada-LWT deal. The Incorporated Society of British Advertisers has written to the OFT expressing concern about any further concentration in the selling of ITV airtime. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, is sceptical about whether 'Chinese walls' can work effectively. Last week the ITC announced a review of advertising sales rules.

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: Commitment becomes the watchword of the 1990s - Bob Reynolds argues that the profession is encountering a big turning point in its relations with clients During the mid 1980s, US corporate managers were driven by the cult of excellence. But in the same period, much of the accountancy profession remained rather slower to join the same battle cry. A decade ago, the book In Search of Excellence by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman became a bible for companies seeking to achieve perfect performance. In the wake of the American experience, some forward-looking corporate planners in the UK also wanted to learn from the quality and excellence initiatives abroad to improve service to customers and enhance internal operations. Professional services organisations, despite offering quality management consultancy to clients, came late to the notion that such programmes could be applied to themselves. To a certain extent, they were victims of their own professional mythology: that their performance was guaranteed by their professional status. Until the early 1980s, professional services firms in the UK cultivated a mystical image depicting themselves as the guardians of largely inaccessible knowledge. Their approach to the customer-supplier relationship was one akin to medical specialist and patient. The commercial history of the last decade has forced greater accountability on the professions and accountancy in particular. One of the principal themes which emerged from the research for my book Excellence in Accountancy was the diversity of reaction among partners and firms towards the emerging commercial dynamics of the last decade. In some practices, there were partners and senior managers who could see the extra demands that clients would soon make upon them as early as 1982 or 1983. Their words of prophecy often fell on deaf ears. These individuals were arguing not solely for a change in commercial direction but a wholesale realignment of the professional dialogue with clients. More traditional partners could not see the raison d'etre for moving from the comfortable status which they had enjoyed for many years. Nevertheless in the late 1980s the larger accountancy practices determined that their independent survival depended on a reformed response to client need. In fairness to accountants, probably more than any other professional group, the quality of their performance is contingent on the personal relationship with client directors. Bankers speak enthusiastically about their personal relationship with their customers, but in the end any manager is governed by tight corporate lending policies. In the accountancy sector, given the constraints of an international audit approach, the partner in the modern practice has extensive scope for fulfilling client expectations. The lead partner on a major international assignment, either statutory or consultatory, will shape a team to meet specific client demands. Although he or she will be accountable, in degrees of formality, to fellow partners, the opportunity to provide the most wide-ranging, creative but precise solutions for client problems is immense. This places the greatest burdens on partners to add value to the client relationships. The environment is aggressively competitive. One senior partner told me: 'Ten years ago if you overheard company directors lamenting their auditor on the 7.55 to Waterloo, you would probably ring him up and say 'Watch out old chap'. Today you ring your own marketing department, they contact the client service partner responsible for that target and he or she rolls out an analysis of their worldwide operations, where you perceive potential difficulties for them ahead and what solutions you propose. In short, you use your competitor's difficulties to press home your advantage.' The last five years have been characterised by widespread moves to reflect changes in demands by clients and potential clients. Among these are: to codify the responses of firms in terms of management structures which offer greater scope for speedy decision-making; organised procedures for marketing, research and product development; efficient structures for bringing together the most talented people from international firms to service multinational clients; systems for improving the quality of service delivery in a broad portfolio of disciplines in key world markets; and, if all these have some impact, improved targets for partnership profitability. Not all these approaches have been entirely successful. However, the passage of time has allowed the creation of such structures and benefits to flow from them. Partners and therefore their firms are much more accountable for the quality of their output. Fees are reviewed by clients more rigorously today than a decade ago. Company directors, if not shareholders, appear to be getting more out of relationships with their auditors. If nothing else, firms have become more responsive to the changing demands of the market. This has most recently been seen in the re-shaping of service teams for audit assignments. Traditionally, an audit team would be led by the partner whose daily involvement in the administration of the service would be comparatively small. His or her role would be to oversee the relationship with the client and to plan, broadly, the execution of the assignment. The bulk of the work was traditionally handled by the junior managers and swathes of students who processed much of the number crunching. Clients are now demanding that partners and senior managers give much more fully of their own time, that they are buying more than overseeing capacity. Directors of client companies want to use partner expertise as part of the daily commitment to the delivery of the audit and other services. They also want to take advantage of the intimate knowledge which firms have built up of their business. This has significant ramifications for the development of such practices. Firms will in future require lower graduate recruitment. The larger firms have been hiring between 500 and 1,000 students a year and were the largest professional employers outside the Civil Service. In future the firms will require fewer but higher calibre staff to work on assignments. The emphasis will shift from students who take three years before they are given real client responsibility to more senior people engaged to work immediately or within a short time. There will be more recruitment of partners and senior staff from non-accountancy based practices. Another trend has also been unfolding in the international arena: multinational companies are requiring their auditors and consultants to make larger scale commitments to their clients. The engagement procedure of assessing potential suppliers can take much longer than the normal audit beauty parade. The reward for this closer commitment is the assurance that the company will probably remain as a client and extend the use of supplier services. The process involves supplier firms sharing the clients' approaches to quality management, demonstrating extensive understanding of the client's international objectives, basing key personnel permanently at the client and responding rapidly to client demands. Firms have moved in scope, flexibility and approach in the last 10 years. The next decade will see greater demands on them to develop creative ideas for international business, to ally themselves more directly with client management approaches, and to become tougher but more fluid organisations ready to respond to client needs.

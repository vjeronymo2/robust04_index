			<p>BFN     [Summary] Nuon Sam-ean, deputy chief of the Bank Control  Department of the National Bank of Cambodia, says that private  banks have brought in around $150 million to contribute to  Cambodia's rehabilitation. However, some banks have not been  conducting their business according to the rules. They are only  declaring their investment capital, which remains outside the  country, and lending customers' savings as loans to get  interest. This will no longer be allowed as the National Bank  plans to introduce four measures to strengthen commercial banks'  legal operations. In early June there are about 30 private  banks operating in Phnom Penh.    The four measures are as follows:    1. Private banks are required to deposit 5 percent of their  investment capital with the National Bank.    2. Each commercial bank's expenditure on immovable  property, such as land for buildings and furniture, should not  be more than 30 percent of its investment capital.    3. Each commercial bank should deposit 5 percent of its  savings with the National Bank to prevent commercial banks from  using the excuse of not having money when customers want their  savings back.    4. Loans to individuals or to groups should not exceed 10  percent of the bank's investment capital and should not exceed  20 percent of the borrower's assets.    A commercial bank that refuses to implement the four  measures  will not be closed but will have some of its activities  curtailed.</p>

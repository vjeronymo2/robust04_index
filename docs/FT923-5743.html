			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Management: Holidays in hell - How Thomson copes when a tourist spot becomes a disaster area When Hurricane Andrew beat its ruinous path through the Caribbean and America's southern states this week, managers at Thomson, Britain's biggest holiday company, reckoned they would be spared their usual problem of persuading tourists of the seriousness of the situation. If radio and television warnings did not convince holidaymakers that they should leave the area, Thomson executives thought the sight of locals boarding up their windows and abandoning their homes probably would. Chernobyl, the Gulf War and the civil conflict in Yugoslavia have given Thomson skills which go beyond booking hotels and printing holiday brochures. The company, which takes more than 3m Britons abroad on holiday every year, has had to learn to cultivate foreign politicians, negotiate roadblocks and evacuate holidaymakers when airports are closed. Rivals in the travel industry complain about Thomson's arrogance and scoff at its perceived inability to react quickly to shifts in holidaymakers' tastes. They give the company high marks, however, for its skill in extracting its customers from uncomfortable holiday spots. On a single day last year, the company successfully evacuated over 500 holidaymakers from Yugoslavia. Thomson was spared the need to carry out a full-scale evacuation from the US this week because Hurricane Andrew passed south of Orlando, site of Walt Disney World, where the company had 2,500 holidaymakers. It did have 114 customers in the Bahamas, directly in the hurricane's path. Of those, 104 were flown home last weekend and 10 were evacuated to Orlando. An additional 135 tourists in Fort Lauderdale, north of Miami, were also flown to Orlando. The company reported little resistance by holidaymakers to being moved out of danger. Tourists at the centre of previous disasters have not been so amenable. At the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, Thomson had 192 tourists in the Soviet Union, some in Leningrad and others travelling from Kiev to Moscow. The company flew a Boeing 767 to Moscow, but found that many of the travellers, assured by their Soviet guides that they were in no danger, were reluctant to leave. Martin Brackenbury, who was then deputy managing director of Thomson Holidays, says the company sent a large supply of British newspapers, complete with lurid headlines about the nuclear catastrophe, with the aircraft. The tourists boarded the aircraft grumbling, picked up the papers, fell silent and buckled their seat belts. Thomson has had to ensure that, in coping with disaster, managers do what they know best. After some confusion of roles during previous emergencies, Thomson has now established the rule that policy-makers decide on such matters as when to stop sending tourists to troubled areas, leaving operations managers to deal with the mechanics of getting customers home. Sally Jennings, Thomson's operations manager, says reviews after each large evacuation have led the company's management to divide itself into 'thinkers' and 'doers'. 'Responsible managers always think they should be there doing things, but a director may not be the best person to arrange the aeroplanes,' she says. Central to Thomson's disaster management is a glass-walled 24-hour duty room at the company's north London headquarters. Two staff members scan computer screens, noting such humdrum problems as aircraft delays and runway closures. Above the screens is a board of emergency numbers of senior Thomson staff. In the corner is a black telephone, capable of handling a conference call involving up to 12 people, which Thomson resorts ring in case of emergency. The company is constantly on the alert for news of widespread civil unrest or impending war. Its travel representatives abroad are one source of information. They are usually British, however, and might not be aware of local political undercurrents. More useful in the gathering of intelligence are Thomson agents abroad. These are usually successful local entrepreneurs who have worked as Thomson contractors, selling day trips to customers or providing coach services. It was Thomson's agent in Tunisia who alerted the company to the anti-American demonstrations taking place in the run-up to the Gulf War and warned that anti-British feelings were likely to develop too. The company also maintains frequent contact with the Foreign Office, although Thomson, along with other travel companies, believes that British diplomats sometimes understate the danger to tourists. 'The Foreign Office can be quite conservative,' says Jennings. 'We have to push them into making a statement.' If it appears to the duty room staff that a crisis is brewing, they contact one of the managers delegated to deal with disasters, who decides whether to set the company's emergency procedure in train. This involves the marshalling of three teams: the information team, which keeps communications open to the site of the emergency; the client welfare team, which fields calls and visits from concerned relatives; and the support services team, which books flight tickets and carries out whatever changes need to be made to the office arrangements in the Thomson building. If the incident is sufficiently serious, the latter would include turning the staff canteen into a reception area for relatives and installing banks of press phones. Bill Ridley, the aviation manager, would turn his office over to the Kentish Town police, who would arrange for officers to visit next-of-kin to inform them of any fatalities. The final part of Thomson's disaster management is arranging evacuation transport. The company owns a charter airline, Britannia, but it is not always possible to fly to the disaster area. For example, at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet authorities refused to give Thomson permission to land until the May Day parade was over.</p>

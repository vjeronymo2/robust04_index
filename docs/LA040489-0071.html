			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TRIAL TO BEGIN FOR OBSTETRICIAN IN DEATHS OF 8 INFANTS, 1 FETUS  </P> <P> Nearly 2 1/2 years after his arrest, a Valencia obstetrician is scheduled to go  on trial today on second-degree murder charges, accusing him of responsibility  for the deaths of eight infants and a fetus.  </P> <P> Milos Klvana, 47, is being prosecuted on charges that he proceeded with  high-risk deliveries -- and bungled them -- despite knowing that he did not  have the skill or the equipment to perform them safely at his obstetrical  clinics in Valencia and Temple City, according to the prosecutor, Deputy Dist.  Atty. Brian R. Kelberg.  </P> <P> Klvana's sometime assistant, Delores Doyle, 36, of Montclair, is being tried  with the doctor on two counts of second-degree murder and one count of  involuntary manslaughter. Klvana and Doyle are also being tried on charges of  insurance fraud and grand theft.  </P> <P> Klvana is representing himself with the aid of two court-appointed advisory  lawyers, Rita-Jane Baird and Richard A. Leonard. His defense so far has been an  attack on Kelberg, who the doctor said is obsessed with the case and is  singling him out for prosecution because his practice of avoiding hospitals is  unorthodox. Klvana is being held in County Jail in lieu of $750,000 bail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims Secondary Role  </P> <P> Doyle, who is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail, is being represented by  Maxwell S. Keith. Keith has argued in pretrial motions that Doyle played only a  secondary role in the deliveries and should not be charged with murder. He said  Klvana, as the doctor, bears the final responsibility for the care of the  mothers and the babies.  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last more than a year. Included among about 400  witnesses are medical experts, friends of Klvana and parents of the dead  infants. The court record will include thousands of pages of exhibits, which  Kelberg has said occupy 45 boxes in his office. The preliminary hearing for  Klvana and Doyle lasted four months in 1987.  </P> <P> With opening statements to begin today, the district attorney's staff set up a  video camera and six television sets Monday in the courtroom of Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin so court personnel and jurors can read  the documents on the screens.  </P> <P> The crux of the case is the prosecution's argument that Klvana knew that deaths  or stillbirths could result from his decisions not to recommend hospitalization  for the mothers in the nine deaths between 1982 and 1986. The legal theory is  one of "implied malice," which is used in murder prosecutions against drunk  drivers who cause deaths despite previously having been convicted of drunk  driving.  </P> <P> "The charge is not that he has an intent to kill any one of these babies or to  harm intentionally the mother or baby, but that he acts with a subjective  awareness of the complications associated with these high-risk cases," Kelberg  said.  </P> <P> The high-risk cases included an insulin-dependent diabetic mother. Infants in  such cases sometimes are born prematurely with underdeveloped lungs,  necessitating close monitoring in a hospital, Kelberg said. He said Klvana's  decision not to have Debbie Friel deliver in a hospital resulted in the death  of her son, Jason, a day after his birth in 1984.  </P> <P> Another high-risk situation alleged by Kelberg is known as "RH sensitization"  in which a conflict of blood factors between mother and child causes the  mother's immune system to treat the fetus as a foreign invader. Blood tests  before delivery can detect this condition so it can be treated with a drug. But  in the cases of two deliveries by Mira Ginsberg in 1982 and 1984, no such tests  or treatments were done, resulting in a stillbirth and an infant's death one  day after birth, according to court documents.  </P> <P> A third condition expected to be cited at the trial is known as "meconium  staining." Meconium, or fecal matter, can kill the fetus if ingested. Kelberg  has said in court papers that during Kim Ennis' labor in 1984, Klvana and Doyle  noticed stains of meconium, indicating trouble, but did nothing to extract the  material from baby Tyrone Ennis' lungs and did not send him to a hospital. The  boy died seven days later.  </P> <P> "The simple fact is that all of the cases involve common textbook obstetrical  complications . . . mandating transfer of each mother prior to delivery to a  hospital setting," Kelberg said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A stronger yen and a probable rise in US interest  rates could solve some of Thailand's economic problems, says  Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham.    The weakness of the U.S. dollar, stemming from a lack of  coordinated efforts among central banks and heavy selling by  foreign-exchange traders anticipating intervention, is creating  pressure for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.    "The economy needs cooling," said Mr Phisit.    He said inflationary pressure in Thailand is manageable. The  Bank of Thailand is expected to meet next month, however, to  re-evaluate the situation based on higher crude oil prices and  stronger than expected export performance.    Several Thai bankers estimate the Thai inflation rate to be  close to 5 percent, a percentage point higher than the central  bank's target of 4 percent.    Mr Phisit said a Bank of Thailand study found that interest  costs amount to a small portion of Thai corporations' total  business costs, and the effect of higher interest rates,  approximately a quarter-points above the current rate, may not  be severe.    A rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve would affect the  Thai  financial system and naturally push rates here higher, said Mr  Phisit. "The increases are in the range expected by Thai  businesses."    Higher inflation bought on by higher oil prices would be  partially offset by higher foreign currency earnings, gained  from exports that have outperformed the central bank's target,  he said.    The baht has also strengthened against the dollar, standing  yesterday at 25.05, the strongest in 18 months. Oil prices are  quoted in dollars and Thailand tends to source lower-cost crude  oil. Local refining capacity increases have also lessened the  impact, said Mr Phisit.    On the trade picture, Mr Phisit said in the long run, a  strong yen could force Thai importers to turn to other  countries, while exports to Japan could benefit. Since Thailand  is currently a net importer from Japan, however, increased  import costs could add to the inflationary pressure in the  medium term.    The net impact is the question, said Mr Phisit.    "Consumption of imports could decrease and locally  manufactured products increase," he said. Thais' propensity to  consume imported goods from Japan, has shown little sign of  change in the past, however.    A recent Bangkok Bank economic forecasting model predicted  that since the U.S. economy is primarily driving the world's  economic growth, a U.S. slowdown could translate to a drop in  Thailand's GNP growth, below the central bank's estimate of  8-8.2 percent.    Japan's economy is showing signs of strength, however, and  could supplement the U.S. as a market for Thai goods. Japan's  economy, surprising most economist with a 3.9 percent annualized  growth rate in the first quarter of 1994, saw its growth  prospects increase even in a strong yen environment.    And with an economy that depends on exports to the U.S., the  Japanese central bank had been supporting the dollar in an  effort to reduce the pressure on Washington to increase interest  rates.    Meanwhile, Thai Farmers Bank's executive vice-president  Sombun Chinsawanon said the volatility in the international  foreign-exchange market, where the yen is appreciating against  the dollar and the Deutsche mark, is unlikely to make a strong  impact on the Thai economy as a whole.    He said the sector that will be affected directly is  external  trade, particularly exports to the U.S. where exporters have to  hedge themselves against foreign-exchange risks, making export  prices higher.    But Thailand will benefit from exporting to Europe and Japan  if they quote their prices in marks and yen respectively.  Overall, the positive impact from exporting to Europe and Japan  will outweigh the negative impact on exports to the US.    "Overall, Thailand will not be losing from the situation,"  he  said.    The yen yesterday rose as high as 99 to the dollar.    During the past two weeks, the baht has appreciated 12  satang  against the dollar from 25.16 to 25.04.    Mr Sombun said the sudden weakening of the U.S. dollar  stemmed from the recent series of rate increases by the Fed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by reporter Marioara </F> Stoianovici from the publication LIBERTATEA issued in Vojvodina,  Republic of Serbia, in Bucharest on 18 May: "Romania, an Open  Country"]    [Text] [Stoianovici] I would like to thank you very much  for your kindness in receiving me and I would like to extend to  you cordial greetings on behalf of my colleagues and of all the  Romanians who live in the Yugoslav Banat region.    [Iliescu] Thank you.    [Stoianovici] Likewise, I would like to mention that the  meeting with you means for us encouragement and an extremely  great moral support but, at the same time, it also shows your  concern for us, the Romanians living beyond Romania's borders.    [Iliescu] Now more than ever. Because for a long time this  issue was ignored in our country and no attention was paid to  it. You who live in Vojvodina have had a somewhat privileged  situation. I visited you in Novi Sad when I was still working in  the area of "water management." In Vojvodina you succeeded in  establishing a center for actions aimed at preserving interest  in Romanian culture, Romanian language, and literary works in  the Romanian language, while the Vlachs, for example, who are  living in the Timok Valley, are more oppressed. They did not  have many opportunities in the past either. As far as I know,  they are not really recognized as an ethnic group today either,  and therefore their situation and their position is much worse  than yours. We have to find ways to help them as well.    [Stoianovici] The Romanian minority living in the Yugoslav  Banat region is well preserved, and therefore we make great  efforts to continue to preserve our minority even in this  current period of great crisis. If you will allow me, I will  start asking you some questions now.    [Iliescu] I'll answer you with pleasure.    [Stoianovici] Thank you. My first question is the  following: As a result of the December 1989 revolution, Romania  had resolutely started off on the path of democracy and market  economy. This path is quite hard in the new geopolitical and  economic situation that emerged after the downfall of communism  in East European countries. How do you view the results  obtained in this confrontation with the difficulties of  transition?    [Iliescu] One can talk about two different aspects here. In  the political sphere, things have progressed better. I would  not say in an easier way, but definitely faster, because  political systems can cope with such situations. Revolutions  happen generally in the field of political relations in society.  One power is eliminated and replaced by another one. This can  be achieved in the way it happened in Romania, that is, through  a sudden crash, with a revolutionary elan, through people's  revolt. The old state structures were eliminated, demolished,  and new provisional structures have been established, which,  later through free elections -- we had two rounds of elections,  in 1990 and in 1992 -- established the appropriate framework for  the endorsement of the new constitution. The judicial bases and  the structures of the new institutions of the rule-of-law state  were also established. Thus, I believe that in the area of  political relations in our society, these four years have marked  radical changes in the physiognomy of the Romanian society. We  have moved from the monopoly of a single party to the multiparty  system and from a party-state toward a rule-of-law state, with  separation of powers, and with the democratic system of electing  state bodies and establishing all necessary institutions.  Certainly, this is a process that will continue mainly in the  field of properly organizing the society, that is, the civilian  society. Thus, in this respect, things have progressed.    Things are progressing a little bit slower in the area of  economy because the economic system is a more inertial system.  In this case, accumulations require time. Certainly, many  things have changed. First of all, as a result of changes in  the political field, a collapse of economic structures took  place. We used to have a super-centralized, state-run economy.  As early as the beginning of 1990, the central structures were  dismantled and a rapid decentralization process took place in  the economy. We took measures to ensure the liberalization of  domestic and foreign trade and liberalization of prices and  salaries. We made efforts to achieve the convertibility of our  national currency, the leu, a process that only this year has  reached a certain stabilization. Thus, many changes have taken  place in the field of economy, but economy is a much more  delicate issue.    Certainly, these changes also meant certain disruptions,  because the structure of the centralized, rigid economy, as it  used to be, had its own internal rules. The moment this  structure broke, its internal rules also broke, without having  been replaced with something else, without a market economy with  all its specific structures and institutions having been  established. This brought about disorder and disruptions at the  level of national economy. One can also add to this the  international situation, the collapse of the international  system in which we had been integrated, namely the CEMA. Thus,  some markets disappeared altogether or became rather limited and  we lost traditional partners. We could feel this situation in  our entire economy.    In practical terms, currently our industry is working at  half  of its potential. Likewise, in agriculture we also encountered  great difficulties as a result of the dissolution of cooperative  structures. The economy is coping with difficulty with this  situation. Revival is a much more difficult process. However,  I believe that we have overcome the most difficult times.    At a macroeconomic level, 1993 was the most difficult year  for us, because, on the one hand, we felt the effects of this  decline in economic activity and because it was the year when  the most difficult economic measures were taken such as cut of  subsidies and introduction of value-added tax and of some  financial discipline measures which were aimed at halting the  quite high pace of inflation. Last year, the inflation rate  reached 300 percent and this was our peak. Certainly, this does  not impress you in Yugoslavia because...    [Stoianovici] Yes, inflation is much higher there.    [Iliescu] But for our situation it is very high. And this  caused great difficulties. Among other things, one of the  effects of the high inflation rate was the lack of capital for  enterprises and economic companies, which started off with  insufficient capital due to the old mechanisms of centralized  economy. According to the plan, they received only half of the  necessary financial resources. The rest was obtained from bank  loans, as an element of additional control exercised on them.  When the plan disappeared, the major source of ensuring  financial resources also disappeared and all companies became  dependent only on banks which also had less than sufficient  resources. Inflation and increase of interest rate led to a  situation in which enterprises found themselves completely  without capital and an economic-financial blockage emerged that  we are still experiencing today.    Currently, the year 1994 is marked mainly by this big  problem  of financial blockage. However, we hope that things will  slowly, slowly stabilize at a macroeconomic level. This year  one can already notice a drop in the rate of inflation. Last  year production marked a zero increase. Thus, the decline of  industrial production was halted. However, today we are facing  the task of reviving industrial production and ensuring its  increase. Agriculture also shows signs of revival. Foreign  trade, mainly exports, also started to show some improvement.  Thus, there are premises that will turn 1994 into a year of  revival and improvement of the economic activity. However, as  far as people's living conditions are concerned, it is still a  difficult year. There is still a big difference between  people's income and prices. We have a large number of  unemployed people, that is, 1.2 million. Thus, from the  viewpoint of the microeconomy and people's standard of living,  1994 still remains a difficult year. However, with the premises  that I was talking about earlier, there are great chances that  at least next year hopefully we will mark a perceptible  improvement in people's lives.    [Stoianovici] If you will allow me, I am going to ask you  the second question. By being accepted into the European  democratic structures, Romania has demonstrated that it is  attached to the democratic values that are promoted in the  world. I would like to ask you to mention a few more important  elements that enabled and ensured this opening to the world.    [Iliescu] As I was saying before, all these changes that  have taken place mainly in the country's political life were  record events for us, which enabled us to join European bodies.  There were certain prejudices toward Romania and the countries  located in this geographical area in general, but particularly  against Romania. This was also caused by a very strong  anti-Romanian lobby that sprang up from Romania itself. The  internal political struggle was reflected in an unhealthy way in  the international arena and this caused some reservations toward  our country in connection with the establishment of democratic  structures, although everything spoke in favor of it.    Romania experienced the most acute revolution, because of  the  people's uprising that dissolved old structures at one push.  Only five months after the people's uprising of December 1989,  we held the first elections in the presence of a large number  of parties that emerged in this period. Nobody contested the  validity of those elections. Parliament was elected, which was  also a constituent assembly at the same time. We worked for one  and a half years to draft the constitution, an exclusively  democratic constitution, which is in line with all international  standards of such fundamental documents and which was  appreciated as such. On the basis of the new constitution, we  organized local elections and general elections in 1992. Thus,  the whole unfolding of political life was a proof of a constant  progress, without any reservation and with no chance of  returning to the old regime. As a mater of fact, it is aberrant  even to question whether a revival of the old structures in the  political sphere or economic area is possible. The idea itself  is aberrant.    The political struggle is carried out by people and groups  of  people. One cannot conceive of building a democratic society on  the basis of the same rules that governed the totalitarian  regime. In fact, the exclusion of a group of people from the  normal life, from social life, from political life was the rule  of those who were playing the role of "champions of democracy."  They were excluding groups of people from the country's  political life. According to what criteria? According to their  subjective criteria. Thus, if a former [communist] party member  became a member of a right-wing formation, he was "clean" as far  as his past is concerned. If a former member of the Communist  Party remained a left-wing supporter, this was unacceptable from  the very beginning! What I mean is that these are subjective  rules and subjective judgments that have nothing to do with  democratic principles which are governing society. We all have  to change this society and we all have to be valuable members of  this society, and each of us should contribute with all our  might to our progress.    However, I believe that in the international arena we have  overcome this stage. Thus, there was this period of reticence  and reservations toward us. However, currently, I believe that  things are regarded with much greater understanding and realism,  and this understanding should characterize the political  thinking in general.    Last year we marked a few events: association, with full  rights, to the Council of Europe; association to the European  Union, initially to the NATO Cooperation Council; and now we  have signed the Partnership for Peace document. Recently we have  been accepted into the Western European Union with a status of  associate partner. Thus, now one can clearly talk about  openings that prove these tendencies that refer not only to the  internal processes in the countries in our region, but also to a  new way of political thinking in Europe and throughout the world  in general.    [Stoianovici] My next question refers to relations with  Yugoslavia. Currently, Yugoslavia is going though maybe its  worst times in its troubled history. Yugoslavia has always had  traditional ties of good neighborliness, friendship, and  cooperation with Romania. What can you tell us about the  current stage of these relations, certainly also viewed from the  perspective of the lifting of sanctions?    [Iliescu] Our relations have always been and have remained  good, even in conditions of this tragic period for the peoples  of Yugoslavia. We are nurturing absolutely the same feelings of  friendship and solidarity with the peoples of Yugoslavia and  with the Serb people, with whom we have always had relations of  good neighborliness. We have never had conflicts throughout  history. Therefore, we have followed with great concern these  dramatic events in the Yugoslav state, this dissolution of the  federation, and mainly the outbreak of conflicts that have  brought about so much tragedy. In these circumstances we tried  to preserve open relations and contacts on the one had with all  the sides involved in the conflicts and, on the other hand, with  all the new state formations that have been established. I  believe that we have good relations not only with the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro, but also with  Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], and Bosnia.    What matters is that this state of strife, maximum tension,  and conflict should be overcome. We have hailed all efforts  made in the world to assist on the one hand the actions aimed at  halting the conflict and state of war, and, on the other hand,  efforts made to find political, reasonable, and adequate  solutions for all sides involved. Thus, we pleaded for a  realistic attitude and for encouraging contacts and dialogue,  and for finding adequate solutions at the negotiation table. We  knew that it was not easy, especially after military conflicts  opened.    This type of conflict aggravates the situation even more,  increases tension, and makes more difficult the reestablishment  of normal contacts and of a logical and realistic approach to  all issues. However, the more so, we believe that the major  mission of the international community is not to take unilateral  and partial positions but to try and facilitate political  contacts and eliminate sources of conflict. Likewise, we have  hailed all more recent efforts, including recent meetings in  Geneva. Although I realize that the disputed issues are still  very serious, nevertheless, I believe that the path of dialogue  is the only possible way for progress. To continue on the path  of military conflict means to aggravate things even more.    [Stoianovici] I believe that my next question is the longest  one. One of the major goals of the revolution is to change the  attitude toward Romanians who live beyond the country's borders,  contrary to the previous position of ignoring their existence.  As far as we are concerned, the new policy that is being  promoted has proved to be constructive. Currently, we are all  confronted with a very serious economic situation in Yugoslavia.  To what extent can Romania, the mother country, assist the  Romanian minority in Yugoslavia in its efforts to preserve and  cultivate their Romanian language and culture?    [Iliescu] You have remarked it correctly, the former  attitude was a mistake of the Romanian state. Regardless of the  structure of a state, it cannot ignore its own citizens or  fellow nationals who live in other areas. And this was one of  Ceausescu's big mistakes and stupidities, to treat the Romanian  diaspora with hostility and regard all those Romanians who left  the country to live in various other places as traitors. Even  Romanians who for hundreds of years have lived in the Balkan  region and in neighboring countries were ignored.    After the Romanian revolution, we adopted an open position.  We considered that all Romanians, regardless of the place where  they live, essentially are bound to the motherland and cannot  ignore what is going on in the country. Cultural connections  with the motherland, with the national culture, and with the  mother tongue are normal for every person. And our duty is to  remain open and reach out with a helping hand to all Romanians,  regardless of the place where they live, closer or farther from  our country. We have proclaimed this as a policy of the  Romanian state.    In a way, I am familiar with the activity of the Romanians  in  Vojvodina. I visited Novi Sad a few times, your publishing house  and the radio and television stations. I held meetings with  representatives of the Romanian community. I think that the  Romanians in Vojvodina, generally speaking, have had a good  situation. They have enjoyed a certain recognition and it is  also their merit that they knew how to assert their existence,  their being, culture, and language. They became artisans and  their cultural work became part of the present Romanian cultural  heritage. There have been good relations between our writers as  well.    I believe that other Romanians in the same area, such as  the Vlachs in the Timoc River Valley, have a more difficult  situation. I recently heard somebody's theory that the  nationality of the Vlachs should not be recognized. Tara  Romaneasca [southern part of Romania, former province of  Wallachia] formerly was called Wallachia. The name Wallachia  comes from the Serb term for Romanians, that is Vlachs or  Wallachs. Thus the Vlachs are Romanians. That is the term that  Slavs used for Romanians, Vlachs or Wallachs. Thus, the Vlachs  in the Timoc Valley are Romanians, just as much Romanians as the  Romanians in Vojvodina or Romanians in Romania.    However, they had a much more bitter situation because they  were completely isolated from Romania. I believe that it is the  common duty of Romania and of the Serbian Yugoslav state to  assist these Romanians to regain their dignity and their right  to exist, to assert themselves, and to assert their national  culture.    As a matter of fact, we promote a policy that I believe is  correct, honest, and open toward all countries that have  Romanian minorities. We regard our minorities not as Romania's  agents on the territory of other countries but as fellow  nationals. But, as citizens of another country, they have to be  loyal to the state whose citizens they are, just as we regard  all citizens of Romania with the same openness, and grant them  equal rights with Romanians, regardless of their nationality.  All ethnic minorities in our country are treated by the  Romanian state, in the current new democratic situation, with  understanding. We grant them all our support. On this basis,  I believe we can forge relations of good neighborliness with all  countries and with our co-nationals. Thus, we believe that it  is our duty to preserve these cultural relations and grant all  the support we can to preserve the Romanian being and culture.    [Stoianovici] At the end of this interview, if you will  allow me, I would like to ask you one more question: Do you  have any message for the Romanians in Vojvodina?    [Iliescu] I wish both the Romanians as well as the Serb  people and the Yugoslav peoples to overcome first of all these  difficult times and the present state of conflict in the  Yugoslav area and to reinstate a normal situation. On this  basis, I wish for the resumption of normal, natural neighborly  relations and of economic relations between our countries that  have been affected very much. The embargo is not only directed  against Yugoslavia, it is also against Romania, Bulgaria,  Hungary, and the other neighboring countries. We all suffer  because of it. Thus, first of all we wish that a normal  situation be reestablished and, on this basis, cultural life, a  full intellectual life, with complete use of creative capacities  our nations should be able to develop.</p>

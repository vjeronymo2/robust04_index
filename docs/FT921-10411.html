			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Review cuts Russian oil exports THE RUSSIAN government's review of export licences helped cause a drop in oil exports of some 400,000 barrels a day in the first three weeks of January, the International Energy Agency, the west's energy watchdog, said. Exports slipped to 600,000 b/d after dropping in December to 1m b/d from 1.1m b/d in November, according to the IEA's latest monthly oil market report. Russia said it would review export licences at the end of November and many shippers are still awaiting the award of licences for this year. This has seen tankers which are waiting to load crude oil and products, having to face abnormally long delays, particularly at Black Sea ports. The IEA said that estimates of oil production in the former Soviet Union in December ranged from as low as 9.4m b/d to 9.75m b/d. The IEA said world oil demand for the first quarter of the year, is projected at 67.9m b/d - 400,000 b/d above the level in the same period last year. The agency estimated production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 24.3m b/d in January - a decline from December's level of 24.4m b/d, which was the organisation's greatest output for 11 years. Meanwhile, Dr Subroto, Opec secretary general, said the organisation's production was running at 24.2m b/d after nine members cut output by 415,000 b/d. He estimated that world oil demand would fall in the second quarter by 1.8m b/d to 64.68m b/d. Oil prices were unmoved by the production forecasts and North Sea Brent crude added 5 cents at Dollars 18.25 a barrel. The market has remained fairly stable this week as traders remain optimistic that Opec will agree to cut output at its meeting next week in order to buoy prices. In addition, Iraq's decision to break off talks with the United Nations over the sale of its oil, makes the prospect of an Iraqi return to the market this year even more remote.</p>

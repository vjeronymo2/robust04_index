			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY SAYS REFORMS WILL SAVE $39 BILLION;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE PENTAGON CHIEF'S 5-YEAR PLAN CALLS FOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES TO  SIMPLIFY WEAPONS BUYING. HE URGES CUTTING 42,000 ACQUISITION OFFICIALS.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in the latest Defense Department management  review, announced Thursday that reforms already under way will save $39 billion  in the coming five years and reduce the rolls of officials who buy equipment  and supplies by 42,000.  </P> <P> Cheney unveiled a welter of management changes designed to slash bureaucratic  red tape in the weapons-buying process, create a cadre of full-time acquisition  experts and salvage relationships with experienced defense contractors that are  now shunning new business with the Pentagon.  </P> <P> In addition, Cheney warned that coming cutbacks in defense spending will force  "extensive" base closings beyond those approved by Congress last year. He  refused to offer specifics.  </P> <P> Leading lawmakers said they are "encouraged" by the Pentagon's new focus on  management but they criticized the lack of a plan for implementing it.  </P> <P> "The Defense Management Review issued today offers no blueprint for  implementation," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin  (D-Wis.). "We need one. That's where reform efforts have failed in the past."  </P> <P> Aspin, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and six other  lawmakers, in a letter to Cheney, urged the defense chief to join Congress in  an "acquisition summit."  </P> <P> Cautioning that radical changes will not come quickly, Cheney said that "$600  toilet seats are sexy and easy to get people to focus on. The work of getting  the Department of Defense to function in such a way that we don't have $600  toilet seats is hard and complex and involves a lot of nitty-gritty detail."  </P> <P> Cheney, who called on Congress to conduct a similar review of its demands on  the Pentagon, likened the department's efforts to "three yards and a cloud of  dust. It's not a 60-yard touchdown pass."  </P> <P> In 1991 alone, Cheney said, the Defense Management Review is expected to save  $2.3 billion and reduce the Pentagon's payroll by 16,000 military and civilian  employees. Officials said that almost all of the prospective manpower cuts  could be made by not replacing employees who retire or resign.  </P> <P> The Pentagon's reform efforts focus on reducing the number of people and  systems needed to run the Pentagon's $300-billion-per-year operations. Cheney  said he hopes to give more responsibility to lower-level acquisition  professionals and to make them more accountable for their work.  </P> <P> These are among the initiatives Cheney unveiled:  </P> <P>  -- Reduce regulations. Almost half of the regulations that guide Defense  Department officials deal with the acquisition of goods and services. Of 400  such directives reviewed, 50% were deemed unnecessary or duplicative and will  be dropped or folded into other regulations.  </P> <P> Similarly, about two-thirds of the 12,000 clauses regularly inserted into  Pentagon contracts can be deleted "without hurting anything," according to  Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood.  </P> <P>  -- Simplify military specifications. The "milspecs" that dictate the  requirements of a defense contract have swelled to more than 50,000, which are  being reviewed to determine whether they remain useful.  </P> <P> "No wonder it takes 20 pages of specifications to buy a fruitcake," said John  A. Betti, undersecretary of defense for acquisition.  </P> <P>  -- Make the Pentagon shoulder the risk of high-technology contracts. With some  of the Defense Department's most dependable contractors unwilling to bid on  many Pentagon contracts, Atwood said that contracts must reduce unnecessary  financial risks to contractors.  </P> <P> As a result, Atwood said the Pentagon will discontinue "wherever practical" the  use of fixed-price contracts, which "tend to put contractors in the untenable  position of developing high-risk programs at a fixed price." Such contracts  became common during the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P>  -- Encourage industry ethics and review financial arrangements. Defense  contractors should police themselves for ethical practices, with Defense  Department monitoring, Atwood said. In addition, he said the Pentagon will  review its current policies on contractor profits and on progress payments --  funds disbursed in regular increments to defense contractors working on  long-term contracts.  </P> <P> Finally, Atwood said the Pentagon is developing a contractor review system that  will give firms with a solid history of performance on defense contracts an  edge in winning new ones.  </P></p>

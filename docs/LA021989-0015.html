			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: SPLITTING A TAB -- LET ME COUNT THE WAY  </P> <P> Brad Altman of Los Angeles asks me to discuss check-splitting protocol. To  celebrate a promotion, he writes, he and four office colleagues had lunch one  day recently at Musso &amp; Frank's in Hollywood. When the $88 bill arrived,  the group gave the waiter four credit cards and asked to have it split four  ways. At first, the waiter refused; after a discussion with his superiors,  though, he did split.  </P> <P> "From a customer's perspective," Altman concludes, "a four-way split was at  worst a minor . . . imposition on the restaurant cashier, who had to imprint  and fill out four credit cards instead of one or two." Was he being  unreasonable to ask for such a split? he asks.  </P> <P> For my money, yes. A two-way split is one thing -- and perhaps it might be  argued that, in a large group with a large sum of money involved, four ways  might be acceptable. But splitting an $88 check in four sounds plain petty to  me. Don't any of these guys carry $25 or so in spendable cash? Can't at least  one or two of them handle the math that would be involved in working out a  split among themselves? And the imposition on the cashier is not a minor one.  Not only must four credit-card blanks be run, but four credit cards have to be  checked for validity (a process that sometimes takes a couple of minutes per  card, especially at peak hours) and then filled out.  </P> <P> Different restaurants obviously have different rules about such things -- but  I'll tell you one thing: If I had a restaurant, I sure wouldn't split $88  checks four ways myself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RUMOR CONTROL: Mauro Vincente, proprietor of Rex II Ristorante downtown, Pazzia  on La Cienega, and Fennel in Santa Monica, called the other day to say that he  felt like shooting somebody. Word had reached him that a local radio broadcast  had announced that Rex had closed. This is absolute nonsense, fumed Vincente.  Though admittedly no longer doing turn-away business as it sometimes did in its  first, hot months, Rex is thriving, he says. A new chef, Gennaro Villella, has  been installed, he pays all his bills on time, he has a number of large-scale  private parties booked, and he is doing quite well, thank you.  </P> <P> Another restaurateur who feels like reaching for his pistol sometimes in Jean  Leon. He says that he hears almost daily from one source or another that his  venerable La Scala in Beverly Hills is going out of business. Again, nonsense.  But because his lease is running out and rents have jumped extraordinarily for  the premises he occupies, he will move both La Scala and the adjacent La Scala  Boutique to a new location, also in Beverly Hills, sometime after the end of  September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WAITER, I'VE DROPPED MY HAND: The next time you sit down at a restaurant table  and discover that you're missing one or more pieces of silverware, you might  stop to think that at some tables, you wouldn't get any silverware at all.  According to a study based on figures abstracted from various 1980 world census  reports published recently in the Cooks Magazine, while some 1.5 billion people  eat with a knife, fork, and spoon worldwide, another 1.2 billion eat with  chopsticks, 350 million eat with a knife and their hands, and 250 million eat  with their hands, period. The latter are the only group among whom it is  considered perfectly proper to walk off with your eating utensils in your  pocket.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NOTES AND NEWS: Robert Bell, chef and co-owner of Chez Melange in Redondo  Beach, begins a six-session UCLA Extension course entitled "Starting Your Own  Restaurant" Tuesday. Fee is $200. Call (213) 206-8120 for details. . . . The  California Restaurant Writers Assn. will again present a series of wine  scholarships, sponsored by Domaine Mumm and the Seagram Classics Wine Company,  to a select number of restaurant-service employees at their 21st annual Awards  Banquet on March 27.

Stir Crazy, which serves  "California Lite Cuisine" in the Brentwood Gardens complex in Brentwood, has  opened a second unit in the Century City Marketplace. . . . And on the off  chance that you find yourself in Jupiter, Fla., with a hankering for Modern  Southwest food, John Sedler, chef and co-owner of St. Estephe in Manhattan  Beach, will cook a week's worth of meals there, at the Jupiter Beach Hilton,  beginning tonight.  </P></p>

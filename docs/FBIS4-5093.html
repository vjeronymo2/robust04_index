			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- It is 40 years since  the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery was built.    The great leader President Kim Il-song saw to it that the  cemetery was built on April 5, 1954.    The cemetery is located on top of the Jujak peak of Mt.  Taesong in Pyongyang.    Lying buried there are anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs  including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist  revolutionary fighter, who dedicated their precious lives to the  anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the struggle for the  victory of the socialist cause under the wise leadership of  President Kim Il-song.    In the cemetery there are a monument bearing the autograph  of  President Kim Il-song, bronze busts of martyrs, and a  wreath-laying stand on which the medal of hero of the DPRK is  embossed.    The cemetery was reconstructed on an expansion basis into a  grand monumental edifice on the occasion of the 40th anniversary  of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea (October 10,  1985) under the energetic and meticulous guidance of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The cemetery is a symbol of the deep trust and sense of  obligation of President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il for  the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, and high appreciation  of the exploits of the martyrs who remained loyal to the party  and the leader, the country and the people till their last  moments.    A meeting was held to mark the 40th anniversary of the  establishment of the cemetery.    At the meeting, Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the C.C.  [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and  vice-president, conveyed a message of thanks of the WPK Central  Committee to the officials and employees of the management  office of the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery.    The message highly praises the officials and employees of  the  management office for their responsible management of the  cemetery and education of people through the cemetery over the  last 40 years.</p>

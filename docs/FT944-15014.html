			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Main point of pay-offs Sir, In a comment on rolling contracts, Lex (October 19) writes: 'Defenders of rollers say they do not necessarily reward failure as boards can insist on a reduced pay-off if performance is poor', and suggests that the departure from Automated Security (Holdings) of its chairman and chief executive gives it 'the chance to show whether that is so'. Lex completely misses the fact that the starting point has to be the service contract. If a company has performed poorly, pay-off can be reduced only if the contract provides for compensation to be reduced for poor performance. Of course, if it could be shown that the executive breached the terms of his employment, that would be another matter. But how many service contracts ('rollers' or not) set out a required standard of performance? Even then it would be a very difficult task to prove that a company's poor performance was caused directly by one or more senior executives. A person who tries and fails should not receive performance-related benefits, but it must be wrong to try to claw back contractual entitlements which are not performance-related.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko article under the "Postscriptum: </F> Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Nursultan Nazarbayev Always  Has Ideas. In Moscow the President of Kazakhstan Left More Than  Just His Signature on 23 Kazakhstani-Russian Documents"]    [Text] After taking his leave of Boris Yeltsin, Nursultan  Nazarbayev visited the mayor of Moscow and Moscow State  University in turn. Quite frankly, he amazed the Moscow public.  Only not so much with the essence of what he said as with his  shrewdness: Nursultan Abishevich said something which recently  has been actively preying on the minds of politicians in a  considerable part of the post-Soviet area. This is the idea of  uniting it in a Eurasian Union [EAU]. "I believe," the  president said at a reception in the capital's City Hall, "that  it is necessary to disband the association within the CIS  framework because it does not work." He went on to expound his  views on the EAU. He believes that it is necessary to form  supranational working organs to coordinate economic, defense,  and foreign policies. The union must have a common parliament.  This is to make it possible to bring together the laws of the  states in the union. The EAU needs an interstate executive  secretariat appointed by the heads of state and common  citizenship registered in a single passport. Even the currency  could be common and supranational -- like the European ECU....  Nursultan Nazarbayev concluded as follows: "We must take this  step, and our children would continue strengthening this union."    In my view this idea needs least of all epithets like "new,"  "fresh," and "unexpected." I believe that epithets such as  "sensible" and "realistic" suit it better. If you look at the  abbreviation EAU, you perceive something familiar.... Well, of  course, the European Union! But you certainly cannot suspect  the Europeans of being rash and indulging in state romanticism  -- it took them decades to arrive at their community. They  surmounted difficult obstacles, which we have written about in  different ways at different times -- ten years ago with playful  skepticism, now with interested surprise and maybe even envy.  Well I never: ...They are uniting while we are scattering. The  bitter taste as a result of this, I believe, burns the souls of  many people in the former Soviet republics. It is offensive to  see Europeans chuckling about it.    I do not doubt that many people in Ukraine feel this burning  sensation. The recent elections have made them feel it. They  feel it in Moldavia [Moldova], where the new parliament has now  begun working. Belorussia [Belarus] has also demonstrated this,  with its firm desire for economic union. How will others  respond to this? We shall see. But if we are or, at least,  want to be realists, the EAU is a vital idea. From all  viewpoints: historical, economic, military, not to mention  geopolitical.... In this part of the globe, where mankind is  accustomed to seeing a unified state, we must not procreate  dozens of weak formations at odds with each other. Of course,  some people will see an image of the old empire. But it is  perfectly within our power to create a union on totally new  principles, without the former imperial aroma. So let us thank  Nursultan Nazarbayev for his political telepathy: He has  perceived in time and given voice to the mental impulses of many  of us.    I would like to think that Nazarbayev's idea was not  announced in Moscow without the Russian president's knowledge.  I want to believe it.</p>

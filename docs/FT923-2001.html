			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Placer Dome acquires stake in copper project PLACER Dome, the Vancouver-based gold producer, is making a long-heralded move into base metals by buying a 50 per cent stake in the Zaldivar copper project in northern Chile. Placer has agreed to pay USDollars 100m in cash to join Outokumpu of Finland in developing a mine at Zaldivar. In addition, the Canadian company will provide project financing of up to Dollars 400m. The deal is expected to be finalised by December. A final decision whether to go ahead with construction of the Dollars 500m mine is expected in mid-1993, with copper cathode production starting two years later. Placer has been looking for some time for an outlet for its large cash reserves. Its diversification plans suffered a setback last year when it decided not to go ahead with development of the low-grade Mount Milligan copper and gold deposit in British Columbia. It wrote off its Dollars 230m investment in the project. The Zaldivar project is close to La Escondida, the world's richest copper mine which began operations in late 1990. According to a feasibility study done last May, Zaldivar contains 560m tonnes of ore with a grade of 0.62 per cent copper. Placer estimated that 140m tonnes of the ore has a grade of 1.2 per cent. In addition, the recently-discovered Pinta Verde deposit, 1 km from Zaldivar, contains 200m tonnes of ore with a grade of 0.62 per cent. Placer and Outokumpu said there was considerable potential to increase the resource.</p>

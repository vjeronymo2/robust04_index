			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / CDU to present EU plan: Bonn follows Paris in mapping out vision of Europe's future Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the majority partner in the ruling German coalition, will today unveil its strategy for the next big reform step in the European Union - calling for the overhaul of all its institutions, and formalisation of the idea of a multi-speed Community. The plan seeks to limit the veto rights of individual member states over the reform process, to boost the powers of the European Parliament to exercise democratic control over the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, and to reduce the Council itself to the role of a 'second chamber' to the parliament. It will call for reinforcement of a 'hard core' of the EU, and further strengthening of the close relations between France and Germany as its driving force. The document will be presented today by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the German Bundestag, and Mr Michael Gloss, his counterpart in the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, junior partner in the coalition. Mr Schauble is the second most powerful man in the CDU after Mr Kohl, and his blessing therefore gives the plan vital political backing. Its presentation comes just two days after publication of an interview by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in which he spelt out a similar vision of a multi-speed Europe. It is clear that the political leaders in both Paris and Bonn have decided that their ideas on the next phase of EU reform - the follow-up conference to the Maastricht treaty scheduled for 1996 - must now be brought into the open. That is in spite of the sensitivity of many of the issues involved, given the looming referendums on EU membership in Finland, Norway and Sweden. In particular, the CDU is likely to touch on the issue of the voting weight of different member states, suggesting that the most populous states should have more votes - a highly contentious point for smaller member states, including the new entrants. However, the fact that both Mr Kohl's CDU and Mr Balladur are now giving their open blessing to the concept of a multi-speed Community may ironically make their vision of a 'federal' Europe easier for British Euro-sceptics to swallow. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has already endorsed the idea in principle. In his interview with the newspaper Le Figaro, Mr Balladur said that enlargement to include the newly emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe would inevitably involve a degree of 'diversification' in the structure of the EU, at least temporarily. 'For many years, no doubt, the European structure will involve a homogeneous central core, consisting essentially of France and Germany, obeying common rules in all areas of co-operation, with around it countries ruled by differing laws, depending on whether they concern monetary matters, social affairs, defence, trade relations, financial relations, or foreign policy,' he said. Mr Balladur is expected today to expand his proposals for the future structure of the EU in a speech he will deliver at a formal lunch attended by all France's ambassadors. It is relatively rare for Mr Balladur to express such forthright views on foreign policy which, under the French constitution, is generally regarded as the preserve of the president, rather than the prime minister. Mr Balladur has been particularly anxious to cast himself in a presidential role in the approach to next spring's presidential elections. He is currently well ahead of Mr Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris, in the opinion polls as favourite to win the centre-right candidacy. Europe is one of the key foreign issues on which Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac have traditionally disagreed: the Paris mayor being markedly more sceptical about the merits of a unified Europe than the prime minister.</p>

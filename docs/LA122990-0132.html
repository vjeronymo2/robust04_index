			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CELTICS COOL OFF, GET BURNED IN ATLANTA BY HAWKS, 131-114  </P> <P> Just as the Boston Celtics appeared to be invincible, they fell back to earth  with a thud.  </P> <P> The improving Atlanta Hawks put together a one-two punch Friday night in  Atlanta and ended the Celtics' eight-game winning streak with a 131-114  victory.  </P> <P> Glenn Rivers scored 36 points and Dominique Wilkins added 31 as the Hawks, who  lost 10 of their first 14 games, won for the 10th time in their last 13. The  two were deadly, Rivers sinking 12 of 16 shots, Wilkins 11 of 16. Between them,  they were seven for eight on three-point attempts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, guards Reggie Lewis and Brian Shaw, who have led the Celtics'  resurgence, were a combined six for 23.  </P> <P> It was only the fifth loss in 28 games for the Celtics.  </P> <P> Boston was in the game for only the first quarter, trailing by four after 12  minutes. By halftime, Atlanta led by 14, and it became a rout in the third  quarter as the Hawks built their margin to 25 points. Midway through the final  quarter, the Celtics trailed by 29.  </P> <P> San Antonio 104, Sacramento 88 -- David Robinson's triple-double at San Antonio  was a little different. He had 27 points, 13 rebounds and 11 blocked shots.  Usually, a triple-double refers to points, rebounds and assists. In 35 minutes,  Robinson had two assists.  </P> <P> It was the 10th victory in the last 11 games for the Spurs. The Kings have lost  five in a row, all by at least 10 points.  </P> <P> Phoenix 115, Philadelphia 96 -- Charles Barkley scored a season-high 45 points  at Phoenix, but it wasn't nearly enough to save the 76ers.  </P> <P> The Suns, who are 7-2 since acquiring Xavier McDaniel from Seattle, were ahead  from the outset, leading by as many as 14 points in the first half and pulling  away again in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Detroit 97, Minnesota 85 -- After being fined $1,000 for his fight with  Chicago's Horace Grant on Christmas Day, the Pistons' Joe Dumars didn't score  in the first half at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> There wasn't much scoring by anybody, in fact, so when Dumars came through with  21 points in the second half, the Pistons won handily. After 24 minutes of  mainly inept play, the Timberwolves led, 35-32.  </P> <P> Dumars was fined for throwing an elbow. Grant, who retaliated with a punch, was  fined $2,500.  </P> <P> Houston 101, New Jersey 99 -- On one of Akeem Olajuwon's off nights, the  Rockets needed someone to come through with a big effort at East Rutherford,  N.J.  </P> <P> Otis Thorpe had 21 points and grabbed a key rebound in the closing seconds to  save the victory.  </P> <P> Although Olajuwon was six for 17 and scored only 14 points, the Rockets led,  90-75, with nine minutes left. The Nets' late rally barely fell short. DAN  HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Whose line is it anyway?: The pressures to privatise telecommunications in the EC look irresistible It is a fair bet that most of Europe's state telecommunications companies will be privatised over the next five years. By the end of the decade, telecommunications could be Europe's largest equity sector, ahead of banking. 'In the next three years alone, telecoms companies with combined capitalisation of Dollars 44bn look set to come to market,' says Mr Richard Ryder, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers. The pressure to privatise comes from three sources: overburdened state budgets; under-resourced state telecommunications networks; and the liberalisation of national and international telecoms markets, which is undermining the position of state monopoly public telecommunications operators (PTOs). The balance of pressure varies between countries. But none is immune and, with the European Community now resolved to liberalise national markets for voice telecommunications traffic from January 1998, pressure can only increase. The predicament of Ireland's Telecom Eireann illustrates the position of Europe's small and medium-sized PTOs. In some respects, TE is not unfavourably placed. Ireland has been granted a five-year extension beyond the 1998 competition deadline, so a state-owned TE could hide behind its monopoly for another decade. After a heavy investment programme in the late 1980s, three-quarters of Ireland's exchanges are digital and TE provides an array of value-added services such as call-itemisation on bills. Yet few TE executives believe the status quo is viable, even in the medium term. Overseas operators offering businesses call-back and leased-line facilities are fast eroding TE's international revenue. To staunch the flow, a recent radical 'rebalancing' of tariffs has reduced TE's international prices sharply, while increasing local charges. But that is only a palliative. Interest charges on 1980s investment are consuming half of TE's operating profit. If margins continue to fall, TE's investment plans will suffer; so will the profits the government creams off. The worst-case, but plausible, scenario for five years hence is dire. It has overseas operators forcing down TE's international tariffs and taking a large slice of its profit; with dearer local calls, voters are attracted to claims that price cuts will result from competition from, say, cable TV operators offering telephone services; and state-owned TE is left with a Pounds 1bn debt, an ageing network, 10,000 employees and a universal service obligation in a country with more remote rural subscribers than New Zealand. It is not surprising, then, that TE is engaged in talks with Cable and Wireless, the UK group, about a possible alliance. When news of the C&amp;W talks broke in the spring, Brian Cowen, Ireland's communications minister insisted that 'privatisation is not on the agenda'. Yet in accepting that alliances were vital to maintain TE's position 'in a sector which is moving at an accelerating rate', he highlighted the dynamic likely to prompt privatisation sooner or later. The scale of the sales involved in these privatisations is breathtaking. Severing links between PTOs and the public sector confronts established interests at every turn. The regulatory implications are equally far-reaching, challenging notions that the state should control 'strategic' industries. For investors, telecoms companies and merchant banks queueing to offer their services, the opportunities created by privatisation are legion. Current evidence suggests former state PTOs will head the list on most of Europe's stock exchanges in terms of capitalisation, opening up a large blue-chip sector for institutional investors. Telecommunications companies keen to diversify will have an array of new strategic options. The UK led the way on telecoms privatisation. The sale of British Telecommunications was completed this summer, nine years after the disposal of the first tranche of government shares. At nearly Pounds 27bn, BT has a capitalisation far ahead of any other UK-based company. Across the rest of western Europe, the industry can be divided into four broad groups. Listed companies. Part or all of the PTOs of Denmark, Spain, Italy and Portugal are listed companies. Only a third of the shares in Telefonica, the Spanish operator, are still owned by the state. Nearly half of the shares of Stet, the Italian telecommunications holding company, which controls six operating and manufacturing companies, are in private hands. Marconi, one of Portugal's three state operators, which handles international traffic, is only 51 per cent state-owned. Eleven per cent of the shareholders in Tele Danmark, the Danish PTO formed two years ago from the merger of four regional operators, are non-government. The Danish government plans to reduce its PTO stake to 51 per cent over the next year, probably in a sale next spring. Both the Spanish and the Italian governments are likely to reduce their PTO holdings before long. The Portuguese telecoms industry is being rationalised and further privatisation is under discussion. Companies to be privatised from scratch. Germany and the Netherlands are the principal candidates. A bill to privatise KPN, the Dutch postal and telecommunications operator, is before the Dutch parliament. Legislation to alter the German constitution is to be introduced this autumn to allow for the sale of shares in Deutsche Telekom. More tentatively, Turkey's governing coalition has agreed to privatise 49 per cent of the country's PTO. State-directed PTOs. A decade ago, virtually all Europe's PTOs fell into this category. Only Austria, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland are likely to remain there. Should the Greek socialists take power after yesterday's election, Mr Andreas Papandreou, their veteren leader, is pledged to halt the privatisation of OTE, the Greek PTO. Its fate thereafter is unclear. Corporations. Five PTOs - those of Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden - are, or soon will be, corporations. Although still owned by the state, as corporations they have legal autonomy and substantial operational independence. Most of the corporations are heading towards privatisation at greater or lesser speeds. 'Given the pressure to introduce competition and fund expensive investment programmes, I would expect most of them to be in the private sector within five years,' says Ms Kathy Burrows, telecoms analyst at Dataquest Europe, a consultancy. What differentiates them is mainly how open their governments are about the likelihood of privatisation. Ireland's centre-left government repudiates the notion. By contrast, Belgium's prime minister has indicated general support for privatisation of Belgacom. His government is under intense pressure to reduce the country's deficit, now approaching 7 per cent of GDP, and privatisation receipts are an alluring prospect. In July, Belgacom forged a strategic alliance with Pacific Telesis (Pactel), the US regional operator, to build Belgium's new digital cellular network. Pactel will take a 25 per cent stake in the network and participate in management. The deal is widely regarded as a trial run for full privatisation - although almost certainly with a different, possibly European, partner. If the politicians can agree a scheme, a sale may not be far off. Europe's telecoms privatisations will not be carbon copies of each other. Each PTO has peculiarities of its own. In particular, the status of employees varies widely. Those countries, like Germany and Belgium, where most employees have civil service contracts, face a legal and political minefield. However, two models are emerging. Governments with PTOs that believe they can thrive in the emerging global telecoms market without a strategic partner are likely to follow the UK in floating their PTOs in tranches, with the intention of disposing of most shares. The Netherlands is proceeding down that road. A first tranche of shares in KPN will be sold early next year; a further sale is expected to follow by 1996, reducing the government stake to about 30 per cent. That will not preclude KPN making post-privatisation alliances - indeed it is already a party to several international consortia. But they will not be integral to the privatisation. By contrast, smaller PTOs are anxious to use privatisation as a way of acquiring a strategic partner in the form of a big overseas operator taking an equity stake. Here, the Greek model is widely cited - although it is likely to be disowned by Greece itself. Under it, 35 per cent of OTE, the Greek state operator, was to have been sold to a strategic partner with management control, in return for a guaranteed Dollars 7bn in investment over the next decade. Another 14 per cent of the stock would have been floated on the Athens stock exchange, leaving the government with a 51 per cent stake but little operational say. However, the decision to sell is only the beginning, not the end, of the privatisation process. Key issues remain: valuation, regulation, the attractiveness of the PTOs to would-be investors and, perhaps most critical of all, the speed and terms of liberalisation. Two things appear certain. Technological advance, plus the European Community's resolve to liberalise the 'voice' market by 1998 (with five extra years' grace for Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal), means that competition is imminent in every country. But the regulatory structure in each country will have a large bearing on the speed it advances and the strength of rival operators - and thus on the valuation of PTOs at privatisation. Providing rough-and-ready valuations of PTOs is easy enough, taking multiples of earnings of comparable companies, subtracting debt and allowing for local market conditions. However, as Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, puts it: 'A PTO is worth largely what the government and management says it's worth.' For the valuation at sale will depend heavily on government decisions on regulation, competition, the freedom of managers to hire and fire and any sale of divisions of the PTO itself. Thereafter, the financial motivation of management will be critical. Privatised PTOs likely to retain the character of a utility, such as Tele Danmark, will be 'safe bet' investments akin to bond substitutes. By contrast, companies intent on maximising shareholder value will lead a more chequered life, floating off ancillary businesses (like cellular and directory services), giving stock options to their senior executives, and engaging in aggressive moves abroad. Mr Heyworth points to Italy as a leader in the second camp. On competition, the essential choice for governments is whether to promote it at privatisation, or to let it arise on its own as the EC's 1998 deadline is passed. The latter is the more popular option, although the Netherlands may embrace an interim duopoly, as occurred at privatisation in the UK. Its government is inviting the country's utilities, railways and cable operators to join forces to provide a second national telecoms network. But even for PTOs not facing immediate competition, there is no easy ride through to 1998. Operators are finding ever more sophisticated means of eroding national monopolies. Cellular telephony, in particular, is opening a new avenue of competition across the continent. The first generation of cellular mobile networks were mostly low-capacity and operated as PTO monopolies. But the generation of digital services now coming on stream are high-capacity networks and, in most cases, the PTOs face competition from networks operated by one or more consortia of private, often foreign, companies. PTOs are likely to be attractive buys. On almost every stock exchange on which they are listed, telecoms companies have been outperforming the average. Even with competition and regulation, their earnings capacity remains impressive. 'We are getting plenty of 'cold' inquiries: indications of interest in forthcoming sales are extremely strong, and there doesn't seem to be much concern about saturation,' says Mr David Wheeler, director of the telecoms group at Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank. That may come as a relief to those at the end of the queue. But the fight among governments and PTOs for the front seats will be intense, notwithstanding those such as Mr Papandreou. This is the first in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state telecommunications operators</p>

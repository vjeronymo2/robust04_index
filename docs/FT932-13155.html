			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Executives at Amag resign after heavy losses THE chief executive and deputy chief executive of Austria Metall (Amag), the troubled Austrian aluminium company, have resigned following the publication of heavy losses for 1992. Amag, a subsidiary of Austrian Industries, the state-owned industrial holding company, lost Sch5.4bn (Dollars 478m) last year on turnover of Sch16.1bn. Operating losses were Sch2.6bn and there were extraordinary charges of Sch2.7bn arising from the closure of its sole remaining aluminium smelter in Austria. In 1991, Amag had a pre-tax loss of Sch0.8bn. The company said that operating losses were caused mainly by the collapse in world aluminium prices. No improvement in results was foreseen this year. It said that Mr Peter Apfalter, the chief executive, and his deputy, Mr Hans Koopman, offered to resign following intense and unfair media criticism of their management. Amag's losses weighed heavily on Austrian Industries. AI this week reported a net loss of Sch4.8bn for 1992 compared with a net profit of Sch95m in the previous year. Its operating loss was Sch2.6bn compared with a Sch2.12bn profit. Mr Michael Sekyra, chief executive, said he hoped Amag would make profits at the operating level this year, and he expected that government subsidies to cover Amag losses would stay within the three-year budget, to the end of this year, of Sch9.1bn.</p>

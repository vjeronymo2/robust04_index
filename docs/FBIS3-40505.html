For example,  some airplanes (STOL, T-4, etc.) and helicopters (BK117, etc.)  were developed by using these useful technologies.    This report presents the current status of these  technologies  in Kawasaki Gifu and the future roles respectively.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Serious wind tunnel testing and CFD work related to  aerospace  got underway at Kawasaki Heavy Industries Gifu at about the same  time, namely in the late 1960's. Currently this work has  progressed to a three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel and  three-dimensional Navier-Stokes CFD analysis.    During this time, we have made wind tunnel tests and CFD the  two pillars of aerodynamic design, and have employed the two  methods in various kinds of R&amp;D and aircraft development  (modification and new designs), particularly with experimental  STOL aircraft, the T-4 jet trainer, and the BK117 helicopter. We  obtained the initially targeted performance, and confirmed that  the technology is effective.    In this article we discuss the wind tunnel and CFD  activities  at Kawasaki Gifu and look at prospects for the future.  <H5>  2. Kawasaki Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>   The history of wind tunnel activities at the Gifu facility  are diagrammed in Figure 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-38A>           Figure 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnel Development </FIG>    Serious wind tunnel testing got underway in 1968 with the  rebuilding and remodeling of the low-speed wind tunnel  originally built in 1938. This wind tunnel facilitates both open  and closed tests, with the closed configuration being usually  employed in helicopter tests for rotor blow-down effect tests  and the like. Subsequently, the two-dimensional smoke wind  tunnel was brought on line in 1969 and the two-dimensional  transonic wind tunnel in 1976. The smoke wind tunnel can readily  capture flow phenomena, including separation flows, and can now  handle force measurements also with the incorporation of a  three-component balance scale. The two-dimensional transonic  wind tunnel is used primarily in studies of airfoil aerodynamic  characteristics, and was put to good use in designing the T-4  airfoils. The three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel was built  in 1988 and can be used in a wide range of wind tunnel tests  from low speed to transonic speed. This wind tunnel has a 1 m x  1 m measurement section, and was designed to share in common the  models, stings, and measurement equipment with the supersonic  wind tunnel of the same size at NAL. By using this wind tunnel  in conjunction with the NAL supersonic wind tunnel, tests can be  conducted continuously over a broad velocity spread, from low to  high Mach speeds. The manifold pressure can be raised to 5  kg/cm[.sup]2[/], so, for a three-dimensional wind tunnel,  this provides the highest Re numbers obtainable in Japan. The  wind-tunnel features are summarized in Table 1.    Table 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnels    -- Low-Speed Wind Tunnel: Built 1938, rebuilt and remodeled  1968 (Open type); Measurement section: 2.5 m x 2.5 m; Maximum  velocity: 60 m/s (Closed type); Measurement section: 3.5 m x 3.5  m; Maximum velocity: 30 m/s    -- 2D Smoke Wind Tunnel: Built 1969; Measurement section:  0.1  m x 1.0 m; Maximum velocity: 30 m/s    -- 2D Transonic Wind Tunnel: Built 1976; Measurement  Section:  0.1 m x 0.4 m; Mach number: 0.5 x [sic] 1.2 -- 2D [sic]  Transonic Wind Tunnel: Built 1988; Measurement section: 1.0 m x  1.0 m; Mach number: 0.2 to 1.4; Max. confluence pressure: 5  atmospheres; Re number: 2 x 10[.sup]7[/]; (H = 0.8, C = 0.3M)    During this period, when broader-region wind tunnel tests  needed to be conducted, we used the various NAL wind tunnels and  foreign wind tunnels (RAE, NAE, CALAC, etc.), and worked hard to  raise the level of our wind tunnel testing technology.  <H5>  3. CFD at Kawasaki Gifu </H5>   Kawasaki develops its basic aerospace software at the Gifu  factory, and from that base also develops application software  (for thermal flow analysis and blade/wing lattice/cascade  analysis, etc.) in various fields for other divisions.    When CFD is used in computer-based aerodynamic analysis and  design, we can divide it into the sequential problem analysis in  which flows around a shape are analyzed, and inverse problem  analysis in which a design condition such as a pressure  distribution is given and the shape is then derived. We will  discuss these two approaches while focusing on developments and  applications in the aerospace field.  <H5>  3.1 Sequential Problem Analysis </H5>   Sequential problem analysis came through lift line theory  analysis and began with the two-dimensional panel analysis in  1970, about the same time that we at Kawasaki rebuilt the  low-speed wind tunnel. It subsequently passed through the  development of total-craft panel analysis, three-dimensional  full potential flow analysis, total-craft Eulerian analysis, and  full-total-craft Navier-Stokes analysis to the present stage of  obtaining equilibrium flow analysis for ultrasonic flows (cf.  Figure 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-39A>           Figure 2. Development of Sequential Problem Analysis </FIG>    As to the individual analyses, precision verification checks  are performed, depending on the correspondences and so forth  with the theoretical values and wind-tunnel test results, even  after development, and improvements are still being made in  expanding analysis software features, enhancing precision, and  I/O data processing.    We now noted some representative analysis results. We omit  here any treatment of equilibrium flows because this is given  detailed treatment in Reference 9.    The panel method is based on non-viscous theory, but viscous  effects can be considered too with the addition of a boundary  layer. It is also possible to simulate separation flows by  releasing eddies that satisfy the kutta conditions  for each time step as diagrammed in Figure 3. In Figure 4 we  have the development to jet flap analysis with the addition of  aft jet flows, which is employed in the aerodynamic analysis of  STOL aircraft. The panel method, while based on non-viscous  theory, exhibits good correspondences with wind tunnel tests in  regions where there is little separation. Accordingly, although  the precision is less than with the differential method, the  panel method requires less time for computation and input data  preparation, and we believe it is still an effective design tool  in parametric studies.[.sup]1[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-39B>           Figure 3. Example of Eddy Release Analysis </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-39C>           Figure 4. Example of Jet Flap Lift Area Theory Analysis </FIG>    In Figures 5 through 7 we give typical examples of  comparisons between wind tunnel test results and the results of  Navier-Stokes (NS) analysis based on the differential and  limited volume methods. With these methods, it is possible to  conduct analyses over a wide range, from low to high Mach  numbers, including viscosity. In Figure 5 we compare the  calculations and tests on the ONERA M6 wing for the purpose of  verifying the precision of three-dimensional NS analysis. Good  agreement is exhibited, including the position of the shock wave.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40A>           Figure 5. ONERA M6 NS Analysis </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40B>           Figure 6. Supersonic Intake NS Analysis Examples </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40C>           Figure 7. Vehicle Ground Effect NS Analysis Example </FIG>    In Figure 6 we show an example of the vent effect of a ramp  and throat in a supersonic intake. An example of ground effect  analysis is depicted in Figure 7 for a vehicle that incorporates  a guideway. There is correspondence with the wind tunnel tests  in the upper part of the diagram (with the guideway and ground  moving together with the vehicle), while the lower part of the  diagram corresponds with an actual vehicle (with the guideway  and ground fixed, and only the vehicle moving). We see  differences in separation and force between these two, and thus  find that care must be exercised in handling the wind tunnel  test data when inferring actual vehicle characteristics from the  wind tunnel test results.    We recently have been conducting studies on STOL craft, the  HOPE, and the SST, as well as elemental analytical studies on  flap gap effects.[.sup]2-7[/]    Thus we see that, thanks to the development of software for  the total-craft Euler method and total-craft NS method, the  analytical capabilities have advanced far beyond those of the  panel method. For this reason, we are now able to conduct fine  flow studies and do simulations in modes that are not  practicable with wind tunnels, although there is still the  problem of precision when large separation is involved.    Even with the advances in computers, much time is required  from input data preparation to the finished analysis (so-called  TAT time) (although we believe that two-dimensional analysis has  now reached that level), and these problems need to be resolved  before this method can be used in the design stage.  <H5>  3.2 Inverse Problem Analysis </H5>   In design work in which wind tunnel tests and CFD sequential  problem solving is used, shape modifications and aerodynamic  analyses are often repeated. With this approach, however, there  is no guarantee that the design goals will be reached, and a  great deal of time is required to obtain convergent solutions.    For this reason, an indispensable tool for us designers is  inverse problem analysis in which shapes are sought for given  design target values.    In the area of inverse problem analysis for airfoils, the  methods of Sumiya and Wever have been around for some time. We  at Kawasaki, however, were interested in inverse problem  analysis for more general cases of high-lift devices, and so  first developed a two-dimensional multiple-object inverse  problem analysis technique based on the panel method, as  diagrammed in Figure 8, and then brought in viscous effects by  adding the boundary layer. Subsequently, based on this, we  developed three-dimensional airfoil inverse problem analysis  techniques which we use in designing main wings, inclusive of  fuselage effects, and flaps (cf. Figure 9). For the SST wing  design we developed inverse problem analysis techniques based on  lift area supersonic theory. We also have improved design  precision by employing Navier-Stokes inverse problem analysis in  which the method of Takanashi is used. The example shown in  Figure 10 is that of the design of a main wing which includes  the USB engine.[.sup]8[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-41A>  Figure 8. Development of Inverse Problem Analysis </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-41B>  Figure 9. Three-Dimensional Multiple-Body Inverse Problem Analysis Example </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-41C>           Figure 10. Three-Dimensional NS Inverse Problem Analysis Example </FIG>   <H5>  4. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5>   In Table 2 we compare wind-tunnel tests and CFD in terms of  various problematic categories.    Table 2. Wind-Tunnel Tests (WTT) and CFD    -- Reynolds number, Mach number: WTT: Limited (especially  Reynolds number); CFD: Precision is problematic, but yields  solutions that correspond to Re numbers, Mach numbers of actual  craft    -- Flow Simulation (separation flows): WTT: Can obtain  actual  flows (yields solutions that include stall); CFD: Limited with  respect to physical model (analysis comprehending large  separation is very difficult)    -- Interference Problems (air flow turbulence): WTT:  Wind-tunnel tests are very difficult; CFD: Can obtain ideal  solutions    -- Preprocessing: WTT: Model design and fabrication is  costly  and requires many days to do; CFD: Low cost, but grid  generation, etc., is time-consuming -- Productivity: WTT: High  productivity; CFD: High productivity if panel method; low  productivity if differential method or limited volume method    -- Reproducibility: WTT: Depends on model precision,  configuration set[tings], and wind tunnel wall correction  method, etc.; CFD: Depends on physical model, grid(s), etc.    -- Effects on Design: WTT: Requires trial and error  repetitions; CFD: Can improve design program and shorten times  using design code (inverse problem analysis)    With wind tunnel tests one cannot obtain real craft Re  numbers, but one can obtain real flows that include separation,  and productivity is high compared to CFD.    With CFD, on the other hand, there are still problems with  analyzing large separation flows and with data productivity, but  there are no restrictions which wind tunnels have (support/wall  interference, ground effect, etc.), and one can obtain solutions  in a form close to actual flight conditions. But with wind  tunnel testing one can easily ascertain fine flow details, such  as is necessary with sophisticated design technology and  instruments.    We believe that the trend toward CFD is very pronounced, and  that an increasingly large role will be played by CFD in more  and more areas, including aerodynamic design. In the near  future, however, wind tunnel and CFD precision will continue to  be cross-checked, CFD will be used in analyzing phenomena which  arise in wind tunnels, and the two approaches will continue to  coexist. It is therefore desirable that there be close  communication between technicians employing these two methods,  in complementary ways, in the future. Designers need to be  cognizant, at every design phase, of the relative merits of the  two technologies in terms of such things as productivity,  applicability, precision, and cost, so as to be able to make the  most effective use of both. In particular, in the interest of  making designs with good precision, we must thoroughly  understand the degrees of approximation and simulation which CFD  provides, so as to appreciate the scope of applicability.  <H5>  5. Concluding Remarks </H5>   The biggest problem with wind tunnel tests is the failure to  achieve actual aircraft Re numbers with wind tunnel Re numbers.  For this reason, in order to grasp actual craft characteristics,  one must rely on Re number extrapolations, with which accurate  estimates are very difficult. This being so, as can be seen in  Boeing's keen interest in building a high-Re number wind tunnel,  we believe that the demand for wind tunnels providing Re numbers  near those of actual aircraft will continue.    On the other hand, there are still problems with CFD  sequential problem analysis, such as the ability to analyze  flows which include large separation, the long TAT times, and  solution reproducibility. We now need to re-evaluate turbulence  models, shorten preprocessing times using non-structural grid  techniques, and study dependencies using grids.    We are working in the area of non-structural grid  techniques,  having perfected software for two-dimensional NS analysis and  working on the application of this to three-dimensional NS  analysis.    Furthermore, by improving CFD inverse problem analysis  techniques, it has become possible to make design work more  effective and more highly precise. In order to make possible  dramatic design breakthroughs, however, we also think that the  design goals and pressure distributions, etc., determined on the  basis of conventional designer experience and know-how, need to  be theoretically studied, as is seen in the optimized pressure  distribution.[.sup]10[/]  References    1.

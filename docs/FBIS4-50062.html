			<p>BFN     [Text] Chunan, Zhejiang Province, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A  group sent by the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  today visited Chun'an County in Zhejiang Province to inspect the  site of the Qiandao Lake incident.    In the accompany of mainland legal experts invited by the  mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS), the group, including Taiwan's legal experts and  relatives of the victims of the incident, went to see the  "Hairui" boat and instruments used by suspects in the murder  case.    The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chun'an  County on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and  the robbery and murder of 32 victims from Taiwan and the  mainland. Of the dead, 24 were tourists from Taiwan.    After the inspection, Shi Hwei-yow, SEF's deputy  secretary-general, said it is helpful to understand the whole  incident and to see the scene of the crime.    During the two-hour inspection, the SEF group went onto the  "Hairui", which is docked in the boat-building yard of Chun'an  County. They reviewed the entire structure of the boat and  fire damage on the upper, middle and lower cabins. They also  asked questions about the cause of the fire and how it spread,  the position of the explosives and the fittings of the boat.    The legal experts from the mainland answered the questions  in  detail.    The SEF group also went to a small house not far away from  the "Hairui" where the tools of the suspects in the incident and  their booty were kept, including two hunting rifles, a bag of  explosives for civilian use, a pail for gasoline, cameras, gold  and jade trinkets, watches, video tapes, and pictures developed  from the film in the cameras.    The SEF group also inspected the motorboat used by the  suspects.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Welsh grant charges rejected Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected allegations that Pounds 7m of government grants had been illegally channelled to marginal constituencies in mid Wales, Roland Adburgham writes. In a BBC Wales television programme last night it was claimed the money was disbursed through the Welsh Development Agency after the region lost its assisted-area status in 1982. It was said that, under the 1975 act which set up the development agency, it had no legal powers to do this. Mr Jon Owen Jones, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, called on Mr Redwood to resign. He said: 'It's a clear case of the political masters deciding that the money should follow their own perceived political advantage.' Mr Redwood accused the BBC of 'not doing its homework' and described the allegations as 'scandalous'. He said: 'The legal advice I have is that the powers are available under the WDA act.' Parliament had been told in 1982 about the aid and it had not been challenged. 'This is just a sign that we have an election coming up,' Mr Redwood said. He would, however, call for a report from officials. The Welsh Office said: 'The money has been used to finance business in mid Wales, has created hundreds of jobs legitimately and has been audited. There is no evidence at all that the scheme has been used for wrong purposes.' Mr Ron Davies, Labour shadow Welsh secretary, said yesterday the government had made a mistake in scrapping assisted area status for mid Wales. Re-enter controversy, Page 22</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: FROM GENIO'S IN BURBANK, A DOUBLE HELPING OF A PEPPERY MEAT LOAF  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: My husband swears Genio's in Burbank has the best meat loaf to be  found anywhere. Could you possibly get the recipe? I'd love to make it for our  fifth wedding anniversary.  </P> <P>  -- LISA  </P> <P> DEAR LISA: Chef-owner Gene Cecchini graciously parted with his recipe, which  was given in double portion. You can prepare two loaves and freeze one for a  future meal or simply cut the recipe by half.  </P> <P> Cecchini also suggested adjusting the seasonings to personal taste. If you  don't like peppery meat loaf, use less pepper than called for in the recipe.  You can also omit the cumin, cinnamon, hot pepper sauce or caraway seeds, and  use your own blend of herbs and spices, if you want.  </P> <P> GENIO'S CALIFORNIA MEAT LOAF  </P> <P> 2 Italian sausages  </P> <P> 2 green onions  </P> <P> 1/2 medium onion  </P> <P> 1 tomato  </P> <P> 1 large clove garlic  </P> <P> 1/8 bunch parsley  </P> <P> 1/8 bunch cilantro  </P> <P> 4 pounds ground beef  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> Hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> Grind sausages, green onions, onion, tomato, garlic, parsley and cilantro  together in food processor. Add to ground beef and mix well.  </P> <P> Add caraway and cumin seeds, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Stir in egg and hot  pepper sauce to taste.  </P> <P> Pack mixture into 2 (9-inch) loaf pans and place in larger pan filled with  1/2-inch water. Bake at 350 degrees 1 1/2 hours or until browned. Let stand 10  minutes before serving. Makes 6 servings per loaf.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with mushroom gravy or other favorite sauce, if desired.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I've lost my recipe for Shaker Lemon Pie, which calls for sliced  fresh lemons soaked overnight with sugar. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- JEAN  </P> <P> DEAR JEAN: This recipe comes directly from the dining room at Shakertown, the  restored Shaker village near Louisville, Ky., where I had a wonderful overnight  stay.  </P> <P> SHAKER LEMON PIE  </P> <P> 2 large lemons  </P> <P> 2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 4 eggs, well beaten  </P> <P> Pastry for 2-crust pie  </P> <P> Slice lemons paper thin, including peel. Combine with sugar and mix well. Let  stand at least 2 hours or preferably overnight, mixing occasionally.  </P> <P> Fold in beaten eggs, mixing well. Arrange slices evenly in 9-inch pie shell.  Cover with top crust. Cut several slits near center.  </P> <P> Bake at 450 degrees 15 minutes. Reduce heat and bake at 375 degrees 20 minutes  longer or until knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool before  serving. Makes 1 (9-inch) pie.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I recently had dinner at a restaurant in San Francisco where they  served a fried slice of Polenta, which was great. Do you have a recipe for  Polenta? I would love it.  </P> <P>  -- ELIZABETH  </P> <P> DEAR ELIZABETH: Polenta, which is nothing more than cornmeal mush, is a typical  staple found in various forms and names in countries from Southern to Northern  Europe.  </P> <P> Polenta can be spooned or sliced to serve with tomato sauce or gravy. Slices  can also be pan-fried to serve as an accompaniment with roasts in place of  potatoes or rice. We love it with roast pork or with crumbled cheese as an  appetizer.  </P> <P> POLENTA  </P> <P> 1 1/2 quarts water  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups finely ground polenta or yellow cornmeal  </P> <P> Tomato Sauce  </P> <P> Bring water and salt to full, rolling boil in heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan over  high heat. Pour polenta meal into boiling water slowly so boiling does not  cease. Stir to keep mixture smooth.  </P> <P> Reduce heat and simmer polenta, stirring frequently, 20 to 30 minutes. Polenta  is done when thick enough so spoon stands up unsupported in center of pan.  Serve at once with Tomato Sauce. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Polenta may also be served with gravy, butter or cheese.  </P> <P> Tomato Sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1/2 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 2 cups chopped Italian plum tomatoes  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons tomato paste  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Heat oil in 2- or 3-quart saucepan, add onion and cook over medium heat 7 to 8  minutes or until onion is tender, but not brown. Add tomatoes, tomato paste,  basil, sugar, salt and pepper to taste.  </P> <P> Simmer over very low heat, with pan partially covered, about 40 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Makes 1 1/2 cups.  </P> <P>  Only recipes of general interest will be printed. We are unable to answer all  requests. Please include restaurant address when requesting recipes from  restaurants.

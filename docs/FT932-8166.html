			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Stability in house market reported STABILITY HAS returned to the housing market, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday, although it warned that sellers should ask 'sensible' prices. The RICS said: 'The market has been taking increasingly confident steps out of recession for nearly six months, but only now can the RICS conclude that stability has returned.' More than 80 per cent of chartered surveyors reported for the second consecutive month that prices were steady. But the institution warned that the recovery was not a signal to raise prices. 'There have been many reports of homeowners reading of recovery and increasing their prices only to find that their property has become a market pariah,' it said.</p>

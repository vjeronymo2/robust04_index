			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0000 GMT on 3 January, as part of its 60-minute "New  Year Interview Program With the Heads of the Opposition  Parties," carries a 40-minute recorded interview with Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono by NHK commentator  Takashi Yamamoto and NHK announcer Atsuko Yamada at the NHK  studios. The interview was recorded on 29 December.    At 0001 GMT, Yamamoto begins interviewing LDP President Kono  by asking his evaluation of the Hosokawa government. Kono  states: "The people warmly welcomed the Hosokawa government,  which replaced the LDP, a party which had been in power for a  long time. But when I think about the Hosokawa government's  achievements, there have been no admirable political  achievements." Asked by Yamada why the LDP delayed  deliberations of the political reform bills in the House of  Councillors, Kono replies: "During the past month, the LDP  joined Diet deliberations on the supplementary budget for fiscal  1993. As for the political reform bills, deliberations were  also conducted in both the Political Reform Committee and the  plenary session of the House of Councillors. I do not want the  people to misunderstand." Asked by Yamamoto if his party makes  no contentions about passing the political reform bills during  the current Diet session, Kono says: "No, our party strongly  hopes to put an end to the issue of political reform. Frankly  speaking, if we should carry over this issue to the next  ordinary Diet session, it will be difficult to settle the other  issues which have to be solved. Therefore, I hope to conclude  the issue of political reform during the current extraordinary  Diet session." He then stresses that the ruling parties should  make concessions to have the political reform bills passed. He  also explains major points of difference between the ruling  parties and the LDP on political reform.    Asked by Yamamoto if Prime Minister Hosokawa should hold  himself responsible if he fails to have the political reform  bills passed during the current Diet session, Kono states: "In  a press conference, he apologized for failing to carry out  political reform. But as you know, Hosokawa also pledged to the  Diet that he would pass the bills by the end of 1993. He needs  to make clear to the Diet whether he will take responsibility.  Our party plans to take up this issue at the Budget Committee  session early in the new year." Asked if the LDP plans to call  for the resignation of the cabinet en masse, Kono replies: "We  first need to hear his present state of mind." As regards the  possible dissolution of the House of Representatives, Kono  notes: "We are not in the position to refer to the dissolution  of the House of Representatives because the right to dissolve  the Diet is held by the prime minister. But we are in a  situation wherein the government is required to give priority to  protecting the people's living. When I think of the current  economic condition, I find the people are in a serious economic  situation. What politicians have to do first is to protect the  people's standards of living. However, if the prime minister,  who has the power to dissolve the Diet, should decide to  dissolve the House of Representatives, we cannot do anything  about it." In this way, Kono indicates the party is ready to  accept the prime minister's challenge.    Asked if he intends to hold talks with Prime Minister  Hosokawa to narrow gaps between the ruling parties and the LDP  on political reform, Kono responds in the negative, saying  holding such talks will devalue the importance of Diet  deliberations.    Yamada discusses economic issues, asking Kono to comment on  the Hosokawa government's economic policy. Kono replies the  government lacks a sense of crisis about the current economic  situation, saying: "We are in the worst economic condition  since the end of the war, and I don't think the government's  coming economic measures based on past experiences will help  overcome the situation." Asked by Yamamoto how he views the  idea of cutting the income tax in order to boost the economy,  Kono stresses that the 10 trillion-yen in income tax cuts is  necessary, adding "other stimulus measures also have to be  taken." As regards the issue of how to secure revenue sources  to make up for a fiscal budget shortfall resulting from the  income tax decrease, Kono says: "Raising the consumption tax  will not help boost the economy. What is most important for us  is to restore the economy." Yamamoto then asks Kono: "Do you  think the government should boost the economy even by issuing  deficit-covering bonds?" Kono answers: "Yes."    Yamamoto turns the subject to reform of the LDP. Asked how  he would change the LDP, Kono says underlying the party's loss  of power is the people's distrust of the LDP's money-power  politics; he intends to regain the people's confidence. Asked  about a move toward realigning the political parties, Kono rules  out a possible split in the LDP.    The interview ends at 0040 GMT.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: RWE buys three energy units from Treuhand RWE Energie, Germany's largest utility, has strengthened its position in eastern Germany's energy industry by purchasing three regional utilities from the Treuhand privatisation agency. RWE has acquired majority stakes in the ESAG utility at Cottbus in the eastern state of Brandenburg, WESAG in Leipzig, and a smaller stake in EVS, which is in the Saxon city of Chemnitz. It will invest DM2.6bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in the companies over five years and guarantee 4,750 jobs until the end of 1998. The investments will be used for modernising and upgrading the utilities. The deals give RWE a virtual monopoly in the generation and distribution of energy in this part of eastern Germany largely because of the electricity contract between the former west and east German governments. Under the terms of the contract, west Germany's utility companies are legally permitted to own 51 per cent of eastern Germany's 15 utilities, with the remaining 49 per cent held by the eastern municipalities. However, in order to underwrite investments of about DM46bn by western German utilities, the contract stipulated that eastern German utilities must buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag, a leading east Germany utility. Veag is controlled by western Germany's eight electricity companies, including RWE which holds the largest stake in Veag. Later this year, Veag is expected to be sold by the Treuhand to west Germany's utilities, while Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal subsidiary, is leading a western German consortium to buy eastern Germany's Laubag brown coal fields.</p>

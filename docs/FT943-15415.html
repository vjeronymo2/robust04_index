			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Northern cool in the Neapolitan heat: The first 50 days of G7 host, Berlusconi Like any fellow Milanese businessman, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, must have regarded the prospect of hosting the G7 summit in Naples with unease. The cheerful anarchy and decadence of the city is anathema to the hardworking northerners. The clash of cultures was evident from Mr Berlusconi's pre-summit press conference in the 17th-century Palazzo Reale, where the main meetings are being staged this weekend. Immaculately groomed and with a perfect tan, in almost any other setting Mr Berlusconi would have looked impressively cast as the New Age prime minister, representing a country that prides itself on its public appearance. But in the baroque splendour of the Bourbon monarchs' private theatre his modern image looked out of place. The humidity has been trying for hosts and guests alike. It made Mr Berlusconi look uncomfortable when he was forced to dab at the sweat on his forehead with a handkerchief. Left to his own devices, Mr Berlusconi would probably have opted to organise the summit elsewhere. However, he inherited the decision made by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the previous prime minister. Mr Ciampi chose Naples out of central government guilt for decades of neglect towards the former capital of the kingdom of the two Sicilies. Though hosting a party he did not organise, Mr Berlusconi clearly intends to make the most of the opportunity to launch himself on to the world stage. His media background should stand him in good stead. Those who know him attest to his charm as a host, which should ensure his guests at the meeting of the seven leading industrial nations - plus Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president - feel relatively at ease. Yet if Mr Berlusconi can reap easy publicity from the occasion, it will not hide the widening gap between the image and reality of the new regime in Italy. The Naples gathering occurs when his right-wing coalition is showing signs of wear and tear - after only 50 days since the parliamentary vote of confidence which in effect launched the Berlusconi administration. On Thursday a cabinet meeting - expected to approve the outlines of macroeconomic policy and agree on a bill to settle the sensitive issue of providing a form of amnesty for the hundreds involved in corruption scandals  -was too divided to decide anything. The three-man team of economic ministers failed to win any advance commitment from Mr Berlusconi on the introduction of austerity measures in the 1995 budget to hold the deficit below 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Rumours of resignations flew at high velocity, and Mr Berlusconi decided to cool tempers by going to the summit early instead of attending the cabinet session. But even in Naples he was caught by talk of resignations. He was obliged to take the embarrassing step of interrupting a press conference, at which he had just extolled the achievements of his government, to deny market rumours that his economic team was resigning. The markets seemed to be worried by the absence of an agreed economic policy statement and by disputes within government over the harshness of the measures to be imposed on Italians, to whom Mr Berlusconi had promised lower taxes and more jobs. But the rumour mill was fuelled by genuine threats to resign from Mr Alfredo Biondi, justice minister, and Mr Giuliano Urbani, civil service minister. Mr Biondi was angered by the cool reception from within the government coalition for his proposals to find a political solution to the corruption investigations. Mr Urbani, one of Mr Berlusconi's ideologues, was incensed by the way his colleagues in Forza Italia had drawn up a proposal to reform the electoral law without consulting him. The proposal envisaged every seat in parliament being covered by the first-past-the-post system in the next election, instead of the current 75 per cent. Mr Urbani favoured a second-round run-off, and believed the reforms were being unnecessarily hurried. These tensions serve to highlight three unsettling aspects of the new administration: its inexperience; Mr Berlusconi's apparent reluctance to take decisions; and the heterogeneous nature of the coalition. Of the three, inexperience is arguably the least important, although it may initially lead to some mistakes. All but two of the 25 ministers have had no ministerial experience, and the junior ministers are novices. To this has to be added a bureaucracy that for four decades has depended on a patronage system, orchestrated by all-powerful ruling parties that have now disappeared off the map. These start-up problems have been aggravated by the aggressive manner in which Mr Berlusconi and his allies have sought to demonstrate they hold the levers of power and do not need to cut deals with the opposition in the centre and on the left. Previously everyone was kept content with some bite of the state's pie. This posture explains the high-profile battle to gain control of the RAI state broadcasting organisation, the enforced departure of Mr Romano Prodi from running IRI, the state holding company, and efforts to unseat Mr Franco Bernabe at ENI, the state oil concern. It also accounts for the government's insistence on its right to appoint a successor to Mr Lamberto Dimi, who moved from being director general at the Bank of Italy to become treasury minister. These battles are being fought with little regard for the diplomatic fall-out. More often than not, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has found himself using his limited authority to ensure that there are some checks on the power of the government. This in turn has weakened his tenure as president - he has always been vulnerable, as a former Christian Democrat interior minister elected by the previous discredited parliament. These power struggles have taken priority over policy formulation. Since Mr Berlusconi took power in mid-May, only a few minor policies, such as tax breaks for creating jobs, have been introduced. Partly, this is because the government was unprepared to govern. But it is also due to Mr Berlusconi's own style of decision making. He ran his Fininvest business empire by relying on a small group of friends to toss around ideas, and then orders were executed by a compliant staff. He is still surrounded by the same group of Fininvest associates; but he now has to sell policies to a cabinet composed of the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/ National Alliance and his own Forza Italia, which all have different agendas. Once issues are past the cabinet hurdle, they then have to go to parliament, where the government lacks a clear majority in the senate. The decision-making process is thus naturally slow. But Mr Berlusconi has not helped himself. By failing to clarify his economic policy, he has squandered the goodwill of the markets. In the past three weeks, the markets have become dismayed by his apparent refusal to confront the central issue of Italy's public finances, focusing instead on stimulating jobs and consolidating a timid domestic recovery. The stock market has weakened and the lira has reached a psychological floor of L1,000 to the D-Mark. Financial analysts say that unless he reacts soon, the lira could face a battering and the Bank of Italy may be forced to raise interest rates. That might prove a self-inflicted wound which could upset Mr Berlusconi's honeymoon with Italian voters.</p>

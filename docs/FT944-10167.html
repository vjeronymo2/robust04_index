			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices continue to fluctuate without a positive overall trend, at least in the short term. A peak in mid-September was followed by a sharp setback, but recovery from this failed to establish a new peak before the market fell back slightly last week. This minor downturn also failed to develop further and Australia's Eastern market indicator rose 9 cents to 790 during this week's sales. The New Zealand market eased, with the indicator there down by 14 cents to 543 NZ cents a kg. The US dollar's fluctuations, which have relevance for currencies in wool producing countries as well as for wool and textile trade more widely, have tended to push up prices in many wool textile manufacturing countries but have at the same time tended to make buyers further down the trading line even more reluctant to operate.</p>

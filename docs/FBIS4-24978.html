			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zheng Jie: "Investors Snapping Up Bonds"] </F>   [Text] Shanghai -- Shanghai citizens are queuing up with  great enthusiasm for this year's sale of two- and three-year  State treasury bonds.    Last Sunday [29 May], local citizens snapped up 6.5 billion  yuan ($747 million) in two-year notes, according to the  municipal office orchestrating the bond issue.    The office said local securities firms playing a major role  in underwriting the treasury notes, have taken up 2.8 billion  yuan ($322 million) in bonds, more than 10 per cent of all the  two-year notes being sold by the central government this year.    The figure is 65 per cent more than the total bought by  local  investors last year.    Shanghai Finance Securities Co took the lead by underwriting  700 million yuan ($80 million) worth.    Sales figures for the three-year bonds, underwritten by  banks, were still being calculated, but the Shanghai branch of  the central bank said things were going smoothly.    The warm response to the issue, which is scheduled to end at  the end of this month, put officials in the municipal office at  ease. They said it is possible that, for the first time in  recent years, demand may outstrip supply.    In the last two or three years, local authorities have had  to  resort to administrative measures to issue treasury bonds, which  lost public favour because of inflationary pressure and the  appeal of the city's fast-growing stock market.    However, with the stock market losing ground for more than a  year, officials said, investors are redirecting their attention  to the safer investment of bonds.    The favourable interest rates and flexible terms are the  major attractions of this year's treasury bonds.    The annual interest rate of the two-year bonds is 13 per  cent, 1.3 points higher than bank deposits of the same duration.    The interest rate for the three-year bonds, offered as  certificates of ownership, will be 13.9 per cent, surpassing  banks' three-year fixed deposits by 1.7 points.    Though the three-year bonds will not enter the market like  the two-year bonds, purchasers will be able to cash their  certificates in advance and still obtain higher interest than a  bank deposit if they hold onto the bonds for more than six  months.    To lure more buyers, the Finance Ministry has encouraged  people to cash in their 1991 three-year treasury bonds, due on  July 1, and their five-year 1989 special treasury bonds early to  buy the new bonds.    These buyers will be offered an additional percentage point  for their old bonds.</p>

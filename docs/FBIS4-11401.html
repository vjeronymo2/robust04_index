			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passage within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Text] A police raid took place in Raboteau, Gonaives on 15  April. Four or five people were shot during this raid in the  slum area of Raboteau. According to a police source, the  operation was held to find some unidentified armed people. A  witness reports the facts to Clarence Renois:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified witness ] "The situation is  not at all good for the people in Raboteau. Since last weekend,  the people have been dealing with a massacre. For instance, on  the night of 17 April to 18 April, the military came into the  area because they were looking for a man called Arnault Mtayer,  also known as "El Cubano." According to the police, he is armed  and leads a small, heavily armed group. They have been searching  for these men for a long time in order to arrest them.    ``The police want to know from where they get their weapons?  Police never got to arrest these men, and innocent people paid  for it. Many people were beaten by FRAPH [Revolutionary Front  for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] members who came with  the military. Many people were arrested, and on 19 April, the  police released some of them after interrogating them. They did  not go to court. The people were asked questions, then released  between 19 and 20 April.    ``On 22 April, while the population was carrying on its  daily  activities, police arrived in the area. People who lived near  the abattoir [as heard] took to the sea to escape, but even the  sea was full of military and heavy weapons."    [Renois] "All of that took place in Raboteau?"    [Witness] "It took place in Raboteau over the past weekend.  Some people died. On Saturday, another body was found, making  it four people dead. Other corpses might be soon found because  many fishermen, who were just returning from fishing, were  reportedly shot down by the military, according to people from  the area.    ``The people have abandoned Raboteau for some other towns  near Gonaives. It is a total massacre that the people in  Raboteau are facing, with the police searching for Mtayer, also  known as `El Cubano.'"    [Renois] "What do the police accuse those wanted people of  doing?"    [Witness] "The police say those people carry weapons. So the  police want to arrest them in order to find out where those  weapons come from."    [Renois] "What kind of actions did the unidentified armed  men  take? Are they criminal actions or political acts that they  would be involved in?"    [Witness] "I believe that if they were criminal actions,  people from the area would have stopped them instead of letting  the police search for them. I believe if the people in the area  did not stop those armed people, it is because they do not have  any problem with the people living in this area." [end recording]</p>

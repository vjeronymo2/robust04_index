			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: First National Bank lifts income 20.5% FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, lifted net income by 20.5 per cent to R187.8m (Dollars 65.2m) in the six months to the end of March on the back of asset growth of 18 per cent. The bank recorded a 26.9 per cent increase in net interest income, to R920.6m, and a 21.8 per cent rise in the bad debt charge, to R160.5m. Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said the interest performance was the result of the bank's focus on profitable business. The 27 per cent increase in net interest income came from a 20.6 per cent increase in advances. Mr Swart said bad debts had risen more than anticipated - the bank forecast an overall drop for the year to September 1992 - but attributed this to an unforeseen double-dip recession and the impact of the severe drought. Although FNB has a large market share in agricultural lending, Mr Swart said that less than 10 per cent of total loans went to the agricultural sector. Other operating income was 21 per cent higher at R645.4m, but this was overshadowed by a 23.1 per cent increase in other operating expenses. Assets increased by 18 per cent to R39.5bn. Mr Swart said FNB wanted to continue to be aggressive in increasing its assets, and most of the R550m raised in a rights issue earlier this year would be used for this purpose. Earnings per share rose by 20.4 per cent to 257.7 cents and the dividend was lifted by 11.1 per cent to 50 cents per share.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasyl Lukyanchuk: "1993 -- the Year of Ukraine's </F> Defeat"]    [Text] This was the conclusion of the Fourth Congress of  the national union Ukraine's State Independence [DSU]. The year  1993 has become a year of defeats of the Ukrainian people: As a  result of the collaboration of the democratic-communist elite  with Moscow, Washington, and Tel Aviv, certain agreements have  been signed, which endanger Ukraine's sovereignty, its  territorial integrity, and its Armed Forces. During this year,  Ukraine has not even approached its long-dreamed independence.    Thanks to the communists and the democrats, who are Russian  and American fifth columns, as well as due to their  protectionist policy toward the Russian and Jewish ethnic  minorities, the situation of the Ukrainians on their own soil  has become unbearable.    Nowadays, the Ukrainians are kept even farther away from the  levers of power than on the eve of the proclamation of  independence; the birthrate has dramatically dropped, mortality  among the Ukrainians has increased, and life expectancy has  considerably decreased.    Russification is rampant: Stores are jammed with Russian  Stalinist literature and OSTANKINO has spread its expansionist  propaganda to the Ukraine. At the same time, Ukrainian  publications and books are disappearing.    The Russian language dominates on the streets, in courts, in  the Army, and at the Supreme Council. Separatist movements are  flexing their muscles.    The socioeconomic situation of the Ukrainians has  deteriorated, living conditions have declined, and foreign  capital has become deep-rooted on our territories.    Ukraine has become a territory, on which counterespionage  services of hostile states operate freely: First of all, these  include the Russia's KGB and Counterintelligence Service,  America's CIA, and the Jewish Mosad. Agents from these  countries have become leaders of a majority of Ukrainian  parties, movements, banks, and funds. There are plenty of them  in the Supreme Council, the president's offices, the Security  Service of Ukraine, and the General Staff of the Navy.  Simultaneously, patriotic officers are being released from duty  in the Armed Forces.    Due to the defeatist policy of [Ukrainian President] Leonid  Kravchuk, Ukraine has lost the Black Sea Fleet and its tactical  nuclear weapons. In accordance with agreements signed by the  president, tanks, airplanes, armored carriers, and the equipment  of the Antiaircraft Defense are being dismantled. Russian  troops still remain on Ukrainian land. Parties comprising  advocates of Ukraine's statehood are persecuted by the  democratic-communist structures: Telephones belonging to  activists of the national movement are being bugged and their  correspondence monitored; activities of Ukrainian economic  structures are hampered; statements by DSU, the Organization of  Ukrainian Nationalists, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican  Party [UKRP], and the Union of Ukrainian Youth are sporadically  presented by the media. Television is available only for  Kravchuk's servants, the Russian and Jewish ethnic minorities,  and adherents of Western "values." The official press is  conducting a smear campaign against Ukrainian patriots, which is  called the fight against Ukrainian fascism. The anti-Ukrainian  authorities are trying to ban opposition newspapers,  particularly NESKORENA NATSIYA, as well as to arrest their  editors and other leading Ukrainian journalists.    The political trials of members of DSU, UKRP, the Ukrainian  National Assembly, the Ukrainian National Self Defense, and the  Volyn Sich Cossacks are being continued. Ukrainian patriots  still remain in prisons.    Today, only Ukrainian nationalism with its program  principles  -- "Ukrainian state above all!" and "Ukraine for Ukrainians!" --  is able to avert a national catastrophe.    The main task of DSU is to unite all the patriotic forces of  Ukraine around the nationalistic idea, as well as to shake off  our necks the shameful foreign yoke. It is necessary to  introduce a national dictatorship for a transitional period of  national liberation and for establishing a national  infrastructure.    National dictatorship is an urgent necessity of the  transitional period. Only national dictatorship is capable of  fulfilling the historic task of reviving Ukrainian statehood, as  well as of establishing a just nationalistic order and a  permanent political system in Ukraine.</p>

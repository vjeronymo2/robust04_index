			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Economics Notebook: Spotlight on Italy's privileged tax refugees Holders of Italian short-term treasury paper are disarmingly nicknamed the 'Bot-people'. These are the individuals and institutions who have traditionally taken refuge from Italy's hostile world of inflation, threats from the taxman and volatile stock market by relying on the security of treasury bills (BOTs). The Bot-people have been assiduously courted by successive post-war governments and have been given enormous privileges. Bearers of Bots are anonymous and pay income tax on interest at a minimal 12.5 per cent. Interest rates offered are extremely attractive, currently some 7 per cent in real terms. In a country with a large parallel economy and punitive tax rates on declared income, state guaranteed paper has been - and still is - an unbeatable investment for those with only lira expenses. Indeed Italy is the last country in the EC where the state courts the investor in such a generous manner. This, though, is not surprising. Italy has long run a budget deficit, which has steadily been increasing as the debt stock has grown. Total accumulated debt has risen from 58 per cent of GDP in 1980 (the maximum set by the now much criticised 1991 Maastricht Treaty) to the current 104 per cent. The 1993 budget deficit consists entirely of debt service payments. State paper has to be attractive to finance the deficit and because of the exchange risk to outsiders it is chiefly attractive to Italians. As a result although Italy accounts for almost a third of all EC debt, only 6.5 per cent of this is held by foreigners. The rest is in the hands of Italians and Italian institutions. The enormous needs of the treasury, coupled with the advantages of state paper, have led Italy consistently to possess one of the highest savings ratios in Europe. Financing the debt has also created a peculiarly distorted savings profile. According to Bank of Italy figures, the average family savings portfolio is 12.7 per cent in short-term state paper (basically Bots) and 18.8 per cent in medium and long-term state paper. This compares with a combined total under the two headings of 2.7 per cent in France and 1.7 per cent in the UK. This distortion in the direction of savings has mattered little until now. But with the Amato committed to a major programme of privatisation over the next three to four years, the distortion has been brought into focus. The government is planning to raise almost L40,000bn (Pounds 18bn) during this period through divestiture and partial sell-off of banks and industrial companies. Foreign capital of necessity is expected to play a considerable part, but most will have to come from domestic sources at a time of recession and projected sluggish growth. In tandem with financing (and hopefully reducing) the debt, the government has to encourage investors, especially the Bot-people, to switch their attention to the bourse. For the world's fifth industrial power, the bourse is a Cinderella compared with Italy's main partners. The turnover volume in relation to GDP is less than half that of France and a quarter that of the UK, according to the latest government assessments in privatisation documents. Last year average daily turnover was L124bn and in the period January-September of this year it fell to an average of L106bn. Since 1985 only on nine occasions has daily turnover risen above L500bn, and of these eight occurred in the boom year of 1986 with one record of L800bn. That record year saw new issues and company capital increases of L14,500bn. But this year so far the figure new issues and capital increases is a little above L2,300bn, and almost entirely has been accounted for by two issues - one from the STET, the state-controlled telephone holding, and San Paolo di Torino, the bank. Treasury experts estimate without changes in the bourse's operations and fresh investment incentives its capacity to raise funds has a ceiling of around 5 per cent of total capitalisation, or less than L10,000bn a year. Yet if the privatisation programme proceeds, the total value of new issues and capital increases next year alone will be close to L20,000bn  - double the present capacity. In part the bourse bears blame for failing to modernise and for its lack of transparency that has created a strong odour of insider dealing. However, the government has never provided incentives to encourage share ownership largely through fear of damaging the demand for state paper. To make risk investment in the stock market more attractive, the government is studying a number of measures. First of these is to provide a package of fiscal incentives for share ownership. Second is the development of pension funds (less than 9 per cent of pensions are paid into pension funds). A third idea is to permit the exchange of state paper for shares in newly privatised companies. A more controversial move, which the government has constantly denied contemplating, is that of raising the tax paid on Bots which account for nearly a third of state paper. At a time when the government is seeking to raise fiscal revenues and create a more rational tax structure, the continued privileges of the Bot-people are an increasing anomaly. Nevertheless, the howls of protest which have greeted suggestions in recent months that the government might tax Bots higher - or freeze interest payments - underline how sensitive the issue is. Such a move might only be palatable if compensatory tax breaks were offered on share ownership. But this would mean Italians accepting the concept of greater risk with their savings, and it still leaves the treasury with the need to fund a huge deficit. The resolution of this dilemma holds the key to Italy developing a fully fledged capital market.</p>

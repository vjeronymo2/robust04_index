			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / New talks on peace in Mexico Talks aimed at reopening peace negotiations between the Mexican government and armed rebels in the south-eastern state of Chiapas will start this week, after a weekend of protests there, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City. Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a local mediator in the crisis, announced a series of 'urgent meetings' after about 20,000 indigenous peasants had blocked all roads in and out of Chiapas at the weekend and demonstrated in at least 40 towns. Officials warned of a possible resumption of hostilities in the state, where Zapatista left-wing guerrillas began an uprising on January 1. Demonstrators are now seeking to prevent Mr Eduardo Robledo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party from taking office as governor, after his election on August 21. They allege fraud and are demanding that Mr Amado Avendano of the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, who was openly supported by the rebels, be declared victor. Bishop Ruiz said that a 'clarification' of electoral irregularities, as well as a new round of peace talks, was the key to any permanent settlement in the state. Mr Robledo 'is going to have very serious problems,' he added.</p>

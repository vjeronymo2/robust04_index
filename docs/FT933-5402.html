			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / A snip at the tangle of red tape: Will Japan's government succeed in deregulating the economy, ask William Dawkins and Robert Thomson Anybody wanting to understand the constraints on Japan's economy should try to open a supermarket. The aspiring retailer must read 17 laws and 45 administrative regulations, fill in 200 pages of application forms and wait perhaps 18 months for a reply, which could be No because a local small shopkeeper does not welcome fresh competition. The cost of this frustration is heavy. Mr Isao Nakauchi, chairman of Daiei, a retailing group, reckons Y58bn (Pounds 364m) in extra sales could be generated annually by a relaxation of restrictions on store openings. But the costs to economic efficiency and to Japanese consumers, denied choice by over-regulation, are greater. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, has recognised the problem. His seven-party coalition government has announced a hit list of 60 deregulation proposals, ranging from the easing of controls on new stores to freeing up satellite broadcasting. If he has his way, the impact on Japan will be great. Beer will be cheaper, taxi fares will come down, and Japanese television viewers will have more choice. The deregulation drive is a Japanese version of the generally successful campaign against barriers to competition by the European Community and the US in the 1980s. Mr Hosokawa faces vested corporate interests and the powerful bureaucracy, which usually blocks changes that weaken its influence. A sign of the challenge before the Hosokawa coalition is that the deregulation list was prepared by these territory-conscious bureaucrats, who inserted several contentious proposals rejected several times in the past decade. But Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce half of the measures by next March. European and US companies and governments have a stake in the programme. If successful, it will allow easier entry into markets and remove, in some industries, a layer or two of a distribution system that increases costs and restricts the flow of new products. A final plan will be presented to parliament on September 20, part of a package to stimulate Japan's flagging economy. A few days later, Mr Hosokawa addresses the UN assembly and meets US leaders, who will be told of action to encourage imports and reduce the overall Japanese trade surplus, up 17.6 per cent in the first half to Dollars 57.3bn (Pounds 38bn). The package includes gas and electricity discounts for big industrial users, fewer controls on construction material imports and mobile telephone sales, an easing of restrictions on the freight weight of large trucks, an end to minimum production limits for brewers, which keep potential small producers out of the market, and fewer car roadworthiness inspections. The difficulties of introducing these and other measures were summed up yesterday by Mr Kiyoshi Ishihara, a Tokyo taxi driver, whose Y600 starting fare could be Y500 or even Y400 if fares are liberalised: 'Six years ago they started talking about deregulating taxi fares, and nothing has happened. We don't want it, and I don't think the Hosokawa coalition will last long enough to introduce it.' Mr Ishihara said the 'timing is wrong', as taxi drivers have suffered a fall in income - in his case, about 30 per cent - with the slowing of the Japanese economy. Change to the old ways would require some form of compensation to taxi drivers. Many of the proposals will meet similar opposition. Car makers have supported the roadworthiness certificate system, as they benefit from purchases inspired by the need for old cars to pass a test every two years, annually for cars more than 13 years old. Car repairers and parts suppliers have a similar interest. Ending a cosy cartel and increasing competition means treading on toes, and toe-treading in Japan is done with shoes off. Affected businesses receive subsidies to compensate them for bruises, but only after long negotiation with the bureaucrats responsible and ultimately with the ministry of finance, which provides the funds. For example, controls on opening large retail outlets will be relaxed under the deregulation proposals. In May 1990, Japan responded to US demands to amend the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which covers stores of 500 sq m or more. The US idea was that large stores would have increased shelf space for imported products and new retailers would be less beholden to traditional suppliers. To win approval for the changes, which took another year to be introduced, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry put together a Y162.1bn subsidy package for small retailers, who were able to use the funds for business promotions, including street fairs and pavement repairs. Three years later, despite a speeding of approvals for new large stores, small shopkeepers are still able to put obstacles in the way of ambitious retailers such as Daiei. Will Mr Hosokawa be able to side-step the vested interests or will deregulation be a flop? The consensus among economic and political observers is that, whatever the outcome of these proposals, the policy debate has been shifted, giving consumers benefits where producers' interests have long predominated. Mr Hosokawa's reputation hangs on the outcome. He is famed for complaining that, as a provincial governor, he could not move a bus stop without approval from Tokyo bureaucrats. If he does cut a way through the thicket of opposition, the next government will be under pressure to follow the path of deregulation. 'We are at the start of a tremendous transition, even if we do not yet have a clear vision of what the new system will be about,' says Mr Susumu Taketomi, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, a long-term credit bank. 'The post-war system was rational, but no longer matches our maturing economy.' One of Mr Hosokawa's difficulties is the fragility of his seven-party coalition, already divided a month after taking office and expected to split within a year. The prime minister was told this week by one partner, the Japan Renewal party, to devote his energies to political reform and not to be distracted by economic or foreign policies. Another partner, the Social Democratic party, formerly the Socialist party, is uncomfortable about deregulation. It has always supported small shopkeepers in preference to larger retailers, but the latter will profit from the proposals. Individual politicians will be under pressure from local lobby groups to leave the laws unchanged. And it is easy to imagine why Japan's four big brewers might object to a proposal to end the present 2,000 kilolitre per year minimum production limit, as this would open the market to small breweries and foreign makers. As the taxi driver explained, the economic timing may be wrong. Deregulation tends to drive up unemployment by killing inefficient companies before stimulating economic activity, which the EC found when introducing single market programmes. A senior EC diplomat said then: 'The first thing that happens when you introduce level playing fields, is that the weak teams get beaten faster.' Mr Tom Hill, strategist at S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo, expects implementation to be slow: 'In the long term, the economic case is impeccable. But the short-term danger is that deregulation will introduce a dose of deflation at a time when the economy is already in the grip of deflationary forces.' But Mr Hosokawa does have support from Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, which is demanding deregulation and has even criticised the government's proposals as inadequate, producing 30 suggestions of its own. It wants the removal of import tariffs for car parts, direct rice sales between growers and shops, cutting out the middlemen, and a reduction in subsidies for dairy products. The list reflects the complaints of larger Japanese companies facing higher costs than foreign, especially Asian, competitors. These companies are burdened by a strong yen and, under extreme pressure to cut costs, have concluded the benefits of deregulation outweigh the costs. Having drafted a package, the government must now carry out the proposals. Sceptics should remember that the collapse of Liberal Democratic party rule after four decades came as a surprise to most Japanese. In this giddy atmosphere, the previously impossible is up for negotiation.</p>

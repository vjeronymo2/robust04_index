In a statement to QUDS PRESS, al-Zir said: Our job is not to  approve such things. He noted that "the municipality has  specific tasks which do not include supervising a police force."  Al-Zir said, however, that "the setting up of a police force in  Hebron should be carried out in coordination with the PLO and  Arab states that have ties with the city, such as Jordan and  Egypt." He stressed that "the Palestinians are demanding the  establishment of a strong, armed, and independent police force  in Hebron."    Al-Zir added: We do not accept this force being subordinate  to any Israeli authority no matter what shape this link might  have. [passage omitted]</p>

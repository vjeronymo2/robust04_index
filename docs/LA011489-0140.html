			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: IN WINTER, THE BEACH BELONGS TO US AGAIN  </P> <P> This is a sparkling, crackling clear day between the rains. I top the rise on  Marguerite Street and the Pacific is suddenly spread out before me -- the  closest I'll ever come in this life to infinity.  </P> <P> This is a Thursday, 2 hours past noon, midwinter. A few months from now,  parking will be hard to find on the street above the beach in Corona del Mar,  there will be a profusion of out-of-state license plates, and the sand will be  crawling with people in sunglasses dragging deck chairs and small children. But  today, the beach belongs to the natives. It's ours in the winter -- at least  those of us who can look up from work long enough to discover we can have this  magnificence almost all to ourselves.  </P> <P> On the grassy rim above the beach, the regulars have set up shop. An elderly  couple in His and Her lawn chairs, reading books and communicating through  their silence. Joggers, breathing hard, who have stopped to rest and immerse  themselves in the view. Other portable chairs are scattered along the grass,  mostly inhabited by older people reading but with folks just sitting and  looking.  </P> <P> There is much to see. The winter rains have momentarily washed away the smog  with which we shroud ourselves, and it's startling to realize what it could be  like if we stopped fouling our own atmosphere. Santa Catalina Island in its  full length stands out in sharp bas-relief, breathtaking in its size and  proximity, like a lost continent that appears once or twice a year to entice  us. From above, the beach looks almost entirely deserted, a vast expanse of  sand broken only by multiple refuse containers, fire pits, and two small boys  kicking a soccer ball while their mother idles along behind.  </P> <P> I drive down to the parking lot -- no fee on winter weekdays -- and find the  look from above is deceptive. The beach just looks deserted; actually, there is  much life here. It just has to be seen up close. As I park, several hundred  nervous gulls on the sand in front of me scramble, like a crazed air squadron  on instant alert. They settle down again 100 yards away, awaiting the next sign  of danger. A pickup truck pulls up beside me in the almost deserted parking  lot, and two men in work clothes get out. They have a bag from a fast-food  restaurant, and they head across the sand, leaving a large, shaggy dog in the  cab watching them forlornly.  </P> <P> I walk down to the seawall that parallels the boat channel to the open sea. The  sun is deceptive; it proffers warmth but the wind takes it away, gusting and  swirling with a real cutting edge. The water in the channel is turbulent,  slapping angrily at the seawall. For the first time in my memory, there are no  boats in the channel.  </P> <P> But people walk here, some of them bracing against the wind, some oblivious to  it. A white-haired man in a Windbreaker emerges from the rocks with his small  grandson who struggles along behind; they are in earnest and animated  conversation. Two sets of lovers come into view, one young and in blue jeans,  the other middle-aged and in street clothes. The older couple sits on a ledge  behind the seawall, talking quietly, ignoring the wind. The younger couple  climbs out on the jetty, hand-in-hand. A young blond woman is standing atop a  rock overlooking the beach, holding a small dog in one hand and trying  unsuccessfully to hold her skirt in the howling wind with the other.  </P> <P> Three people, unconnected, walk alone near the shoreline: a young man, a  middle-aged woman and an older woman. All are walking slowly, hands deep in  their pockets, mostly looking down at the sand. Two young women in office  attire take off their shoes and step gingerly into the sand, deep in  conversation. The water, breaking over the beach, is subdued, grayish blue,  looking a little angry and surly in the bright sun.  </P> <P> I study Catalina and remember that, as a boy in the Midwest, I was told that if  I dug a hole deep enough I would emerge in China -- a project I tried  unsuccessfully a number of times. I wonder if Orange County kids are told that  if they could swim far enough they would reach China. If so, on this day, they  could easily believe that Catalina is China -- or maybe kids don't fantasize  such things any more.  </P> <P> As I get back to my car, a van pulls up and three Asian men -- dressed against  the elements -- get out. They talk excitedly as they assemble a complex maze of  fishing gear, then set out across the sand, meeting the workers returning from  their sack lunch.  </P> <P> I wish I had brought a book and a lawn chair, but instead I must get to work.  But I'll be back. Not in the summer when a few square inches of sand are hard  to come by, but in the winter when we have this glorious beach to ourselves and  can watch it change character with the weather and time of day.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] London, March 16--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, today reaffirmed India's solemn commitment to  fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the constitution and  asserted that "there is no question of any going back on human  rights of the individual citizens," reports PTI.    Speaking after paying his homage to the historic magna  carta,  a source of inspiration and a symbol of freedom under the law  throughout the world, Mr Rao said the Indian constitution  provides the individual freedoms in no uncertain terms and  chapter three of the constitution on fundamental rights was full  elaboration of the principles symbolised by the magna carta  memorial. The memorial was erected at the spot at which King  John and his barons put their seal to charter of magna carta 779  years ago on June 15, 1215.    The Prime Minister unveiled a commemorative plaque and  planted an English oak at the memorial on the bank of river  Thames at Runnymede in Surrey about 25 km from here to mark  significance of this symbol of freedom on India's development of  democratic government.    Mr Rao briefly addressed the distinguished audience which  had  gathered at the memorial in the meadows of Surrey braving heavy  showers and a mild hailstorm before the Prime Minister's  arrival. The memorial was erected in 1957 by the American Bar  Association whose central pillar bears the inscription "to  commemorate magna carta, symbol of freedom under law."    The Indian Prime Minister is the second statesman after  President, J.F. Kennedy to associate himself with the home of  magna carta.    Mr Rao spoke about the human rights situation in India and  said those in the administration knew how difficult it was for  the government to conform to the stringent law of freedom in  the Indian judicial system. "But we are doing and there is no  question of going back on the fundamental freedom of the human  rights of individual citizens."    Mr Rao ruled out India accepting any "regional" arrangement  for nuclear non-proliferation and called for a global and  non-discriminatory regime against proliferation.    "Proliferation could not be stopped nor clandestine activity  prevented without a global and non-discriminatory regime," Mr  Rao told Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, during their  30-minute meeting here on the third day of the Prime Minister's  four-day official visit to the U.K. yesterday.    Aboard his aircraft, the Prime Minister said Britain's stand  on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir "is not very far from  ours."    On the British view on Kashmir, Mr Rao said that its  position  was not identical to India's "but on the whole it is not very  far from our stand."</p>

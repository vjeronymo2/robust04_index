			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / BA seeks Branson pledge of silence to end dispute BRITISH Airways is demanding that Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic Airways, sign a pledge banning him from ever making any public reference to BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign as part of a final settlement of their bitter dispute. Virgin, in turn, is understood to have asked for signed commitments from BA not to indulge in any further anti-competitive practices. According to sources close to both sides, the two airlines are refusing, so far, to yield on these issues but are understood to have agreed in principle on a Pounds 9m cash compensation offer to Virgin by BA on Monday to settle the dispute. As the two sides remained locked in tense negotiations, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of BA, and Mr Robert Ayling, the airline's managing director, last night came under pressure from some MPs at a private meeting of the House of Commons all-party Aviation Group. Labour MPs alleged that BA's activities against Virgin had damaged the reputation of UK civil aviation and demanded assurances that the airline would never repeat such behaviour. Mr Ayling renewed BA's assurances that the 'dirty tricks' involved a small number of incidents and employees. Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, dismissed the explanation as 'implausible'. Pressed by MPs, Sir Colin said any BA activities against Virgin 'had not been authorised by any director'. Asked about reports that BA was still conducting covert operations against Virgin in the US, Mr Ayling said a full investigation into the latest allegations of passenger poaching was under way. Sources close to the talks said last night that, unless the outstanding issues were quickly resolved, the lengthy and difficult negotiations between the two airlines risked collapse. Virgin rejected BA's Pounds 9m offer on Tuesday after Mr Branson was asked to sign a pledge he would remain permanently silent on BA's campaign against his airline. Although both sides appear anxious to reach an agreement by the end of this week, Mr Branson has made it clear he does not intend to be legally bound never to mention again the events of the past seven years involving BA and his airline. Under BA's demands, Mr Branson would be required to consult Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, before making any statement concerning the relations between the two airlines. This is understood to be regarded by Virgin as unacceptable. The commitment would preclude Mr Branson from referring to the episode in, for instance, an autobiography without BA's approval. A Virgin official said last night that 'the lines are still open and negotiations are continuing' but refused to comment on the issues still threatening the talks. But the main stumbling block remains the demand for silence from BA which, unless resolved in the next 24 hours, could jeopardise a peace settlement. Mr Branson and Sir Colin first met to try to settle the dispute following Virgin's libel case victory in January. Although Virgin won Pounds 610,000 in libel damages from BA and a public apology, Mr Branson has repeatedly threatened to take further legal action against BA unless he secured satisfactory compensation for the commercial damages inflicted on his company by BA's undercover activities. The proposal to pay Pounds 9m to Mr Branson, including about Pounds 6m in settlement over a longstanding aircraft maintenance dispute, appears to have caused dissent among BA board members. Some directors are understood to have opposed any payment, while others insisted it should be presented as an act of goodwill rather than as an admission of wrongdoing.</p>

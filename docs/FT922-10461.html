			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (3): Mindboggling prospects - The Power Market POWER plant suppliers are not the kind of people to get carried away by excessive euphoria over business prospects, but there is little doubting their enthusiasm over the outlook for power generating equipment orders in Asia. Against a backdrop of growth in populations and economies - an important combination for spurring power demand - and rather less exciting forecasts for growth in many western markets, the additional capacity requirements forecast for the region in the 1990s look almost mindboggling. Suppliers' and official forecasts vary according to their assessment of the outlook for different technologies and their own position in individual countries. But few quibble with the assessment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that a further 300,000MW will be required this decade. This comes on top of installed capacity of about 500,000MW. Siemens, the German power plant supplier, expects the Asian market, excluding India, to require 31,000MW of additional capacity each year this decade, or 37 per cent of expected world demand. Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish supplier, contrasts the forecast growth in the Asian market of 5-10 per cent a year with expansion of between plus and minus 2 per cent in the western hemisphere. The cost of this investment in power plant capacity is estimated by the ADB at Dollars 500bn, and suppliers recognise this will place immense strain on countries in the region. That explains why utility privatisation and alternative means of financing such as build-own-transfer (BOT) and build-own-operate (BOO) are being actively developed in the face of some obstacles. Despite that, there is considerable confidence among suppliers that much of what is required will get built, even if some countries' power station building programmes have to be taken with a mild pinch of salt. Suppliers keen to help build Asia's future are acutely aware, too, that the market is changing. Apart from privatisation of utilities, economic growth in south-east Asia is taking countries out of the aid financing category, encouraging more suppliers to bid for contracts and thus enhancing competition. Old ties that have their origin in colonial days are gradually being loosened, introducing greater fairness - although the size of power station projects will never remove realpolitik from the bidding process. Change is also occurring in the type of equipment ordered by suppliers. Asian governments, admittedly somewhat behind their western counterparts, are waking up to environmental pressures, prompting a wave of orders for combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants. These are also quicker to build and will thus appeal to privatised utilities. But the prospects are also good for suppliers of large coal-fired plants. 'Coal and combined-cycle, they all play in south-east Asia,' says Mr Don Kusza, appointed in February to head the Asian activities of General Electric Industrial and Power Systems. Encouragingly, many of the planned coal-fired projects in the region include flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to reduce emissions. The World Bank, which is active in many of the region's projects, ties its participation in financing large coal-fired projects to the inclusion of such equipment. With coal-fired orders drying up in much of the western world, this is one further reason why the big equipment suppliers give Asia such a high priority. Nuclear power, too, remains on the agenda in some Asian countries. In Taiwan, Taipower has three plants with two units each, and is considering two more units, while Korea also has an active nuclear programme. Mr Nick Salmon, deputy managing director of GEC Alsthom's power plants division, says the prospects for the region can be summarised in two words: growth and change. Along with these external trends, however, is an important factor that is particularly relevant to power plant suppliers: an imbalance of about five to one between Asia's needs for power generating equipment and its own capacity to manufacture it. Consequently, for the foreseeable future, it is inevitable that the western and Japanese suppliers will take a large share of the market, even if they often can only win contracts through developing partnerships with local equipment suppliers that will gradually reduce the manufacturing imbalance. Historically, the Japanese suppliers Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba and Hitachi, and GE of the US have supplied more than half of Asia's power capacity, followed closely by India's Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) and Anglo-French GEC Alsthom. The two other European suppliers, Siemens and ABB, are less entrenched historically but fighting hard to catch up. In individual Asian countries, the market shares of foreign and domestic suppliers vary widely. In China, GEC Alsthom is comfortably the largest foreign supplier, due to the big efforts made in the past by both GEC and Alsthom in establishing high-level contacts. Siemens, in contrast, has won very little business in China but is now preparing a strategy to penetrate the market. Across Asia, suppliers are making similar decisions, whether in pursuit of a single contract or for securing a better permanent market presence. Judgments on subcontracting the civil work or component supply, forging technology transfer links with local plant suppliers and forming consortiums to build power stations, vary widely from one market to another. In Indonesia, for example, there is capacity to produce heavy components locally which does not exist to nearly the same extent in Hong Kong where manufacturing is inclined more towards lighter components. On the other hand, excessive local content could jeopardise a western supplier's ability to secure financing from its own country. Consequently, in a region whose immense needs for additional power capacity inevitably produce a strong flow of large projects costing more than Dollars 1bn, co-operation between equipment suppliers and civil engineering companies from different nations is becoming necessary to maximise financing opportunities. Such international co-operation is set to continue, while more novel project financing methods will also become more prevalent. So far, BOT or BOO schemes have failed to make much impact, partly because many countries lack the legal framework or because of difficulties with repatriating revenues, but their attraction for countries with heavy spending commitments outside power is clear - so long as they can find investors.</p>

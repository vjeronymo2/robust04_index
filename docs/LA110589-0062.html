			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IGNORANT AND INEFFICIENT  </P> <P> Peter S. Greenberg's article ("It's Time for Business to Get Back to the  Basics," Oct. 15) about the lack of service for the traveler is right on  target. However, it reminds me that during 15 years of almost weekly travel in  the United States, and a total of nearly 30 months' travel throughout Europe  over several years, it is amazing how many stupid, ignorant, inefficient and  rude people I have met when I was in a bad mood.  </P> <P> JAMES T.

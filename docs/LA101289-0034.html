			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS PALMDALE ANNEXATION;  </P> <P> LANCASTER LOSES LATEST BATTLE IN OLD RIVALRY OVER LAND  </P> <P> The city of Lancaster failed in its attempt Wednesday to prevent 40 acres of  the unincorporated Quartz Hill area from being annexed by neighboring Palmdale  in a flare-up of the local turf war.  </P> <P> By a 7-0 vote, the county's Local Agency Formation Commission reaffirmed its  original Aug. 23 decision to give the undeveloped area to Palmdale. In  rejecting an appeal filed by Lancaster, the panel sided with landowners in the  affected area, who want to build housing tracts.  </P> <P> The two cities have a history of land feuds. In June, 1988, they reached a  settlement of sorts that specified the spheres of influence of each city and  marked the outlying areas that each could consider annexing. The Quartz Hill  dispute was the first of its kind since the settlement.  </P> <P> The 40-acre parcel at the northeast corner of Avenue N and 55th Street West was  within Lancaster's sphere of influence. But the county commission, which had  approved last year's agreement, changed that by giving the land to Palmdale --  a move that rankled Lancaster officials.  </P> <P> Lancaster Councilman George Theophanis accused the county panel of violating  the spirit of the 1988 accord, which he said was supposed to allow the two  cities to resolve such disputes themselves. He also blamed Palmdale officials  for not cooperating sufficiently with Lancaster.  </P> <P> Palmdale officials responded that they remained neutral in the dispute, even  saying they had no objection to Lancaster's desire to preserve its sway over  the area. But Palmdale granted the property owners prezoning for their land,  allowing up to three houses per acre.  </P> <P> A commission spokeswoman, Michi Takahashi, defended LAFCO's decision. She said  the panel thought there were "overriding considerations," mainly that the  property already is bounded on three sides by Palmdale and that the closest  part of Lancaster is nearly a mile to the east.  </P> <P> Commission staff members also had promised worried Lancaster officials that the  case would not set a precedent to remove other land from the city's sphere of  influence. A commission report noted there is "no similarly located parcel"  between the two fast-growing cities.  </P> <P> The decision was good news for the owners of the three parcels, although they  probably could have developed their land in either city. Two owners now hope to  build a total of 59 homes on 20 acres. The owners of the remaining 20 acres  have no development plans, their representative said.  </P> <P> Kevin Maevers of JK Civil Engineering in Palmdale, who initiated the annexation  request on behalf of the owners, said they preferred Palmdale only because  Lancaster officials earlier had told them that the location of their land made  annexation by Lancaster unlikely.  </P></p>

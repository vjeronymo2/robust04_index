			<p>BFN     [Text] Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski has said that,  if the government presents in the coming days a timetable for  meeting the union's demands, Solidarity will suspend the strike  action scheduled for 4, 5, and 6 May.    In his remarks for "Signals of the Day," Krzaklewski  stressed, however, that the action would be suspended and not  called off. It will eventually be called off when the  government begins to implement agreements jointly reached with  Solidarity.    The Solidarity leader again accused the government of  causing  the strikes by not meeting earlier promises as well as of  intentional dragging out the negotiations with the strikers.</p>

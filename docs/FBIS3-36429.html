			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a meeting presently under way today in Chisinau,  President Mircea Snegur expressed his opinion about relations  with Romania by calling for prudence and wisdom, and  preservation of origins in this era of building brotherly  relations on the two banks of the Prut River.    The following report by Anca Florea details this idea of the  president of the Republic of Moldova.    [Begin Anca Florea recording] As reported, the congress Our  Home, the Republic of Moldova is being held in Chisinau today.  It has been organized by the Civic Alliance and the Government  of the Republic of Moldova. This congress is being attended by  almost 2,000 people from various social segments and, as the  deputy Prime Minister Mihai Coscodar specified, guests from  Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Greece, Switzerland, and others.    The congress was opened by writer Ion Druta, after which the  floor was taken by the president of the Republic of Moldova,  Mircea Snegur. In a lengthy speech, the president began by  responding to those who, as he put it, want to eliminate such  notions as Moldova, the Moldovan language: Moldovan, and the  Moldovan people from the political vocabulary.    President Snegur also referred to the Dniester problem and  to  relations between the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Here is  a passage from President Snegur's speech:    He expressed his position, quote: Regarding a problem which,  I can assure you, concerns all of us, unquote. And then he  continued, quote: I am speaking of relations with our brethren  in Romania. The first thing I want to mention is the fact that  our blood brothers are living beyond the Prut and we industrious  Moldovan people must first develop our relations with them. At  the same time, it is my first duty and great honor to tell our  blood brothers the following: Brothers, with consideration and  respect, esteem and fraternal love, we want to express heartfelt  thanks and deep gratitude for the support and assistance you  have granted and continue to grant us during these trying times.    May the Lord help us to jointly survive in this troubled  world. At a time when the danger of wars is hovering above us --  from one or another direction -- we have this fraternal request  to jointly step forth with honesty and courage, careful  consideration and caution, wisdom and moderation, dignity and  mutual respect, which have to be our guides now, when we are  building our fraternal relations.    The historic recollection of sacrifices and losses does not  permit us to miss this opportunity to be free. Let us lend our  ear to the wise voice of the people and to their desires, which  are never wrong.    The Moldovan people no longer want to [words indistinct] and  do not want to hear that their country is coveted as a rich land  as if it did not have genuine owners, the successors of our  ancestors. Our people want good understanding with our brothers  as befits nations, unquote.    And now I will continue with another passage of President  Snegur's speech:    Let us preserve our origins, not in a bashful but in a  dignified way, by not wasting anything that characterizes us as  Moldovan. Our people want us to prosper and flourish as equal  nations in this world, unquote. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco estimates Soviet nickel exports in 1991 INCO, THE Canadian group, estimates that the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) exported about 245m lb of nickel to the western world last year, up from 175m lb in 1991. However, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman designate, suggests that Russia's ability to export will be reduced this year because its nickel output will slip from an estimated 660m lb in 1991, Reuter reports from Toronto. Mr Sopko says that he expects the western world market balance to remain more or less unchanged from the 1991 situation, when demand was about 1.52m lb and supply 1.56m lb. 'We're producing all we can, selling all we can produce. The only problem is lousy prices.' He sees no need for more production cuts by Inco but the group is reducing capital spending by 40 per cent to CDollars 280m (Pounds 135m) this year from earlier estimates of Dollars 350m and Dollars 440m spent in 1991. Among other things, Inco intends to defer development of its McCreedy East nickel mine in Ontario.</p>

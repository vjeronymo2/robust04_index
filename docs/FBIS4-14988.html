			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 6 April EESTI SENUMID, p. 3 ; "News Bulletin" No. </F> 65/94]    [Text] Hain Rebas, former defence minister, held a lecture  in Tallinn yesterday on the influence of the military-industrial  complex on the Russian home and foreign policy.    Rebas announced that he had started to gather information on  the subject after resigning from the minister's post. The  conversion of the military industry in Russia has never been  more than a propaganda move, he claimed, adding that modern  weaponry is constantly being produced in addition to existing  stockpiles or armament. The military industry has suffered  relatively less from the industrial decline than the  non-military production, Rebas told the audience and added that  the development and production of biological and chemical  weapons is going on, despite high-level denials.    The ex-minister stressed the influence of the  military-industrial complex on the Russian politics, mentioning  the organisations joining the defence industry, their  representatives in the government circles and in the parliament.  Russia has given priority to the military industry and adopted  expansionist foreign policy, Rebas said. He warned that the  people in Russia are willing to adopt aggressive ideas and  stressed the need to explain the situation more efficiently in  the Western countries.</p>

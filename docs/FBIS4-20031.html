			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: "We Help </F> South Africa"]    [Text] For the first time in South Africa's history, all  citizens, no matter what the color of their skin is, will elect  a joint government this week. The horrible apartheid system  will finally be buried this April 1994.    Germany helped to prepare the elections. In these days, 100  German election observers are at the Cape. For years, we have  supported antiapartheid organizations -- with almost 500 million  German marks since 1975. At the same time, we always held a  critical dialogue with the South African Government. This  farsighted policy of the Federal Government is now bearing fruit.    In early September I will extend invitations to a conference  in Berlin for promotion of the economy in southern Africa.  Together with our partners in the European Union, we must and  will support South Africa now with a comprehensive relief  program in the difficult transition period.</p>

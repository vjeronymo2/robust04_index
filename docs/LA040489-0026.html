			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GILAD, KARASIK WITH SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY  </P> <P> In his seven years as its conductor, Yehuda Gilad has established the Santa  Monica Symphony as a first-rate community orchestra, an ensemble worthy of the  company of many of the Southland's fully professional orchestras. Thus his  decision to step down from the post must engender some regret.  </P> <P> In the Sunday evening concert at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Gilad's fine  sense of drama helped insure dynamic, propulsive music-making; his clear  economical beat assured a tight, unified ensemble. Opening with a transparent,  flowing account of Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll," the conductor evoked telling  contrasts and maintained mostly consistent balances, the latter no easy task in  the hangar-like auditorium.  </P> <P> In Sibelius' First Symphony, however, those balances frequently went askew; at  one point in the Finale, for instance, the strings virtually obliterated an  important trumpet passage. The string choir tended to be bottom-heavy -- not  surprisingly, since first violin and cello sections were about equal in  numbers.  </P> <P> Still, there was much to admire in this reading: the superb solos (clarinetist  Emily Bernstein's opening solo is just one example), the brass section's heroic  sound and Gilad's attention to detail. One would have welcomed, however, a bit  more flexibility of tempo, particularly in the Andante.  </P> <P> Between the orchestra works, pianist Gita Karasik delivered an assured, elegant  reading of Mozart's Concerto in C, K. 467 (the D-minor concerto had originally  been scheduled).  </P> <P> The Los Angeles native eschewed flashiness and instead opted for a thoughtful,  controlled reading marked by refinement, nuance and subtlety. Gilad's orchestra  provided sensitive and rhythmically secure support. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

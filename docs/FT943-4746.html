			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rec buy-backs gather momentum The rush by regional electricity companies to buy back their own shares before dealing restrictions take effect at the end of the month gathered pace yesterday with purchases by South Wales Electric and South Western Electricity. South Wales bought 500,000 shares, representing 0.5 per cent of its equity, for Pounds 4.1m at a price of 815p per share. The company is widely expected to follow this first purchase with further buying before the closed period takes effect at the end of the month. South Western Electricity bought 750,000 shares at 805p, bringing the total acquired in the last week to 4.25m shares, or 3.4 per cent of the share capital. The recs have the power to buy back up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital. This would enhance both earnings and the potential to increase dividends. 'If people are paying anything more than lip service to improving shareholders' value, they ought to buy back the maximum allowable,' said one industry source. However, their opportunities are limited by restrictions on buying in advance of results or prior to any announcement on the future of the National Grid, in which they are shareholders. Shares in South Wales jumped 21p to 815p after the announcement. South Western shares fell by 7p to 803p.</p>

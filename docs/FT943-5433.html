			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can we do better than 2% interest? I live on a private road, the common parts of which are owned by a limited company in which all the freeholders are also shareholders. The company has reserves of about Pounds 35,000 in an account earning 2 per cent. What is the best kind of investment account in which to keep this money? Because of the relatively small amount of money involved, it is difficult to see how you are going to get significantly better rates with a bank deposit. If the company employs an accountant or solicitor to prepare annual accounts, it might be worth seeing if this amount of money could be bulked with other sums on client account to achieve a better rate of interest than the present one.

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SHAW AGREES TO PLAY FOR CELTICS  </P> <P> Guard Brian Shaw said today he will return to play for the Boston Celtics this  season.  </P> <P> Shaw played last season for Il Messaggero in the Italian league.  </P> <P> He later signed a contract to rejoin the Celtics, for whom he played during the  1988-89 season. A Celtics' first-round draft pick in 1988, Shaw had one year  left on his Italian contract, but had an option to get out.  </P> <P> But after signing with the Celtics, he said he wouldn't play for them this  season.  </P> <P> The Celtics took their case to federal court, where a judge ruled that Shaw  could play only for the Celtics.  </P> <P> "I have always wanted to rejoin the Celtics, but after the upcoming season,"  Shaw said at a press conference today.  </P> <P> "I felt it was in my best interest to play in Italy this season, then finish  the rest of my career with the Celtics. The federal court has ruled that this  option is not available to me so I didn't want to jeopardize my future in  Boston."  </P></p>

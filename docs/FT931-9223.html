			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Noranda turns round to profit of CDollars 79m NORANDA, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, shook off lower commodity prices to return to profitability last year. Net earnings were CDollars 79m, (USDollars 62.2) or 10 cents a share, compared to a CDollars 133m loss, equal to CDollars 1.04 a share, in 1991. Revenues rose to CDollars 8.64bn from CDollars 8.46bn. The fourth quarter saw a meagre profit of CDollars 4m, compared to a CDollars 109m loss a year earlier. Noranda buttressed its balance sheet last week by selling a controlling interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group for CDollars 971m. Proceeds from the sale will be received in three almost-equal instalments over the next two years. Noranda predicted that favourable currency and interest rates should produce some improvement in earnings and cash flows this year. But it painted a sombre picture of prospects in its main markets, noting that a pick-up in demand for some its products has been more than matched by supplies from eastern Europe. The improved 1992 financial performance was largely due to a 16 per cent drop in interest charges, the impact of a lower Canadian dollar on export earnings and cost reductions.</p>

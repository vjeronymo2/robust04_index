			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Abbott leaves Redland for Bowater Kevin Abbott is leaving building products group Redland after six years as a main board director to take up a post at Bowater, the paper and packaging company. Abbott, 40, has been with Redland for 16 years, having joined its corporate planning team from Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank. He was promoted to finance director of Redland's Roof Tiles division in 1982, eventually rising to become global roofing director and to the main board six years later. After a reshuffle at the start of the year, he took over responsibility for non-European building products and the UK roof tiles business. Abbott said yesterday: 'Having grown up in one company, I thought it was about time for a new challenge.' At Bowater he will be reunited with his former Redland managing director David Lyon, who beat a similar path in 1987. 'I am looking forward to working again with David; he is someone for whom I have a lot of respect.' At Bowater, Abbott will become executive director responsible for worldwide Health and Beauty and European packaging. He fills the spot left vacant by Stuart Wallace, who left to join Fisons at the end of August.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Paris? Been there, done that: Why London leaves the French capital for dead UNSEASONABLY chill winds and lashings of rain have not shown London at its best in the past couple of weeks. Even so, it was irksome to hear a friend apologising to a visitor from Paris the other day for the existence of a city so thoroughly depressing. Why do the British indulge in this perpetual self-flagellation when comparing their own capital with that of France? William Davis, chairman of the British Tourist Authority, was at it this week, complaining in his annual report of a litter-strewn, tired and tarnished city. Yet just to mention the word Paris is to trigger eulogies in praise of a supposed earthly paradise. Guide books, of course, must bear part of the blame. No guide book would ever open with the words: 'To be honest, Paris is a bit of a dump, and if I were you I wouldn't bother going there.' If it did, nobody would buy it. Instead, the book will say Paris is the world's most wondrous city, and no one who has spent a lot of time and money visiting the place is going to come back and say the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. And yet, so much nonsense is talked about Paris. Take its legendary beauty. True, Paris has a pretty cathedral, a big arch and an amusing metal tower: but by comparison with London, it is a visual snore. Most of the interesting bits were demolished during the Second Empire by Baron Haussmann, a monomaniacal town planning despot who criss-crossed the city with mile after mile of dreary, soul-less boulevards lined with uniform, grey stone facades. The result is a kind of 19th century Milton Keynes. One of the side-effects of Haussmann's demolition campaign was a displacement of the prosperous classes to new quarters on the city's western boundaries, leaving the central areas to the poor. Properties were divided into ever smaller units as landlords sought to maximise rentals, resulting in the rabbit-hutch style accommodation which so many Parisians now endure. If only they had gardens, as so many Londoners do, things might not be so bad. Or if only Haussmann had thought to give Paris the equivalent of London's glorious parks. As it is, having neither, Parisians seek to lighten the gloom of their existence through their obsessional ownership of preposterous toy dogs. These, lacking alternative facilities, leave an estimated 20 tonnes of dejections on the city's pavements each day. Of course, one of the delights of Paris is its compact size. It is tiny compared with London. Given a good pair of wellington boots and a poor sense of smell, it is possible to walk around the city in a day. But just what is there left to do then? Eating is one possibility. Only a moron, after all, would deny that French cuisine is among the world's finest. Paris, however, is not the place to savour it: the memory of a good meal is more likely to endure for the outrageous price charged than for the quality of the food. As for good wine, search in vain: all the decent stuff goes to Oddbins and Tesco. After an indifferent meal, it is time for entertainment. Unfortunately, unless you are a cineaste, you are as likely to find it in Kidderminster as Paris. London is leagues ahead in virtually all forms of entertainment, be it drama, classical and contemporary music, dance, opera, fringe theatre, comedy, popular music or the club scene. Other than cinema, the only field in which Paris can claim ascendancy is in cabarets featuring topless dancing girls (most of them English) waving prodigious amounts of feathers. Indeed, it is hard to imagine what Parisians do in the evening. They cannot stay in and watch television: it is too unspeakably awful. Their apartments are too small for entertaining. There are no pubs. Usually, one surmises, they end up going to see yet another crackly print of an old Jean Luc Godard film, then spend the next few hours discussing it in some down-at-heel cafe over a glass of warm lager and 40 Gauloises. In fairness, Paris does not come out of every comparison badly. It has a lot more art galleries than London. Its young people do not get drunk and roam the streets shouting obscenities. The Metro may be filthy, but it works. Parisians speak much better French than Londoners. For sheer exuberance, variety and vitality, however, London puts Paris in the shade. Its only real problem is that Parisians know it, with the result that the city is overflowing with Parisian tourists. Perhaps there is a case for doing the place down after all.</p>

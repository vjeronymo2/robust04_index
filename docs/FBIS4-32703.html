			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister for </F> industry, trade, and tourism, by Francoise Delstanche in  Brussels; date not given: "Prague Does Not Deliberately Delay  Reforms"]    [Text] Privatizations are progressing at a very rapid  rate in the Czech Republic, but the restructuring of the  enterprises is lagging behind. Although growth seems to have  revived, unemployment is not yet a thing of the past.    Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister for industry, trade,  and tourism, was recently in Brussels to meet with Leon Brittan  [European commissioner for external and economic affairs] and  Henning Christophersen [European commissioner for economic and  financial affairs]. On this occasion, we questioned him on the  progress of the reforms in his country. Indeed, the Czech  Republic is among the countries most convinced that it is  necessary to carry out the changes rapidly, and it can probably  afford to do so in view of the healthy state of its major  macroeconomic parameters. The state budget is showing a  surplus, and the foreign debt is low, and it seems possible to  keep inflation between 6 and 7 percent this year.    And yet, despite the neoliberal convictions of Vaclav  Klaus, its prime minister, the Czech Republic sometimes proceeds  with greater caution than you might think.    [Delstanche] The Czech Republic is the one that first  launched a mass privatization program, especially with a view to  speeding up the process. Are you satisfied with how it is  running? And what is the present position?    [Dlouhy] Technically speaking, privatization is going well.  The second phase of the privatization program by coupons should  be completed by the end of the year. At that time, the public  sector should no longer own more than 15-18 percent of the  companies. And we include in this figure the health sector and  the strategic holdings sector. We will probably therefore reach  a paradoxical situation because state participation will  probably be much less important than in many European Union  countries.    [Delstanche] Are there not some problems with investment  funds, which are being gradually taken over by the banks?    [Dlouhy] That is not exactly the case. It is true that the  banks have created a number of investment funds and that these  represent approximately 20 percent of the total. But this is  not the result of the redemption of funds by the banks. Having  said that, it is true that these funds created by the banks are  among the strongest and biggest and that they have played a  major part in the privatization process. They have sometimes  also carried out debt equity swaps and other operations that  reflect the financial problems of companies that are part of the  mass sales program. But why should we consider that the  participation of banks in the ownership of these funds is a  problem? I do not think this reflects a problem in the  privatization process. Obviously, it would be different if the  banks held 80 or 90 percent of the funds.    [Delstanche] Is there not a risk of witnessing too strong a  concentration of these funds, when they are required to deal  with financial problems?    [Dlouhy] That is true up to a point. But it is clear that  some funds will fail. That is logical because we have inherited  a very inefficient economic system, and this is the law of the  market. It is therefore possible to expect a great  concentration of property, especially among these funds linked  to the banks.    But I have no fears that this concentration will become  excessive. And we are also trying to develop, at the same time,  a strong policy of competition, which should ensure the  maintenance of a competitive environment, even with a greater  concentration. Moreover, this is a question that should be  linked to commercial policy and the opening of the internal  market to foreign competition and so forth.    [Delstanche] In this connection, the OECD detected your  country's violations of the rules of competition by granting  favorable treatment in the case of Volkswagen's takeover of  Skoda.    [Dlouhy] It is true that Volkswagen received special  conditions but not very much if they are compared with the  treatment offered by Spain and Portugal to foreign investors.  That is also an exception to the rule. We are well known and  sometimes even criticized by the international investment  institutions or the internal opposition because we do not offer  special treatment to foreign investors. We prefer to offer  everybody the same conditions.    We went against our principles in the case of Volkswagen  because the automobile industry is very important for the Czech  Republic. Not only per se, but also because it is the driving  force for many other companies like textiles, the chemical  industry, machine manufacturers.    [Delstanche] You have a law on bankruptcy, but it has  clearly  not been forcefully implemented so far. Is this not a  contradiction, when your country has chosen to carry out rapid  reforms?    [Dlouhy] It is not a contradiction. Our law is good. So  far, it is true, there have not been many bankruptcies, but this  is not because of the legislation. It is the result of the fact  that the privatization process has not yet been completed and  that the new owners are not making the restructuring very  rapidly. This is also the result of internal insolvency, which  creates a kind of vicious circle in which everybody is indebted  toward somebody else, which prevents any flow of payment.  Moreover, we cannot deny that it is also the result of the fact  that you mentioned--namely, that some investment funds are  partly owned by the banks. These institutions that hold shares  in companies in difficulty do not want to push them into  bankruptcy but are trying to carry out their financial  restructuring.    [Delstanche] But does this not also correspond to a desire  by  the government to delay the explosion of unemployment?    [Dlouhy] I can assure you that it is not a problem resulting  from a deliberate policy. We have always been cautious with  bankruptcies, but we have never stated that we were going to  tackle this problem in a gradual way. This is the result of the  privatization strategy. Obviously, for the time being, we are  gaining major political advantages from it because the  unemployment rate is very low. It is now 3.14 percent, whereas  the economic growth rate has reached 3.5 percent in the first  five months of the year. However, it is true that we are going  to face this unemployment problem in the future, but it will  essentially be a problem at the level of certain regions.</p>

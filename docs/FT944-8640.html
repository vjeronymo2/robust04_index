			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (1): Now the real work must begin - Following its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, the fledgling Baltic state of Latvia stands a good chance of flourishing Latvia is the middle of three strongly contrasting Baltic states. Like the other two - Estonia and Lithuania - it was trapped after the war, until 1991, in the Soviet Union: it can now reasonably believe that this will have been its last imperial cage. Occupying a middle position in geography, between Lithuania to the south west and Estonia to the north east, it also lies between the other two in population (2.6m people to Estonia's 1.6m and Lithuania's 3.7m) - and, so far, has been in the middle, too, in its efforts to reform its economy: leading the more conservative Lithuania, but not yet showing the growth and investment achievements of Lithuania. Yet, so much has been done. The visitor to Riga, the 'Paris of the Baltic,' now emerging from its Soviet dinginess again to deserve that name, sees a city of newly-opened shops, cafes and galleries, matching Budapest or Prague. The signs of suddenly acquired wealth are evident, as are those of construction and reconstruction. After the nervousness of the first years of independence - its statehood was declared in August 1991 - a social consensus appears to be holding and strengthening. Governments have come and gone, but each re-iterates its adhesion to democratic norms, to market principles and to European integration, without serious challenge to any of these. The threat that the large Russian-speaking population - some 40 per cent of the whole - would remain disaffected, mutinous and unable to integrate has substantially lessened as the attraction of Latvia over Russia has grown more evident, as a citizenship law is passed permitting gradual integration, and as the hostility of the just-before and just-after independence years gives way to an acceptance of each other under a re-arrangement of political power. Growing wealth will aid that. The Soviet past recedes. Few, even in the late 1980s at the beginning of the struggle for independence - at first thinly disguised as support for a radical version of the then Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika policy - believed that Latvia could again secure the independent status it retained shakily between the two world wars. Now the memory of the achievement of independence fades enough to permit grumbling that the new life is harder than the old - a grumbling which will not, however translate itself into serious opposition to the government's course. There are parties of the left, and the equal rights movement lays an accent on the present effective exclusion of most of the Russian speakers from full voting and many civil rights, because they have not attained citizenship. But in broad terms, ethnicity has receded from political life, not strengthened within it. Few now believe that, having achieved independence, it is in constant question. The issue is rather the need to ingrain that independence into every facet of government policy and national life. The geopolitical environment in which Latvia finds itself is one where that goal is seen as being most likely to be achieved through three parallel movements: towards acceptance by the European Union; towards a competent, democratic and secure statehood; and towards a well-functioning market system. In what remains of the century  -given peace and stability - its governing class believes it can gain much of that. The difficulties have ceased to be of the kind which might threaten the fledgling state, though they remain as testing for the new political elite as they are trying for the patience of the population. Latvia is better placed than almost any other former Soviet state to use its independence to create the foundation for democratic and market development but its first governments hesitated, then introduced inadequate and hastily drafted economic legislation, feared internal and external backlash and opened up the country (probably inevitably) to a wave of crime and corruption which, though not of the intensity and threat of that in Russia, is nevertheless alarming in its scope. A new beginning is now being attempted - but parliamentary elections are being held within the year and even Mr Maris Gailis, the Prime Minister talks of a period of consolidation, not of radical reform. The political parties reflect the interests and views of a largely urban intellectual and technical stratum who see the pro-market reforms and conformity with European norms as their best hope. However, the political parties have few members and none can govern on its own. Latvian Way remains the largest grouping - but its need to change coalition partners when the Farmers' Union deserted the coalition in mid-summer left the country without effective government for two months and now means that all policies have an electoral edge to them. The Latvian Way coalition is centrist and moderately nationalist but the more overtly nationalist parties to its right have recently taken control of Riga city - where more than one third of the country's population lives - probably reflecting more a dissatisfaction with lowered living standards than a desire for a harder nationalist stance. It represents a warning to the government, nonetheless. Latvia's agriculture, an important part of its production, employment and exports, has suffered in the short term from privatisation. The state and the collective farms were often inefficient - but they were embedded in a functioning system of supply and distribution which has not yet been remodelled. That experience has damaged the concept of privatisation as a whole, though a more potent cause has been the decision to allow ministries to privatise the companies for which they were responsible at their own speed - a strategy which meant that many did nothing, others allowed corrupt practices to flourish and others still were privatised by financial and other interests widely believed to be penetrated by, or to be front organisations for, organised crime. Nevertheless, many companies with apparently good prospects - the Laima chocolate company and the wood products and furnishing company, Latvijas Finieris are oft-cited but still impressive examples - did privatise themselves with existing management taking over the reins of power and grappling with the rocky conditions of post-independence Latvia as best they could. The outstanding success of the past two years has been the introduction of a currency - the Lat - as stable as any in Europe. Latvia stayed with the rouble immediately after independence, then moved to a Latvian rouble in 1992 and introduced the Lat last year, pegged to the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights. Under Mr Repse, a non-economist appointed by the parliament for a six-yearterm as governor, the Central Bank was turned into an institution as independent as that under Mr Siim Kallas in Estonia - though without the taint of scandal which deprived Mr Kallas of the premiership of his country in succession to Mr Mart Laar. However, the strong Lat has resulted in exports becoming high-priced and this has forced manufacturers to pay more attention to securing improvements in productivity and quality, but at a cost. The rash of small banks which appeared in 1990-1992 has given the country the edge in the Baltics in banking and financial services - the Baltic Switzerland is one metaphor often employed, if sardonically. Many of these banks, however, have acquired the reputation of being a conduit for flight capital from Russia, and the trade they finance is often illegal, at least at the Russian border. Business in the former USSR is a rough game, and Latvia is far from the worst. Its banks provide income and employment but they also deter, because of their reputation, the serious foreign investor fearful of becoming mixed up in illegalities of which he knows nothing. These are central issues for the state which it can neither ignore nor finesse. As it celebrates the national independence it announced on this day 74 years ago, Latvia can be more certain than for decades - perhaps at any time in its past - that its independence is well founded. The country will grow, and it has a high chance of flourishing. But for that, as its leaders increasingly recognise, the real work must start now.</p>

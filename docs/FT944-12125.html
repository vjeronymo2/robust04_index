			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Swedish fiscal package targets debt Sweden's Social Democratic government yesterday promised new measures to stabilise the country's fast-growing debt, saying the moves would reduce the country's budget deficit and bring down interest rates. In a fiscal package announced yesterday, the government included SKr31.6bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in tax increases and SKr25.5bn in spending cuts, SKr6bn more than the SKr51bn 'budget strengthening' total outlined by the party in the run-up to the September election which brought it to power. A further SKr20bn of unspecified new measures, mainly spending cuts, will be presented in Sweden's January budget. Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister, said the proposals should be sufficient to enable Sweden to stabilise central government debt by 1998 or even earlier. But the markets took a more sceptical view and some commentators suggested further savings would be needed. Bond yields rose a few basis points. The package was denounced by Mr Carl Bildt, leader of the opposition Moderate party, who called it 'the biggest tax increase in Swedish modern history' and a return to the 'failed' Social Democratic policies of the past. The Federation of Swedish Industries regretted the emphasis on tax increases and the delay in implementing badly needed savings. The size of Sweden's budget deficit, projected at 13 per cent of gross domestic product in the current financial year, and the growth in state debt are the main symptoms of the country's financial crisis. The difficulties have led Moody's, the US rating agency, to consider downgrading Sweden's debt rating. The minority Social Democratic government hopes to get the SKr57.1bn package through parliament with the support of the former communist Left party. The government forecast GDP growth of 2.5 per cent in 1994, rising to 3.4 per cent next year. This is a more optimistic view of the outlook than most independent commentators have taken. Inflation is forecast at 3.0 per cent next year while unemployment, excluding those on training schemes, is expected to fall to 6.9 per cent from 8.0 per cent in 1994. Mr Lars Heikensten, chief economist at Svenska Handelsbanken, said the government could not have risked more drastic measures yesterday in the run-up to Sweden's referendum on EU membership on November 13. But he believed the government was 'taking a risk' by not proposing tougher measures in January. Mr Persson urged Swedes to vote Yes to EU membership, warning that the economic costs of staying outside were greater than those of joining. Membership would cost Sweden around SKr20bn a year, but he said this would largely be funded by the groups which would most benefit from membership.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Banesto rescue plan agreed Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Banco Santander have emerged as the contenders to control Banesto, the Spanish banking group in which the authorities imposed a new management last month, according to a rescue plan agreed by the Bank of Spain and the private banking sector. The plan will provisionally make the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), which is financed the Spanish banks, into Banesto's chief shareholder by underwriting a Pta180bn (Pounds 861m) capital increase for the troubled bank. Before the end of the year, the FGD will publicly auction its Banesto equity and the share offer will be constructed to allow a domestic institution to become Banesto's dominant shareholder. BBV and Santander are singled out by analysts as the only possible strategic buyers of Banesto stock among the domestic institutions. Neither bank has officially declared an interest but both are understood to have spent the weekend assessing the rescue plan. Banesto is due to shrink dramatically in size prior to the FGD's capital increase. The bank will allocate all its Pta244bn reserves to provisions, raise an additional Pta49bn towards its financing requirement by reducing the par value of its individual shares from Pta700 to Pta400 and write down over time a further Pta27bn in provisions. In all, Banesto new management has undertaken to provide Pta320bn towards the finally agreed figure of Pta605bn needed to restore the bank's balance sheet. The private banks and the Bank of Spain will jointly, and on an equal basis, provide Pta285bn to finance the acquisition by the FDG of outstanding non-performing loans which Banesto is unable to provision. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, said: 'Banesto will be profitable before the end of the year and I hope there will not be any more frights.' Trading in Banesto shares, suspended last month, is due to resume in Madrid tomorrow.</p>

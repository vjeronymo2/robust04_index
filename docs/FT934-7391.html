			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis face pressure for oil production cut PRESSURE IS likely to grow on Saudi Arabia over the next few days to take the lead in cutting oil production in order to underpin weak prices, according to analysts. Saudi Arabian officials have refused to comment on their stance at next week's meeting in Vienna of oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, although one said 'price is an important key issue'. But he warned that any action undertaken by Opec next week would have to 'deliver', adding: 'Any action which will not deliver will not be followed.' In Tehran the Iranian news agency Irna reported that Opec ministers would have to consider a 3 to 5 per cent cut in the 24.52m-barrels a day production ceiling set in September. Mr Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Associates in Paris, predicted that Saudi participation in 'getting the volume down by about 300,000 barrels a day would have a very strong effect on the markets'. The Saudi official professed, however, to being 'baffled' by the market's softness, which has persisted in recent weeks after an initial boost following the September Opec accord. He suggested that higher North Sea output and the arrival on the market of Gulf crude pumped before the Opec meeting in Geneva at the end of September were among the factors contributing to the price weakness. 'At the time when Opec is making every effort to decrease our production, there has been a consistent increase by others,' said the official, pointing out that Norway's output has risen in recent weeks and that Oman, also outside Opec, last week announced record output levels of 800,000 b/d - a 50,000 b/d rise on last year's average. The Saudi official flatly denied that the kingdom's decision to hold output at 8m b/d under the September accord, while other states were permitted a slight rise in production, signalled a return to being the cartel's swing producer.</p>

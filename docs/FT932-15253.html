			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Westpac sells large part of US loan portfolio WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, yesterday announced the sale of a large part of its US loan portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank of Canada in a further step towards its planned withdrawal from large-scale international operations. Westpac said Toronto-Dominion would assume up to USDollars 5.5bn in credit commitments, representing approximately USDollars 3bn of risk-adjusted loans to more than 100 US corporations. The sale, which is at book value, follows Westpac's decision to reduce its corporate lending risk assets by ADollars 10bn (USDollars 7bn) over the next three years as part of a restructuring plan under which it will refocus on Australian business. Mr Robert Joss, managing director, said the sale of the loans was 'tangible evidence' that Westpac was achieving the goals set out in its recovery programme. Mr Joss said the deal would enable Westpac's Americas division to focus on corporate customers doing business in Australia and New Zealand, where Westpac is the second-biggest trading bank. Westpac has already scaled back its North American operations.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Russian pledge to fight spending pressure MR BORIS Fyodorov, Russia's new chief economic strategist, has pledged to resist pressure to spend money the state does not have. In an interview with the Financial Times, his first with a foreign news organisation since his appointment last week, Mr Fyodorov also said he wanted to build the market institutions that Russia lacks. He called for greater emphasis on 'technical' measures to smooth transition to a market economy than was the case under Mr Yegor Gaidar, dumped as prime minister two weeks ago. 'We are moving towards a market but we need much more professional analysis (of the economy) at micro-level,' said Mr Fyodorov, a 35-year-old economist, who is quitting his job as Russia's representative at the World Bank in Washington to become deputy prime minister. He will guide overall policy of the finance and economics ministries, the tax inspectorate and the country's pricing committee. Although his fight against inflation would involve 'minimising the dangers' of pressure for more money from state-owned enterprises, Mr Fyodorov said he would also try to mobilise extra sources of finance for the country. This would include fighting the flight of capital from Russia and issuing bonds to the population on terms more attractive than the combination of negative interest rates and high inflation now ravaging ordinary savings accounts. 'Even if you have a big budget deficit it should be financed in a civilised manner,' he said, criticising the inflationary central bank practice of printing money to complement budget revenues. Mr Fyodorov - who resigned as finance minister two years ago when an earlier government headed by Mr Boris Yeltsin failed to get economic reform under way - said it was too early to discuss the substance of the policies to be embraced by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister. But he seemed encouraged by what he had seen so far of Mr Chernomyrdin, former manager of the Soviet gas monopoly. He said Mr Chernomyrdin's manner could make relations easier with the parliament. 'Unlike Gaidar, he will not use foreign words or display intellectual sophistication, and that will make it easier for the parliament to understand him.' Mr Fyodorov said he also hoped to find common ground with Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has a big measure of control over monetary policy and sees no alternative to inflationary financing. 'He is a very reasonable man, but if we don't agree, we'll have to fight,' he said of his former boss - Mr Fyodorov worked at the Soviet central bank, before serving as Russian finance minister in 1990. He welcomed the presence of consultants from foreign banks, law firms and universities who advised Mr Gaidar. 'But if I work with advisers, I would like to stick to concrete measures rather than broad-based policy. I want very practical assistance.' Mr Fyodorov said the bank and the previous government had done 'nothing' to tackle the flight of capital. He wanted a carrot and stick approach to encourage enterprises to keep money in the country. To stabilise the rouble exchange rate he suggested widening the available currency market set up by the central bank - 'if necessary we will set up our own currency market'.

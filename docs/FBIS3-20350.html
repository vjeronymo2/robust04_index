			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Achille Occhetto, PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] Secretary has said that the "electorate's response is  clear" and that Silvio Berlusconi should be given the job of  forming the government. He added: "Let us see if he is up to  it."    The election results will be discussed at a meeting in the  secretariat tomorrow. Party leaders have laughed off  speculation that Occhetto may resign. Claudio Petruccioli said  it was "rubbish." Piero Fassino said, "It is not a problem.  The center-right has a majority, but the Progressive Alliance  was not routed."</p>

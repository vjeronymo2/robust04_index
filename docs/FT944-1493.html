			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: City thefts take the biscuit City law firms are facing a chocolate biscuit crisis. Pilfering by staff of biscuits destined for client meetings is forcing city firms to take drastic action. Simmons &amp; Simmons has saved between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 20,000 a year by forbidding staff, even heads of department, to eat chocolate biscuits during meetings with clients. At Clifford Chance, a member of staff was given a formal reprimand recently after issuing more than the permitted two chocolate biscuits per guest. Clyde &amp; Co initially switched from four-finger to two-finger Kit Kats, but has now gone further by offering only Cadbury's Snacks. Senior partner Michael Payton says the savings were 'considerable, mainly because we have been able to sack the half of the personnel department who were dealing with nothing but complaints about biscuits'. At DJ Freeman, biscuit costs have proved difficult to control because of a form of the small boys' custom of 'scrumping' in apple orchards, known as 'hoovering'. Staff loiter until conference rooms are empty, then dart in and fill their pockets. Senior partner David Solomon says it was hard to combat because 'suspects include lawyers at the most senior levels'. The crisis has led firms to incorporate biscuits in negotiating tactics. At Freshfields, Manchester Airport Enquiry meetings were speeded up by awarding a chocolate biscuit to whoever made a point on which all parties could agree. Procedures elsewhere in the country vary. In Yorkshire, the duty of hospitality is taken very seriously. At the Sheffield office of Oxley &amp; Coward, a heaped plate of Cadbury's Shapes is put on the table when meetings begin, and replenished when empty. This adds an extra dimension to the threat of competition from regional law firms.</p>

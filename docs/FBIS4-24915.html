			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By U.S.-based station reporters Lu Weichang (7120 0251 </F> 2490) and Wang Chunquan (3769 2504 0356); from the "National  News Hookup" program]    [Text] A ceremony was held at the World Bank headquarters  today for signing documents on World Bank loans totaling $880  million for four projects in China. Li Daoyu, Chinese  ambassador to the United States, and (?Kachi), World Bank vice  governor in charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs, signed  legal documents on the World Bank loans on behalf of China and  the World Bank respectively.    The four projects are the Huang He Valley's (?Xiaolangdi)  key  water conservancy project, the (?Xiaolangdi) resettlement  project, Shanghai's environmental protection program, and  Tianjin's industrial development project.    At the document signing ceremony, Ambassador Li Daoyu  pointed  out that smooth implementation of the four projects would be  conducive to promoting China's economic construction and that  China would continue to maintain and develop cooperation with  the World Bank. (?Kachi) said China has been properly  implementing projects financed by the World Bank and that the  signing of the four loan agreements signaled fresh results from  the World Bank's cooperation with China. He specifically  stressed: The (?Xiaolangdi) resettlement project is a model of  the World Bank's cooperation with China and has opened up a way  for other countries to build large water conservancy facilities  and properly handle the resettlement issue using World Bank  loans.    Wang Liansheng [3769 6647 3932; identified by caption],  China's resident executive director at the World Bank, told  reporters:    [Begin recording] In China, we use World Bank loans mainly  for agricultural water conservancy projects, communications,  energy, and environmental protection. We have carried out the  projects pretty well and won unanimously favorable comments from  the World Bank's (?Board of Executive Directors) by virtue of  the experiences and situation over the past few years. China  has now become the biggest recipient nation of World Bank loans.  [end recording]</p>

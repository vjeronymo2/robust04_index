The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as  saying in his New Year address:    "Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are the  imperishable,  glorious traditions of our revolution and our banner of victory."    It goes on:    Single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the most  durable and mighty one centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    The single-hearted unity is, first of all, the source of the  powerful strength which makes it possible to dynamically  advance the cause of socialism holding the illustrious leader  in high esteem with loyalty.    In our country today all the people are holding the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in high esteem with faith and sense  of obligation and vigorously advancing with the conviction of  victory and optimism that we will win certainly because he is  leading us.    The whole party, all the people and the entire Army move as  one under the unitary leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il and the revolutionary work system of unconditionally  implementing the idea and lines of the leader has been  established in the whole party and the whole of society.    Thanks to the unbreakable unity of the leader and the people  in one mind the socialism of our own style has inexhaustible  might to make a victorious advance, breaking through rigorous  ordeals and trials.    Single-hearted unity of our ranks around the illustrious  leader is also a powerful weapon in braving all the challenges  and obstructive moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries  and firmly defending the cause of socialism of our own style and  a mighty motive force for the development and prosperity of the  country. When a grave situation was created in the way of our  revolution last year, our people and the officers and men of the  People's Army decisively shattered the challenge and aggression  moves of the enemy and effected a great upswing in socialist  construction, united firmly behind the illustrious leader,  holding a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle in the other  hand, thus fully demonstrating the dignity of the country and  the heroic stamina of our people.    The might of the single-hearted unity of our ranks around  the  illustrious leader firmly convinces our people that they can  defend and accomplish the cause of socialism of our own style,  not wavering in any storm.    In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan great  difficulties  and obstacles were laid in economic construction owing to the  unexpected international events and the acute situation created  in our country. But our people, upholding the slogan that when  the party is determined, we can do anything, pushed on with the  socialist construction and increased the economic independence  of the country and its might in every way. This proud victory  was a great demonstration of our single-hearted unity.    Our party put forward the militant tasks to secure a new  base  for reaching higher levels of socialism by carrying through the  revolutionary economic strategy of the party in the period of  three-year adjustment.    The victorious advance and accomplishment of the cause of  socialism of our own style depend on how to defend  single-hearted unity, the banner of great victory in our  revolution.    Our people are not a people who will abandon the banner of  faith, the banner of single-hearted unity they have already  upheld, no matter what others may say, and not a people who will  take another road, yielding to any pressure or threat.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Suicide note castigates Milan magistrates' methods: 'I can no longer bear this disgrace. We are trested like dogs in kennels' - Gabriele Cagliari Extracts of the letter written by Gabriele Cagliari, former ENI chairman, to his family before committing suicide on July 20. The messages to his wife and children have been omitted. ONCE more I am about to cause great grief. After intense thought, I have decided I can no longer bear this disgrace. Ways of behaviour common to almost everybody - including the very same magistrates, even those in Milan - have become criminal. Some of us have been caught and exposed to public pillory and anger. The heavy hand of the law, unbalanced and unjust, has done the rest. We are treated like non-persons, like dogs in kennels. I have been here for over four months, illegally detained. There is no risk of me repeating anything I am accused of; nor is there any risk of me tampering with evidence relating to these accusations since I possess no powers of decision or action, neither am I going to alter any document since I have none. As for me leaving the country, I have no passport or identity card. On top of this I am 67 years old and the law lays down that to be kept in such degrading conditions there have to be exceptional circumstances. But as you are aware the motives for this pitiless treatment are different and the magistrates themselves repeatedly say so, even though this never is placed on the formal record (of the interrogations) as it should be. The magistrates' aim, and in particular those in Milan, is to force each one of us to make an irrevocable break with what they call our 'world' (the corrupt politico-economic system). Each one of us, already compromised in the public eye for being under investigation - or worse still arrested - is expected to 'collaborate'. Such 'collaboration' involves betrayals and denunciations and one ends up as they want you being classed as an 'outcast'. I am convinced the magistrates regard prison as no more than a tool of the trade for psychological torture, regardless of peoples' lives being at stake. As I have said we are like dogs in a kennel, and any public prosecutor can pick on us to show off to his colleagues that he can be tougher and smarter than the person who did the same thing a few days ago or a few hours back. Even among them there are the same market forces of competition - with the difference that in this case they are playing with other people's skins. In these circumstances I cannot accept any justice they hand out to me. They are destroying the very base of the rule of law and are moving on a path that leads towards authoritarianism. I want no part of this. Today the trials - and not only those in Milan - are tragic farces, with disproportionate sentences handed out by judges who scarce know the cases or who have fallen asleep during the sessions and then make up their minds in five minutes behind closed doors. The few of us who have fallen into the hands of this system of 'justice' risk becoming the scapegoats in the national tragedy being created by this revolution. I am convinced however I must reject such a scapegoat role. I feel above all else a husband and father, then a committed and honest worker who has sought to enhance a little our name: someone who has contributed his tiny part in advancing the cause of this country in the world. I won't let this be sullied by anyone involved in the 'clean hands' (corruption enquiry). I ask this of you as I seek your forgiveness for this farewell that is final.</p>

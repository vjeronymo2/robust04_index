Raja Mohan: "U.S. Sees India as a Big </F> Emerging Market"]    [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Clinton Administration  continues to send mixed signals to India. Even as the White  House puts out letters signed by the U.S. President, Mr. Bill  Clinton, with remarks on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that  are needlessly offensive to India, senior economic policy makers  in the administration are pointing out the emerging economic  opportunities in India and the absence of a political initiative  in Washington to consolidate these opportunities.    The U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for International  Trade,  Mr. Jeffrey E. Garten has said that as the economic reform  gathers momentum, India may be "in a position to provide  significant commercial opportunities for U.S. firms throughout  the 1990s.    Addressing the American Foreign Policy Association in New  York late last week, Mr. Garten expressed the hope of the  Clinton Administration to "develop a more regular, higher  profile commercial policy dialogue with India in the future."    Larger strategic framework: Mr. Garten's reference  to India was part of a larger strategic framework being  developed by the U.S. Commerce Department to engage the "big  emerging markets" (BEMs), such as China, Indonesia, South Korea,  India, Turkey, South Africa, Poland, Argentina, Brazil and  Mexico. Although Japan and Western Europe are likely to remain  the biggest markets for the United States, Mr. Garten suggests  that the "big emerging markets," hold--far more promise for  large incremental gains in exports." He estimates that nearly  three-fourths of the growth in world trade in the next two  decades is likely to take place in the developing world--much of  it occurring in the big emerging markets. The BEMs are likely to  double their share in world GDP in that time, to 20 percent from  today's 10 percent. By the year 2010, according to Mr. Garten,  the share of the BEMs in world imports is likely to exceed that  of Japan and the European Union combined.    Talking of the new commercial opportunities in India, Mr.  Garten has urged the reinvigoration of "dormant U.S.-Indian  Government-to-Government economic and commercial forums, and  encourage the involvement of business groups." In a reference to  the Indian expatriate community in the United States, Mr. Garten  believes that the U.S. business community and the Government  should find ways of working with them," whose familiarity and  ties with India would be invaluable." The expanded Indo-U.S.  commercial dialogue, according to Mr. Garten, should cover not  only issues such as intellectual property rights, workers  rights, and market access, but also procedures for export  financing and export licensing.    The U.S. Commerce Department, which is laying the ground for  a comprehensive commercial initiative towards the BEMs, believes  that the advanced industrial nations may have to compete  fiercely for a share of these markets. Mr. Garten notes that  since the Indian economic reforms began, top European leaders  have visited India to pursue enhanced commercial ties. He also  records that the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has  travelled to Germany, Japan, France, and South Korea with a  "commercial agenda in hand." Mr. Garten notes that "America has  been conspicuously absent from this flow." He insists "this must  change."    The incipient American strategy towards the BEMs understands  the need for "deft balancing" of commercial and foreign policy  considerations. The close coexistence of commercial  opportunities with the problems of "human rights, worker rights,  nuclear non-proliferation, and violations of intellectual  property rights," poses difficult policy dilemmas. Mr. Garten  recognises the independent political aspirations of these  countries, who "often effectively challenge U.S. policies in  multi-lateral organisations, such as the IMF, GATT and the  United Nations."    Voices beginning to be heard: The inability of the  South Asia Bureau in the U.S. State Department to find that  appropriate balance between different American interests in  India that has brought the high expectations just a year ago on  Indo-U.S. relations crashing down. It has been stuck with the  tiresome agenda of human rights, preventive diplomacy on  Kashmir, and non-proliferation, without any reference to the  larger economic opportunities for the United States, that are  emerging not only in India, but also in other parts of the  Sub-Continent. The letter-writing from the White House has not  helped either. But other voices in the Clinton administration,  most notably the Commerce Department, are at least beginning to  be heard.    It may be recalled that the announcement of the Prime  Minister's visit to the United States early this year came from  Ms. Joan Spero, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic and  Agricultural Affairs. Ms. Spero was putting Mr. Rao's visit in  the context of the new emphasis in Washington on economic  diplomacy. It may yet be possible that the U.S. policy towards  India could get a better balance, as the Clinton administration  sorts out the current chaos in its foreign policymaking.    PTI reports from Delhi:    Additional access to Indian garments: The United  States has agreed to accord additional access of about 40  million square metres over and above the notional level of about  500 million square metres for Indian garments in the current  calendar year under the new Indo-U.S. textile agreement.    Both the countries signed an agreement on Saturday last in  Washington, after three days of intense negotiations, an  official release said today.    For other cotton made-ups, including hand-loom made-ups, an  enhanced 115 percent had been provided, which is of the order of  13 million square metres.    For pajamas and nightwears, gent's jackets, which were under  unilateral specific limit have now been shifted to Group I with  bilaterally agreed specific limit. Similarly, items under  category 338/339 (cotton T-shirts), category 315 (twills),  category 326 (satins) which were hitherto covered by Group II  limit have also been shifted to Group I with specific limit. In  the case of category 351/651 and category 334/634, improvement  of 15 percent had been provided and in the case of 338/639, an  uplift of 50 percent have been provided.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Qinghai, one of China's  poor provinces in the northwest, has declared that the province  will get rid of poverty by the end of 2000.    Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, Qinghai has harsh  natural conditions and is often hit by natural disasters.    According to Ma Yuanbiao, vice-governor of the province, by  the year 2000 Qinghai's animal husbandry production will occupy  30 percent of total agricultural production, the per capita  income of farmers and herdsmen will be over 500 yuan, and some  50 percent of the total social production value in rural areas  will be made by township enterprises.    In the past eight years, the poverty-stricken areas in  Qinghai have constructed over 2,300 kilometers of highways and  improved farmland soil and grassland. The per capita income has  increased by 81 percent in the rural areas.    The provincial government has helped the poor areas to set  up  nearly 1,000 processing factories for farm and animal husbandry  products, mining and metallurgical plants and trained more than  1 million people.    In 1993, the total industrial output value in poor areas was  1.25 billion yuan (about 180 million U.S. dollars), 2.6 times  the figure eight years ago.    As a result of these efforts, nearly 70,000 people in the  province have escaped poverty every year. But there are still  1.19 million people under the poverty line, one-third of the  population in rural areas.    According to a new help-the-poor plan of the province, there  will be an average of 170,000 people escaping poverty each year,  and 14 percent increase of per capita income, through 2000.    The provincial government has issued policies to encourage  enterprises in developed areas to invest in poor areas.    Each year, the province issues 3 million yuan in  aid-the-poor  loans.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Riddick apologises for 'lack of judgment' Mr Graham Riddick, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley who agreed to table a parliamentary question for a fee of Pounds 1,000, last night apologised to the Commons for his 'lack of judgment'. The apology came as MPs approved without a vote a motion authorising the committee of privileges to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the so-called 'cash for questions' affair. The committee of senior MPs, picked by arrangement between the parties, will investigate payments made to MPs for tabling parliamentary questions and the role of The Sunday Times in the controversy. Tory backbenchers strongly attacked The Sunday Times, one of whose journalists posed as a businessman when offering Pounds 1,000 to a number of MPs for putting down questions to ministers in the Commons. Mr Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick, the Conservative MP for Bosworth, were named in the newspaper as having accepted Pounds 1,000 each. In a contrite speech, Mr Riddick welcomed the fact that it would be his peers on the committee of privileges 'sitting in judgment' and not the press. He said: 'I accept that I made an error of judgment in agreeing to table a question and agreeing, initially, to accept a fee.' He had later decided not to accept the fee and sent the cheque back by return of post. Throughout the debate there were demands from the opposition benches that MPs should be barred from accepting outside business commitments, particularly as consultants, which involved using facilities and procedures of the Commons. Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark Bermondsey, said that on stepping down from the leadership of the party Sir David Steel had been offered a five-figure sum for one year to book rooms in the Commons where he could join in entertaining the clients of a consultancy. Mr Hughes said that Sir David had been, in his own words, 'astounded' by the offer, which he had declined. Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, called for all MPs to be subject to the rules which prevent ministers accepting gifts or hospitality which could be said to influence their decisions. Insisting that MPs should not accept payment for acting as consultants, he said: 'We are elected to be consultants to the British people.' Moving the motion authorising an inquiry, Mr Nick Brown, shadow leader of the House, said the role of The Sunday Times in subjecting MPs to entrapment should be investigated along with the conduct of MPs. Sir John Gorst, Tory MP for Hendon North, condemned the undercover use of a tape recorder by The Sunday Times journalist when he agreed to see him, in the belief that he was a genuine businessman, within the parliamentary precincts. He said that those who sought to cause an MP to commit a contempt of the House by accepting bribes were themselves guilty of contempt. In the aftermath of the debate, some senior Tories expressed concerns about the extent of the reforms that the investigation might bring in its wake. 'I detect a sea-change,' said one. 'I think we are moving towards full-time MPs,' said another. The expectation last night was that the names of the MPs chosen to sit on the committee would be decided within days and that the inquiry would get under way before the summer recess, which starts next week.</p>

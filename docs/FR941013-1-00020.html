			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the exemptions from the registration requirement, DEA has determined that persons who manufacture List I chemicals solely for internal use, without any subsequent distribution or exportation of such chemicals, should not be required to obtain a registration, since there is a low risk of diversion from such persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has also been determined that persons who are registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances shall not be required to obtain a separate registration to distribute drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals. Further, persons who are registered with DEA to import or export controlled substances shall not be required to obtain a separate registration to engage in the same activities with drug products which are regulated as List I chemicals. Persons registered to engage in activities with controlled substances are subjected to more comprehensive investigations by Federal and state authorities relating to their controlled substance registrations than is required for a chemical registration. The Administrator reserves the right in this proposal to cancel a person's exemption from the registration requirement, if continuation of the exemption would not be in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 1310.01 is amended to revise the definitions of ``regulated transaction'' and ``regulated person'', and to add new definitions of ``broker'' and ``trader'', and ``international transaction''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Chemical mixtures that met the definition of ``chemical mixture'' set forth in &sect;1310.01(g) prior to the effective date of the DCDCA shall remain exempted from the definition of regulated transaction until DEA has promulgated final regulations regarding the procedures by which manufacturers may request exemption of chemical mixtures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section 1310.02 is amended to remove three chemicals from List I: d-lysergic acid, n-ethylephedrine and n-ethylpseudoephedrine; and to add to List I: nitroethane and benzaldehyde, as established by the DCDCA. In addition, the DEA chemical codes assigned to the listed chemicals have been added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Section 1310.03 is amended to implement the requirement that manufacturers of listed chemicals report certain data to DEA. This requirement will only apply to bulk manufacturers of listed chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 1310.04 is amended to reflect the additions and deletions of the List I chemicals and to set forth the proposed thresholds for the new chemicals. With respect to the newly added chemicals Nitroethane and Benzaldehyde, records and reports must be kept only for those transactions, including cumulative transactions within a calendar month, which equal or exceed the proposed thresholds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Sections 1310.05 and 1310.06 are amended to include a reporting requirement with respect to drug products containing ephedrine that are regulated as List I chemicals and to set forth the required format for the chemical manufacturer reports. Drug products containing ephedrine are legitimately distributed solely for human consumption. Thus, the distribution of 375 dosage units (approximately a two-month supply at the current recommended therapeutic dose) or more of such drug products in a calendar month to a person who is not registered with DEA to distribute or export a List I chemical would be considered extraordinary and therefore would have to be reported. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Section 1310.08 is amended to add international transactions to the types of transactions regulated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Sections 1310.10 through 1310.15 are added to set forth the procedures regarding removal of the exemption from recordkeeping and reporting requirements of drugs distributed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the exemption from recordkeeping and reporting requirements of chemical mixtures, and the identification of drugs which contain ephedrine in combination with therapeutically significant quantities of another medicinal ingredient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Section 1313.02 is amended to revise the definitions for ``regulated person'' and ``regulated transaction''; and definitions for ``regular importer'', ``established record as an importer'', ``broker'' and ``trader'', and ``international transaction''; and to remove the definition of ``regular supplier''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Sections 1313.12, 1313.15 and 1313.21 are amended to set forth criteria regarding the waiver of the 15 day notification requirement for certain imports and exports of listed chemicals and the removal of the waiver of the 15 day notification requirement for exports of listed chemicals to specified countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Sections 1313.32, 1313.33 and 1313.34 are added to establish the notification requirements for brokers and traders engaging in international transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

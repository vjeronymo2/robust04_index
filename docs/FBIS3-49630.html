			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Czech President Vaclav Havel with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents in Prague's Public Hall on  12 January -- live]    [Excerpts] [Havel] President Clinton has just left for  Kiev. From there he is flying to Moscow. He was in this country  for over 24 hours. The main objective of his stay in Prague was  to acquaint us and the neighboring countries with the results of  the NATO Brussels summit, with the Partnership for Peace project.    All countries that took part in this meeting confirmed their  interest in this project and expressed their readiness to start  to implement it immediately. This means that various  delegations will be coming soon and relevant protocols about  cooperation in various areas will be prepared.    President Clinton emphasized on several occasions, at  various  talks the importance of stability, peace, and security in  central Europe, for Europe as a whole, and also for United Staes  security. I personally see this visit as very successful.  President Clinton also said something similar because this  project was received by the central European countries with  understanding. It, however, must be said that all central  European countries emphasized they understood this [project]  only as a first step on the way to the full NATO membership.  The U.S. side took this with full understanding and assured us  that this was indeed the path on which it was possible to reach  full membership. The speed with which this project will be  changed into full NATO membership depends on individual  countries, their internal stability, their possibilities, their  potential, and many other circumstances.    Naturally, during the official talks of the delegations,  during the multilateral lunch, and also on other less official  occasions, we spoke about various matters, including economic  cooperation. The main objective of this visit was, however,  what I have described earlier.    [Czech Radio correspondent] Mr. President, to what extent is  the project Partnership for Peace done to meet our dreams,  ideas, and aspirations? To what extent does it contain specific  guarantees of us being integrated in the sphere of Euro-American  influence, and to what extent is this accommodating attitude  toward this project a matter of inner convictions of the  representatives of the Visegrad countries? Finally, to what  extent is it the realization that there is no other way?    [Havel] All those countries which took part in this meeting  stressed that they did not want to join the North Atlantic  Alliance only in order to have as smaller countries some allies  and formal guarantees of their security. This application means  something deeper. It means subscribing to certain civilization  values which the North Atlantic Alliance is protecting. It also  means a will to take an active part in protecting such values.  Those specific areas in which protocols on cooperation are to  be concluded and which this project contains are generally  expressed in the final communique issued by the NATO summit in  Brussels, which surely you shall have or which you already have  at your disposal. During the discussions on these matters this  issue was developed in a somewhat more specific detail.    It is clear that this project as such does not contain  formalized security guarantees; rather, as it emerged from all  the discussions it is in fact a some kind of a degree of  security guarantees or let us say a first step to security  guarantees. It contains, for instance, the clause about  consultations 16 plus one. This means that if a country feels  threatened it has the right of consulting its situation with the  Alliance and it depends on the assessment of both partners what  consequences it might eventually have.    [Holec, Czech News Agency] Mr. President, to what extent did  opinions of [words indistinct] Visegrad differ? President  Walesa's address at the working lunch, from what I have seen,  was very critical. President Walesa was saying that, at least  according to that speech, the Partnership for Peace is somewhere  halfway. Could you tell us more about the differences in  opinions as well as President Walesa's stance?    [Havel] The important fact is that these four countries, and  that was in the interest of the American side as well, gave  their support to this project, accepted it, and expressed their  readiness to work on it. Of course, stances of some individual  delegations differed. In the stance taken by the Polish  delegation there emerged some kind of a basic formula that this  is a step in the right direction but a small one.    We do not share this view. I personally believe that this  was the only possible step [to be taken] by the alliance, that  it is a well-balanced, well thought out step. If I pose any  questions to myself it is only the question why this step had  not been taken one or two years ago.    Poland has different historical experience. It is more  sensitive to the possibility of a likely threat and that is why  in its policy there is a somewhat bigger proportion of concern,  more caution concerning its own security. However, it is not  for me to explain the positions of other states. I am sure that  the presidents will have an opportunity to familiarize [us] with  their opinions.    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] Did you talk with  President Clinton about the fate of Radio Free Europe?    [Havel] Yes, we did talk about it, but at this moment I am  unable to say anything specific in this matter the press.    [Correspondent] If you allow me I shall revert to  "Partnership for Peace." You said yesterday that the Czech  Republic was willing to begin immediately to fill the project  with a concrete content. What is this content and in order to  realize these objectives does it envisage bilateral  consultations in our region or even consultations within the  framework of the Visegrad Four?    [Havel] The partnership for peace project has several items  which characterize the areas of cooperation. Those specific  discussions will be about how this cooperation is to be  implemented in individual areas. This will be the subject of  these discussions. The Czech side is prepared for such  discussions and likewise the North Atlantic Alliance is also  prepared for them. President Clinton told us that at the close  of the summit in Brussels Manfred Werner had given instructions  to the states of the North Atlantic Alliance that if these  [Visegrad] countries showed interest that they were to sent  immediately their experts and start preparing these protocols at  an expert level. The document describes precisely what kind of  cooperation is involved. As far as consultations are concerned  within the framework of regions the partnership for peace  project, and this is one of its clauses, envisages cooperation  among individual partnership countries which will then be  partners of the Alliance.    Talks will be held separately with each country. Such talks  will always take the form 16 plus one. The talks are  individualized and in the case of each country this may have a  different content, perhaps a different rhythm of contacts,  different frequence of joint exercises and the like, or  cooperation in the field of inspection of military budgets and  arms manufacture and the like. Nonetheless, the document also  contains a clause that the individual partnership countries,  which will sign up to this project, are also to cooperate  together. One can hardly imagine a situation in which two  partner countries of the North Atlantic Alliance would have cool  relations with each other.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, while you were discussing it  and in view of the very special experiences over the history of  Czechoslovakia did you discuss in any way, did you mention in  any way a Russian politician named Vladimir Adolfovich  Zhirinovskiy and what he may mean?    [Havel] Similarly like representatives of some other  neighboring countries we also have certain historical  experiences of our own, above all the one that if our liberty,  our independence are sacrificed to some kind of an illusionary  peace, if someone judges that such a small and distant country  is not worthy of a possible involvement or possible sacrifices  than in history this has never paid off to those countries since  later they had to bring sacrifices that were disproportionately  far bigger. Central Europe is a region that is very exposed  lying in the very center of Europe where in history various wars  begun and ended. It is a crossroad of spiritual and  civilizational tides, geo-political interests and this is why  our security is a part of the all-European security and after  all historical experiences the West is in my view is well aware  of this, and it is aware of this face to face to certain extreme  or nationalistic voices that one can hear at present from  various countries.    [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mr. President, did you discuss the financial  dimension of the Partnership for Peace with the presidents of  the Visegrad [Group]? I have in mind their possibilities to  financially participate on this project.    [Havel] The Partnership for Peace project is a project of a  defense alliance, a NATO project. Therefore, its specific  articles relate especially to the cooperation between the  armies, the cooperation on security. However, it is by no means  only this. The project has its political dimension. The  cooperation on security is envisaged on the basis of shared  democratic values as well as a shared perception of economy and  of the economic reform. This means that, indirectly, this  partnership must lead, and it is assumed that it will lead, to  the deepening of relations in all other areas, including even  such areas as is the cooperation between parliaments etc.    [Correspondent] President Clinton regularly uses only the  word Visegrad. You were speaking about the countries of Central  Europe. This conceptual tension is rather well known. Did  anything change during this visit? I mean, our idea of  individual states and some Visegrad cooperation as opposed to  the American idea of Visegrad as a relatively well defined  region?    [Havel] I think that the difference is not as big as it  might  seem. Individual countries are aware that the era, when it was  necessary to demonstrate our inseparable unity in such a  manifest way, is over. This was [needed] at a time when we were  doing away with the Warsaw treaty, when we tried to free  ourselves from under the Soviet hegemony. At that time it was  important that the heads of states and premiers of those three  countries often came together. It was at the time when we  strived to achieve a fast withdrawal of the Russian army and we  demonstrated our political unity both eastward and westward.  That era is over. The tasks were completed.    Now comes the era of a more concrete, regional and permanent  cooperation. A cooperation which is not being turned into  problem by anybody and whose urgency and necessity is being  perceived by all. Everybody knows that the basic principle of a  foreign policy is to be in good terms with one's neighbors and  to cooperate with them in the best possible way.    Hence, from the conceptual point of view, there are no  differences and it is not essential whether we use the words  Visegrad Group or not. If you wish so, I can use them. By the  way, this group was given its name by you journalists.    Could you give us a specific proof of cooperation that is  requested from Visegrad Group countries?    [Havel] As I have already indicated all Visegrad countries  realize that cooperation will have to come from both sides and  that this means also an involvement from their side and not only  involvement on the side of the North Atlantic Alliance. Among  others this means, for instance, a possible participation of our  units in operation which the Alliance may carry out at the  request of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe. This implies a certain investment, both  moral and material. None of these countries have any doubt  about this since it arises directly from the project.    [Correspondent] At a news conference today Slovak Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar voiced the view that cooperation among  the countries of the Visegrad group was stagnating. What is  your view and do you think that partnership for peace may become  a factor that may make such cooperation more dynamic?    [Havel] I would not dare to say that it stagnates. I know,  for instance, that interior ministers have regular contacts  because the whole region has a common refugee problem, that  other ministers also cooperate, that cooperation is taking place  in various areas. As you know the Czech Republic has developed  initiative to speed up the formation of a free trade zone, to  expand free trade by including in it some further commodities.  I would not say that this co-operation stagnates. It is  perhaps less visible. It has simply shifted to various specific  areas and is less demonstrative.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, has the Czech Republic or  other individual countries of the Visegrad four countries  obtained an approximate date and a time-table when they could  join the Alliance?    [Havel] This issue was not discussed. Everyone was very  reticent as far as setting dates was concerned and that included  us. This is because we know very well that such a matter depends  on an enormous amount of various factors and circumstances which  can be hardly envisaged and very few politicians would want to  take a blame for setting a date which cannot then be met. We  merely say that we want to be regular members of the Alliance as  soon as possible, and from the other side we have been assured  that nothing stand in our way that would prevent us from  becoming regular members soon.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Lacklustre demand for African Development Bank The African Development Bank took advantage of calmer market conditions at the start of this week to launch its Dollars 500m 10-year Eurobond, via Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers. But despite being reasonably priced, the deal met lacklustre demand, according to syndicate officials. 'Investors were relieved that the last 24 hours had been better, but they are not in buying mode,' said one syndicate manager. The African Development Bank deal suffered as inflationary fears prompted by the latest spate of US economic data prompted a further sell-off in US Treasuries. The deal was priced to yield 28 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury. For investors, this represents a yield pick-up of about 8 basis points over the Asian Development Bank's recent 10-year deal, currently trading at 20 basis points over the Treasury. Dealers described the pricing as offering fair value, but said that they had seen little buying interest. The spread widened slightly to 29 basis points. The deal was issued under the bank's Dollars 500m Euro medium-term note programme, which is now likely to be increased, according to its treasurer, Mr Kofi Bucknor. The bank expects to borrow a further Dollars 500m this year. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars. Dollar swap spreads have widened slightly as the bond market has sold off, creating some better arbitrage opportunities. The market saw heavy new issuance in the equity-linked sector by Japanese borrowers, with Dollars 1.1bn in US dollar-denominated issues and SFr270m of Swiss franc-denominated issues. In the face of such heavy supply, investor demand for the issues appeared fairly weak, although syndicate officials said they expected to sell the issues over the next few days. Buying was mainly from Europe, although some demand was reported from the Middle and Far East. Investors were a mixture of arbitrageurs - who were buying the warrants and shorting the stock - and traditional equity-linked investors who want exposure to the stock. Dealers said the heavy supply was purely coincidental rather than a reflection of suitable market conditions. Tobu Railway launched the biggest equity-linked deal of the day, a Dollars 400m four-year bond issue with warrants. One dealer said several Japanese borrowers were expected to launch equity-linked deals ahead of the introduction of new accounting rules in April.</p>

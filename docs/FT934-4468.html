			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Back seat drivers push Volvo off the road: Shareholders unhappy with Renault deal but offer few alternatives The resignation last night of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's dominant figure for more than two decades, was the culmination of one of the most extraordinary episodes in Swedish industrial history. When Volvo announced its proposed merger with Renault in September, it was billed as Mr Gyllenhammar's crowning achievement, but instead it turned out to be the beginning of his humiliation. In a battle with his shareholders, Mr Gyllenhammar saw the merger torn up, a three-year alliance with Renault thrown into doubt and questions raised about the strategy of Volvo. Mr Gyllenhammar hit back hard at his enemies last night, accusing them of wilfully blurring debate over the merits of the merger with emotional and political issues. In a bitter commment, he said Volvo shareholders had simply followed popular sentiment. 'Many have let me know that they are very observant of where the wind blows,' he said. But the shareholder revolt was bred by longstanding disquiet over Mr Gyllenhammar's dictatorial management style which spilled over into outright hostility at what was seen as his bungled negotiation of a deeply flawed agreement with Renault. For shareholders, the core question of exactly how much Renault was paying to take over Volvo's vehicle manufacturing was never properly answered. In spite of publishing sheaves of information, the two groups never explained how they had calculated the 35 per cent share of the merged company that Volvo was to receive. The lack of detailed valuations exacerbated strong Swedish doubts over placing Volvo's core assets into an unquoted company controlled by what was regarded as one of Europe's most interventionist states. Latterly, concern was also fuelled by growing reports from groups within Volvo - such as engineers - that co-operation between Renault and Volvo under the existing alliance had not gone as smoothly as Mr Gyllenhammar had suggested. Pushed along by saturation media coverage, much of it hostile to the deal, these factors helped overturn a mood of the sober acceptance by politicians, unions, the business community and shareholders that had greeted the merger announcement in September. As the doubts piled up, the latent emotional reluctance to seeing the greatest symbol of Swedish industrial prowess fall under foreign control came to the fore. But the question Volvo's shareholders have not addressed is where the company goes if not to a merger with Renault. 'Whatever happens, it will be bad for Volvo,' admitted Mr Stig Ramel, chief executive of the 92-94 Fund, a state investment fund which was in the 'no' camp to the merger. 'It is a question of finding the way out that is least damaging.' The central aspect of the merger proposal which Volvo always felt commanded widespread support was the 'industrial logic' of the deal - the belief that Volvo needed to deepen the partnership already established with Renault if it was to survive in a world automotive industry saddled with overcapacity. Critics argued that the rapid return to profitability at Volvo this year - in contrast to sagging profits at Renault - showed the company could stand alone. They pointed out Volvo's truck division was much stronger than Renault's. Moreover, they said Renault, which already owns 10 per cent of Volvo, was unlikely to try to reverse out of the alliance which benefits both companies, especially in cost savings. Those who rejected the merger are apparently willing to contribute, via a share issue, to the SKr8bn (Pounds 640m) Volvo has said it will need in new capital without the merger. But Mr Gyllenhammar derided the notion that Volvo suddenly had a 'brilliant future' without Renault. 'Our painstakingly built relations with France and with Renault will now be detroyed with immediate effect. This reduces the probability of a Swedish presence in Europe and for Volvo's long-term survival.' This argument has always been accepted by Volvo's blue-collar trade unions - something Mr Gyllenhammar paid tribute to in a further swipe at his critics. '(The unions) see the long term. They understand industrial development. And they have courage.' Mr Gyllenhammar stressed the weaknesses at Volvo which the merger was meant to address. Strong profits flow this year has been helped by a weak Swedish krona and low development costs, as new models have been recently launched. In the meantime, Volvo's narrow model range - it does not produce a small car - is a severe hindrance. The market-leading safety record which powered Volvo's success in the 1980s has also been eroded by advances made by other manufacturers. 'Volvo needs a partner, now or later, and later there won't be such a good deal available,' said one of Volvo's international advisers. Much will now depend on Renault's response to the crisis at Volvo. Within Volvo itself, meanwhile, it was clear last night that the Volvo board will be almost completely reshaped, with Mr Gyllenhammar's allies, including Mr Raymond Levy, the former Renault chief, stepping down with him. Mr Soren Gyll, brought in as chief executive by Mr Gyllenhammar last year, is now set to exert full influence over Volvo. He has retained shareholder support throughout the merger episode and will be the key figure in shaping Volvo's uncertain future. Lex, Page 16; Gyllenhammar, Page 22; World stock markets, Page 39</p>

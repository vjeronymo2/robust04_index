			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Big gains against D-Mark THE D-MARK weakened against most of the important currencies as speculation about monetary easing in Germany intensified, writes Emma Tucker. The announcement by the Bundesbank that it was switching to a variable, rather than a fixed rate, repurchase tender was taken as a sign that the German central bank was happy to see money market rates ease. The news sent the dollar sharply higher in frantic European trading, leading some traders to suggest that the US currency was finally recovering from its position as the lowest yielding key international currency. 'The dollar is at long last firmly established on an upward path. It is likely to make a sustained break above DM1.52,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Although the main push to the dollar came from the easing of German money rates, poor economic data from Japan - suggesting rates would ease there too  -also helped buoy the currency. The view that a victory by Mr Bill Clinton in the US presidential election might caution the Federal Reserve against further rate cuts also contributed to the dollar's better performance. It closed in London at DM1.5195, up 3 1/2 pfennigs on the day. In early New York trading the currency continued to make gains. It popped above DM2.52 before settling just below that level in mid-day trading. The move by the Bundesbank to variable repurchase rates also helped boost the pound. But dealers said the currency's gains would be short lived and said sterling would continue to fluctuate. 'The D-Mark's weakness was very helpful to the pound but it is still very volatile. People will continue to find reasons to sell the pound,' said Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Poor money supply data - in particular the news that individuals and companies made a net repayment of loans to banks and building societies last month for the time since records started 28 years ago - also reminded the market of the UK's weak economic outlook and hence the likelihood of further base rate cuts. Dealers were, however, a little more sanguine about the political outlook in the UK. They no longer expect the government to be defeated in today's debate on the future of the coal industry, following its partial U-turn on the decision to close 31 pits. Sterling closed in London at DM2.4700 up five pfennigs on the day. It slipped  2/3 of a cent against the dollar to close in London at Dollars 1.6255. Tentative signs of recovery among weaker European currencies were also aided by the signs of monetary relaxation in Germany.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian Television  and Radio Company [VGTRK], informed us overnight by telephone  that the meeting between the heads of VGTRK departments and  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets ended late yesterday  evening. The meeting addressed, among other things, ways to  combine commercial and state television services. No specific  decisions have yet been made. At the same time, Poptsov told  the meeting that Russia's Finance Ministry was demonstrating  what he called "total hostility" toward state television. The  VGTRK chairman said the Finance Ministry seemed to think that  state television lives on a different planet, while the Ministry  of Finance is the main planet--where policy is decided by Yuriy  Dubinin.    At roughly the same time, it was learned that Viktor  Chernomyrdin had instructed the Finance Ministry to draw up a  range of measures to ensure that the state television companies'  80 billion [rubles] in debts to the Communications Ministry are  paid off in stages. At 0600 Moscow time, however, we received  an ITAR-TASS report that Krasnoyarsk telecommunications  personnel had switched off the transmitters immediately after  Ostankino's "Utro" program. Russian television programs are not  being broadcast in Krasnoyarsk either.</p>

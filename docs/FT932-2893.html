			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Gooda Walker Names face fresh Pounds 157m cash call LLOYD'S NAMES in the insur-ance market's worst-affected syndicates, which have already reported losses of more than Pounds 900m, learned yesterday they must pay Pounds 157m of that amount by the end of next month. The 4,500 Gooda Walker Names - the individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's of London insurance market - will be asked to pay an average of Pounds 35,000. GW Run Off, the agency supervising the affairs of seven stricken syndicates, reported combined losses for 1989, 1990, and some earlier years of Pounds 900m, a slight fall from an earlier estimate of Pounds 924m. However, Mr Ken Randall, a director of GW Run Off, who is investigating the syndicates, expects the total loss to rise to more than Pounds 1bn, about a sixth of Lloyd's total losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the last five years. Lloyd's will report record 1990 losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn next week. The Serious Fraud Office reaffirmed yesterday that it was considering a report by Mr Randall into the Gooda Walker syndicates submitted to it in April. The SFO insisted, however, that its 'vetting' of the report 'is certainly not an investigation'. The Randall report alleges that Gooda Walker syndicates artificially inflated their profits during the 1980s through the improper use of 'time and distance' (T&amp;D) policies - reinsurance policies that allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves against so-called long-tail claims more effectively. Long-tail claims are those that emerge many years after the inception of policies. Both Mr Randall and Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, which is organising legal action on behalf of 2,000 Names, said they had been approached by the SFO for information. Mr Randall said: 'They have been making inquiries and we are now getting supplementaries.' Mr Deeny said it 'is absolutely scandalous for Lloyd's to try to extract Pounds 157m from ruined Names in a case under serious examination by the SFO. This further demand is intolerable'. He added: 'We were lured on to these syndicates by invented profit figures created by the use of these T&amp;Ds. Lloyd's itself encourages the use of these dangerously misleading financial instruments.' Describing the result as 'truly awful', Mr Randall said: 'We expect the claims and reinsurance recoveries to go and we've tried to match the calls - we've deferred everything we possibly can.' The fresh cash call includes Pounds 30m for losses which were incurred in 1991. Payment of a further Pounds 145m has been deferred. Already Names have been asked to pay Pounds 553m, of which some Pounds 73m is still outstanding. An estimated Pounds 100m had been paid by the Lloyd's central fund, which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations, Mr Randall said. Members of one or more of the Gooda Walker syndicates include: 15 peers; three QCs; Mr Paul Marland, the Conservative MP; Sir Antony Richard Pilkington, the chairman of Pilkington, the glassmaker; and Sir Leslie Porter, the former chairman of Tesco.

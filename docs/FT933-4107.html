			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Rural petrol stations 'at risk' A NUMBER of rural petrol stations operated by large integrated oil companies such as Shell could close if competition from hypermarkets continues unabated, Sir John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said yesterday. Sir John said in the company's annual energy review that competitive pressures were undermining the 'old public services undertakings' by which the big oil companies ensured countrywide access to fuel supplies at uniform prices. He added that the undertakings were becoming 'an untenable anachronism'. Sir John said that hyper-markets account for 16 per cent of national sales of vehicle fuels. Their market share is growing rapidly because they can take advantage of the cheap supplies from surplus capacity in British refineries. Hypermarkets can also concentrate on a few sites where they can incorporate the latest health, safety and environmental standards at relatively low costs. 'There is a growing differential between low volumes and high unit costs of rural sites and the converse for hyper-markets who operate only at prime sites,' Sir John said. 'These differentials can no longer be accommodated . . . (and) they will increasingly entail the reduction and concentration of oil company networks, with consequent pressures on the availability or price of rural petrol supplies.' Sir John also warned that urban motorists should not assume that the trend towards lower petrol prices would last. Financial strains on re-finers were now 'acute' because of a 20 per cent surplus in capacity combined with the cost of new environmental measures, many of which he believes are 'ill-considered'.</p>

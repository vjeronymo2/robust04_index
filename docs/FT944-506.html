			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Fibre optic bridge: A tiny Irish village has a role in US health care, says John Murray-Brown 'Cigna? What's that, a horse?' It was the sort of conversation you might expect in an Irish pub as Saturday night slipped into Sunday morning. In Pat Barret's, one of Loughrea's favourite hostelries, surprisingly few people seem to know about the American healthcare company installed among the dry stone walls next to the Gaelic Athletic Association. Like the Burt Lancaster character in Local Hero, who descends on a remote Scottish village with big business plans, Cigna is something of a mystery to many of the 3,500 inhabitants of this west of Ireland town close to the sea. 'The only thing I know is that my wife plays bridge in a group called the Cigna pairs,' says Joe, as he passes round a plate of crab claws. Bertie Donoghue, local correspondent for the Connaught Tribune, who for 54 years has in his own words 'chronicled the passing parade', says: 'It comes over by satellite every day, some kind of hospital accounts I think, and they send them back mostly by computer . . . Gives a lot of young ladies a lot of hope.' Cigna is, in fact, one of several US companies that have set up back offices in the heart of the Irish countryside, reducing their wage bills thanks to advances in telecommunications. The office handles around 5,000 medical claims a day, equivalent to 20 per cent of Cigna's business. The paperwork - from doctors, patients and corporate clients across the US - is flown to Shannon from New York's John F Kennedy airport, collected by courier and driven to Loughrea. It is then entered into the computer, and transmitted through two dedicated optic fibre cables back to Cigna's headquarters in Delaware, where, because of the time difference, it arrives in time for the following day's business. Catherine Hynes, the office manager, believes that one of the reasons the operation is so little understood locally is that it is an office, rather than a factory. 'Five years ago there was nothing. All of a sudden this American company arrives. There was some anxiety over whether it was going to take off. Ireland has had some manufacturing. But the office environment is different,' she says. 'There is also still a myth out here that office work is more suited to women.' But Cigna is now Loughrea's largest employer, with a staff of 88, and office skills have come to the fore. Michael Bond, headmaster of St Brigid's vocational school, one of two schools in Loughrea, admits to knowing nothing about computers himself, but St Brigid's has been offering evening classes on information technology and secretarial skills for some years. 'I am a geography teacher and I know how much a service industry can do. I welcome it,' Mr Bond says. 'Our history is that we always went away for work. Now parents want to see their children stay.' Others are more sceptical about the gains from operations based on telecommunications. The average starting salary at the Cigna office is IPounds 7,000 (Pounds 7,000). 'They are in a buyer's market: there are 300,000 out of work in Ireland,' says Maurice Sweeney the local travel agent, and head of Loughrea's fishing club. Any company that relocates its back office is doing so to keep wage costs down and will be willing to go anywhere, he says. 'They can hire and fire at their leisure.' Loughrea certainly has cause to be wary of the longevity of foreign investments. Courtaulds, the UK textile group, was producing locally in the 1950s. Hohner, the mouth organ manufacturer, also had an operation nearby. Both have long since closed down. There were even rumours of cuts at the Cigna office, when US President Bill Clinton was applying pressure to get his health bill past Congress, but, by all accounts, Ms Hynes fought Loughrea's corner. 'We would prefer if it was an indigenous company but, if it gives employment, it gives employment. The Americans make them work hard, no doubt,' says Rodney Donnellan, newsagent and local town commissioner. In Loughrea, there are some 800 people collecting benefit, and Ireland has the second highest unemployment rate in the European Union. Young people have traditionally moved away in search of work. But opportunities are scarce these days. There are fewer jobs available in the UK, and it is becoming increasingly tough to get work visas in the US, except under the so-called Morrison scheme, a lottery which provides a few hundred visas every year. 'It is easier to win the pools,' says Richard Reilly, father of four and a local painter and decorator. Many locals used to work in Dublin during the week, coming home only at the weekends. 'It used to be so sad to see all the young people lined up on a Monday morning taking the bus to Dublin,' says Mr Michael Chambers, manager of the local branch of Allied Irish Bank. But 'Cigna is changing all that,' he says The Cigna jobs do seem to have made a difference. Home rents have gone up. Declan Keary, the local auctioneer, says: 'We always used to have a few properties on our books, now we have none.' At the Skillet, one of Loughrea's 33 pubs, Willy Burke has converted his top floor into new apartments. The town council is considering reopening the local cinema, an old linen hall donated to the town by Lord Lascelles in British times. A new lease of life at the Temperance Hall, a former cavalry barracks, has brought performances which this year included Zorba the Greek by the Loughrea Choral and Dramatic Society. The community appears to be thriving. Mr Terry Doyle, manager of the town's other bank, the Bank of Ireland, says of the Cigna operation: 'In the early days I suppose the type of employment wasn't the best - the wage structure, for example. But it's a better place today. If we got another one it would be grand.' 'I've come back,' he says, 'and thank God I've come back and please God I'll stay.'</p>

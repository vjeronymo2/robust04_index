			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052)] </F>   [Text] Nanjing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- While inspecting rural  areas in Suzhou recently, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the  Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC  Central Committee, stressed that economically developed areas  should further strengthen their agricultural foundation and  bring about an all-around development of the rural economy; they  should intensify the building of a socialist spiritual  civilization and bring about all-around social progress.    From 11 to 15 June, Wen Jiabao conducted investigations and  studies in Suzhou's Wujiang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu,  Zhangjiagang, and Taicang Counties (cities) to become acquainted  with the development of agriculture and the rural economy there.  Suzhou made an early start in building town and township  enterprises, and they have been developing rapidly. By the end  of 1993, the city's town and township enterprises, whose output  value accounted for 75 percent of the city's total industrial  output value, employed 45 percent of the rural labor force.  While rapidly expanding town and township enterprises, the city  authorities have not slackened agriculture, investing more than  300 million yuan in agriculture each year. All throughout the  countryside, the rural economy is flourishing; production is  expanding; and there is social stability. After fully affirming  Suzhou city's marked achievements in economic and social  development, Wen Jiabao said: Town and township enterprises are  a great invention of China's peasants and are also the pillar  for economic development in the countryside. From the very  start, town and township enterprises have been closely linked  to the rural economy, to agricultural modernization, and to  efforts by peasants to strive for a prosperous standard of  living. Vigorously developing town and township enterprises is  an important mission for rural economic work. Areas with  comparatively developed town and township enterprises should,  through supplementing agriculture with industry and developing  agricultural with support from industry, make further efforts to  strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy and  comprehensively invigorate the rural economy by ensuring that  grain production, diversified undertakings, and town and  township enterprises develop in a coordinated way.    Visiting a number of township-established high-standard  farms  and vegetable growing bases, Wen Jiabao asked many relevant  questions. He said: Establishment of high-standard capital  farms and vegetable growing bases will spur the construction of  agricultural infrastructural facilities and the construction of  agricultural service systems, and the application of modern  agricultural science and technology will also help in protecting  arable land. Areas with a comparatively developed economy  should strengthen the coonstruction of high-standard  agricultural farms and protected zones for vegetable gardens.  When conditions permit, all areas should develop diversified  undertakings of an appropriate scale in line with local  conditions and strive to increase the level of intensive farming.    While seizing the opportunity to accelerate economic  development, Suzhou has also paid attention to the building of a  spiritual civilization in rural areas. Education, culture, and  health services have developed fairly rapidly there, and public  order has been relatively good. After commending the local  authorities for what they had done, Wen Jiabao stressed: What  we want to build is a new socialist countryside with developed  material and spiritual civilizations. While we should strive to  enable the peasants to have ample food and clothing and enjoy a  fairly prosperous material life, we should also strive to enable  them to work and live in peace and contentment and to enjoy a  relatively abundant spiritual life. In rural work, we should  adhere to the principle that both material progress and cultural  and ideological progress should be promoted, and concentrate on  the objectives of developing the rural productive forces and  achieving a comfortable standard of living. While deepening  reform and developing the economy, we should effectively  strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization in rural  areas, bring about all-around progress there, and strive to  build a prosperous and civilized new socialist countryside.    Accompanying Wen Jiabao on the inspection tour were Cao  Hongming, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC  Committee; Wang Minsheng, vice chairman of the provincial  people's congress standing committee secretary of the Suzhou  City party committee; and others.</p>

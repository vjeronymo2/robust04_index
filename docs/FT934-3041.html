			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: North West Water North West chose a sensitive moment to part company with Mr Bob Thian, the chief executive who left unexpectedly a fortnight ago. With the regulator poised to set price limits for the second half of the decade, and a portfolio of international contracts now stretching from Malaysia to Mexico, a firm hand on the tiller would be comforting. This is all the more so since North West's process engineering side has taken a turn for the worse. Without the benefit of foreign exchange, turnover in this area was lower in the first half and operating profits halved. After interest payments on the Pounds 140m cost of acquisitions, the business will do well to cover its costs this year. North West may prove more adept at operating water treatment plants overseas than managing US engineering companies. The risk capital involved in such projects is also modest compared with the cost of acquisitions. Having raised equity through May's enhanced scrip dividend to pay for such investment, though, the onus is on North West to prove that it can earn a decent rate of return. The tax credit which boosted earnings in the first half was a direct benefit of the scrip, but will not be felt again. If North West can avoid trouble overseas, the more immediate risks lie with the regulated water business. Efforts to scale back capital expenditure plans should allow it to live with a lower price cap and probably lessen the risk of a rights issue. Even so, with capital expenditure of around Pounds 500m a year for the next 10 years, North West badly needs a favourable settlement with the regulator.</p>

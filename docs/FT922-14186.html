			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: The good manager not necessarily a good director Sir, Your report on the Cadbury Committee is timely (Management: 'Getting directors on board', April 2). The issue, though, is not just 'corporate governance' but the selection and training of directors. There is a huge difference between managing and directing. Wise companies are beginning to recognise this, and are finding that good managers do not necessarily make good directors. This challenges the current notion of a manager's career progression. Surveys of directors by the Institute of Directors and myself have both found that over 90 per cent of directors, nationally and internationally, have had no training or development in directing. The areas of formulating policy, strategic thinking, supervision of management, and accountability to stakeholders, are just beginning to be recognised as providing full-time work for directors. The new centre for director development at the IoD is heavily subscribed with people keen to understand what direction-giving is all about. This is an area in which Britain leads the world.

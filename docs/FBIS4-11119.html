			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Begin relay] [Mario Espinoza, identified by  screen caption] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on 20 April  promulgated the Popular Participation Law, one of the bases of  his administration as he himself has repeatedly explained to  Bolivian citizens.    When promulgating the law, President Sanchez de Lozada said:  With the promulgation of the Capitalization [as heard] Law we  are closing a chapter in the government reorganization process.    The Chamber of Deputies approved the law on 20 April,  including the amendments introduced by the Senate. The Chamber  of Deputies also is planning to discuss the national budget  during the congressional term that is about to expire. [end  relay] [passage omitted]    As we reported a few minutes ago, labor unions are indignant  over the approval and promulgation of the Popular Participation  Law.    [Begin relay] [Cathia Rodriguez, identified by screen  caption] Union leaders allege that the Bolivian Labor  Federation [COB] cannot be happy with a Popular Participation  Law that was drafted and approved without popular participation.  According to union leaders, the law's main objective is to  abolish traditional union organizations.    [First unidentified union leader] Until today, COB, labor  unions, federations, and confederations of different sectors  have been the mediators between civilian society and the  government. Today, the government wants to take this role away  from the COB. This is why the Popular Participation Law does not  discuss the concept (?of grass-roots) organizations [words  indistinct]. They are being virtually disavowed.    [Second unidentified union leader] Although laws are being  approved, we have to see whether they will be enforced in  Bolivia.    [Rodriguez] Does COB believe it can prevent their  enforcement?    [Union leader] We believe we represent those who have been  marginalized from the drafting of these laws. Therefore, those  who have been marginalized will be following this issue very  closely.    [Rodriguez] The Popular Participation Law was approved on 20  April and the national budget will be approved soon. The union  leaders are aware that once the budget is approved, salary  negotiations will end then and there with the imposition of an 8  percent salary increase offered by the government. However,  they assert they will continue fasting until the government's  will is broken.    Nationwide, there are already 90 union groups that are  fasting and 738 people on strike. The group that has been  fasting the longest is in La Paz. The group has been fasting  for 18 days. At the national level, 40 people on a fast are in  serious health.    Meanwhile, the demonstrations continue. This week retail  shop workers staged two protest demonstrations. COB has  announced that tomorrow there will be a demonstration staged by  all labor unions. In La Paz, the demonstration is scheduled for  1500 in San Francisco Plaza. [end relay]</p>

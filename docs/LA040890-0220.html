			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE FEW, THE PROUD -- THE KNOW-IT-ALLS;  </P> <P> COMPETITION: THE STATE'S BEST ACADEMIC DECATHLON TEAM FROM LAGUNA HILLS HIGH  SCHOOL IS TRAINING HARD FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. ONLY THE TOP SQUAD FROM  TEXAS IS RANKED HIGHER.  </P> <P> Ready to exercise? OK, flex that left frontal lobe! Stretch that gray matter!  C'mon, work that cerebellum!  </P> <P> How else would you expect an academic decathlon team to work out for a  championship?  </P> <P> Actually, it doesn't sound quite like that when the state champion Laguna Hills  High School academic decathlon team meets to prepare for the upcoming national  championships in Des Moines. But the team's preparations are something like  brain calisthenics.  </P> <P> From now until the start of the grueling three-day national competition on  April 20, the nine-student Laguna Hills team -- which bested 46 other high  schools March 10 to take the state championship -- will be studying almost  nonstop in a bid to be crowned the smartest teens in America.  </P> <P> Much of the team's preparation consists simply of cramming as much information  as possible into their heads during marathon study sessions, which coach Kathy  Lane said can last up to four hours a day before the event. Lane and the team's  other coach, Roger Gunderson, will also get the team ready for the contest with  a series of tests and drills, throwing out questions at random.  </P> <P> "What's the theme of 'The Great Gatsby?' " Gunderson barked out at a recent  team meeting.  </P> <P> With little hesitation, senior student Mike Lee, 17, responded: "Gatsby's  desire to recapture the past."  </P> <P> At the study session, the students also quizzed each other in their specialty  -- American Indian history, the subject that helped earn them the state title  -- and in other subjects, using textbooks and loose-leaf notebooks so large  that they could have held designs for nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> But despite the enormous volume of information they memorize, the three juniors  and six seniors on the team are no more intimidated by the championship than  they would be about a pop quiz, if their attitude and demeanor is an  indication.  </P> <P> "My friends are more excited that I am, really," Jay Kim, 16, a junior, said at  a recent team meeting.  </P> <P> "Our parents are ecstatic," added team captain Jeff McCombs, 18, a senior. "My  parents are more excited than me."  </P> <P> After all, it's not as if the team hasn't won before. The school has won the  Orange County competition for four years running. In this year's contest, as  McCombs proudly pointed out, at the junior-senior level, "we had the largest  margin of victory ever -- 3,700 points."  </P> <P> And at the state championship in Bakersfield, Laguna Hills scored 45,361  points. The closest of the also-rans, El Camino High, fell 572 points short.  </P> <P> Based on those performances, Laguna Hills -- the first team from Orange County  to win the state championship in 11 years -- has been ranked second in the  nation. "Texas is ranked No. 1 in the country," McCombs said.  </P> <P> But Julian Kingston, 17, quickly chimed in: "They're not going to be ranked No.  1 for long!"  </P> <P> Jeff DeWit, a 17-year-old senior, added that the team does not feel at all  intimidated by the team from Texas or any of the other participants. "In every  competition, we've been a first-place team," he said. "I think we're the ones  intimidating other people."  </P> <P> Gunderson and Lane, who have put in hundreds of extracurricular hours to  prepare the team for the championships, were also confident in their team.  "They have the will, spirit and determination to win," Lane said.  </P> <P> OK, so everybody's confident. But doesn't the team fear the national exposure  or the expectations of parents or the burden of upholding the school tradition  of championship academic decathlon teams?  </P> <P> "I think we thrive on pressure," Kim said.  </P> <P> In that case, Kim should enjoy the national championship, because there will be  no shortage of pressure. The first day of the brain-bending competition starts  with an essay-writing contest, followed by personal interviews in which  students are judged by their off-the-cuff answers.  </P> <P> Kim predicted that he will do well in the interview segment, even though  there's no way to prepare for it. The judges "ask questions about your  activities, your future plans, your character, your personality," Kim said.  "They can ask you anything."  </P> <P> The interview segment is followed by a speech competition, in which contestants  are judged on their oratory.  </P> <P> The second day begins with morning-long testing in social science, science,  mathematics, economics, language, literature and fine arts. The competition  ends with a high-pressure "super quiz," a two-hour question session in which  teams compete against each other. Day Three is devoted to awards presentations.  </P> <P> The team is grouped into three levels, based on grade-point average. McCombs,  Kim and junior Ryan Sakamoto, 16, are in the "A" group. The "B" group consists  of Lee, junior Todd Faurot, 16, and senior Jack Dietz, 17. Kingston, DeWit and  senior Bill Fischer, 17, are in the "C" group. No girls signed up for the team  this year, though girls have competed on previous Laguna Hills teams.  </P> <P> The team is confident because each member is skilled in different disciplines.  For example, Faurot excels in fine arts -- "He's one of the best piano players  I've ever seen," Kim said -- while Lee does best in the super quiz segment and  essay writing, in which he was ranked first in the state. DeWit said he is best  in the speech competition, while Dietz boasts medals from the state competition  in math and science.  </P> <P> Faurot said the whole team takes advantage of cumulative knowledge through  question-and-answer drills and testing.  </P> <P> "What one person knows, everybody should know," he said. "The biggest reason  for our success is we put the team ahead of ourselves."  </P></p>

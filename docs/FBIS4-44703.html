			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nicola Siegmund-Schultze: "Microbes Eat Up </F> Explosive Materials -- Scientists Test Methods of Biological  Soil Remediation on Military Site"]    [Text] "Zuendhuetle," meaning ignition cap, is the name of  a residential area in Karlsruhe, and not without reason:  Percussion caps, detonator caps and munitions for civilian  weapons were manufactured here right up to the seventies. New  apartments were built on parts of the factory site in the  eighties. Today, the citizens there are wondering whether they  may have built on poisoned land. Although the competent  authorities knew what the site was formerly used for, they did  not remove potential risks due to pollutant residues before  allowing the land to be built on. Not until the beginning of  the nineties did they start a systematic investigation.    The "Zuendhuetle" is only one of many examples of how slowly  the awareness of the dangers of military legacies develops. "In  the old German laender, people started to make a record of  weapons waste at the beginning of the eighties; in the new  laender they did not start until the reunification," stated  Manfred Kurka from the Federal Environment Office in Berlin  recently at a symposium on "Military wastes" in Offenbach. By  the summer of last year, the authority had identified more than  4,000 "suspect sites" of weapons wastes and informed the German  laender accordingly.    There are still no uniform criteria throughout the laender  for assessing pollution with weapon-specific hazardous  substances. Not even the term "weapons waste" has been defined  consistently throughout the laender. The development of  techniques for cleaning up these legacies in an environmentally  acceptable manner is likewise in its infancy.    Explosives are a particular problem. Trinitro- and  dinitrotoluene (TNT, DNT) are frequently used. DNT is extremely  harmful to the blood, and can cause cancer in the long term, as  can the degradation products of TNT. Whenever these substances  occurred in their pure form, as in munitions residues on former  training grounds, they were often burnt in the open air,  resulting in contaminated soil and ground water. According to  Kruka, the only environmentally acceptable way of incinerating  the material is currently being tested by Buck in Pinnow near  Berlin.    The situation is even more complicated when the substances  have contaminated the soil, as in Hallschlag near Daun in the  Eifel, where explosives were once manufactured. Right up to  1987, cows were still grazing on the former works site. It is  now known that about 80,000 cubic meters of soil are  contaminated. In many places beneath the grass, the  nitrotoluenes reach such high concentrations that there could be  explosions if drilling were carried out for testing or  remediation purposes. Pure explosive is to be found there in  some places.    Microbes could be extraordinarily helpful in dealing with  the  explosive inheritance. Certain types of bacteria of the  pseudomonas strain, and also azotobacteriaceen, both natural  soil dwellers, can thrive on TNT and DNT as a source of carbon  and nitrogen. They degrade the explosive and convert it to  composites from which they obtain energy or synthesize vital  molecules. Toxic degradation products (metabolites) may,  however, also be produced.  <H5>  Attack by Bacteria </H5>   Andre Dahn, an engineer at Berlin-Consult GmbH, and Peter  Koehler from the analytical center of Forgenta in Berlin,  presented a process at the congress with which even highly  contaminated soils can probably be decontaminated by chemical  and biological means in the future. Initially, they render the  toluene water-soluble by treating the material with chemicals,  namely a strong base, and heating it. As a result, the  dangerous substances are altered to such an extent that  bacterial degradation is possible, from which no toxic  substances are expected. The cooled solution is ready for  attack by bacteria.    Mixed bacteria populations are used -- including the  explosives consumers -- which survive partly with and partly  without oxygen (aerobic and anaerobic). It is useful to use  such mixed populations because they often form stable  communities and require only few additional nutrients. After  the anaerobic reaction phase which precedes the aerobic phase,  the researchers noticed during the experiment that just under 70  percent of the pollutants had already been decomposed. As yet,  however, there are no test results for the biological process as  a whole. The Federal Environment Office considers the process  to be promising. It is currently being optimized with a view to  being used in Hallschlag.    A research group from Braunschweig Technical College is also  considering micro-organisms for environmentally acceptable toxic  waste remediation. At the Institute for Microbiology, Martin  Wittmaier is working with colleagues on the question of how  organic, aromatic hydrocarbons -- benzene, xylene, or toluene --  but also highly chlorinated composites and mineral oils can be  disposed of biologically in situ.    Substances like these can occur and pollute soils and ground  water wherever vehicles and machines are maintained and  repaired, for example, on troop exercise sites. The  Braunschweig-based scientists want to exploit the natural  self-cleaning potential of the soil. To this end, efforts are  being made to promote the growth of those microorganisms that  are capable of decomposing pollutants in the earth but for which  the earth does not provide the ideal conditions for propagation.    Their metabolism is specifically activated, for example, by  introducing certain nutrients or gases by means of pipes (wells)  inserted vertically in the soil. The microbes then multiply and  destroy the substances to be removed. In this way, high rates  of decontamination have been achieved in experiments. A plant  installed on the site with which the area of a solvent recycling  company was cleaned up achieved pollutant degradation levels of  more than 99 percent. Such remediation measures do, however,  take time. Depending on the degree of contamination, the process  may take months or years.    The ecological damage by toxic military waste will be a  matter of increasing concern for the government and laender in  the years to come. The troops of the former Soviet Union are  leaving behind "massive environmental damage" on their 1,026  sites, according to initial research by Christina Sussbauer from  the Free University of Berlin. She criticizes mainly the  agreement to offset the value of the buildings and land against  the environmental damage. As there is no financial inducement  to hand over land "in a clean state," harmful substances and  munitions were just left. Disorderly scrap heaps were created  and drums with oil and other pollutants were simply thrown away  -- adding daily to the new toxic waste.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug issues strong Pharmaceutical stocks were strong ahead of an announcement, after the London market had closed, that SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome had products recommended for approval in the US. SmithKline announced that the US Food and Drug Administration had given initial approval to Kytril, the company's anti-nausea treatment for cancer patients. Kytril competes with the Glaxo product Zofran and is expected to achieve sales above Pounds 80m this year. Approval will be a relief to the company, which had problems with its application earlier this year. US sales could add a further Pounds 30m to Pounds 80m depending on the precise guidelines for use. Wellcome received initial approval for a lung cancer drug. SmithKline rose 4 to 381p, Glaxo gained 6 1/2 at 695p and Wellcome added a penny at 635p ahead of its annual meeting today. Standard Chartered, one of the bank sector's and market's best performers in recent weeks, endured a turbulent session as the market reacted violently to suggestions of bad news on profit margins in its Far Eastern business. The news, sourced from a routine press conference given by Standard's general manager in Hong Kong, quickly filtered into the London market, where Standard shares plunged from an opening 1194p to a low point of 1038p. However, some soothing comments from Standard officials in London, who sought to emphasise that the Hong Kong manager's statement had been misconstrued and was not specifically about Standard Chartered, saw the share price recover strongly to close a net 16 off at 1179p, and 'bid only', according to marketmakers. Suggestions that Land Securities may be lining up a big property acquisition failed to help the share price, which fell victim to profit-taking following the stock's recent impressive run. The deal, said to be worth Pounds 125m, is believed to involve some 120 properties from a wide variety of high yielding sites owned by Royal Insurance. Land shares - which began the year at just 444p - fell 8 to 784p, but turnover was relatively moderate. Two other property groups were undermined by talk of directors' share sales, with British Land slipping 3 to 428p and Frogmore Estates down 12 at 499p. Meanhwile, London Industrial, which specialises in light industrial properties, made its market debut at 320p. The shares were well received and closed 16 ahead at 336p. The two English power generators delivered exceptionally strong performances, responding to a statement from Offer, the electricity industry regulator, that it may not recommend a referral of the companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Offer said it wanted an agreement with the generators on more competition in the industry by the sale of some existing generation plants, and assurances on prices for a reasonable period until a more competitive market is achieved. Dealers said the market was looking for an agreement between the companies and the regulator and that such an agreement would trigger another substantial uprating for the shares. National Power reached a peak 453p before ending 13 ahead at 449 1/2 p after turnover of 11m. PowerGen raced forward to an all-time high of 511p before closing 9 up at 509p on 5.1m dealt. A big US seller took Reuters Holdings to a day's low of 1731p as the price reacted to a sharp fall on Tuesday night in New York. When the stock had been offloaded, the shares rallied to end 16 down at 1736p. International conglomerate Hanson advanced 5 to 268 1/2 p as the group said its US coal subsidiaries hit by the recent national coal strike would start production again within the next few days. Shares in RMC, the construction industry group, jumped 26 to 930p as marketmakers were gripped by a stock shortage. Forte appreciated 10 to 258p as hopes rose that its Ital-ian venture with Ciga will fight off challenges from other hoteliers. Maligned supermarket stocks continued their quiet march back to respectable levels, having been heavily sold during the spate of recent pre-Christmas price war stories. Yesterday, one leading food retail analyst said: 'Some investors are realising that the price competition is not as aggressive as they were led to believe.' All the leading stocks made good gains, with J. Sainsbury up 9 at 440p, Tesco 9 at 213 1/2 p, Kwik Save 18 at 570p and Argyll 6 1/2 at 268p. Food manufacturers were also strong, but Tate &amp; Lyle, amid market concern over the glut of corn in the US market, slipped 3 to 396p. A profits warning from Pentos sent the shares plummeting 8 1/2 to 26p. Newspaper publisher Daily Mail &amp; General Trust gained smartly after reporting a 74 per cent profits rise and a nine-for-one bonus issue to improve marketability of its shares. The 'A' stock rose 612p to Pounds 115.12. Publisher Dorling Kindersley slid 89 to 221p after issuing a profits warning and announcing the resignation of its managing director.</p>

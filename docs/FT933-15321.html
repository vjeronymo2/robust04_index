			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / University teachers' union censured on election THE ASSOCIATION of University Teachers will almost certainly have to rerun the election for its general secretary's post after a finding by the Certification Office, the official union watchdog, that the election was improperly conducted. Mr David Triesman, who took up his post with the 31,000-strong union in February, beat Dr Peter Borcherds in a ballot last December by just 276 votes. Following complaints by Dr Borcherds about the conduct of the election, an internal AUT inquiry discovered that about 500 part-time staff working for the Open University were probably not sent ballot papers. Dr Borcherds' complaints were also investigated by the Certification Office, which yesterday published its findings. It said that 'the AUT failed to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that every person entitled to vote in that election was given the opportunity to do so', as required by law. Two other complaints from Dr Borcherds were rejected. The Certification Office does not have the power to take the AUT to court, but its findings could be used to take legal action in an attempt to force the union to rerun the ballot. The AUT is taking legal advice but is likely to decide to pre-empt any legal action by rerunning the ballot. Mr John Monks, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, now seems certain to be elected general secretary at the annual congress in September. Nominations do not close until July 19, but Mr Monks - who would take over from Mr Norman Willis - has already secured more than half the nominations from unions for the post.</p>

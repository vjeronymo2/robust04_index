			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: June Moon HERE'S a twist: not another musical to lift downcast spirits during the recession, but a well turned play about creating popular music which both enables the cast to enjoy a song and dance finale and the audience to leave the theatre smiling. June Moon was the only collaboration between Ring Lardner and George S Kaufman and was a Broadway hit during the Great American Depression. It surfaces brightly at Hampstead with hopes of a West End transfer and its snappy dialogue, racy characters, and boy gets girl plot are all in its favour. Fred (charmingly played by Adam Godley) is an aspiring lyric writer from Schenectady. On the Pullman train to New York he meets Edna (Maria Gough) who is his perfect match in naivety and ordinariness. With the lovelight in his eyes, Fred suddenly realises that June rhymes with moon, and, can you believe it, so does spoon. Edna helpfully adds macaroon. Fred is a Holy Fool, totally in tune with popular taste, and 'June Moon' is an instant hit. But Tin Pan Alley is a treacherous place and Fred's innocence is threatened by Eileen (Susannah Fellows) who knows how to spend his advance. With the help of the wise cracking Maxie (Frank Lazarus) who plays Cupid, the plot twists to a happy ending. What lifts June Moon above an enjoyable PG Wodehouse style yarn is the setting. Tin Pan Alley in 1929 was a factory at full capacity, with song writers in their cubicles churning out songs like 'Ain't Misbehavin', 'Singin' in the Rain' along with many hundreds more that never made it. Lardner and Kaufman lay bare the hard cheerless graft of it all, with Paul (Neil McCaul) living off the glory of his one hit 'Paprika' and the aspiring Benny (Clive Walton) playing his novelty number 'Hello Tokyo' to the window cleaner for want of an audience. Behind the optimistic numbers and the sentimental numbers, the marriages of the writers crack up and the power of the publisher corrupts. Designer Michael Holt, helped by a revolve, makes the tiny Hampstead stage seem quite spacious. Godley, all nervous body language and guilless charm, is a good foil to the New York sophisticates, and Lazarus, the in-house pianist, has all the best lines. 'The tune's easy to remember and if you forget, it doesn't make any difference' is his laid back reaction to most new songs. Director Alan Strachan has effectively scaled down June Moon to a chamber musical play. There seemed to be plenty of moist eyes to go with the lifted spirits at the end, which should be a winning combination. Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage Centre, London NW3, (071) 722 9301</p>

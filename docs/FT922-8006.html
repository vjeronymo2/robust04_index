			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Oxford United goes green A company which runs protection programmes for tropical rain forests and non-human primates is the new owner of Oxford United Football Club. Biomass Recycling has bought the 89.5 per cent stake in the club previously owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell from Buchler Phillips, the receivers of his private estate. Mr Tim Midgley, a Biomass director, said one of the aims would be to create 'an ecologically benign stadium'. For example, solar panels in the roofs of the stands could charge batteries to run the floodlights. With thousands of fans coming through the turnstiles each week, the stadium would demonstrate the sustainable use of materials and energy. It was a way of promoting the Biomass ethic, which also included community involvement. 'We started as a group of conservationists 15 years ago and felt we could have a major impact on the rain forest and its sustainable use.' But with so much forest still being cut down, 'we realised that we also had to do it by education.' Oxford United is set to move out of its cramped five-acre Manor Road ground in Headington. Mr Midgley said that although the club had come close to being put into administration, it was operating profitably. 'it does not have debts as such, but it has several legal problems over several sums of money.' Mr Peter Phillips, the receiver, said that although the club was only a small part of the estate, it had taken 700 man hours to sort out the sale. He said the chasing of Mr Maxwell's assets was 'like putting a jigsaw together when you have no picture on the box.'</p>

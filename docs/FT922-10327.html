			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Bosnian battles dim hopes for talks RIVAL leaders of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday remained locked in conflict in European Community-sponsored talks in Lisbon as fighting again shook the republic. Up to 20 people were reported killed early in the day in bomb attacks which destroyed the road and rail bridges across the river Sava separating Bosnia and Croatia in the town of Brcko. Nobody claimed responsibility for the bridge explosions, the worst in eight weeks of conflict in Bosnia. Sarajevo, the capital, endured one of its worst bombardments of the war in the early hours when at least two people were killed. Sarajevo radio also reported fighting in several other towns and said three people had been killed in shelling overnight in the southwestern city of Mostar. In Lisbon, a Portuguese official said round-table talks between the Serb, Croat and Moslem delegations appeared unlikely in the short term. Bilateral talks between the EC and the three delegations were being hampered by accusation and counter-accusation as well as events on the ground. On the diplomatic front, Mr Marrack Goulding, United Nations under-secretary general, is expected to arrive in Bosnia at the weekend to assess the feasibility of deploying a peacekeeping force there. In Helsinki, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe welcomed Bosnia as its 52nd member, while allowing Yugoslavia to retain its seat for the time being. 'Fifty states expressed their clear understanding that the presence of Yugoslavia does not mean any solution as far as the question of succession is concerned,' a spokesman said. EC foreign ministers will discuss fresh action to force Serbia to put down its guns and negotiate a peaceful division of Yugoslavia when they meet in northern Portugal today. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister who will chair the meeting, has proposed isolating Serbia diplomatically and freezing Yugoslav assets abroad unless it pulls the Yugoslav federal army out of both Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. He said that unless Belgrade withdrew the Serb-led army from these two war-torn republics, the EC should not recognise the new smaller state of Yugoslavia which Serbia declared with its ally Montenegro on Monday. Such international recognition appears to be the main diplomatic weapon against Serbia at the moment. 'It all boils down to whether Mr Milosevic (Serbia's president) cares enough about recognition to bring peace to Bosnia,' said a western diplomat. The fighting has left at least 350 people dead and some 420,000 have fled their homes.</p>

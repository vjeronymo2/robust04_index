			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament  today refused to include an amendment bill to the Penal Code in  the agenda of its current session. The amendment recommends  that Articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the  head of state be abolished. Sixty-four deputies from the total  of 140 present voted for inclusion of the bill. Seventy  deputies were against and six abstained.    On Wednesday [2 February], the Slovak Government approved  the  deputy-drafted amendment bill, in light of recommendations by  two organisations for the protection of human rights -- Amnesty  International and the Helsinki Committee.    The parliamentary opposition says the draft amendment has  not  been completed. It considers the government's striving for  quick passage of the amendment to be an effort to acquit an  active member of the government Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), the state secretary of the Privatisation  Ministry, Ivan Lexa, who is being prosecuted for defamation of  the head of state, President Michal Kovac.</p>

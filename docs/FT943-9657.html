			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / EU ruling bans 'soya milk' from food labels The term 'soya milk' should be dropped in the UK because its dairy connotations are 'confusing', a European Union committee has decreed. The ruling that anything sold as milk should be a dairy product comes in spite of the EU's 1989 acceptance that products can be sold as cream crackers, butter beans and lemon cheese even if they do not contain cream, butter or cheese. The Ministry of Agriculture announced ruefully yesterday that Britain had been outvoted by 10 to one, with one abstention - the Republic of Ireland - on the EU's milk management committee. Soya milk manufacturers, whose sales amount to only Pounds 10m a year compared with Pounds 3.3bn for the dairy milk market, will have to find a new name for their product, said Mr Michael Jack, junior agriculture minister. Britain argued that 'soya milk' should be allowed under the EU's 1989 dairy designation regulations because it was a well-known name in the UK. But other member states, apparently led by France, the Netherlands and Germany, thought otherwise. Soya milk is a substitute for those who cannot tolerate dairy milk or prefer not to drink it. The Health Food Manufacturers' Association responded to the decision with fury, dismissing the alternative 'soya drink', widely used on the continent, as 'nondescript'. 'It is outrageous that we should be forced to apply what seems to us to be a misleading description to a product of great value to a minority,' said Mr Maurice Hanssen, president. 'Here is surely a case where subsidiarity can be applied and the manufacturers allowed to continue to name their product in as effective a way as do coconut milk producers, which is of course a permitted designation.' The National Dairy Council questioned whether consumers were really confused by soya milk. 'We think the consumer is a bit brighter than that,' it said.</p>

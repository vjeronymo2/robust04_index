			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Bosch cuts pay rises in attempt to reduce staff costs BOSCH, the German electrical, electronics and motor components maker, is to cut pay increases agreed with its domestic workforce in an attempt to reduce costs. Uhde, a chemical plant manufacturer, is to 'export' jobs to foreign plants with the same aim in view. The moves reflect the crushing impact of recession on German industry, which is now running out of 'easy' options in its search for payroll economies. Hundreds of companies have introduced early retirement schemes and stopped hiring replacements for leavers. However, the cost-saving potential of natural wastage is virtually exhausted in many sectors. Compulsory redundancy is almost unknown in Germany, and employers are searching for other means to economise. Announcing a 'first step' at the weekend, Bosch said it would pay a 3 per cent pay increase, agreed with the IG Metall union last year, and due to take effect on April 1. However, the rise would apply only to national basic pay levels. Other payments would be excluded from the calculation, the group said. Non-union employees, who were awarded a pay increase last autumn, would be asked to show 'solidarity' and take a 3 per cent pay cut from the same date. Management had already agreed to 'considerable' salary reductions. According to early estimates, the measures would save around DM250m (Pounds 106m) in a full year, the company added. Bosch, which slipped into operating losses in the second half of 1992, said at the weekend that improvement was unlikely this year. 'Negative economic developments and increasing competitive pressure have led to a considerable drop in profits and damaged international competitiveness,' a statement noted. The group has shed 12,000 workers worldwide in the last 14 months, and some 24,000 employees are now currently on short-time rotas. The weekend action followed unsuccessful negotiations with workers' representatives at group level in which management sought voluntary cuts on a range of extras and bonuses including 25-year service awards, lunch subsidies, nursing care and spa cures. At Uhde, a subsidiary of chemicals giant Hoechst, management announced a switch of manufacturing strategy in which only 40 per cent of its 3,000-strong workforce would in future be employed in Germany, compared with 60 per cent at present. Mr Lothar Jaeschke, chief executive, said the costs of employing an engineer in India, for example, were between 50 per cent and 80 per cent lower than in Germany. German pay strikes loom, Page 3</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (14): Try the new wines - Competition among the wine bars has hotted up THE FRENCH will probably never forgive them for the congenital misfortune of being British, but even the snooty Gault Millau guide has been forced to admit, albeit very grudgingly, that Mark Williamson and Tim Johnstone run one of the very best wine bars in Paris. Willi's, their wine bar, on rue des Petits-Champs between the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Palais Royal is now a firm fixture on the Parisian wine scene. Williamson and Johnstone, both of whom worked in the English wine trade before setting up Willi's in 1980, scour the Rhone valley, Bourdeaux and vineyards in further flung places, California, Australia and even Italy, for new wines. At first glance it looks as though they must have been crazy - to think that the French would buy wine, and even food, from two Brits. But Tim Johnstone says that when they hatched their original plan to open Willi's in the late 1970s, they were convinced there was a gap in the market - 'at the time there just weren't any really good wine bars around,' he says. Times have changed and competition has hotted up. Nicolas, the chain of wine shops, has opened a string of L'Ecluse wine bars all over the city. L'Ecluse specialises in Bourdeaux wines, selling everything up to Grands Crus, and serves perfectly palatable salads, fish dishes, foie gras and San Daniele. L'Ecluse is a chain, but its choice of prettily renovated bistros, means that it avoids the antiseptic feel of most of the 'corporate' cafes in Paris. Its wine bars are also among the few places where it is really nice to eat in the very touristy areas, such as the one on quai des Grands-Augustins along the Left Bank by place Saint-Michel. Anyone with more traditional taste should head for Le Rallye on rue Daguerre in the 14th arrondissement, which has been in the hands of the Peret family for three generations, and does, or so they say, sell the best Beaujolais in Paris with a choice of 200 bottles. Devotees of Loire wines may prefer La Cafe de la Nouvelle Marie on rue des Fosses-Saint-Jacques by the Sorbonne, where you can sit out in the leafy square on sunny days. La Sancerre on avenue Rapp by the Eiffel Tower specialises, as its name suggests, in Sancerre wines. La Cloche des Halles on rue Coquilliere by the Les Halles shopping centre is a classic bustling bistro, packed with chattering Parisians which serves hearty food and good wines, bottled on the premises. Meanwhile Le Forum on boulevard Malesherbes by the Madeleine is the classic Parisian bar with its Art Deco decor, little plates of olives and nuts, a choice of 150 (killer) cocktails and its very enigmatic clientele. La Cloche and Le Forum are favourite haunts of the Willi's team, Mark Williamson and Tim Johnstone, when they are checking out the competition. Johnstone also recommends Ange Vin on rue Richard Lenoir in the Bastille district for 'really good, very cheap wines' and 'a cheerful atmosphere', or Le Moulin a Vin on rue Burq, north of the Pigalle sex district, which he describes as 'a funky place with down-to-earth food and a good choice of wine.'</p>

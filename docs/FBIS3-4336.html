The ceremony, presided over by Vice President Li Yuan-zu on  behalf of President Li Teng-hui was witnessed by more than 100  guests, including National Defense Minister Sun Chen and Admiral  Liu Ho-chien, chief of the general staff.    "The purpose of strengthening our military power is for  defense, not offense. It is for sustaining peace, not for  provoking war," Li said.    Construction of the warship, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted  Ching dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990.    The first frigate went into service last May and the last  one  is scheduled to begin service by October 1999.    The eight 4,200-ton frigates, which will eventually cost the  Navy more than NT [new Taiwan] $40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are  to replace part of the Navy's aging fleet. According to the  International Institute for Strategic Studies, the ROC Navy had  24 destroyers and nine frigates as of the end of 1992.    Taiwan also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy  16  Lafayette-class frigates from France.    With a maximum speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour, each  of  the frigates will be armed with locally-manufactured Hsiung-feng  ship- to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, anti  submarine torpedoes, and a Phalanx weapons system built by the  General Dynamics Corp. of the United States.</p>

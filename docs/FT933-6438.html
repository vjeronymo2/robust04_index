			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / BASF and Bayer see no European recovery this year TWO of Europe's biggest chemical companies warned yesterday that there was no prospect of economic recovery in Europe this year. BASF of Germany, reporting a halving of profits for the first half of the year, said: 'We do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the second half of 1993.' Bayer of Germany, reporting a 25 per cent profits fall for the same period, said: 'There is no prospect of an economic recovery in Europe.' BASF said that in Germany, it was unlikely the recession would bottom out before the middle of next year. Worldwide, said Dr Jurgen Strube, BASF chairman, 'we do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the second half of 1993'. However, he said, there should be a slow upturn in the US. 'Following the United Kingdom, the economy in other western countries will also improve gradually in 1994,' he said. 'From 1994 onwards, slowly at first, we expect business to revive.' He warned of continuing job losses. 'We will continue to reduce employment by around 4 or 5 per cent a year in the group, and by more in Germany.' Productivity at the group's main German complex at Ludwigshafen had risen 13 per cent in the past three years. However, this had been largely eroded by the rise in the D-Mark. 'Increases in wage costs in Germany cannot be accepted,' said Dr Strube. On a day when the Bundesbank defied expectations by refusing to relax interest rates, Dr Strube defended German monetary policy. 'There is a need for additional financial discipline in Germany,' he said. 'Germany requires capital to invest in eastern Germany, and has to finance a growing burden of public debt. The Bundesbank has little room for manoeuvre.' Referring to the overcapacity of Europe's petrochemicals industry, Dr Strube said BASF had less need to reduce capacity than others. He defended the group's decision to build a large new ethylene cracker at Antwerp, saying its output would be largely used within BASF itself. He expected ethylene plants to be shut in Italy and the UK early next year. Details, Page 19</p>

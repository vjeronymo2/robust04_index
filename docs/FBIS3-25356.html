Our colleague, Braimah Camara, who is back from town  after an on-the-spot assessment, reports.    [Camara] High school and university students have indeed  ransacked some areas of the capital. Groups of students  attacked basic education Minister Adama Samassekou's residence  and the external wall was partially broken down. In  Lafiabougou, the residence of our colleague Daouda Tekete,  technical adviser to the basic education minister, was  completely ransacked and burned down together with the furniture  and equipment inside it. Still in Lafiabougou, Mrs. Tekete's  private clinic was ransacked. The villa where the clinic is  located was seriously damaged and working instruments carried  away. Tension was very high this morning at the ADEMA [Alliance  for Democracy in Mali] headquarters in Bamako III. Here ADEMA  youth met spontaneously at the party headquarters and some  articles were broken. The ECHO newspaper building was visited  by a handful of students who were forced to give up in the face  of the workers' determination to preserve their equipment.  According to evidence we managed to gather there, some students  tried again to attack the Cheick Anta Diop High School owned by  Professor Cheikna Modi Cissoko and here they ran into a  contingent of security forces. This is what we were able to  observe this morning in the capital.</p>

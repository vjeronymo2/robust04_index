			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 8 May (INA) -- Under the headline "A  Viewpoint on Yemen's Events", the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  published an editorial today. It says: No one imagined that  matters would lead to a war in this way, as if the war was  taking place among enemies, when they are, in fact, brothers.    In its editorial today by Barzan al-Tikriti, the newspaper  adds: Just as the majority [words indistinct] the declaration of  unity, this saddening and painful event was not expected to take  place between brothers in the way we see and hear from the mass  media.    The writer explained in his article that what is taking  place  could be viewed as a result of a relationship between two  contradictory regimes that were placed within a framework of  unity about which many people seeking or opposing the concept of  unity voiced their doubts.    AL-JUMHURIYAH points out in its editorial that what has  caused the all-out war is that some people view the concept of  unity as something that should be complete, or should lead to a  destructive, all-out war as the only alternative. This is, of  course, wrong in the view of everyone who honestly wants unity    The editorial says that in order to make unity true and to  guarantee it, the people should, before the leaders and  officials, believe in it, understand it, and adhere to it.  This, the newspaper says, will prevent differences among  officials from affecting, threatening, and undermining unity.</p>

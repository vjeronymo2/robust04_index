			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>   [Text] Donetsk April 15 TASS -- Contrary to all pessimistic  forecasts, Ukraine has elected a new Supreme Soviet  (parliament). A total of 337 deputies were elected as a result  of the voting, extended for two weeks. This is quite enough for  the parliament to start working. Elections were recognised as  invalid in 113 constituencies, and run-off elections will be  held there.    It is clear already that the hegemony of the nationalistic  ideology of the Rukh party in Ukraine was dealt a crushing blow.  The fact that more than one third of deputies belong to the bloc  of the left-wing forces (86 communists, 14 socialists and 18  members of the Peasants' Party) is not the most important of  all. There is another thing which is even more important: The  elections showed vividly that the left-bank and right-bank parts  of Ukraine have different concepts of the country's future.    The industrially developed eastern regions of Ukraine  demonstrated most convincingly what they want: The overwhelming  majority of their residents voted for representatives of  left-wing parties and movements and for industrial managers. No  one could forecast the tremendous defeat suffered by  national-radicals in the biggest regions of Ukraine. The  Donetsk and Lugansk regions sent left-wing deputies to  parliament and strengthened their anti- nationalistic stand by  the results of local referendums. The Donets coal basin  (Donbass) voted unambiguously for the equality of the Russian  and Ukrainian languages, for Ukraine's joining of the CIS and  its interparliamentary assembly, as well as for the federal  setup of Ukraine. It remains to be seen whether or not deputies  from the eastern regions of Ukraine will manage to prove in  parliament the expediency of their attitude to those problems.    This is not going to be easy, however. Vyacheslav Chornovil,  leader of the people's Rukh party, stated point-blank on the  second day after the elections that his party, which got 38  seats in parliament, intended to further oppose both Ukraine's  joining of the CIS and the equality of the two languages in the  independent Ukraine. Observers do not rule out a possibility of  a split in the new parliament according to the territorial  principle. Many people believe that the first session,  scheduled for mid-May, will be held in an atmosphere of  anti-Russian and anti-communist hysteria, because the western  regions of Ukraine again sent to parliament, together with  popular fighters for the independent Ukraine, several members of  UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National  Self-Defense], which is an openly fascist organisation.  National- radicals do not conceal their intention to give a  "farewell performance" on April 22 and to use the last session  of the current Supreme Soviet for setting the tone for the  speeches of their successors. However, a political debate will  hardly be long in the new parliament, because this will be  mortally dangerous for the Ukrainian economy, nearly brought to  a standstill, and for the destitute Ukrainian population.</p>

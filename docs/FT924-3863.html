			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords' revolt over fishing to stand EARL HOWE, the junior fisheries minister, made it clear yesterday that the government would not seek to overturn a move by the House of Lords last month to ensure that the government considered a more extensive scheme for de-commissioning fishing boats before limiting time at sea. Privately, however, ministers believe that the requirement, forced on them by a Tory revolt, will not unduly tie their hands. The bill will complete its passage through parliament next week.</p>

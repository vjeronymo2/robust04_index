			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: A Union that frustrates and provokes an unreasonable argument (1) Sir, Joe Rogaly's article, 'Scotland the grave' (February 25) is the best explanation I have yet come across as to why the Conservative party clings to the retention of the Union in its present form. John Major's argument at the weekend that, collectively, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together are far greater than the sum of their parts has to be taken with a large measure of salt. As the article points out, it is largely the English who hold to a misplaced sense of superiority on the world stage - something perpetuated by Mrs Thatcher, and subsequently by Mr Major. Oh, the ether of power] As a Scot, l have been continually frustrated by the UK's actions in being the main brake on greater European integration. The Scottish Nationalists have struck a strong chord when they say that they wish to attain independence for Scotland within Europe. I feel that our aspirations as a nation could be better satisfied within a federal Europe, instead of clinging to a past that was great but is irrelevant in the face of new challenges confronting us all. Last, and on a lighter note, a possible name for the three Independent Celtic States would be the Commonwealth of Celtic Countries (CCC). Roy Lawson, Flat 3, 26 Ongar Road, London SW6 1SJ</p>

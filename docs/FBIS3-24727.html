A special IFP general conference in Ulundi on Sunday  rejected the 1993 interim constitution but resolved to "pursue  every last opportunity to seek agreement in negotiations", and  mandated Inkatha's Central Committee to take a final decision on  the April poll.    IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi told the conference on  Sunday he had spoken earlier to State President F W de Klerk who  had assured him he would do all he could to arrive at an all  inclusive constitutional settlement. Mr Buthelezi had told the  president he did not want to "shut the door" and that  negotiations should continue and "take their course".    He told a media conference later, however, that it would  take  "almost a miracle" for an acceptable agreement within the next  few days, echoing the views of one of his top negotiators,  Walter Felgate, who described the latest ANC [African National  Congress] proposals to break the constitutional impasse as an  "insult to our intelligence". The IFP would continue last-ditch  negotiations with the African National Congress and the  government on Monday and had only 10 days to make a final  decision on elections after Mr De Klerk had proclaimed the  election date -- probably on Monday -- explained Mr Buthelezi.    Party negotiators Dr Ben Ngubane and Mr Joe Matthews flew to  Pretoria on Sunday morning to prepare for the talks.    The IFP conference stood fast on the Freedom Alliance  proposals to have the constitution amended and instructed  Inkatha's Central Committee to receive a final report from its  negotiators for review. It would also review achievements in  negotiations on the Zulu monarchy. It further resolved to seek  common cause with the Pan Africanist Congress on objection to a  single ballot and would try to bring in the Democratic Party and  others opposed to this system of voting. The IFP leader made it  clear that this was one of the major stumbling blocks to his  party's participation in elections. The IFP's other main  constitutional demands include greater regional autonomy and the  right for provinces to draw up their own constitutions and for  these to be constitutionally entrenched.    Earlier, IFP negotiator Walter Felgate warned the deadline  for a settlement was midnight on Monday but said there was still  time for the African National Congress and the government to  "come to their senses". Mr Felgate was a strong force behind an  election boycott, charging on Saturday that negotiations would  not deliver for the IFP. He also branded government chief  negotiator Roelf Meyer a "liar".    Leading the anti-election stance was IFP President  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi who on Saturday told a few thousand delegates the  interim constitution was "specifically designed to promote ANC  power and was an instrument for the IFP's destruction".    Mr Buthelezi told the media conference on Sunday that his  party had more to lose than any other by boycotting elections  but laughed at predictions that the IFP would be relegated to  the political wilderness by adopting this stance. The IFP  leader said his party would resort to "resistance" politics but  this would be non-violent.    Mr Buthelezi on Saturday, said he would not subject his  supporters to a constitution which was "totally wrong for South  Africa", adding while he had never rejected the notion of  reconciliation with the ANC, "this constitution as it now stands  is an arena for a struggle to the finish".    "Within its provisions there is no scope for constitutional  or political settlements," he said.</p>

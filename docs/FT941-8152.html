			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Capable of producing from the ground up - The loss of its Japanese partner does not necessarily present a significant setback for the UK carmaker A critical question faces Rover Group. How will it survive without Honda's technology and expertise in the wake of their failed relationship? Rover has 2,000 design, development and engineering staff. It has the capability to take a car from first concept on a computer screen to production, with no outside help. This capability includes the design, development and production of engines and gearboxes. Senior Rover executives insist that this capability has not been utilised to the full during the period of Rover's 15-year partnership with Honda, for straightforward commercial reasons rather than for any lack of technical ability. There is no logic, they maintain, in Rover developing wholly separate vehicles or powertrains for market slots that can be occupied perfectly adequately by shared development models enjoying good economies of scale. And Rover's full technical capability will in any case be amply demonstrated in new, as-yet secret, models already scheduled for production and in which Honda has played no part, according to Mr John Towers, Rover's chief executive. That such core expertise has been retained by Rover is easily overlooked, however, given that the UK car maker being sold to BMW appears to have been so overwhelmingly dependent on Honda. Two of Rover's key model ranges, the 600 and 200/400 saloons, are the subject of simple licensing agreements with Honda or are joint developments, while a key Rover gearbox is also a Honda design made under licence. All the licence agreements can be terminated by Honda at three months' notice. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has indicated that BMW will be more than willing to place some of BMW's own 6,000 engineers at Rover's disposal as future new model plans develop without Honda. '6,000 BMW engineers? - I don't know what we'd do with them,' said one Rover executive yesterday. 'We are fully capable of seeing through our new car projects.' Where Rover executives and engineers, many of whom regret the loss of Honda as a long-term partner, do see major benefits in BMW's ownership is in the finan-cial resources that they expect to be made avail-able. Currently Rover spends some Pounds 200m a year on new model development, bringing cars into production and upgrading or maintaining plant and equipment to build them. This is a very small amount by mainstream motor industry standards, and Mr Pischetsrieder has indicated that he would expect to see Rover increase it to at least 7 per cent of its Pounds 4.3bn of annual sales, or slightly more than Pounds 300m a year. That would give Rover the ability to bring to fruition various new model ideas which have been beyond its financial grasp. 'All car makers have more model ideas than finance, and so have to prioritise what is actually built,' the company said yesterday. Rover's design, research, development, and engineering facilities are more extensive than many realise. They are concentrated at Canley, near Birmingham, and at a vast, 900-acre complex including 26 miles of test track at Gaydon in Warwickshire. The Gaydon facility, currently employing 900 engineers and the subject of a Pounds 100m-plus new building programme, includes: climatic wind tunnels, prototype build centre, structural analysis facilities, electro-magnetic compatibility centre to test car computer and wiring systems, component test laboratories, noise, vibration and harshness analysis centre, engine test beds and anechoic (sound-free) chambers. It contains within it the capability to develop engines from scratch. It is where Rover's state-of-the-art K series multi-valve engine was developed and which in turn is being developed from a small-capacity four cylinder unit into a full range of engines, including a V6, capable of powering almost any vehicle Rover might make in the future. Commercial logic once again dictates, however, that BMW and other manufacturers' units are used instead in some applications, such as diesels, where they can be simply taken 'off the shelf'. Peugeot diesels, for example, are used in Rover 200, 400 and Metro ranges. The Canley centre is occupied by some 1,000 designers and engineers, where vehicles are styled from scratch, and where a master database of dimensions and other elements is created off which Rover's and component suppliers' project engineers can work. However, one of the most valuable benefits Rover has gained from its long relationship with Honda has been how to break down old barriers between the various development departments and use simultaneous engineering to bring products to market more quickly and with many fewer mistakes in the build-up to production. Honda has changed Rover's methodology radically, to the extent that new vehicle projects are not even centred at Gardon or Canley, but at the plant where they are to be built. For the 600, for example, a project leader was appointed at the Cowley manufacturing plant. He appointed a team and they 'lived' within just one room while ideas for the car took shape. Gaydon and Canley personnel simply became part of the project team. It is this Honda-taught approach to development, costs and quality which allowed Rover to take its Discovery four-wheel-drive model into production in a record-breaking 21 months and is where, Rover executives acknowledge, Rover's greatest debt to Honda lies. Understandably perhaps, Honda is not anxious to see it all handed to such a fierce rival on a plate.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ROVER AND HONDA: THE MAIN LINKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Type of agreement   Example                         Status  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equity      Honda has 20% stake in Rover    Honda selling to BMW holdings    Cars             Rover has 20% stake in Honda    BMW selling to Honda             (UK)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Licensing   Honda car designs:              Can be broken on 3-months             Rover 200, 400, 600 and 800     notice; Honda to negotiate                                             with BMW             Honda component designs:        As above             eg Gearbox for 2-litre Rover             engines             Honda has supplied production   Rover able to maintain             equipment and technology to     existing equipment             Rover for eg its 200, 400 and             600 models  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Component   Rover and Honda each sell the   In many cases each party supplies    other about Pounds 400m-worth   has to supply the other             of car parts a year             as long as the car model             eg - Honda sells to Rover 1.6,  remains in production                  2.0, 2.3 and 2.7-litre                  engines; fascias for 600                  models                - Rover sells body panels to                  Honda for UK-made Accords             Maintenance of common lists of  Disintegration of this             parts specifications and        relationship would quickly             suppliers                       cause chaos on production                                             lines  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vehicle     Rover makes Honda Concertos     Model sales likely to sales       in Birmingham and supplies      continue             Land Rover Discoveries for             sale as Honda Crossroads in             Japan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

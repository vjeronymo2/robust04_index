			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Buoyancy is fading THE buoyancy that followed last week's cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted rates showed signs of fading yesterday, in spite of another cut in the rate at which the Bank of France lends money overnight to commercial banks, writes James Blitz. Last week's 25 basis points reduction in the Bundesbank's discount rate to 8.00 per cent encouraged France to ease monetary policy yesterday without adversely affecting the French franc. At the start of trading, the French authorities announced that they would be offering overnight money at 11 1/2 per cent, against 11 5/8 per cent on Friday. However, the move was not received enthusiastically by the markets. After lunchtime in London, the franc gradually fell back beyond the FFr3.3850 level against the D-Mark, having opened near to FFr3.38. Three-month French franc interest rates, which were bid at around 11.10 per cent after the overnight rate move, also appreciated, creeping up to 11.31 per cent towards the close of French trading. The March French franc contract finished at 89.14, down 10 basis points on the day. The bearishness in the French market was partly due to evidence that conditions in the German market were not getting any easier. German call money yesterday hovered unchanged on Friday's levels, at around 8.60 per cent. The Bundesbank's repo allocation rates should ease at tomorrow's tender. One London based dealer was looking for a cut of about 10 basis points. But any downward move in call money rates will be checked if, as some dealers expect, the Bundesbank drains liquidity from the market on Wednesday. As the March Euromark contract moves towards maturity in a little over one month's time, it becomes highly sensitive to events in the cash market. Yesterday, it retreated 10 basis points on the day to 92.05. But it is still discounting a further 40 basis points off three-month money in the next four weeks. However, the underlying tone was downbeat. One London based money dealer said: 'The Bundesbank's move last week may have underlined the current level of money market rates, rather than re-establishing new ones.' The overnight rate for cash in the sterling money market peaked at 11 per cent yesterday after dealers failed to remove a Pounds 1.25bn in normal operations. There was late assistance of Pounds 755m and three-month money closed unchanged on the day at 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A Supreme Court justice cleared the way for a second trial of GAF Corp. on  charges of stock manipulation by lifting his order that blocked a new trial on  possible grounds of "double jeopardy." Justice Thurgood Marshall, who issued a  stay Sunday night to allow GAF's attorneys to argue against a second trial, has  vacated the stay and denied GAF's application in all respects.  </P></p>

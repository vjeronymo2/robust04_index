			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE WANTS EQUAL TIME FOR THE BAD PLAYS  </P> <P> Kneeling in thankful, public prayer by a football running back is becoming more  and more of a religious ritual. In defense of logic, that same religious player  who thanks God for a touchdown should also shake his angry fist toward heaven  when he is stopped at the one-yard line.  </P> <P> Most linemen and defensive players spend their entire careers without scoring a  touchdown. If we are to have personal religious displays by those who carry the  ball, then those non-carrying players should also have their moment to kneel in  thanks for having made a great block or tackle. Perhaps a time for prayer  should be allowed after each play for those who feel the need.  </P> <P> As you see, the whole idea becomes absurd. May I suggest that just as we have  separation of church and state, we also have separation of church and sport.  </P> <P> GEORGE WOOD, Malibu  </P></p>

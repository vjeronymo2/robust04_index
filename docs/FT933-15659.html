			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / EC employment creation is no easy job, says Brussels report CREATING jobs in Europe is not just a matter of growth, according to a European Commission report published yesterday. While few countries have succeeded in increasing employment without a healthy increase in output, the relationship is not at all uniform, says the Commission's fifth report on Employment in Europe. High-growth Spain and Ireland have both performed poorly in job creation, it says. France and Italy, too, have been above average on growth but below average on employment creation. The report - written by officials in Directorate General 5 - is an ambitious attempt at a comparative labour market analysis which underlines that there are no easy answers to the EC's manifest failure to create jobs. But describing the great diversity of practice and outcome within the EC's labour markets 'can be used to develop more effective measures and programmes of action', claim the authors. The report's publication could scarcely be better timed, given the recent launch by Brussels of a debate about unemployment and job creation across the community. The report's authors start by setting the scene with the familiar but depressing facts of EC employment: the proportion of the working age population in employment has fallen in the past 20 years while it has been rising sharply in most of the rest of the industrial world; during the EC jobs boom of the second half of the 1980s only about a quarter of the new jobs went to the unemployed; and in 1991, 45 per cent of the EC unemployed had been out of work for more than a year. But the regional variations in unemployment are extreme, ranging from less than 5 per cent in parts of southern Germany, northern Italy and northern Portugal to rates of more than 20 per cent in parts of Spain, Ireland and southern Italy. The two most original chapters of the report concern labour costs and employment protection. Taking average hourly labour costs in manufacturing, Germany is 15 per cent higher than the next country, the Netherlands, which is bunched together with Belgium, France, Denmark and Luxembourg. Italy is 5 per cent below them and roughly at the EC average while the UK is placed 25 per cent below that average and only just above Spain and Ireland. Average hourly labour costs in manufacturing are six times greater in Germany than Portugal. These large differences are closely linked to differences in productivity, say the authors. Indirect labour costs vary considerably from 30 per cent or more in France, Italy and Belgium, to 13 per cent in the UK and 3 per cent in Denmark. The authors say that cutting such indirect costs to employers would not necessarily make countries more competitive as either the state or the individual employee would have to take on more of the burden of, say, health care, which would place upward pressure on wage costs. But the report does say that excessive non-wage costs push more employees into the black market. Wages adjust to changes in employment levels only very slowly, says the report, pointing to Germany where Hamburg has the second-highest unemployment level in the country but by far the highest labour costs. Restrictions on firing workers divides the EC into three groups: Denmark, Ireland and the UK have the least restrictions; Greece, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have the most restrictions and Belgium, France and Germany are somewhere in between. Despite the fact that direct severance costs are third highest in Spain, behind Italy and Greece (the average cost of firing someone in the EC is 22 weeks pay), Spanish workers have the highest risk of involuntary redundancy. That is because there is has been a sharp increase in the use of temporary contract work in some high regulation countries such as Spain and Portugal. In Spain the proportion of employees on temporary contracts increased from 16 per cent in 1987 to 32 per cent in 1991. And in France most new recruits now start on part-time contracts. EC surveys of employers' perceptions of labour protection placed Italy at the top followed by the Netherlands, Spain, France and Belgium. There has been some pattern of liberalisation in recent years and the report concludes that the link between employment protection and job creation is complex. The highest protection is found in the southern member states (Italy has the most highly-regulated market in the Community) which also, however, have the lowest labour costs. And in the high-protection northern states some of the costs are cancelled out by generous state aid to employers for restructuring.</p>

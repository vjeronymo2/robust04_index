			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Radu Stefanescu report: "PDSR Is Forcing the </F> Politicization of the Romanian Army"]    [Text] The leadership of the Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR], in the person of its executive chairman, Adrian  Nastase, has begun a sustained offensive intended to politically  enroll the Romanian Army. This action of the ruling party is  openly backed by Minister of National Defense Gheorghe Tinca and  tacitly supported by the head of the general chief of staff,  Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina.    During the recent electoral tour of Adrian Nastase, also  nicknamed "Sweety" [Bombonel], he tried to make the army  division heads and even the army commanders join the PDSR.  Specific similar cases were reported in Buzau and Craiova.    After a strong rapprochement with the East, Gheorghe Tinca  accepts the excessive politicization of the army personally  attending to the PDSR's electoral actions, along with the head  of the chief of General Staff. After the elimination of [former  Defense Minister] Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, the chiefs  of the National Defense Ministry departments were actually  expecting a concentrated counteroffensive from the PDSR.  Currently that counteroffensive is stronger than ever, and the  "mastermind" behind this politicization campaign being none  other than Adrian Nastase, also nicknamed "Sweety."</p>

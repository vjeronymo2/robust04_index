			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Museum stimulates appetite for knowledge: Chris Tighe finds that the exhibits are not the only unusual features of Eureka] IN the bank at the entrance to Eureka], children can become cashiers and security guards, use a cash machine and walk into the vault to examine the strongboxes. Nearby, in the exposed side section of a house, they can plumb in taps before moving on to join the production-line team in a factory, or watch how teeth grind food and listen to the sounds of a rumbling stomach. Eureka], Britain's newest museum, which opens officially this week, is a rarity in several respects; a Pounds 10m project funded almost entirely by the private sector in the midst of recession, it is designed for children aged five to 12, to raise their awareness and understanding of their bodies, society and the technology around them. Its location is unusual too: not in London but on reclaimed land near the centre of Halifax, the Pennine town that five years ago became the setting for the Calderdale Partnership - the first experimental Business Leadership Team formed by Business in the Community (BIC), which encourages private-sector involvement in the community. Mrs Vivien Duffield, daughter of the late Sir Charles Clore and the driving force - and prime funder - behind Eureka], originally intended to site her 'hands-on' educational museum in the capital. Prince Charles, president of BIC, suggested she should take a look at Halifax, which has a population of 8.5m within 90 minutes' drive. Eureka] is the biggest coup for the Calderdale Partnership, which has been instrumental in raising Pounds 2.5m of private sponsorship towards the project. The Clore and Vivien Duffield Foundations have invested Pounds 7m and the government Pounds 250,000. Income from admissions - which are intended to reach 500,000 annually within three years - will be supplemented by developing an adjacent disused Victorian railway station, probably for speciality retailing. Prince Charles, who launched the Halifax 'one town partnership' in 1987, will open Eureka] tomorrow. It will open to the public on Thursday. But even with a rich benefactor, strong support from high-profile businessmen and the patronage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the project hit problems at planning stage. Sceptical local politicians, whose council has since leased Eureka] its 12.5 acre site for just Pounds 370,000, pressed for more power over the scheme. Mrs Duffield, who chairs Eureka], refused. 'If it's a private museum it remains private,' she insists. She won and Calderdale council, now again hung, is supporting a project which, it feels, will enhance Halifax's local pride. Eureka] is a milestone for the partnership, says one of its most committed supporters, Mr Ernest Hall, who has regenerated Halifax's Victorian Dean Clough mill complex. Recently, the partnership has suffered something of a hiatus as leading private-sector members have become involved in a variety of education, arts and community activities. Prince Charles's visit to Halifax this week, his fifth since he launched the partnership in 1987, is far from the end of the story, says Mr Hall, Eureka]'s deputy chairman. 'This is the end of the first phase. But it feels very much the beginning of something.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- Cabinet today approved  an amendment to state budget legislation which maintains the  deficit at 14 billion Slovak crowns (about $424 million), while  increasing revenues and expenditures, Deputy Premier Brigita  Schmognerova announced after an extraordinary cabinet meeting  today. The draft state budget does not resolve the relationship  between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of  Slovakia which must finance the budget deficit.    Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that he would discuss  the  issue with the bank's governor Vladimir Masar. An amendment to  the Law on the Central Bank will then be drawn up in July, which  will probably increase the payments that the bank has to make to  the state budget. Last year, the bank financed a 23 billion  crown deficit and the state had to pay 9.6 billion crowns in  interest. The bank only made budget contributions of six billion  crowns.    The amendment increases health expenditures by 1.8 billion  and education by 1.2 billion crowns. Costs for family benefits  will also be higher. The government also proposes the creation  of a reserve for guarantees for social insurance funds. It  wants to ensure higher revenues through already prepared  increases in value-added and excise taxes. "If the parliament  fails to approve the tax laws, the government will withdraw the  draft amendment on the state budget," Schmognerova remarked.    The amendment also allocates 500 million crowns from the  National Property Fund for comprehensive housing construction  and 245.5 million crowns for projects converting arms production  to civilian purposes, which should already have been financed  last year. A total of 3.5 billion crowns from the Fund's money  is to be spent on other development programs.    Filkus said the draft amendment is conditional on the Slovak  Government's obligations to the International Monetary Fund  (IMF).</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Sport: Atherton and the child within As a child, I was a compulsive cheat. I would peer into the bag full of Scrabble tiles, looking for the letters that would complete the word 'quetzal'; I would steal from the Monopoly bank. Like all real cheats, I would even cheat at patience. The truism that I was 'only cheating myself' meant nothing to me. All I knew was that I simply could not bear to lose: it made me feel diminished, it made me feel ridiculous, and I saw no reason why I should feel these things when it was so easy to ensure that I did not. Victory, when it came, was so sweet that it would expunge from my memory all the machinations that had been necessary to gain it. All that was left to me was the sensation of winning. I was reminded of this long-buried amorality by the Michael Atherton saga, which seems already to have been running for a very long time but which is, let us be assured, just getting into its stride. The chief question posed by the incident is obviously that of Atherton's intentions: was he attempting to give the English attack an unfair advantage? The irresistible reply is that, if he was, one could only wish that he had done it better. But the truth is that it is an impossible question to answer. Study it as one may, and certainly I have seen it more often than one of Bob Hoskins' British Telecom adverts, the ball-rubbing footage will not yield up its secrets. Only the ball-rubber himself knows what his intentions were. And so another question, less specific, more general, arises in place of the unanswerable one. If Atherton had, in fact, been tampering with the cricket ball, if his actions had helped England to take a couple of South African wickets, and if these wickets had helped England to victory, would that have been a victory worth having, a victory to believe in? When Ben Johnson left Seoul in 1988 with his 100 metres gold medal, did he look at it and think, Hurray, I'm the fastest man in the world? Had Diego Maradona led Argentina to win this year's World Cup, would he have thought himself entitled to receive the acclaim of millions? Do those cricketers who have not just a bit of honest dirt in their pockets but bottle tops, lip salve, miniature cans of Mr Sheen, feel that the wickets they take are truly their trophies? Now that I have grown out of my cheating past, I find it hard to believe that they do. That is not to say that I no longer feel the urgent desire to win - I still find losing unbearable - but I also feel that it would be easier to live with the memory of defeat than with the knowledge of an unreal victory. Surely, as soon as the straight course of the contest has been bent in any way, the winning post ceases to have any significance. Another example relevant to this argument is that of this year's Grand Prix drivers' championship. Damon Hill was helped to victory at Silverstone by a penalty inflicted upon Michael Schumacher, who forfeited several seconds in the race for overtaking Hill on the warm-up lap. Since then, Schumacher has been further penalised. He has been docked six points and banned from two Grand Prix (a decision against which he is appealing); Damon Hill is now within striking distance. But would a world championship won in such circumstances really satisfy him? He says that it would, that posterity only remembers who won and not how he did so, which, of course, is true. Yet victory must surely be soured by the sense - however slight - that it has been given, rather than earned. Of course, Schumacher has not been penalised for nothing, and if he loses the championship because of the Silverstone misdemeanour then that is his own fault. But it is the element of uncertainty which creeps in when the straight course of the contest has been bent that affects winners, should-be winners, losers, and should-be losers alike. For example, can Carl Lewis ever be entirely sure that he would have won the 1988 Olympic 100 metres final? What about all the other races that Ben Johnson ran; all the football matches that Maradona played; all the cricket matches won by wickets taken by suspect bowlers? To whom do all those victories truly belong? And what, in the end, is cheating in sport? Whatever Michael Atherton was really doing to that fateful ball, whether or not his action were inside or outside the laws of the game, they were hardly any diferent from the sort of thing that is done in cricket all the time. Athletes are constantly taking substances to improve their performances; obviously these are permitted but only within an arbitrary set of rules. Legality and illegality are fluid terms in such an environment. It comes down, as I said before, to intention. Even then, though, I am not so sure that proven cheats are singled out by the detached, premeditated quality of their desire to win. When, 20 years ago, I sat with one hand in the Monopoly bank and the other placing an hotel on Mayfair, I knew that what I was doing was wrong but it did not feel wrong. Within the miasma of intensity, expectation, and desperation that must sometimes fill the sportsman's head, creating conditions that no longer relate to reality or responsibility, who is to say that he does not view his actions with the uncomprehending wilfulness of a child?</p>

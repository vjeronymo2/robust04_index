			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Clinton opens Nato's door to E Europe President Bill Clinton said yesterday it was 'no longer a question of whether' Nato would acquire new members in eastern Europe 'but of when and how'. The Partnership for Peace adopted by the Nato summit this week was 'not a permanent holding group', he said after bilateral meetings in Prague with the leaders of the Visegrad countries - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia - which are generally considered to head the queue for Nato membership. But Mr Clinton - who early today arrived in Moscow after a stopover in Kiev  -told the Visegrad leaders that while he saw 'a clear link' between the partnership and eventual accession to the alliance, he had advanced 'no promises, no criteria and no timetable', and had not, according to a White House official, raised the question of 'explicit security guarantees'. In their public remarks the Visegrad leaders did not dissent from the president's views. President Lech Walesa of Poland said he had found the session 'most gratifying', while President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic welcomed the partnership as 'a good departure in the Nato quest for a new identity' and promised his country would work 'quickly and energetically' to prove itself 'worthy of membership'. But he added that while 'it is not possible or desirable to isolate Russia, we are independent states who decide our own affiliations and policies'. Mr Clinton still felt it necessary to sweeten the pill of any disappointment by offering a modest programme of economic assistance to the four. This, a White House official conceded, involved 'more know-how than money', though it included some concrete proposals. Chief among them is an increase from Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) per project to Dollars 200m in the cover provided by the US Overseas Private Insurance Corporation. The US will also set up a Dollars 30m programme drawn from existing funds, designed to bring together US and east European organisations engaged in education, legal and social reform.</p>

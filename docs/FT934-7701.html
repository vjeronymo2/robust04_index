			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (29): A tussle over water supplies - Shortages are made worse by the pollution of rivers and water tables ONE OF the best tests of whether China can get to grips with pollution will be its success in improving supplies of clean water. At the moment, the cities, industry and agriculture are tussling over an increasingly scarce resource. Tianjin, located 100km south-east from Beijing, has recently seen part of its water supply diverted to Beijing, after a new reservoir was built upstream. It is now rapidly approaching a ceiling: it uses 90 per cent of the remaining water and demand is still rising. Tianjin's Environmental Protection Bureau acknowledges the dangers that water shortage poses to its regional development, but the solution - building more reservoirs - is expensive. Reports by China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the World Bank show that the main cities frequently extract too much ground water. Thousands of square kilometres of land have subsided around Beijin and Tianjin because of over-extraction of groundwater. Overall, subsidence has been detected in 45 large and medium-sized cities. The shortages are exacerbated by pollution of rivers and water tables. Much of the country's liquid and solid waste ends up eventually in one of the seven main river basins. The pollution is rapidly cutting fishery yields. Annual breeding of the four main fishes in the Yangtze river declined from 20bn in the 1970s to the present 1bn, according to NEPA reports. Meanwhile, poor drainage and accumulation of salt has cut yields on nearly 7m hectares of irrigated cropland, sometimes by 25 per cent, the World Bank study found. Around 1.4m hectares are irrigated by polluted water, leaving poisonous heavy metals in the crops.</p>

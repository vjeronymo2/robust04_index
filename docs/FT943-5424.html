			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / How To Spend It: The easyish guide to mobile happiness - Some portable telephones are getting cheaper but there are hidden costs. Peter Knight offers a 10-step guide to talking on the move If you thought buying a personal pension was a nightmare, try getting the best deal on a mobile telephone. Beginners who want to understand the complexities of the business have three options, in ascending order of easiness: First, read this article very carefully. Next, ask a series of questions of the smart people (in every sense) who want to sell you a telephone. Then, work out (preferably, with a spreadsheet) what is best for you. Second, abandon this article, decide what advertisement you like best (some fancy the Mercury woman with a gap in her teeth, others prefer the minimalism of the Orange ads, while the bargain hunters love the cheap giveaway deals found in the local paper). Go for the image you like best and the sexiest telephone available - you can assume it is going to cost a fortune, anyway. Third, and quite the best, persuade your boss, spouse or rich, doting lover to give you a mobile telephone with a written promise to pay the bills. Since the first mobile 'phones were introduced a decade ago, talking on the move has progressed from being strikingly unusual to socially gauche and now, oh so ordinary. While owning a mobile (it's never referred to as anything but a 'mobile') might not make you different, it can certainly improve your life. But no matter what deal you strike on these gadgets, if you are paying the bills, it is going to cost you more than owning an ordinary phone - at least Pounds 150 a year without counting the cost of the phone or the calls. Even so, with judicious use and firm discipline to curb excessive chatting, you can escape relatively lightly - from around Pounds 300 a year (plus VAT), as the table shows. Just follow our 10 steps to mobile happiness. 10 STEPS TO MOBILE HAPPINESS 1. Understand that you are buying a service, not a phone. The money in the mobile phone business is made primarily by selling air time (the call costs), not the telephones. Handsets can be bought without an air-time contract, but they are then very expensive. The price of most hand portables is subsidised by the companies selling air time, as an inducement to sign up for one of the many options available from the four operators: Cellnet, Vodafone, Mercury One-2-One, and Orange. 2. Navigate through the mobile maze. Mobile telephones (hand portables and car-phones) work on a radio system. Each operator has set up transmitters and receivers throughout their area of coverage (usually on tall buildings) in interlinked 'cells', hence the term cellular radio. When you make a call your mobile 'phone transmits the conversation to a nearby receiver which routes it to the operator. The call is then routed to its destination, either another portable or into the main BT network of cables. The system works the same in reverse, with the operator's computers keeping a track on your 'phone as it moves from cell to cell. To encourage competition, the government set up a system that shared the spoils between the network operators and middlemen, called service providers. The service providers buy air time wholesale from the operators and then sell it on to you, either directly or through a retailer. Your contract is with a service provider. Network operators are now allowed to sell air time directly too. 3. Decide where you want to make and receive calls. Your needs could simplify your choices. Only two networks - Vodafone and Cellnet - offer a Europe-wide coverage on what's called GSM. This is a technical standard that allows you to make and receive calls in most European countries and some others, such as Australia and South Africa. The same operators are the only ones to offer near-nationwide coverage in the UK, which is important if you intend to use the 'phone away from the big towns and cities. All the networks offer services in London and the south-east. Mercury One-2-One started there and is extending to other English metropolitan centres. Orange started in all the large English and Scottish cities and is extending its coverage to 90 per cent of the population by the middle of next year. Remember that you can call anywhere in the world on any of the services, as long as you are within their demarcated reception boundaries. Once you leave their area, the 'phone is useless. If you want a mobile for security in case you should break down or get lost while driving, members of the AA can buy its Callsafe system. This is a mobile 'phone that can only be used to call the AA or the emergency services. It is expensive but may be worth it for the peace of mind. It costs Pounds 149.99 for the phone, Pounds 25 for a connect fee and Pounds 26.50 per quarter. The calls are free. 4. If you want privacy, go Digital. There are two types of system, analogue (the original) and digital. Both offer high quality sound and reception when they are working well. Both suffer from bad reception. The digital service, although considered technically superior, can make you sound rather Dalek-like at times. If you do not want eavesdroppers (remember the Princess Diana 'Squidgy' calls?) then go digital because it is far more secure. Digital is essential for secret agents (although your whereabouts could be tracked) and anyone involved in an extra-marital affair. 5. Estimate how much - and when - you intend to use the phone. The methods used to charge for air time are complex and confusing. Before you pay for calls, you have to settle a one-off connection fee (from Pounds 25-Pounds 50) and then pay a monthly standing charge (from Pounds 12.77-Pounds 100). The differences in tariffs are essentially between the 'business' packages (medium monthly fee, high call charges) and packages aimed at the social caller (low monthly fee, high call charges at peak times). There are many variations on the theme, including inducements of free calls. Mercury gives free local calls after seven in the evening, Orange provides five different 'price plans' in which it offers from 15 to 540 minutes free. Some charges are rounded up to the nearest half-minute while others, from Orange, are charged per second. It is virtually impossible for those who have never owned a mobile 'phone to know how much they will use it. Some users have found that the phone changes the way they work, allowing much more mobility. This makes it exceedingly difficult to choose the right tariff package, so check if there is a charge in case you want to move from one package to another on the same system. The producers of the Financial Times newsletter Mobile Communications have computed the total cost of the various options over a three-year period. 'We made some assumptions on the amount of calls made and then worked out the cost, including the price of the cheapest hand portable available on the service,' says editor Neil McCartney. 'The cheapest countries for cellular telephone service are in Scandinavia but because there's a lot more competition in the UK market now, we are the fifth cheapest country in Europe. Germany, France and Spain are a lot more expensive.' European Cellular Tariffs, published by The X25 Partnership, has done some useful work comparing the costs of using the leading operators. The table published here shows the average cost per year over three years for low users and high users and does at least provide some help to those trying to get straight answers to the complicated question of costs. 6. Beware of cheap 'phones. Advertisements for cheap 'phones are misleading. The chances are that the 'phones will be yesterday's technology but even if not, the 'bargain' phone is being subsidised to attract customers for the air time. Look for the right tariff package first and then see what 'phones are available. Remember the 'phones have to conform to the technical standards of the operator. 7. Do not be seduced by sexy looks. They have not squeezed the technology into a wristwatch yet, but hand portables have shrunk quite dramatically since the early days. Some, such as the Sony CM-R 111, can be put in a pocket without breaking the stitching. But there are inevitable trade-offs between size, weight, functions and performance. The capacity of batteries is still a problem - the smaller the phone, the smaller the battery and that means you have to carry a spare. Check too that the smaller phones are easy to use and have the power to work well when you are on the fringe of an operator's transmission boundary. Unless you always carry a briefcase, some 'phones can be rather heavy to carry around in a pocket or handbag. The Swatch, for example, is 385g, the Mercury M200 is 370g and the Nokia 1011 is 470 gm. The Sony CM-R 111 is only 185g. Which? magazine tested 19 mobile 'phones. Its recommendations are: Analogue: Mitsubishi MT-7, Nokia 101, People's Phone CTN 6000 and for occasional use, the Sony CM-H 333. Digital: Mercury M400 and the Nokia Orange. For GSM (Europe-wide service) the Motorola Micro TAC International 5200 is recommended. However, other 'phones have been launched since Which? did its tests. 8. Watch out for thieves. Mobiles are highly prized and some thieves specialise in snatching them from queueing cars at traffic lights. Make sure yours is insured. This is doubly important because you will have to buy a replacement at a non-subsidised price, or pay a penalty for cancelling your contract. 9. Read the contract carefully. The contract with the service provider will bind you to using the service for a set time (usually a year, but it could be more). There will be penalties if you want to give it up or move to another tariff package. Make sure you know what you are signing because the consequences can be costly. Look for opt-out clauses for bad service from the operator. 10. Watch that recall button. Many marital miscreants have been caught out by their spouse after programming 0 as the quick-dial to their lovers. You have been warned.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                Mobile telephones: comparative charges  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator                  Monthly                     Low      High                           Charge (Pounds)             User*    User*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cellnet Primetime         25                          438      765 Cellnet Lifetime          12.77                       372      934 Cellnet Citytime          20                          408      873 Vodafone Business         25                          438      765 Vodafone LowCall          12.77                       372      934 Vodafone Capitalcall      20                          408      873 Vodafone Eurodigital      25                          463      790 Vodafone Metrodigital     20                          711      711 Mercury One-2-One:  Business                 17.50                       375      553  Personal                 12.50                       303      639 Orange Talk 15            15 (inc 15 mins free)       330      652 Orange Talk 60            25 (inc 60 mins free)       381      585 Orange Talk 200           50 (inc 200 mins free)      681      681 Orange Talk 360           75 (inc 360 mins free)      981      982 Orange Talk 540           100 (inc 540 mins free)   1,281    1,280  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Average total cost (including calls, monthly charges, and cost of purchasing the set) in Pounds per year over three years (excluding VAT).

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Moldova vote good for peace, bad for economy Moldova's former communist establishment took a huge lead over both nationalists and market reformers in the war-torn country's first parliamentary elections on Sunday, according to preliminary results. The vote suggests Moldovans have rejected the old nationalist aspiration to reunite their former Soviet republic with neighbouring Romania and want to make peace with their Russian-occupied breakaway region of Trans-Dneister. With a third of votes counted by late yesterday, the Agrarian-Democratic Party had won 45 per cent of the vote and the pro-Russian socialist bloc 25 per cent. Counting is slow in a country of isolated villages and poor communications. The Agrarian party favours repairing relations with Moscow and making concessions to the discontented Russian minority in Trans-Dneister, which boycotted the elections. Trans-Dneister, threatened by the hopes of Moldova's first independent government to merge with Romania, fought a breakaway war which claimed 500 lives in 1992. A fragile peace has held since July 1992, largely through the presence of more than 7,000 Russian troops there. But negotiations have stalled on a final political settlement to withdraw the Russian troops and grant the region a special autonomous status. While the Agrarian victory may be good for peace, however, it may seriously damage the economy. The party, which is more agrarian than democratic, threatens to destroy a radical economic reform experiment launched last autumn when the government, an informal coalition of former communists and economic reformers,asked the west for help. Moldova agreed to introduce tight monetary policies and to cut inflation in return for financial support. Now, however, the national bank's fastidious monetary policies, among the most determined in eastern Europe, and a newly launched privatisation programme may be cast aside before the reforms have a chance to take hold. The prime minister, Mr Andrei Sanagheli, who ran on the Agrarian ticket, approved the reform deal, but observers say he is not ideologically committed to it. 'There will be credit expansion and price increases,' said a reformist economist, Mr Anatoly Gudim. 'It's inescapable.' This spring will test the Agrarian party. To keep monetary policy in check it will need to withstand pressure from the farm sector, which it represents, to issue a wave of credits for planting crops. Issuing those credits would risk losing more than Dollars 200m in International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans. But forgoing spring planting would be unthinkable. Agriculture accounts for some two-thirds of the economy. The national bank governor, Mr Leonid Talmaci, who is technically subordinate to the parliament, has said he is 'ready to resign' if parliament orders an expansion in the money supply. 'Reducing inflation is my most important task. I will not degrade our new currency,' he said. The privatisation ministry, headed by Mr Vissarion Cheshuev, is under fire, too, and he expects to be thrown out of office. The Agrarians have denounced as illegal his plan to auction off a third of state property by the end of the year and are calling for a complete review of the programme.</p>

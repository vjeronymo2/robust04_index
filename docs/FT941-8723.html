			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Ministers back Tec-chamber mergers A pilot scheme of voluntary mergers between chambers of commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils won government approval yesterday. The scheme's aim is to stimulate local business activities. The announcement was made by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, in a letter to the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Tec National Council. The organisations welcomed the government's decision and pointed out that some chambers and Tecs had already been working more closely. The proposed bodies would offer benefits to local business by reducing duplication of activities. The British Chambers of Commerce says it represents more than 200,000 companies, which amounts to 40 per cent of all businesses. There are 82 Tecs operating in England and Wales. The BCC and the Tec National Council emphasised yesterday there would be no pressure applied to secure mergers. No more than 10 mergers are likely this year. Both organisations insisted yesterday that where mergers took place it was 'absolutely critical' that the new bodies met local business needs, and that merging would 'in due course enable them to equal or better their French or German equivalents'. Ministers are keen to ensure that any merged Tecs and chambers should be created under an agreed framework of guidance which is approved by them. They also want the new bodies to play a strategic role and exercise an overview of all training and enterprise issues in their areas, including the creation and popularising of business links. The government insists that the merged bodies should represent the full range of local employers and not just those who belong to them. The proposed articles of association for such bodies have to make clear they will not become involved in direct delivery of services except with the explicit permission of government departments responsible for funding the relevant service. Separate organisations will have to be set up where one of the parties to a merger already acts as a large-scale deliverer of training programmes. Mr Heseltine and Mr Hunt said in their letter: 'We will need to ensure we have legal advice on any contractual implications.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, China's  northern port city, has just mapped out a bold plan to upgrade  its shopping facilities in the upcoming few years to make it an  international shopping metropolis.    According to the plan, Tianjin Municipal Government will  concentrate on the construction of ten commercial streets, 18  shopping centers, five large department stores and six wholesale  markets, which are expected to extend for a dozen kilometers.    According to a municipal official, a number of foreign  investors have shown keen interest in investing in such  construction. Shopping facilities with two million square meters  in total floor space like the Huaxing Shopping Building, Fuyu  Plaza and Olympic Building are being built with overseas  investment.    Tianjin's large-scale construction of shopping facilities  has  offered an excellent opportunity for foreign investment, said an  official from the Municipal Planning Bureau. He said Tianjin  has a number of golden shopping areas which remain undeveloped.  Tianjin has stipulated a series of preferential policies for  foreign investment to develop these areas, he said.</p>

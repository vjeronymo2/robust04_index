			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (3): Computer begets computer - Production changes to meet new market conditions COMPUTER MAKERS are taking their own medicine and finding it efficacious. They are using their own products at every stage of the computer manufacturing process. Indeed, without the flexibility of modern computer databases, coupled to powerful minicomputers and workstations, the problems of coping with today's chaotic market conditions could be crippling. The computer market has changed greatly in the past few years. Demand for mainframes, the workhorse of the traditional data processing business, has flattened off with serious consequences for large computer makers who derive most of their profits from mainframe systems. At the same time, the market for smaller systems - personal computers, workstations and network computers or servers - has grown enormously. Prices have plummeted because of fierce competition and lower component costs. In such unsettled conditions, manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are paramount. Product cycle times are reducing sharply. According to Mr John McClelland, director of manufacturing and development for International Business Machines' UK subsidiary, a product that typically took two years from initial design to launch now takes less than a year to develop. At ICL, Mr Ian Hunt, product introduction manager, says that a new variation on a basic personal computer model can be introduced in less than three months. Computer-aided design and manufacturing technology provide the lubricant for the most modern techniques: concurrent engineering where designers, engineers and marketing specialists work as a group on a new product. Just-in-time parts delivery is made possible by on-line, automated warehouses. Design for manufacture is critical. Hewlett-Packard has designed computer terminals that were easy to build and cut labour and overheads at one plant by two-thirds and raw materials by half. Computer manufacturing itself has changed markedly as proprietary designs have begun to give way to open systems built from off-the-shelf components. NCR, for example, now the computer manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T, builds its entire product line, from notebook computers to mainframe systems, using standard Intel microprocessors. At one time, computer cabinets could be opened to display a spaghetti-like mass of wiring (minicomputer companies have flourished in former textile towns where experience with tangled threads translated swiftly into skills with tangled wires). No longer, however; integration of components onto printed circuit boards many layers thick has often done away with the need manually to connect components together. Computer manufacturers, indeed, are becoming chiefly assemblers. They may design the chips in their machines but the physical parts are made in silicon foundries - semiconductor manufacturers who will make chips in volume to order. ICL, for example, designs the processors used in its top of the line Series 39 large mainframes, but the silicon chips are made by Fujitsu, whose semiconductor technology is second to none. Computer makers still design their own printed circuit boards, but may neither manufacture them nor insert the electronic components. Tandem, for example, a leading manufacturer of fault-tolerant computers, sold off its board factory last year. It no longer makes economic sense to make components which can be produced more efficiently by a specialist manufacturer. The labour content of a small computer - a personal computer or workstation  -is now typically less than 5 per cent of the overall manufacturing cost. Assembling machines as complex as computers - whether mainframe or micro - makes powerful demands on manufacturing logistics, however. For large manufacturers IBM and ICL, the key is integrated engineering software which drives the manufacturing process. At the heart of IBM's manufacturing process, for example, is a software system called Catia (Computer Graphics Aided Three Dimensional Interactive Application), a suite of programs for design, analysis and manufacturing. It includes software for three-dimensional surface and solid modelling, drafting and numerical control programming in its extensive list of applications. Developed by Dassault of France, Catia is not only used by IBM but also marketed by the US company. IBM commonly manufactures each product in at least three sites worldwide. The sites compete with each other to set cost and quality standards. The key to co-ordination is the integration of the engineering database. Paper has, to a large extent, been eliminated. Engineering releases - complete descriptions of parts - flow electronically from the data base to the manufacturing sites. Parts have unique identifying numbers worldwide and are recognised as they pass along the assembly process by bar codes. The supplier side of the manufacturing process is equally automated. Customer orders arrive electronically. Invoices and bills are despatched by electronic document interchange (EDI). ICL, for example, orders silicon chips from Texas Instruments of the US and Fujitsu of Japan through EDI messages and receives acknowledgements in a similar fashion. The company builds only to order; nothing is made for stock which means the order book has to be forecast some 18 months into the future. In the present business climate, the order book changes daily but ICL's MRP (Materials Resource Planning) software takes the strain.</p>

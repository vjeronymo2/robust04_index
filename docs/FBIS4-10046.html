			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancourt from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] To conduct foreign politics from within the country  is still the goal that encourages the Cuban Foreign Ministry to  organize tours through different territories. The latest tour  was to the special municipality of the Isle of Youth, where  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived with 60 heads of  missions accredited in Havana.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] I believe everyone in the  country, particularly the diplomatic corps, has always been  interested in the work performed on the island. I believe that  to become familiar with the island, one must do it from within  and with its people. Nothing is more important than the  explanations the people personally give. I believe the example  we saw today, when the diplomats were able to stop and talk with  whomever they wanted on the streets about whatever they wanted,  is an example of what Isle of Youth residents can do; therefore,  the best message is, above all, about pledges, not formal  pledges but, rather, only a real pledge that only by working can  we solve our problems and find the option we truly need. There  is no need to explain this to Isle of Youth residents. The  people on the Isle of Youth are doing it.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you know.... [pauses] Did you  know, before you came to the island, the people on the Isle of  Youth had already decided they wanted to host the 26 July  celebrations next year?    [Robaina] I learned about it because certain media are  already talking about this issue. I believe, first of all, it  is an important pledge that reflects the Isle of Youth people's  decision. I believe it is a decision, desire, and hope backed by  hard work and achievements. If we could hope for something, on  a personal basis, it is that they successfully achieve their  goals.    [Reporter] I understand that out of the five tours that have  been made throughout the country, this tour has had a  peculiarity: direct contact with the people. What is your  evaluation of this point?    [Robaina] I believe each tour has its own appeal. This tour  has the island's attention and includes the possibility and  privilege of enjoying a neighborhood and family atmosphere,  among other things. If the island is like this normally, I see  no reason why it should be different for this tour. I believe  this is the most important thing, to show the way you really are.    [Reporter] We heard you talk about your diplomatic  offensive. What does that term mean?    [Robaina] I think we have talked about a diplomatic  offensive, and we think a diplomatic offensive can involve a  stage in which it is necessary to increase a specific activity  in connection with the absence or role of the media. I believe  once that phase has been completed we must talk about a  permanent diplomatic offensive in which we tell the world what  we want the world to know rather than answer questions. We get  tired of going around the world, answering questions, because  Cuba also has many questions to ask and has much to say even  though it is not asked. [end recording]    Robaina gave those statements to local journalists upon  concluding the visit to the Isle of Youth, where he and members  of the diplomatic corps visited the main areas of economic  interest in the territory, El Abra Farm-Museum, the  reconstruction work carried out at Nueva Gerona's historical  sector, the Presidio Modelo Museum, and one of the 60 rural  schools in the municipality.</p>

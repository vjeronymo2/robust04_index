			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MCENROE LOSES A MATCH TO FORGET  </P> <P> Guy Forget was just glad to be playing, while John McEnroe apparently wanted to  be somewhere else.  </P> <P> Forget, sidelined for five months by a knee injury earlier in the year, upset  top-seeded John McEnroe, 6-4, 7-6, Saturday in the semifinals of an indoor  tournament at Wembley, England.  </P> <P> "I felt kind of tired," McEnroe said. "I was not able to want the match enough.  It didn't mean enough.  </P> <P> "The scheduling didn't help me this week," said McEnroe, who teamed up to win a  doubles semifinal with Jakob Hlasek immediately after he lost to Forget. "I  played better in doubles because I didn't have to run so fast. My body just  wasn't up to it.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, Michael Chang, who hasn't won a tournament since the  French Open in June, defeated Wally Masur of Australia, 7-6, 6-1.  </P> <P> Forget, a 24-year-old Frenchman, overpowered an unusually lethargic McEnroe to  reach his second Grand Prix final of the year.  </P> <P> "I played this match very loose," Forget said. "Win or lose, I was happy to  play. He didn't get a lot of first serves in, and that was very important."  </P> <P> McEnroe, a five-time winner of this title who is ranked fourth in the world,  hit a number of unforced errors and couldn't get his serve into gear. He still  had enough chances to put Forget away, but blew a 4-2 lead in the first set and  four set points at 5-4 in the second.  </P> <P> Forget was the lowest-ranked player to beat McEnroe in more than 18 months.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl beat Stefan Edberg, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3, at Stockholm, Sweden, in the  semifinals of the Stockholm Open.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed, but he played very well," Wilander said. "I had my chances  in the first set and I think I should have beaten him, but he played so well on  the big points."  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden knocked off Mats Wilander,  also of Sweden, 7-6, 6-4.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Lendl romped through the opening set after it took almost 30 minutes  to settle the first two games.  </P> <P> Edberg, who beat Lendl the last time they met in the Japan Open final last  April, broke for a 1-0 lead in the second set as his powerful serve-and-volley  game finally got going. He broke again to lead, 5-2, then held to even the  match.  </P> <P> Lendl, who has won 14 consecutive matches, took a 2-0 lead in the decisive set  with a brilliant cross-court return off Edberg's tricky kick serve. There were  no other service breaks.  </P> <P> Unseeded Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union used a big first serve and a new  game plan to upset third-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-4, and  advance to the final of a Virginia Slims tournament at Chicago.  </P> <P> In today's final, Savchenko will play Zina Garrison, who struggled but beat  Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1.  </P> <P> Savchenko's first victory over Sukova in five meetings came when she changed  her tactics after a three-set loss to Sukova in September in the fourth round  of the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "This time I made up my mind I was going to come to the net, and she hit a lot  of balls out," Savchenko said.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina defeated Mark Koevermans of the  Netherlands, 7-5, 6-2, in the semifinals of a Grand Prix tournament at Sao  Paulo, Brazil.  </P> <P> The other semifinal, between fourth-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain and Jean  Fleurian of France, was rained out and will be played today, followed by the  final.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, 11 Jan -- The Lithuanian Seimas today  ratified a law permitting citizens of the republic to acquire  and carry light firearms. The new law comes into force on 1  April this year, although, as one of the Seimas members joked,  "1 April is not the most appropriate date."    Firearms may be legally acquired by persons over the age of  25 who have no court record, do not abuse spirits, are  well-balanced, not addicted to drugs, and who are not registered  at a psychiatric clinic.    It was pointed out at the Seimas session, that the adoption  of such a law was a forced measure, since the rise in crime in  Lithuania is getting beyond state control.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Regulator bans carry-forward deals in India The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), acting to dampen a sharp rise in stock prices, is banning carry-forward deals at four major exchanges, Reuter reports from Bombay. The SEBI said the ban would apply to the Bombay, Calcutta, Ahmedabad and Delhi stock markets. Brokers have been given until the middle of January to liquidate their carry-forward positions. The Bombay 30-share index has risen by 32 per cent since the start of November. The SEBI ordered brokers to reduce their forward positions by 50 per cent by the end of the current account period, which ends on January 6. The remaining forward positions will have to be liquidated during the following account period ending in mid-January. Brokers said the ban showed that the government was still haunted by last year's Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal.</p>

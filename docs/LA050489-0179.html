The  rest of the money is coming from insurance companies that issued polices to  BKK.  </P> <P> Residents said in their suit that the dump created health and safety problems.  More than 3.4 million tons of hazardous waste are buried in the BKK Landfill,  making it one of the nation's largest toxic-waste sites.  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Politicians usurp the technocrats THERE was a sense of history unfolding in Brussels yesterday afternoon as finance ministers trooped into offices near the empty shell of the Berlaymont, former headquarters of the European Commission. The presence of the politicians - who were noticeably absent nine months ago when sterling and the lira crashed out of the exchange rate mechanism - showed that this time everyone grasped an essential truth. The latest crisis was too important to leave to the technocrats alone. At stake was the future of European monetary co-operation based on a Franco-German axis, and the more elusive goal of European monetary union. On Saturday, after more than six hours of deliberations, the technocrats of the EC monetary committee had been unable to reach agreement on a plan to save the ERM. The impasse underlined unresolved tensions between France and Germany over the Bundesbank's refusal to lower short-term interest rates. Germany called for both the monetary committee and ministers' meetings in the hope that a decisive action plan could be endorsed at the highest level among the 12 member states, before financial markets reopened today. The EC monetary committee - comprised of senior central and Treasury officials - discussed several options for defusing the ERM crisis. But according to informed sources, officials could only agree to the principle that the European monetary system and its exchange rate grid had to be preserved. European monetary officials said France's determination to resist a devaluation of the franc had increased pressure on the Bundesbank to lower short-term rates after its largely technical move on Thursday. The broader French strategy seemed aimed at forcing Bonn to make a choice: either to break publicly with its traditional ally in Paris, or to twist arms at the central bank to lower the key discount rate. Germany's decision to call the emergency meetings reflected these conflicting political pressures. But it also pointed to Bundesbank worries that unlimited intervention on behalf of the French franc risked an inflationary bloating of Germany's money supply, as during last September's ERM crisis which led to the forced exit of sterling and the lira. The EC monetary committee discussed all available options for easing the crisis. All contained significant drawbacks and are believed to include: A suspension of the ERM for a limited period. The attraction of an 'extended vacation' for the EMS currencies from the ERM grid was that it would prevent France losing face; it would introduce much-needed flexibility into the system; and it could be defended as the best chance of restoring economic growth in the EC through lower interest rates. But allowing currencies to float would jeopardise the single market and would amount to a grievous blow to the Maastricht treaty's goal of European monetary union by the end of the century. The forced exit of several currencies from the ERM, including the franc. This might make practical sense, as it would almost certainly allow France and Spain to lower interest rates. But it would encourage talk of a 'two-tier' ERM, undermining France's 10-year policy of maintaining parity with the D-Mark. A deal involving a devaluation of the franc in return for a cut in the German discount rate. This would be a significant climbdown for the Bundesbank, but analysts recalled that a similar political trade-off last September involving a cut in German rates in return for a devaluation of the lira failed to prevent the Black Wednesday crisis. A widening of the fluctuation bands within the ERM beyond their current level of 2.25 per cent (excluding the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo). This would avoid an official devaluation of the franc but would amount to a de facto depreciation, which was counter to the franc fort policy. It might also be dismissed as a ruse to buy time. As ministers and officials laboured yesterday to come up with a convincing deal it was clear the outcome would have profound political and economic repercussions for the European Community. If the Bundesbank agreed to a discount rate cut, this would amount to a humiliating public U-turn. How such a retreat would play before the German public - and the German constitutional court which is currently reviewing the Maastricht treaty - was another matter. On the other hand, a French devaluation and/or a suspension of the ERM would be viewed as a devastating blow to European monetary co-operation.</p>

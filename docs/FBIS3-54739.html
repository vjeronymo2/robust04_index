			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified correspondent, including recorded remarks </F> by Gennadiy Burbulis, president of the Strategiya humanitarian  and political science center; from the "Tsentr" newscast]    [Text] [Correspondent] The Strategiya [Strategy] center,  created by Gennadiy Burbulis after his removal from official  power structures, has summed up the results of the first year of  its work. The existence of the center is no secret today, but  its work, as well as the personality of its president, are  shrouded in some kind of mystery.    [Burbulis] There is awareness about the center. They do not  know what it does, what results have been achieved, but the  world knows it is there, and this is our achievement, as it were.    [Correspondent] Speaking on the urgent issue of creating a  political party, Gennadiy Burbulis stated that, sadly, he has  had to be publicly involved, of late, in a dialogue on this  issue with President Yeltsin, whose desire to also build a party  comes into confrontation with Yeltsin's aspiration to be and  remain an arbitrator of the society.    [Burbulis] Our objective is to help Yeltsin to understand  the  following: That any further attempt to remain an arbitrator is  threatening to him personally and to his political biography,  and therefore, is threatening to the whole country. The  transitional stage that we are undergoing, the sheer scale and  depth of the contradictions, and of the clash of interests do  not allow the president to take a stance of arbitrator today.  One thing is to be a political arbitrator, and another thing --  to be a president who adopts a certain position in a clear-cut,  business-like, and committed way, but at the same time, who is  able to engage in a dialogue with all other political structures  in the country and in the society. These are different things.  Yeltsin needs to take up a clear position, to stop playing  patron to the nation, especially since the nation is simply not  there as such, so this precludes this patronage, what the nation  badly needs is leadership. Yeltsin must learn to conduct  dialogue with the society in forms for which a serious school of  democratic leadership is needed.    Should our assessment be correct, to some extent, then  indeed  one will not be able to move even a step forward without a  party. However, this cannot be a presidential party any more.  This cannot be a party built on Yeltsin's charisma. This must  be a two-way street: Of the president moving toward the society  and of society, in its growing awareness of the necessity of  such political structure.    They must both grow up mutually to meet this challenge. I  believe our center can be equally useful by way of inspiring the  authority and the person in authority, and by helping to  implement this demand in practical terms.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Charity lottery Would Britain's national lottery raise more money for good causes if it gave its profits to charities rather than to shareholders? Mr Richard Branson, the airline entrepreneur, and Lord Young, the former Tory minister who now runs telecommunications group Cable &amp; Wireless, say it would. Their Lottery Foundation plans to bid for the lottery on a charitable basis when the licence is put out to competitive tender this week. All their rivals are profit-driven. Charity gives Branson and Young a public relations edge. But while it is welcome that the two men are giving their time for nothing, that should not be a decisive factor. Profit is not a dirty word, but an important means of motivating people. Not only have both Branson and Young preached the gospel of enterprise in the past. Their lottery will also provide suppliers with the opportunity to make profits, precisely because they feel that the operation must be commercially-orientated. Moreover, it is not as though all the money from a profit-driven lottery would go to shareholders. They will get only what is left over after payments to the government's fund for good causes, prize money, lottery duty and administration costs. Because the licence will go to the bidder with the best prospect of maximising funds for good causes, there should be little opportunity to earn monopoly profits. Indeed, it is even possible that the winner will end up losing money if it overbids. The central question is therefore not whether handing the lottery's profits to charity is intrinsically ethical but whether doing so would help maximise the proceeds for good causes. According to the Lottery Foundation, there are two reasons why it would. First, more people would play because they would feel good about the profits going to charity. Second, there would be lower financing costs because shareholders would not need to receive dividends. Neither of these arguments looks all that compelling. Most of the evidence suggests that people play lotteries because they hope to get rich, not because they feel charitable. Moreover, although the Lottery Foundation would not pay dividends, it would still need to raise debt to finance its operations. Lack of equity might even be a drawback not an advantage. Without the comfort of an equity cushion, lenders might insist on higher interest rates. And if it was saddled with a high gearing ratio, the lottery would probably have to run itself conservatively. As a result, it could be prevented from pursuing strategies that maximised the return to good causes. This is not to say that the Branson/Young bid should be rejected on a priori grounds. It may hold out the best prospect for maximising funds for good causes if, for example, its rivals are too greedy. If so, it will deserve to win. Otherwise, not.</p>

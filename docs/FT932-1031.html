			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Present Laughter - Theatre If you want to see just one play in London's West End this summer, go for the revival of Noel Coward's Present Laughter at the Globe. It is not Coward's best piece and lacks the precision of Hay Fever and Private Lives, but under Tom Conti's direction there are times when it seems the next best thing and, because you may not be too familiar with it, there should be new delights. Conti stars as well as directing. He plays Gary Essendine, the actor, lover, writer and wit who comes close to being Coward's idealised version of himself. This dual role of actor/director is at the heart of the production. It allows Conti to dictate the pace. At times, playing Essendine, he is the protagonist: for example, when he savages a young would-be dramatist for wanting to write pyschological plays, like Chekov. Go into rep, Essendine tells him, and learn what is 'actable'. The young man, memorably played here by James Purefoy, is duly stunned and henceforth wants to act, write and live like Coward. At other times, Conti the director becomes more detached. He stands back and watches the action going on around him - from lovers, admirers and domestiques alike. There is, if you are looking for theatrical influences, a remarkable amount of Present Laughter in John Osborne's Inadmissible Evidence, which was revived at the Royal National Theatre last week. Compare the use of the telephone in both plays, as well as the promiscuity. Where Coward and Conti score is in the detail and the household arrangements. Essendine has three domestic helpers: a spiritualist Scandinavian housekeeper played by Hana-Maria Pravda who has a devastating touch with the hoover, a valet called Fred and a wonderfully smart secretary (Gabrielle Drake) on whom he depends for almost everything but romance. Not only do these wildly different people get along well enough with each other; Essendine is at home with all of them. This is the classless society or Coward showing off the breadth of his taste. There is also a beautiful semi-separated wife ready to come to the rescue whenever danger lurks or another woman threatens to go too far. Certainly as played by Judy Loe she is a sparkling asset, a supremely elegant dea ex machina always at the end of a telephone line at the right time. Thus here is the essence of the Coward-Conti family. Just like the Bliss family in Hay Fever no one else is allowed more than a look-in for long, though some of the supporting parts in Present Laughter are weaker. There is very little to be said for the two male roles of Henry and Morris who looks as if they have strayed in from the nearest golf club. Possibly that is a fault of the production rather than the original Coward. If so, it is the only one. Conti's own performance is to be treasured. He passes the ultimate acting test of sometimes being even better when he is silent than when he is speaking. Watch him just observing other people. He is marvellously vain. Whenever the door bell rings, he moves towards the mirror to preen himself. When it rings almost for the last time, he makes the same instinctive movement then draws back as if to say 'sod it]' He makes Coward seem a much nicer man than he probably was, and he makes Present Laughter the play to see.

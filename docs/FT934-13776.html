			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Wolseley Wolseley is a modest company with little to be modest about. Despite setbacks in California and sticky progress in France, Wolseley still succeeded in lifting earnings per share by 28 per cent last year. Good stock control, a strong balance sheet and promising acquisitions leave it well placed for further growth. Although a 6 per cent dividend increase looks meagre against earnings growth, its 2.5 times cover should enable the company to sustain a progressive pay-out policy, which is more than can be said for many in the building materials sector. The main irritation, though, concerns Wolseley's recent penchant for issuing paper. The company has effectively staged a one-for-four rights issue on the quiet by seeping shares into the market through placings. Even here, though, it can perhaps be excused. Reasonably enough, Wolseley argues acquisitive growth should be financed with equity and organic growth with cash. So far, at least, the new shares have been used to buy earnings-enhancing assets. Nevertheless, having outperformed the sector by more than 200 per cent since the start of 1990, Wolseley's shares would appear to have little room for more. Since it never plumbed the depths in recession, Wolseley's earnings recovery may also be less striking than that of its more reckless peers. Building materials stocks are also unlikely to be too frisky ahead of the Budget. The fear is the Chancellor may bear down heavily on local government and housing spending.</p>

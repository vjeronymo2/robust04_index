			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGES  </P> <P> With regard to your editorial ("Change in the Offing," Oct. 26), I would like  to give you some missing information about Hope Logan, a candidate for Board of  Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges.  </P> <P> Her opponent, Denise Moreno Ducheny, appears to be promoted by you partially  for "the kind of fire needed on this board."  </P> <P> Others, as you state, see her style as confrontational. A confrontational  style, in my experience, is simply ineffective.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Hope Logan, a former professor at San Diego State  University, has been remarkably effective on boards from which she has gained  vast experience. Your editorial states: "Either woman would make an exemplary  trustee."  </P> <P> As I have sat on a board of directors and on several committees with Logan, I  have seen her in action. Hope Logan is impressive in her determination to solve  problems. She is a powerful negotiator and communicator. Her reasons are backed  by factual data. Hope Logan is persuasive in her dialogues. Her successful  community service record is an indication of her superb leadership ability.  </P> <P> San Diego is fortunate to have such a caring and capable candidate as Hope  Logan for the Board of Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges.  </P> <P> LOIS M. KOHN, La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Redford the Environmentalist: Robert Redford urged a new crop of university  graduates over the weekend to force politicians into ending a decade of "naked  greed and profit at the expense of the environment."  </P> <P> The actor and longtime environmental activist spoke Saturday at commencement  ceremonies on the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts. "It is time  to send a message to our elected officials that if they do not protect our  environment they will be voted out of office or never get elected in the first  place," he said. Redford, who received an honorary doctorate of science degree,  also criticized President Bush for failing to follow up on campaign promises to  improve the environment. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

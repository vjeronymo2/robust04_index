The injured Israelis, who are  members of the General Security Service [Shin Bet], were  transferred to hospital, while security forces have been  searching for the attackers. More from Alan Ben-'Ami:    The three Israelis were attacked near the entrance to the  village of Baytuniya beside Ramallah and about 12 km north of  Jerusalem. The indications are that there were two gunmen  waiting in ambush. The Israelis drove by in a saloon car and  came under a hail of automatic weapons fire. Dozens of bullets  penetrated their vehicle. One of the men was mortally wounded in  the head and chest, the other two were both injured by metal  splinters in the head, and one was wounded in the shoulder,  while his companion was injured in the hand. [passage omitted]    A curfew has been placed on Baytuniya, the surrounding area,  and parts of Ramallah as the security forces try to find the  perpetrators of this latest attack.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Network Channel 1 in Hebrew at  1800 GMT on 13 February adds that "Hamas has claimed  responsibility for the attack." Later in the newsreel, the  anchor announces: "It has been just released for publication  that 28-year-old Shin Bet member No'am Kohen from Jerusalem, who  was wounded in the Baytuniya attack today, has died of his  wounds."]</p>

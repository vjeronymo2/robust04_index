			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is meeting in New York  to examine the situation in Rwanda. [passage omitted]    Rwanda was also on the agenda of the talks of the 12 foreign  ministers in Brussels today. The Europeans have committed  themselves to increase their humanitarian effort in favor of the  victims of the civil war. They also want to try and give a  fresh boost to the political negotiations process. This is what  the French foreign minister [Alain Juppe] said after the meeting:    [Begin Juppe recording] What is happening in Rwanda at the  moment deserves to be called a genocide. In the face of this  unbearable situation, what can the international community do,  and what will France do?    First of all, it must intensify its humanitarian aid. How  can this humanitarian aid be forwarded, first of all to those  Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi -- this is one of the  points of implementation of France's humanitarian aid -- and  then to Rwanda itself through the ICRC [International Committee  of Red Cross], the nongovernmental organization which is most  present on the ground right now in Rwanda?    Secondly, we must do our utmost so that an international  humanitarian force is deployed on the ground as quickly as  possible. It must be a UN force, since it is the only one which  has the required speed and efficiency.    Thirdly, we must support mediators in the region. In that  respect, the idea of a summit of the heads of state in the  region -- which would make it possible to start fresh  negotiations on the basis of the Arusha accords - is supported  by France.

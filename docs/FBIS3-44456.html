			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A few days ago, Chen Xitong, secretary of the  municipal party committee, went to the Wangfujing Department  Store (Group) Company Limited to conduct investigation and  study. He also heard Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan  Shopping Center's reports on 1993 work and 1994 work  arrangements, urged these two enterprises to make development in  accordance with the systems of modern commercial enterprises and  large groups and to bring into full play their role as the  political core of the party. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong affirmed the work achievements of these two  enterprises, set forth three tasks, and also asked to fulfill  the tasks in 1994.    First, put development in line with the modern commercial  enterprise system. According to the guidelines of the central  authorities, we should set up a modern enterprise system with  commercial characteristics and particularly create experiences  in developing holding companies. Our shareholding enterprises  should have Chinese characteristics, proceed from reality, free  themselves from both modern and traditional restrictions, have  the leadership of the party, have their stocks controlled by the  state, and ensure to abide by the state laws, principles, and  policies. We should know that there must be two possibilities  in carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis since  the system is impossibly perfect. So, we should strive to gain  advantages and avoid disadvantages.    Second, develop toward the orientation of large groups. Each  of Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan Shopping Center creates  more than 1 billion yuan of marketing volume. However, they are  still small groups. They should strive to be large groups. For  instance, they should specifically define the amounts of  property, the number of overseas enterprises, and the number of  branches. They should have the daring to be socialist enterprise  owners. Instead of staying at and moving around the original  place, we should go out of the municipality and the national  border to make development. We must neither accomplish in one  mover nor develop slowly. We should make bigger strides and  make bigger development.    Third, bring into full play the role as the party's  political core. Shareholding enterprises are not different from  the original enterprises. How can they bring into play the  functions of the party? The department store has some  experiences in this regard. So, we should further develop these  experiences and strive to form systems. The party committees  should supervise and guarantee the socialist orientation of  enterprises. This function must neither be weakened nor shaken,  but should be strengthened. If this function is shaken, we will  not be able to develop the socialist market economy. The  enterprise party committees and branches should strive to make  explorations and create experiences in the course of deepening  reform.    After the forum, Chen Xitong zestfully inspected the newly  reconstructed goods yard of the department store; also cordially  talked with the salesclerks; and asked them about the marketing,  contract, payment, and living situation.    Also joining the investigation and study activities were  Ouyang Wenan and Duan Bingren, standing committee members of the  municipal party committee; Meng Xuenong, vice mayor of the  municipality; and responsible persons of the municipal  departments concerned.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroo Yasue, General Manager, Technical </F> Development Department, Technology Research Association for  Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell Power Generation System]    [Text]  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   MCFC power generation is expected to meet the global  environment in the 21st century due to its higher electric power  generation efficiency and smaller SO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  and  NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions. Many efforts have been made for R&amp;D  on MCFC power generation system since the early 1980s in the  United States of America, Japan and Europe.    The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in  the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has  organized a national project (Moonlight Project) aiming for new  energy systems, in which MCFC project has been promoted in  cooperation with New Energy and Industrial Technology  Development Organization (NEDO) and their contractors. MCFC  Research Association was established in February 1988 to  accelerate the R&amp;D on stack operation, plant system and  equipment, coal gasification combined system, and new materials.    At present, a second-stage plan targeting the development of  a 1000kW class pilot plant is being conducted. In order to  achieve this target, 100kW class stacks by external reforming  type cells, peripheral equipment and system control technology  are to be developed and assessed by FY93. Then, the fabrication  of the 1000kW pilot plant will immediately start and a  demonstration test will be completed by FY97.    The current status of R&amp;D for MCFC power generation  system  are presented here.  <H5>  1. MCFC Power Generation System </H5>   A basic power generation system of LNG fueled-MCFC is  illustrated in Figure 1. The system consists mainly of reformer,  stack, AC/DC converter, gas recycle blower (high temperature  blower), and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-09A>           Figure 1. Basic System of MCFC Power Generation </FIG>       A gas mixture of LNG and steam is fed at 800&deg;C and 3ata  to the refomer tube packed with Ni catalyst on which reforming  reactions take place to form hydrogen rich gas. The resulting  gas is introduced to the anode and hydrogen reacts with  carbonate ion from cathode through electrolyte to generate  electricity. The anode exhaust gas is to the reformer and is  catalytically combusted to produce heat needed for endothermic  reforming reactions. The combusted gas containing carbon dioxide  is fed to the cathode. The cathode exhaust is recycled by the  high temperature blower to recover heat produced in power  generation. Energy in the cathode exhaust from the recycle line  is recovered by the turbine compressor and HRSG. Compressed air  by the compressor is fed to the cathode and oxygen reacts with  carbon dioxide and electron from anode to form carbonate ion.  Steam from HRSG is mixed with LNG at the inlet of the reformer.  <H3>  2. Demonstration Tests at Akagi Research Laboratory (Akagi  Stack and System Square) </H3>   Akagi 3S was constructed in October 1990 by MCFC Research  Association to test 100kW stacks and 1,000kW plant equipment,  for example, reformer, high temperature blower, turbine  compressor, and HRSG by this September.  <H5>  2.1 100kW Class Stack Operation Tests </H5>   NEDO is developing two 100kW-class MCFC stacks (multiple  large capacity type and rectangular large capacity type).    The test is intended for the confirmation of the performance  of these stacks. The target values of 100kW stacks are initial  cell voltage of 0.8V at 150mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and decay rate of  less than 1&percnt;/1000 hours.    Taking the test results into consideration, four 250kW fuel  cell stacks will be designed and manufactured as the main  component of the pilot plant.  <H5>  2.2 1000kW Class Fuel Processing Subsystem Tests </H5>   The tests are aimed at confirming the performance of the two  newly developed reformers, namely: heat exchanger type and  two-stage catalytic combustion type (Figure 2). These reformers  produce hydrogen rich gas to be supplied to fuel cell anode.  Heat for processing reaction is obtained by the catalytic  combustion of low calorie anode exhaust gas. The tests with full  scale (1000kW) capacity are now proceeding.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-10A>           Figure 2. Outline of Two Types of Reformer </FIG>       The heat exchanger type consists of catalytic combuster to  produce 1200&deg;C gas and reformer tubes.    The anode exhaust is introduced to the first combuster and  combusted on a Pd/Al&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; -ZrO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  catalyst to produce a gas of 1000&deg;C followed by secondary  combustion on thermally conductive SiC. A reforming catalyst of  0.24m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt;  are packed in 6 reformer tubes of 165mm in  diameter. In case of the 1000kW plant, LNG of 141kg/h is fed at  S/C of 3 and hydrogen rich gas of 1154Nm&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; /h is  produced.    The two-stage catalytic combustion type consists of 16  reformer tubes of 165mm in diameter which are directly contact  with two combustion catalyst bed. The tube is a dual column type  and contains a reforming catalyst of 0.5m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; . The  configuration of the combustion catalyst bed was simulated from  physical and basic experimental data and verified by a 100kW  test plant. The start up time within 3.5hrs and NOx emission of  4ppm at steady state have been confirmed.  <H5>  2.3 1000kW Class Stack Peripheral System Tests </H5>   The installation of the test apparatus was finished in  August  1993.    The performance of the newly developed high temperature  blower and cell differential pressure control will be tested. A  part of the control equipment and the high temperature blower  are completely manufactured.    Demonstration tests are intended to confirm: (1) optimum  differential pressure control method between the anode and the  cathode, (2) heat resistance and performance characteristics of  the high temperature blower, etc.  <H5>  2.4 1000kW Class Heat Recovery System Tests </H5>   The full scale test facilities were constructed in August  1993.    Demonstration tests will be performed on the turbine  compressor for producing compressed air by means of the kinetic  energy of the cathode outlet gas and HRSG for producing the  steam for fuel processing reaction with recovered heat of the  turbine outlet gas.    Demonstration tests are intended to confirm:    (1) performance characteristics and emergency shutdown  characteristics of the turbine compressor, etc.    (2) heat conducting characteristics, load response and  startup/shutdown characteristics of HRSG.  <H5>  Afterward </H5>   The development and demonstration of the 1000kW class pilot  plant as the ultimate target of the phase-II R&amp;D project of  the  MCFC power generation system will be started soon based on the  interim report of the Evaluation Subcommittee of the Energy  Conservation Technology Development Committee in the Industrial  Technology Council, an advisory organ for the Minister of  International Trade and Industry.    In order to enhance our activities for the construction of  the pilot plant, the research and development including fuel  cell stacks development was unified to our association and the  members from electric utilities was newly joined our association  in May 1993.  <H5>  Acknowledgment </H5>   This work has been performed under the sponsorship of the  New  Energy and Industrial Technology Organization.</p>

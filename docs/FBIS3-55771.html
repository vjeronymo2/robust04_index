			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to the United States Sergey </F> Mikalayevich Martynov by Vasil Spas; place and date not given:  "U.S. President Chose Minsk Not Accidentally"]    [Text] [Spas] Syarhey Mikalayevich, in a few days,  U.S. President Bill Clinton will pay an official visit to Minsk.  This will be the second U.S.-Belarusian summit within the last  six months, which is rather unprecedented in relations between  the largest state in the world and a rather small country such  as Belarus. In connection with this, how would you describe  relations between Minsk and Washington, and what has been  achieved in our relations over the last six months?    [Martynov] Relations between Belarus and the United States  were officially classified as friendly in a joint declaration,  which was adopted at the first meeting between Stanislav  Shushkevich and Bill Clinton in July of last year.    The first July visit by a Belarusian delegation was not held  without a reason, but occurred as a result of efforts made over  the entire existence of relations between Belarus and the United  States. While speaking about achievements of this period, one  must emphasize that Belarus has signed with the United States an  array of agreements on cooperation in the military-technical  sphere. The main ones among them were signed during the visit  by Stanislav Shushkevich to the United States. These agreements  are still paving the way for relations between the United States  and other countries of the former Soviet Union: There have been  no similar agreements between the United States and other CIS  countries, except with Belarus. We are the only ones with whom  the United States has signed agreements on cooperation in  military conversion and in ecological restoration of  radioactively and chemically polluted strategic nuclear weapons  facilities. Such agreements, I would like to emphasize, exist  only between Belarus and the United States.    Currently, we are receiving $76 million in disarmament aid  from the United States, and we would like to receive additional  funds for this purpose in 1994.    We have received considerable economic assistance in the  form  of preferential deliveries of grain and bread. Additionally, an  array of programs is being introduced -- some of them are  currently being reexamined -- regarding technical cooperation  between the United States and Belarus in establishing a  financial-credit system, a monetary system, development of  private farming, etc.    [Spas] The January trip to Europe by Bill Clinton will  be his first visit to the Old World as U.S. President.  Moreover, this is a very short visit -- altogether about one  week. This way, Minsk is one of the four European capitals to  be visited by President Clinton. Why, in your opinion, did he  choose Belarus as one of the points of his brief European tour?    [Martynov] Why did the President choose Minsk as one of the  points on his first European itinerary? Probably, only Bill  Clinton himself could give a more precise answer to this  question. From our point of view, the choice was determined by  the constructive and weighed course in Belarus' disarmament and  foreign policies, as well as by Belarus' position as the most  stable post-Soviet republic, which has not shed a drop of blood  during the process of deep transformations, and which is  conducting democratic and economic reforms.    Another factor is that the United States is interested in  the  development of relations with Belarus, and there are directions  which require a more active impulse at a higher level. In  particular, this regards the development of economic cooperation  between the United States and Belarus.    [Spas] What could you say about prospects for the  development of economic cooperation between the two countries?  So far, the political and, I would say, military-political  aspects have been the center of attention of U.S.-Belarusian  relations.    [Martynov] A goal of the development of our economic  relations, and simultaneously, a goal of the preparations for  the visit, is, first of all, the establishment of legal grounds,  on which trade and credit relations between the United States  and Belarus will be later developing. Second, it is possible  that certain issues of cooperation in abolishing trade barriers  will also be addressed, and Belarus will receive assistance in  establishing a market economy infrastructure, speeding the pace  of economic reform, privatization, etc.    [Spas] Speaking about U.S.-Belarusian relations, one  cannot forget the humanitarian aid the United States delivers to  Belarus.    [Martynov] Yes, our Embassy cooperates with numerous  humanitarian organizations. The aid they have already sent to  Belarus, first of all to Chernobyl victims, amounts to millions  of dollars. I expect that this assistance will continue. We  also receive a great deal of humanitarian aid from the U.S.  Government.    [Spas] Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk will undoubtedly  increase Belarus' popularity in the United States, thanks to our  foreign and disarmament policies. This will also be reflected  in the improvement of economic relations between the United  States and Belarus.    [Martynov] Belarus' popularity in the United States is not  the only goal of our relations. Conditions suitable for  investments and prospects for improved business relations also  play an important role. As soon as such conditions are created,  the message will come very quickly.    [Spas] At a briefing held in Washington on 16  December, a top U.S. Administration official stated that Belarus  is a very important country. We have already underlined the  importance of Bill Clinton's choice, however, what did that  official have in mind saying that Belarus is a very important  country?    [Martynov] Of course, this opinion, voiced by a top White  House official, is not accidental. The White House does not  voice such statements accidentally. As we believe, the opinion  was determined by the geopolitical and strategic position of  Belarus in Europe in general, and in Eastern Europe in  particular, as well as the uniqueness of Belarus' position among  post-Soviet countries. In this sense, Belarus can serve as an  example of a post-Soviet country, which develops quite  successfully, of course, taking into account certain objective  economic hardships.</p>

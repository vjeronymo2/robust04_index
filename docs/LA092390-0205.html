			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ENROLLMENT JUMPS 7% AT VENTURA COLLEGE  </P> <P> Ventura College's enrollment for the fall semester has jumped by more than 7%  over last year, officials said.  </P> <P> Registration figures show that 12,393 students have enrolled, a 7.14% increase  over the 11,567 students who enrolled by mid-September, 1989.  </P> <P> "We believe the increase in enrollment can be attributed in part to the rising  cost of an education at the university level," said John Woolley, vice  president for student services. "Ventura College has proven itself to be very  affordable."  </P></p>

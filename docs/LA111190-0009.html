			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ / ALBUM REVIEWS  </P> <P>  JON HENDRICKS "Freddie Freeloader" Denon  </P> <P> Guest artists abound on this session. George Benson is in splendid virtuosic  form, singing Hendricks' words to what was originally a Cannonball Adderley sax  solo on the title cut, from Miles Davis' classic "Kind of Blue" date.  </P> <P> On the same track, Bobby McFerrin sings the Wynton Kelly piano solo, Al Jarreau  handles lyrics to Miles' solo and Hendricks himself tackles the John Coltrane  passage. Hendricks' vocals with the Count Basie band on "Fas' Living Blues" and  "The Finer Things in Life" are delightful. Wynton Marsalis has solos on two  cuts and Manhattan Transfer, aided by multiple overdubbing, is gloriously  effective on "High As a Mountain," based on Miles Davis-Gil Evans' "Song Number  Two." Few weak numbers here, showing Hendricks remains the supreme master of  vocalese. Leonard Feather  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LENO ROYALTIES DEVOTED TO AIDS  </P> <P> Comic Jay Leno will donate royalties from his book "Headlines" to a charity  that helps children stricken with AIDS.  </P> <P> "My manager had a 3-year-old baby that died of AIDS and at the time people  thought it couldn't happen to them," Leno said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Profits from the book, a collection of wacky newspaper headlines that has sold  more than 250,000 copies, will go to the Samuel Jared Kushnick Foundation,  founded by his manager, Helen Kushnick. Leno said he does not know how much  money is involved.  </P> <P> Kushnick's son died in 1983 after receiving an AIDS-tainted blood transfusion.  </P> <P> She said Leno's effort "makes me feel Sam didn't die in vain."  </P></p>

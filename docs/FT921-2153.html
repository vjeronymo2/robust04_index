			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Watchdog drops case on Air NZ stake THE New Zealand Commerce Commission, the monopolies watchdog, yesterday withdrew its case against Brierley Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group, and Qantas Airways, the Australian national carrier, over their stakes in Air New Zealand, Reuter reports from Wellington. The commission said it had withdrawn because it had achieved its main objective of preventing the acquisition by Qantas of further shares in Air NZ without commission clearance. Qantas holds 19.9 per cent Air NZ and BIL 42.5 per cent. 'The commission has concluded that its action to block the acquisition by Qantas has been vindicated and has been successful,' Ms Susan Lojkine, the commission chairman said. The commission had alleged that Qantas and BIL made an oral agreement before they, along with Japan Airlines (JAL) and American Airlines, bought Air NZ in April 1989. American, a unit of AMR of the US, recently sold its 7.5 per cent stake to BIL. Qantas had earlier sought to buy the stake. Ms Lojkine said Qantas and BIL would give undertakings to the New Zealand courts, including an undertaking in respect of BIL's purchase of American's stake. The commission had received an affidavit from Mr Paul Collins, BIL chief executive, stating that there was not, and never had been, any arrangement or understanding between Qantas and BIL that Qantas was to exert management control over Air New Zealand. When the consortium to buy Air NZ was set up, Qantas agreed to guarantee the dividend for BIL's Air NZ shares and to assure BIL a minimum selling price on part of its stake.</p>

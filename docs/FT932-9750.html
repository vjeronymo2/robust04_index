			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ericsson bounces back to profit in first three months STRONG demand and cost-cutting helped Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, swing back into profit in the first quarter of this year. The group, which has announced a series of big new orders in recent days, said pre-tax profit amounted to SKr428m (Dollars 57.8m), compared with a SKr363m loss in the first three months of 1992. However, the results fell short of stock market expectations and the company's B shares slid SKr9 to SKr291. The group reaffirmed its forecast of a significantly improved result for the whole of this year. In 1992, the group recorded profits of SKr1.30bn. Order intake was healthy and sales were rising. First-quarter orders rose 34 per cent to SKr17.5bn while sales - helped by the weaker Swedish krona - increased 36 per cent to SKr12.9bn. Ericsson's orders have risen for six successive quarters. The most impressive growth has been recorded by the company's radio communications division, which houses its mobile phone operations. Order intake here increased by 58 per cent. It exceeded the level of orders recorded by the group's more traditional public telecommunications business for the first time. Radio communications sales rose to SKr4.76bn from SKr2.73bn, while public communications lifted sales to SKr5.03bn from SKr4.16bn. A growth area for the company was Asia, where sales rose to SKr2.15bn from SKr935m. China has become the company's fifth-largest market, accounting for 7 per cent of sales, compared with just 1 per cent a year ago. Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, said the group's order backlog of SKr45bn at the end of the first quarter was its highest, and SKr7bn more than at the beginning of the year. He noted that although sales had been lifted the depreciation of the krona had so far had little impact on profits.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television ScreenPlay; Safe (BBC2, 9.25) won two awards at the Edinburgh International Film Festival this year, a not inconsiderable achievement for a small-budget film against lavishly funded competitors. It is a typical teenage romance of our time, which means to say that it is about homelessness, drugs, alcohol and prostitution. Notes written on lavatory paper by hunger striker Bobby Sands in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland are treasured by Republicans as if they were holy relics of early Christian martyrs. Timewatch: Hunger Strike, a Hidden History (BBC2, 8.00) disinters the ghastly 1981 confrontation between the British government and Republican 'martyrs', 10 of whom fasted to death. Another jail-death, this time inflicted by the state through lethal injection, is examined in Inside Story: Rector versus Clinton (BBC 1, 9.30). In January 1992, with poll ratings looking queasy, governor Bill Clinton showed his cloven hoof - or if you prefer, his passion for justice. He rejected the appeal for clemency of Rickey Ray Rector, a mentally ill black murderer.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: FT broadens gold mine index The Financial Times is replacing the gold mines index, which is based on the performance of South African companies only, with one enlarged to include gold producers from other parts of the world. Regional indices covering three geographic areas will be published at the same time. The accompanying chart shows the new indices' values and illustrates their high leverage to the price of the precious metal. It also highlights differences in the performances of the regional indices. The 1993 year-end gold price of Dollars 391 a troy ounce (up by 17 per cent compared with 31 December 1992) translated into a jump of more than 100 per cent for the new gold mines index over the same 12 months. Gold mining companies are included in the index if they: Have sustainable, attributable gold production of at least 300,000 ounces a year; Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from mined gold sales; Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing public. These conditions mean that there will be no set number of constituents and the eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year. The present 34 constituents account for about 53 per cent of western world output, or about 31m ounces. Australasia is represented by Dominion Mining; Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Highlands Gold; Homestake Gold Australia; Newcrest; Placer Pacific; Plutonic Resources and Poseidon Gold. Canadian constituents include American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo Bay Mines; Hemlo Gold Mines; Lac Minerals; Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome and TVX Gold. From South Africa there is Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein; Elandsrand; Freegold; Harmony; Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof; Randfontein; Southvaal; Vaal Reefs; Western Areas; Western Deep Levels; and Winkelhaak. US mines in the new index include Battle Mountain Gold; Homestake Mining; and Newmont Gold. The index reflects the sum of the market capitalisations of the component companies, denominated in US dollars and based at 1,000 on December 31, 1992, when the gold price was Dollars 333 an ounce. On December 31 last year the gold price was Dollars 390.75 and the index was 2,232.1. It has been calculated back to December 1991, so a two-year history is available. Calculations follow the close of business on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges. Indicative index values will be published weekly until the end of this month and then the FT will publish daily figures, including yield, highs/lows and, on Mondays only, market capitalisations.</p>

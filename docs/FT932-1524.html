			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood improves to Pounds 55m - Underlying growth as period of consolidation draws to a close PROFITS at Hazlewood Foods advanced from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 55m pre-tax in the year to March 31 despite a number of adverse influences. The group said that underlying growth in the base business, excluding acquisitions and one-off factors, was 5 per cent. Mr Peter Barr, chairman, said the period of consolidation, where its numerous operations have been rationalised and integrated, was now coming to an end. The next stage was to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, to maintain and eventually increase margins. Hazlewood, which operates mainly in the UK and the Netherlands, saw strong growth from its convenience foods activities. The period covered 53 weeks, the extra week worth Pounds 1.3m to profits. There was a Pounds 2.7m benefit from sterling devaluation offset by a Pounds 1.4m cost as debtor balances were translated at new rates. Recovery in the cockle business, hit the previous year by fishing restrictions, added back Pounds 2.6m to profits. Acquisitions, such as a full year contribution from Sutherland, which was included for 7 months the previous year, chipped in Pounds 2.9m. However, a botulism scare at a meat subsidiary cost Pounds 1m and sharp falls in tomato and capsicum prices cut Pounds 2.7m from profits. A more conservative depreciation policy added Pounds 1m to the charge and interest payable rose Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.8m. Group turnover was 20.5 per cent higher at Pounds 761.8m and operating profits were up 11 per cent to Pounds 66.8m. Mr John Simons, finance director, said that margins were maintained if the effect of a full year's inclusion of the lower margin distribution activities of Sutherland were taken into account. Earnings per share rose 8.1 per cent to 17.75p. A proposed 4.1p final dividend makes a 6.4p total, a 4.9 per cent improvement on last year's 6.1p. In the grocery and non foods division profits rose from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 15.8m. In the frozen foods division profits were up from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 27.1m, helped by the recovery in the cockle business and growth in ready meals. In fresh foods profits were up from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 22m as convenience foods more than doubled its contribution, offseting declines in meat and produce. A high level of capital expenditure, at Pounds 49.2m, and spending on acquisitions totalling Pounds 20.9m, including Pounds 9.7m of integration costs, led to a rise in net debt from Pounds 109.7m to Pounds 157.2m, increasing gearing from 69 to 95 per cent. Since the year end the group has sold its Dutch confectionery business for Pounds 14.2m. COMMENT Hazlewood is slowly translating its promises into action and at least the profits are moving up again, if not yet back to the Pounds 57.1m made in 1990. Conditions for food manufacturers have been tough, and if anything Hazlewood has been somewhat protected by having a third of its customers in continental Europe. That might not be such good news as mainland Europe goes further into recession. But it is pressing on with its plan to grow the higher added-value activities and allow the less exciting areas to become a smaller part of the whole. Gearing is a concern, but capital expenditure will fall this year. 1993-94 profits might top Pounds 60m, putting the shares, down 7p to 189p yesterday, on a prospective p/e of about 10, which is not taking too much on trust.</p>

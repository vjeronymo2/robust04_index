			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Wen: "Guangdong Curtailing Illicit Trade in </F> Currency"]    [Text] Guangzhou--Government officials in Guangdong are  putting the brakes on the illegal trading of foreign exchange  futures by financial consultancies.    Ji Guoyan, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Futures  Supervision and Administration Commission, said such illegal  trading is plaguing China's fledgling futures market.    "Owing to an imperfect management system and inexperienced  traders, the market provides some openings for speculators," Jin  said.    Aiming to stop the illegal practice, about 20 officials from  the province's futures regulatory organizations and the  Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau recently  launched a surprise night attack on six companies in Guangzhou.    Most such companies rent offices in the most expensive  buildings in downtown Guangzhou, like the International  Building, the International Finance Building, and the World  Trade Centre.    All six companies were caught doing futures trading, which  goes beyond their authorized business scope as stipulated by the  local industrial and commercial bureau.    Inspectors found evidence that the companies were helping  clients buy and sell foreign exchange through computers  connected to foreign swap markets.    The companies' registered business certificates clearly  specify that they confine themselves to providing information or  advice on real estate, engineering and finance. This means they  are not entitled to deal in foreign exchange trading. The six  companies were ordered to stop operating and to return client's  cash deposits within 30 days.    Since the Bank of China authorized Guangzhou to open foreign  exchange futures trading last year, the province has been very  careful in issuing licenses to companies.    Among the 156 future companies in the province, only 12 are  authorized to deal in such business.    With a registered capital of HK$50,000 ($6,400), approved  and  registered companies can help clients conduct margin trading  with cash deposits of HK$4 million ($512,000).    Some companies have no connections with international  futures  trading exchanges. Others hire unqualified dealers and cheat  their customers.    According to a local magazine, residents of the affluent  Pearl River Delta region have been cheated of more than HK$1  billion ($130 million).    To prevent such abuses, futures companies must now operate  from two sides: overseas companies provide the investment and  brokers, and the Chinese side administers.    The State Foreign Exchange Administration last June ordered  all futures companies listed with the State Industrial and  Commercial Administration Bureau to be checked and re-registered.</p>

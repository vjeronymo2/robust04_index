			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lord Sainsbury comes under attack on Sunday trading LORD SAINSBURY bade farewell to J Sainsbury's shareholders at the grocery chain's annual meeting yesterday after 23 years as chairman. However, in spite of his glowing remarks about the company's past achievements and encouraging comments about its current trading prospects, his swan-song was marred by shareholders objecting to the company's stance on Sunday trading. Some said Sainsbury's lacked integrity by flouting the law and disturbed the peace of those who lived near its stores by opening seven days a week. 'We do have a serious violence problem in this country, and it's not right that big organisations should be seen to break the law in this way when small people are penalised,' one shareholder said. Lord Sainsbury replied that the company did take the matter very seriously but observed that polls indicated that two thirds of its shoppers wanted its stores to stay open on Sundays. He also pointed out that, according to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, no one trading on Sundays was breaking the law because the House of Lords had decided the law was not clear. But even if some shareholders remained dubious about the company's stance on Sunday trading, they could hardly quibble with the company's results under Lord Sainsbury's stewardship. When Lord Sainsbury became chairman in 1969 - then as Mr John Sainsbury - pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 4.3m (or Pounds 33m in 1992 prices). Last year, the UK's biggest retailer made pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m. Commenting on current trading, Lord Sainsbury said the year had started well with food price inflation being 'lower than we expected and sales volumes slightly higher'. Stores opened this year were trading well and 22 were likely to be completed by the year-end, he said. Lord Sainsbury will hand over the chairmanship to his cousin, David, in November.</p>

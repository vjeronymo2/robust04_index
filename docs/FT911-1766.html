			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: Non-executive directors and their role in corporate governance Sir, The recent report of the Institutional Shareholders Committee on the best practice in the role and duties of directors ('Code urges separation of company boards' top roles', April 19) is a curious and disappointing paper. A statement of best practice on an important topic is useful when such practice represents a satisfactory solution to the problem. When, however, the best practice cannot begin to remedy the much-publicised basic weaknesses in British corporate governance, such a paper is particularly unsatisfactory. For over two years an important debate has been continuing on the inadequacies of British corporate governance, most notably in your paper and The Economist. It has covered the related subjects of short-termism, excessive takeover activity and absentee shareholders. Much analysis has occurred and many remedies have been proposed. All this is ignored by the committee's paper. Your writers, Richard Waters (April 19) and Barry Riley (April 20) have already commented penetratingly on some of the paper's paradoxes, and particularly the shuffling of all responsibility for better corporate governance on to the already overloaded shoulders of non-executive directors. (The committee expects to put the burden entirely on such directors while taking no part in choosing and nominating them]) The committee only sees them as a combination of nanny and policeman, but at most this should be a subsidiary role. The best non-executive directors can make their contribution by helping businesses to expand profitably - their main role in western Europe. Accordingly, they deserve profit-based incentives as well as executive directors. The most serious weakness in British corporate governance is the lack of committed, knowledgeable long-term owners. The institutions are unwilling to fulfil this role, preferring the right to chop and change investment positions at will. It leaves a vacuum in corporate governance no other entities can fill. This is the prime cause of short-termism. It has reduced long term corporate returns in Britain below west European levels, and far below Japanese levels, yet without benefiting the average institution. Their returns, as Barry Riley reminds us, are lower even than average corporate returns. Everyone loses. In sum, we have a system of corporate governance, ownership and finance inferior to our main European and Far East rivals. Investment institutions must accept their responsibility for this, and join with industry in finding effective remedies. We need fewer institutional shareholders per company, and a knowledgeable long-term commitment from them. Then, as in western Europe they should participate in appointing effective, well remunerated non-executive directors whose main role would be to help companies run profitably. Perhaps the Institutional Shareholders Committee would address these more relevant issues in a further paper. Allen Sykes, Mallington, 29 The Mount, Fetcham, Leatherhead, Surrey</p>

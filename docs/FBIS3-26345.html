Setting the requirements for military affairs in the coming  year, Zhang Wannian said: This year will be a crucial year for  reform, opening up, and economic construction in China. The  development of the situation demands that we further promote  army building and reform, and raise the troops' combat  capability in an all-round manner so as to provide a solid and  powerful security guarantee for the country's reform, opening  up, and modernization drive. In the coming year, we should  persist in taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army building in  the new period as our basic guidelines; earnestly implement the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; further intensify army building in accordance with  the general requirement of "being qualified politically and  competent militarily, having a good work style, maintaining  strict discipline, and being assured of adequate logistic  support" set by Jiang Zemin; make the study of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping the first and most  important task; and use the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of all officers and  men. We should continue to apply the principles of military  strategy in the new period to obtain a comprehensive  understanding of the work situation related to the army; and  enhance the political awareness of the party commanding the gun,  the awareness of the importance of being good at the strategy of  making overall planning, the awareness of our profound  responsibility toward state security and army building, and the  awareness of being a role model in setting strict demands on  ourselves, thereby raising the ideological awareness and  military competence of the vast officers and men in the long  run. We should reinforce the quality of the rank-and-file  cadres, especially leaders at all levels; pay keen attention to  the implementation of the "Outline for Grass-Roots Construction  in the Army" re-issued by the Central Military Commission; and  take new strides and score fresh achievements in improving party  work style and promoting clean administration and socialist  spiritual civilization in the coming year.</p>

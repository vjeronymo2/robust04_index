			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sonia Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Managua, 17 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- General Humberto  Ortega, commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS],  announced his decision today to reduce the Army's presence in  northern Nicaragua to a "minimum" once the 3-80 Northern Front's  unconventional forces are disarmed.    The "demilitarization" of northern Nicaragua and the  inclusion of the demobilized in the National Police are among  the rebels' conditions for establishing a schedule for their  disarmament within the next few days.    Ortega reasserted the Army will reduce to a minimum its  presence in northern Nicaragua--an area of conflict since the  past decade when the contras struggled to topple Daniel Ortega's  government-- after the recontras end the armed struggle.    For the first time ever, Ortega admitted that as total peace  is achieved in Nicaragua "it will become unnecessary for the EPS  to deploy troops."    According to military sources, a meeting between the rebel  leaders and EPS officers with the mediation of a commission  formed by the OAS and Catholic Church is scheduled to take place  on 21 February in the city of Antigua.    This will be the first meeting between the rebels and the  EPS  High Command, who have been political and military foes since  the past decade and over the past two years when the "recontra"  groups emerged.    After presenting a military base to the Natural Resources  and  Environment Ministry, near km 20 on the Managua-Masaya Highway,  Gen. Ortega dismissed the possibility of a "fatal deadline" in  order to achieve results in the talks with the rearmed groups.    He said, nevertheless, his desire is to achieve "as soon as  possible" the demobilization of the main group that is still up  in arms against Violeta Chamorro's government.    Ortega admitted pacification in the north requires economic  and social programs to deal with the region's high levels of  poverty and unemployment and to secure means of survival for  hundreds of rebels who for the second time will lay down their  weapons.    The military chief acknowledged the shortage of jobs in the  country and the "considerable poverty" this generates; he also  said "disarmament is not enough," because effective social  programs must be executed.    Ortega, in a letter he sent recently to 3-80 Northern Front  chief Jose Angel Talavara, guaranteed respect for the lives and  property of members of the group who immediately lay down their  weapons.    Talavera responded with a list of requests that included  social and economic demands and the return of government troops  to their headquarters.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The voting fields WITH peacekeeping operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia dogged by political controversy or worse, Cambodia represents a welcome success story for the United Nations. In a country devastated by years of civil war and by the depredations of the Khmer Rouge, it organised free and fair elections which have led to the establishment of a new constitution and democratic government. The Dollars 2bn operation - now winding down - has achieved more than the UN dared hope when the Paris peace accord was signed two years ago. Cambodia's peace remains fragile. Norodom Sihanouk has become king and must resist the temptation to interfere in government. His son, Ranariddh, has entered what could be an awkward coalition with Hun Sen, premier in the former Vietnamese-installed government. However, the real losers in the electoral process have been the Khmer Rouge, whose tactics in seeking to sabotage the elections have backfired with defections of guerrillas disillusioned and tired of war. The weakening of the Khmer Rouge, if it continues, justifies the UN's determination to hold elections. It is up to Cambodians to make their new political system work. But the international community must still provide assistance. Aid to finance the building of physical infrastructure is essential. Help is also needed to create the elements of a new society: a financial system, a judiciary, education. Aid commitments total around Dollars 1bn but so far little money has reached Cambodia. Efforts to restore the country to the international financial community by clearing its arrears to the International Monetary Fund are a vital way to start the flow of funds. It would be a tragedy if the extraordinary, and costly, efforts of UN personnel in Cambodia were wasted through failure by the international community to follow the task through to the end.</p>

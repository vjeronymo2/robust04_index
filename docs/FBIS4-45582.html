			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Tackling Hard Drugs, Seriously"] </F>   [Text] No one could have been cheered by foreign news  reports recently that fresh sanctions were being imposed on  Nigeria by the United States Government. Unlike last year's  sanctions which had to do with the regress in the  democratisation process, the latest are related to the  increasingly urgent issue of the hard drugs trade. Presidential  memorandum addressed to American officials is directing these to  vote against all Nigerian request for financial assistance at  the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and similar  organisations.    The charge of the Americans is the complicity of the  Nigerian  government in the hard drugs trade, in the area of interdiction,  law enforcement and prosecution of offenders. Specifically, they  allege the uncooperative attitude of Nigerian officials in the  extradition of suspects. They point to four cases of American  request for the extradition of drug barons, only one of which  has been honoured. Government's inaction in the other three  pending cases, is evidence, they claim, of the protection which  the suspects enjoy from the Nigerian government.    In view of the standing Cooperation Agreement between the  two  countries, these are indeed strange and unfortunate  developments. Nigerian officials are wont to point out that the  Agreement is subject to judicial process. In other words, it is  too much to expect that Nigeria would immediately hand over  suspected citizens for prosecution in America, without due  process. Not only would this be a violation of Nigerian law and  sovereignty, the rights of individual citizens could be  infringed. For their part, the Americans profess understanding  of this, but insist that even when clearly documented cases are  prepared for that judicial process, they are frequently  stone-walled by the Nigerian government. Such action, they  charge, can only be deliberate.    The American insistence is premised on claims by its high  officials including the Assistant Secretary of State for  International Narcotics Matters, Robert Gelbard, that more than  a third of all heroin imported into the United States, comes  from Nigerian syndicates. The Nigerian Ambassador to the United  States, Zubair Kazaure denies this, citing in support of his  contention of a report of the U.S. International Narcotics  Centre which declares an improvement in the level of drug  cooperation between Nigeria and the America for the year 1993.    Neither of these recriminatory claims are of any avail in  the  concrete question of tackling a pervasive menace which hard  drugs represent in the world today. There are those who argue  that the American sanctions might in fact be counter-productive  in the long run. The nonchalance or outright complicity of  government officials is unlikely to be significantly altered  merely on account of these sanctions, given our experience with  unelected governments. On the contrary, the ordinary citizenry  which would be more directly affected by them might in fact  become more sympathetic with the cause of the government.    One area, for instance, in which citizens have been  particularly resentful concerns the treatment meted out to  Nigerians abroad. On the strength of certain foreign campaigns,  the image of the average Nigerian is of a drug-peddling,  uninformly [as printed] dishonest character out of dupe his  foreign second in any business dealings. What this eventually  translates into is incessant and unjustifiable harassment of  Nigerians around the airports and seaports of the world.    It is impossible to deny the criminal activities of some  Nigerians abroad. But against the background of many upright and  excellent services rendered by Nigerians in innumerable  institutions, workplaces and environments around the world, the  negative campaign provides only a partial and foreshortened  picture of the country and its people.    Lest this foregoing be interpreted as support for or denial  of the American allegation of government complicity in drug  trafficking, we must hasten to say that the perception of the  National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) can only lend  credence to the allegations. The NDLEA seems not to have been  able to find its feet since its creation. Dogged by frequent  leadership changes, occurring in circumstances which raise  questions of probity and competence, this Agency has so far  failed the nation. When it is not bungling investigations and  prosecutions, it is being trailed by serious scandals  significantly related to drugs.    In the past one year alone, the organisation has had no  fewer  than four heads, and been involved in many more scandals and  failings. And, therefore, unless a serious re-organisation takes  place, we might as well write it off as a hindrance and not a  help in the fight against drugs.    The inability of the government and its agencies to act  promptly and with determination in this fight, gives the  impression that hard drugs are not at all a matter of serious  concern to the nation. They cannot be more wrong. Research shows  that an unfailing pattern in this menace is that from being a  drugs transit country, Nigeria would eventually graduate into a  consuming one. Already, among the offsprings of the well-to-do  in our society, remarkable changes in the consumption pattern  have been noticed. Given our societal propensity for negative  habits and trends to grow rapidly, it cannot be long before  Nigeria becomes one of the drug-consuming nations.    The drugs menace cannot but be seen as a global problem.  Consequently, only in a concerted way, through a network manner  can the world approach the fight against it. Nigeria must  contribute seriously to this struggle. Even if Nigeria were not  so directly implicated, this would still have been a serious  obligation. As it is, Nigeria by acts of omission and  commission, is perceived to be right at the centre of the  problem. It is not a responsibility to shirk or take lightly.  The government can only convince the world of its innocence by  the determined way it sets out to join the rest of mankind in  fighting what is really a global scourge. Recent dismissals at  the NDLEA can only be a first step.</p>

Meanwhile, Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] leader, delivered a serious ultimatum because of the  slowness of government troop confinement.    At the Military Club, Raul Domingos had some "technical  problems" while following the CSC meeting, which would end  rather abruptly, shortly after the Cease-Fire Commission, CCF,  had read its report. The meeting is regarded as crucial and is  scheduled to resume today.    However, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has set 22 January as  the deadline for the government to explain the reason for the  poor turnout of its forces at confinement points.    Speaking shortly before the CSC meeting was due to open, the  Renamo leader warned that "if by 22 January President Chissano  has said nothing in connection with this matter, I shall order a  stop to everything." The CSC meeting had been called to discuss  the relaxation in government troop turnout at confinement points.    Afonso Dhlakama described as unacceptable the explanations  given by the government so far. He added that, in addition to  the fact that the Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, have means of  transportation such as vehicles and aircraft, their troop  confinement points are in easily accessible villages and  district capitals.    Statistics provided by the UN Operations in Mozambique,  Unomoz, indicate that Renamo has already confined more than  5,400 men, as opposed to the government's 8,340 troops. The  total number of men is about 80,000 on the government's side and  20,000 on the Renamo side. This difference makes it clear that  Renamo has so far confined a higher percentage of its forces  than the government.    Dhlakama explained that his threat to stop the troop  confinement process is linked to "pressure from my generals.  They keep asking me: so, Mr. President, you are telling us to  confine our troops, and yet the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] forces are still outside?"    Dhlakama noted that government soldiers are taking advantage  of the fact that his men have gone into their confinement points  to enter areas previously occupied by Renamo. "They (the  government forces) are even murdering civilians in Milange and  Angonia", the Renamo leader said.    Afonso Dhlakama said he was concerned about the fact that  the  international community has not condemned the government's  behavior as vigorously as it has condemned Renamo so far.    "I get nervous, because when we explain that we cannot do  this or that because Frelimo has not yet given us housing, that  prompts Security Council meetings and pressures from this or  that source...now, we have arrived at a crucial stage, we are  confining men who used to fight each other with their  weapons...this is a joke in poor taste."</p>

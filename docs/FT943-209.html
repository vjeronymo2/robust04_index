			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Earl Peel to be adviser on Duchy of Cornwall The Earl Peel, 46, the great-great-grandson of Sir Robert the founder of Britain's police force, is to take over from Lord Ashburton, chairman of BP, as Lord Warden of the Stanneries, an ancient title which means that he will be the senior adviser to the Prince of Wales in running the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy, a mainly agricultural estate of 130,000 acres spread across 23 counties, was set up in 1337 to provide an income for the British heir to the throne. Its activities range from letting farms, to conservation, inner city regeneration and organic farming. Last year the Duchy increased its surplus by 20 per cent to Pounds 4m and its capital grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 87.7m. The Prince of Wales, as chairman of The Prince's Council which advises on the running of the estate, operates it in accordance with his own strongly held environmental and social principles. Lord Peel, vice chairman of the Game Conservancy and a close friend of the Prince, is in the process of selling his family's 26,485 acre Gunnerside estate in North Yorkshire. He is well regarded for having transformed one of Britain's most run down estates into a fine grouse moor. Lord Peel only joined the Prince's Council last year and has a very different business background to that of Lord Ashburton, a member of the Barings banking family. Lord Ashburton, had acted as the Receiver General - the Duchy's financial adviser - for seventeen years before taking over as Lord Warden in 1990. Lord Cairns, chief executive of S G Warburg, took over as the Receiver General and continues to hold that post. Lord Peel takes up his new part-time post on November 1. Meanwhile, Jeremy Sullivan, 49, a lawyer with particular interest in architectural and planning matters, is taking over as the Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. He succeeds Robert Carnwath, 49, who has been appointed a High Court judge. James Furber, 40, who joined Farrer &amp; Co in 1976, has been appointed solicitor to the Duchy succeeding Henry Boyd-Carpenter, 54, another Farrer's solicitor, who is taking over from Sir Matthew Farrer as the private solicitor to the Queen.</p>

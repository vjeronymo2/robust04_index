			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter: A right way to beat exhaustion Sir, Why do most motor vehicles in the UK have the exhaust pipe positioned on the near side? This causes inconvenience and near-asphyxiation to people on the pavement when there is a slow-moving line of traffic. If all right-hand drive vehicles had the exhaust pipe on the off side the gases would be expelled into the middle of the road, which would be more acceptable to pedestrians. Manufacturers, please note. Dennis Richardson, Sussex Lodge, Blenheim Close, London, SW20 9BD</p>

Exporters of Strategic Raw Material Will  Determine Competition"]    [Text] The latest measures in the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations show that the ministry leaders are  consistently changing from administrative methods of regulating  foreign economic activity to market mechanisms. This pertains  not so much to the expansion of the practice of conducting  bidding for the distribution of orders for the delivery of raw  material for state needs as it does to the complete replacement  of the administrative method for distribution of all state  orders with the competition method. In particular, beginning 1  January of this year the distribution of state orders for  exports of petroleum, petroleum products, and nonferrous  metals--the most important items of state exports--will be  conducted only according to the results of the competition. At a  conference held yesterday in the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations they named organizations that had passed the  competitive selection. The winners will be able to begin export  deliveries of petroleum products after the list is approved by  leaders of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations.    The distribution of state orders conducted in keeping with  the new procedure should not be confused with federal trading  sessions for the distribution of export quotas conducted by the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. At these, as a rule,  they place one-time orders or orders that are limited to a short  period of time for fulfillment. In the former case this pertains  to making deliveries for a year.    The plan for conducting the competition is the same for all  kinds of raw materials. According to it, the competition is  conducted by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and, at least at first,  only organizations that have traditionally fulfilled the state  order or participants in last year's bidding organized by the  foreign economic department may participate in it. Participants  in the competition must submit to the Ministry of Finance the  calculated effectiveness of the forthcoming export  operations--in other words, indicate the quantity of currency  that will be transferred into the budget per unit of commodity.  If all other conditions are equal, this criterion will be the  decisive one. Additionally, the competitors will be required to  submit a schedule of payments backed up by bank guarantees of  meeting the indicated time periods for receiving the amount of  the first payment. If the schedule is not met, a fine is  collected from the exporter in the amount of the bank  guarantees. But they are allowed to adjust both the payment  deadlines and the payment amounts--in the event of force majeure  circumstances or a change in conditions in the world and  domestic markets. As for exporters who will be making deliveries  of fuel oil and diesel fuel for state needs in 1994, so far  there are only 17 of these organizations.    [begin box]  <H5>  Commentary from the Department of Economic Policy </H5>   In the system for competitive distribution of state export  quotas in 1994 there were higher and lower leagues. In the lower  league the bidding sessions being conducted are the same as in  1993. In the higher league, where the role of the main  arbitrator will be played by the Ministry of Finance and where  the winners of the bidding from last year and this year will be  included, much larger quotas are being distributed. Thus 23.4  million tonnes of oil credited to state export quotas have  already been distributed among six organizations. The specific  feature of the new model is that in it we have managed to  coordinate the functions of the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and the Ministry of Finance (in the past it was the  conflicting interests of these departments that reduced the  results of the bidding sessions). The division of labor looks  like this: The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations determines  the group of participants and the Ministry of Finance evaluates  their proposals from the standpoint of maximizing budget  currency receipts and hands down a final verdict.    If the new system for regulating exports, which continues  the  policy of liberalization of foreign economic activity, is  approved, it, along with the unraveling currency control, could  make the institution of specialized exporters superfluous.

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CULTURAL IDENTITY CRISIS IN 'AMERICAN EYES'  </P> <P> Adolescence is a trying time under the best of circumstances, but 16-year-old  John Henderson has added trials: he's an adopted Asian in an all-Caucasian  family, in an all-Caucasian town.  </P> <P> How he comes through his identity crisis and comes to terms with his adopted  family and his cultural heritage is the subject of today's  feel-good-about-yourself "CBS Schoolbreak Special," "American Eyes" (3 p.m.,  Channels 2 and 8).  </P> <P> John (Jason Scott Lee) has his differences pointed out to him by a bigoted high  school bully. He resents his adopted brother's (Brian Krause) protection and  begins to question his place in the close-knit Henderson family.  </P> <P> David Ogden Stiers, as his concerned dad, urges him to go to a Korean cultural  summer camp for teens to find his roots. Mom (Concetta Tomei) is worried about  losing him.  </P> <P> Kelly Hu is the sympathetic and lovely girl John meets at camp who helps him  break down his defensiveness and accept who he is with pride.  </P> <P> Herb Stein directed and co-wrote the script with Cynthia Cherbak and Elizabeth  Hansen, and it is sensitive and well-acted. But how will John deal with the  violent racial prejudice he was faced with in school? We'll never know. It  doesn't fit into the quick-fix, happily-ever-after wrap-up. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

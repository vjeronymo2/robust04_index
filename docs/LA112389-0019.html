			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: UNDERCUTTING THANKSGIVING CARVING CHORE  </P> <P> Ever since Phyllis Diller balanced her turkey on a window ledge and stuffed it  through the beak, this traditional bird has been an enigma to cooks everywhere.  </P> <P> We are intimidated by its size. (You could lose your luggage in there.) We are  awed by its history and threatened by its independence. ("We'll be done when we  say we're done!")  </P> <P> I cannot look at a pale, naked turkey with its thunder thighs, sunken chest and  accordion neck without thinking, "I have seen my future and you are it!" It's  unsettling to me. It is obviously the resemblance that has prompted my mother  every year to call, "Erma, time for you to carve the turkey."  </P> <P> I have no idea how I got stuck with this dubious honor. After 40 years of  marriage, I still haven't a clue as to how to cut up a whole chicken. We call  them mystery parts. Anyone who can identify where they belong wins a big prize.  </P> <P> But back to the turkey. I approach the bronze bird like a sumo wrestler  circling his opponent to find out where his weaknesses and strengths are. Then  I begin. We're not talking Norman Rockwell here. It's more like a chain-saw  massacre. If the legs don't fall off in my hands, my mother is lamenting, "It's  not done yet, is it?" If they do fall off in my hands, my father says, "It's  overcooked. It'll be dry."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, my husband hovers over me and predicts, "You are going to cut  yourself." I have always wanted to answer him, "You have just ruined my  surprise!"  </P> <P> I've tried studying all those little charts that are put out just before the  holidays, the ones that tell you where to make the incisions that leave you  with a wall of white meat that slides off in thin slices. It never works for  me.  </P> <P> Usually I resort to a list of things to blame for the miserable mound of meat  on the platter: The knife was dull; the light was burned out over the stove;  the turkey was too hot when I carved it/too cold when I carved it; the  Republicans did something; nuclear testing is at work; glasnost . . . take your  pick.  </P> <P> Today will be no different than Thanksgivings past. I will once again  arm-wrestle a 20-pound bird to the platter and under-whelm everyone. But as in  the past, I will allow myself a few minutes to reflect on how simple life would  have been if the Pilgrims had just tossed up a salad and thrown a few steaks on  the grill.  </P></p>

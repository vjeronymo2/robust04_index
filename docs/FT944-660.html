			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican recovery stalls The Mexican Bolsa ended with a solid gain in a volatile session dominated finally by selective buying. The key stock index closed up 39.59 points, or 1.54 per cent, at 2,341.85 on strong volume of 120.3m shares. Brazil's Bovespa index had a less volatile career, moving from a session high of 43,395 on bargain hunting, following a 12 per cent fall on Wednesday and Thursday, to close at 43,514. Argentine's Merval index was showing an early gain of 2.2 per cent after losing 3 per cent on Thursday. In terms of real money, Mexican equities had a lot of ground to make up. The IPC index, on Thursday evening, was up 3.3 per cent in three days in local currency terms; but the peso had fallen from 3.45 to the dollar to 4.9 over the same period, meaning a three day loss on the IPC, dollar adjusted, of 27 per cent.</p>

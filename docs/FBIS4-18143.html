			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, March 30 (AFP) -- The leader of Italy's  neo-fascist National Alliance Gianfranco Fini confirmed  Wednesday [30 March] that he will not be a member of Italy's new  government despite this week's landslide vote to a right-wing  alliance.    Fini told reporters at a meeting of his movement that he had  spoken to Forza Italia (Go Italy) party leader Silvio Berlusconi  by telephone after the TV magnate met Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi in Milan. Following that meeting, Berlusconi  claimed the prime ministership, making it understood that Bossi  no longer opposed his holding it.    The right-wing alliance of the Northern League, National  Alliance and Forza Italia parties won a landslide victory in  legislative elections on Sunday and Monday. Berlusconi and  Bossi are due to meet again in Milan on Friday.</p>

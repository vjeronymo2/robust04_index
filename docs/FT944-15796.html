			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / This Week: Television As the first British monarch sets foot on Russian soil, the most extensive profile of her kinsman, Tsar Nicholas II, hits the screen. Network First (Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm, ITV) got access to personal papers, diaries, photographs and archive footage which have never been aired. There are also interviews with witnesses who may not live to tell their story again - one is 112. The first of a two-parter, this is an exhaustive study, introduced by Prince Michael of Kent, who adds little to the programme apart from his uncanny resemblance to his kinsman. Insurance companies are accused of entrapment, intimidation and deception by Dispatches (Wednesday, 9.00-9.45pm, C4), which investigates the ruses used to avoid paying personal injury claims. The current affairs programme interviews people who have had detectives prying into their lives by posing as market researchers or simply by camping out in the front garden. What are a high-ranking policeman's career choices when the attorney-general instigates criminal charges against him? That's the question facing Tony Clark with the return of the award-laden cop show Between The Lines (Wednesday, 9.30-10.25pm, BBC1). Even prospective pub managers, security guards and store detectives need references, and Clark doesn't have them. A taut thriller with more twists and counter-twists than a helter-skelter. Ford Transits claim half the British market for vans, but when they were launched in 1965 - the first collaboration between Ford in Britain and its German counterpart - they were considered outlandish and unsellable. A new series, Perpetual Motion (Friday, 8.30-9.00pm, BBC2), looks at lovable vehicles, starting with the Ford Transit - friend of burglars and police patrols alike - and progressing to the Ferguson TE Tractor, Concorde and the electric milk float. The home of too many spoof chat shows launches a series that isn't a parody of the genre with Last Word (Saturday, 11.00-11.45pm, BBC2). Hosted by Germaine Greer, all the guests will be women, with contributions from Ann Leslie, Suzanne Moore, Janet Street-Porter and Miranda Sawyer. Greer promises to enrage and engage, and topics will include: 'What exactly are women for?' The highest-earning woman in the world, Madonna, meets the woman with the lowest embarrasment threshold in Ruby Wax (Sunday, 10.05-10.35pm, BBC1). With the shrewd pop singer hitting a run of bad luck in the last couple of years, there is plenty to talk about. You can bet Wax won't hesitate to ask the most probing posers.</p>

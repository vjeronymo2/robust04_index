			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Appointments: Helping to heal BUPA The management renewal process at Bupa, Britain's biggest private health care organisation, has taken another step forward with the appointment of Roger Hymas as group marketing director. Hymas was previously GE Capital Corporation's executive director retail financial services - Europe, and earlier in his career held posts with Burton Group, Welbeck Financial Services and American Express. As we reported earlier, David Stonehouse has been appointed to the job Hymas has vacated. Britain's private health sector is currently under heavy financial and competitive pressures and marketing will play a central part in the strategy of Peter Jacobs, Bupa's chief executive, to strengthen the association's position. Bupa is widely-regarded as a generic term for private medicine in Britain, and Hymas will be responsible for extracting full benefit from the brand name. In November, Jacobs announced a shake-up involving the departure of three senior executives. Since then, together with Edward Lea, group finance director, he has been building a new team which he hopes will give Bupa a sharper commercial edge.</p>

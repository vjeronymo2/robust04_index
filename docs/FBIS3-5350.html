The analyst says:    Japan plans to put into operation Monju, its first fast  breeder reactor, in the near future. This is its open scheme to  produce nuclear weapons any time by securing large quantities of  plutonium by itself.    Japan has already stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium and  developed the electronic destructive device and other devices  and technology of atomic bombs and even means of long-range  nuclear delivery.    The promotion of Japan's nuclear armament in full scale with  the connivance of the West is, in actuality, a matter which must  be taken most seriously in the world at present.    This is, first of all, because Japan's nuclear armament is  an  undisguised challenge to the desire of mankind to live in a  peaceful world without nuclear threat and is a big obstacle to  the building of a nuclear-free, peaceful world.    Checking Japan's nuclear armament has become an urgent  matter  also because the Japanese reactionaries are attempting to  gratify their dominationist ambition with nuclear weapons.    In Japan today, revanchism for revenging Japan's defeat in  the past has raised its head and ultra-nationalism, a  reactionary ideological trend which had constituted the  ideological basis of Japanese militarism, is being openly  fostered.    It is not difficult to imagine the grave consequences that  would be entailed by the nuclear armament of Japan upon the  cause of peace in Asia and the world.    The main target of the nuclear threat from Japan is,  needless  to say, our country and other Asian countries. The Japanese  reactionary ruling circles are revealing their aggressive  designs on our country more openly.    The world people who love peace must join in the struggle to  frustrate Japan's nuclear armament.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nedcor increases earnings by 17% NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth-largest bank, met market expectations with a 17 per cent rise in earnings per share to 251 cents in the year to September, from 215 cents last time. The results, which are identical to those of its two main competitors, confirm the bank is in sound health. Its shares have enjoyed a substantial re-rating over the past year, their price rising to R24 from a low of R13.75 in November 1992. There was a good performance from the Perm, the home loan arm of the group, which has encountered problems through its high exposure to the difficult township market. The Perm increased net income by 22 per cent to R85m (Dollars 19.3m) from R70m. Mr Richard Laubscher, managing director, said the Perm's bad debt level was 20 per cent down on last year, and that 94 per cent of the total bond book was fully paid up to date. Net interest income in the group rose by 11 per cent to R1.8bn from R1.62bn, while other income rose by 14 per cent to R1.18bn from R1.04bn. Specific and general risk provisions increased by 22 per cent to R282m from R231m - more than that of some competitors. Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said: 'We want to be as conservative and realistic as possible.' A 9 per cent fall in the tax bill helped boost attributable earnings by 23 per cent to R501m from R408m. The dividend rose by 17 per cent to 77 cents per share from 66 cents. Group advances grew to R40bn from R34.7bn and total assets rose to R51.7bn from R47.3bn.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RTZ shows its mettle with advance to Pounds 339m - Results at top end of analysts' expectations RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, 'showed its considerable resilience in combating difficult trading conditions,' by reporting a 15 per cent increase in half year pre-tax profits despite an average 11.5 per cent fall in metal prices. The results were at the top end of analysts' forecasts and RTZ's share price rose 7p to end the day at 725p. Profit before tax rose from Pounds 295m to Pounds 339m. Net attributable earnings, which RTZ suggests is usually the most relevant measure of its performance, surged from Pounds 128m to Pounds 264m. Earnings per share were up from 12.4p to 25.6p. However, adjusted earnings, which reflect underlying performance by excluding exceptional items, were up by a more modest amount, from Pounds 158m to Pounds 186m, or from 15.3p a share to 18p. Sir Derek Birkin, chairman, warned that it may be some time before metal prices showed any meaningful improvement from present depressed levels and a more widespread improvement in economic activity was needed for volume growth in industrial minerals. Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said first half results had benefited by Pounds 50m from exchange rates, arising principally from the devaluation of sterling and a weaker Australian dollar, whereas lower metal prices reduced earnings by Pounds 43m. Operating cash flow from continuing operations increased from Pounds 236m to Pounds 315m. A Pounds 536m rise in net debt to Pounds 1.58bn in the first half reflected the cost of the Nerco and Cordero US coal acquisitions. Asset disposals had reduced this to 14 per cent and gearing would be even lower by the year-end. Sir Derek is to give up executive responsibilities at the 1994 annual meeting when he will be 64 to become non-executive chairman. He said RTZ was in very good health. 'How many companies could see a near-60 per cent fall in its product prices since the peak in 1988 and still produce these results and throw off all this cash?' COMMENT It has been a hectic half year for RTZ, what with buying about 5 per cent of the US coal industry, selling most of the Pillar business and other assets. The share price last night seemed to be assuming there is more wheeling and dealing to come in the second half. This seems very unlikely and RTZ will have to work very hard indeed to match in the second half, or in 1994, what was undoubtedly an impressive first-half performance. There is no more dividend to come this year and, while most metal prices do not have much further to fall, copper, the most important one in the portfolio, might drop another 20 per cent from today's 86 cents a lb. And every 10 cent a lb fall would cost RTZ about Pounds 53m. In its present form RTZ is probably capable of earning 90p a share at the peak of the metals cycle, so there will be a better time to buy. It is a question of getting the timing right.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS ARTS, RECREATION, LIBRARIES  </P> <P> Police response times probably would rise, the city's pools and recreational  facilities would be open fewer hours, the city library budget would be cut in  half, and arts organizations would get no money under a $1.2-billion budget  proposed Tuesday by City Manager John Lockwood.  </P> <P> At a press conference, Lockwood repeated his contention that the city will be  unable to maintain existing municipal service levels such as police protection  and library hours, unless the council decides to increase taxes or fees. The  city must generate an additional $60 million in new revenue if it intends to  keep services at the current level, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> "You can only stretch the dollar so far," Lockwood said. The $1.2-billion  budget proposed Tuesday "is not an adequate amount of money in order to fund  what we're used to funding," Lockwood said. "But it's all we have."  </P> <P> Lockwood's inch-thick budget proposal, which was described as "dead on arrival"  by at least one council member, served to rekindle an already acrimonious  council debate on whether the city should solve the budget crunch by cutting  service levels or by taking the politically difficult step of raising taxes and  fees.  </P> <P> Council members will use Lockwood's proposed budget as the starting point for a  series of public hearings on the budget that begin May 24. The council now has  the option of accepting Lockwood's budget or fashioning its own budget by  making cuts and/or raising revenue. The council expects to complete its budget  by late June or early July, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Tuesday remained adamant that the city's budget  crunch not destroy "people programs," such as parks and recreation, the library  and arts funding, said O'Connor spokesman Paul Downey.  </P> <P> "Her position is identical to what she's said before," Downey said. "She is  still opposed to raising revenue without putting it to a vote of the people."  O'Connor will review Lockwood's proposed budget before making her own  recommendations, Downey said.  </P> <P> Councilman Ron Roberts said that Lockwood's budget proposal would "bring some  sanity into this (budget) process" by forcing the council to address needed  budget cuts and new revenue sources. "Those who have put their heads in the  sand and said there's no problem will now have to address" the shortfall,  Roberts said.  </P> <P> Roberts, who earlier this year argued that the city needed to make "substantial  cuts" in the upcoming budget, also has stated that the council must raise taxes  or fees to reduce the shortfall. Roberts has suggested that council add revenue  by increasing business license fees or imposing a new utility bill tax.  </P> <P> Roberts' argument that new revenue sources are needed runs counter to  Councilman Bruce Henderson's oft-stated claim that there is no budget crisis  and that the city could make cuts without seriously endangering services.  </P> <P> While the $1.2-billion budget is by far the largest ever proposed in San Diego,  its size is "misleading," according to Lockwood, because the general fund,  which finances police, fire, recreational programs and the library, has only  increased to $434.6 million, up from $402 million.  </P> <P> A large part of the proposed increase in the general fund is linked to programs  that were approved during the current fiscal year but didn't require funding  until the upcoming fiscal year. For example, the city last year authorized the  addition of more than 100 uniformed police officers, but delayed their hiring  until late in the year. The full cost of those officers will be felt in the  coming year for the first time.  </P> <P> The rest of the $1.2-billion budget covers programs that the council cannot  cut, Lockwood said. Programs that have their own funding sources, such as sewer  and water treatment, will not be cut back, Lockwood said. "I don't think  there's one . . . (department) that's funded by general revenue that will  maintain the same level of service," Lockwood said.  </P> <P> Although the Police Department budget proposed by Lockwood would increase by  3.9% to $145.4 million, up from the current $139.8 million, the department's  level of service would probably deteriorate slightly because the department  would have 50 fewer non-uniform personnel, Lockwood said. And, although the  number of uniformed officers would remain constant, the population is expected  to increase by 25,000, which would move the city farther away from its  long-stated goal of two officers per 1,000 residents, Lockwood said.  </P> <P> The library's current $12.6 million budget would be cut by 47.9% to $6.5  million. That reduction would force branch libraries to cut back hours to an  average of 24 hours a week from the current 43 hours a week.  </P> <P> Park and recreation centers would be cut to 24 hours a week, down from 60  hours, and swimming pools would only be open 24 hours a week.  </P> <P> Nonprofit arts organizations in the city, which traditionally have won city  funding through the transit occupancy tax (TOT) that is levied upon hotel and  motel guests, received no funding in Lockwood's proposed budget.  </P> <P> Because of the shortfall in revenue, Lockwood instead has proposed using TOT  money "to maintain . . . (police, recreation and library services) at the  expense of arts and promotions" such as the Holiday Bowl.  </P> <P> "I'm not disagreeing with the arts and promotion community leaders who say that  we can't afford these reductions," Lockwood said. But Lockwood maintained that,  given the current budget crisis, it is more important to fund regular city  services than arts and promotions.  </P> <P> Related Story, F1  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D.R.: "Stop the Arrests"] </F>   [Text] The Democratic Action Party has sent a letter to  diplomatic and consular representations in Belgrade requesting  that they inform the governments of their countries about the  latest events in Sandzak, so the "further arrests and  persecution of Muslims would stop." The letter starts with the  following words:    "Since 25 January of this year, Serbian-Montenegrin police  have been making mass arrests of Muslims in the area of Sandzak  and particularly in the Prijepolje, Rozaje, and Bijelo Polje  communes. In most cases they are arresting the very top leaders  of the of the Party of Democratic Action. This series of arrests  started in Urozaje when a group of well-armed members of  Montenegro MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] arrived in six  Land Rovers, surrounded the house of the secretary for  Montenegro, Mr. Rasim Sahman, and took him to some unknown  location."    The letter further states that "despite all our attempts to  learn the reasons for these arrests, the police authorities have  not given us any explanation. In the aftermath of these events  the tense situation in Sandzak has acquired dramatic  proportions. By means of these and other similar actions,  Serbian and Montenegrin authorities hope to intimidate the  Muslim population and create pressure that would accelerate the  process of their migration from Sandzak. The direct attack on  the political representatives of Sandzak Muslims is designed to  repress any form of political expression by these people."</p>

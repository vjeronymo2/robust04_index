			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory requirement, under section 1861(ee) of the Act, mandating the inclusion of discharge planning into the hospital conditions of participation, explicitly applies only to Medicare beneficiaries. Although we believed the Secretary had the authority to expand the application of the provision beyond the statutorily mandated population, we did not choose to do so at the time we published the proposed rule, in part because we believed that additional development of mechanisms for effectively completing and executing discharge plans was warranted before a requirement as detailed as this one was made applicable beyond the mandated population. We have since changed our view and now are applying the requirement to all patients who need it. (See section IV., ``Comments and Responses'', below for further discussion of this issue.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the proposal, we had not yet made a determination as authorized under section 9305(c)(3) as to whether the JCAHO or AOA discharge planning standards were at least equivalent to the statutory standards and guidelines in section 1861(ee) of the Act. Our current regulations at 42 CFR 488.5, as redesignated from 42 CFR 405.1901(d)(3) on June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22850), already provide that JCAHO and AOA accredited hospitals are deemed to meet our conditions of participation unless our requirements are higher or more precise. We indicated that we would review each organization's standards to determine if they are at least equivalent and invited comments on this issue. We requested comments from the public on this issue and proposed to announce in the final rule whether hospital compliance with the JCAHO or AOA accreditation programs would provide the Secretary with a ``reasonable assurance'' that the hospital met the new condition of participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new section 1861(ee)(2)(B) includes the requirement that hospitals provide discharge planning evaluations upon the request of the ``patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.'' We proposed to characterize ``patient's representative'' in &sect;482.43(b)(1) as any properly authorized ``person acting on the patient's behalf.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed not to require hospitals to inform Medicare patients of the availability of discharge planning services separately from other information furnished. Currently, hospitals give all Medicare patients a notice (``An Important Message from Medicare'') that informs beneficiaries, among other things, of the availability of discharge planning. This message was designed to help Medicare patients who may believe they need post-hospital services but do not know how to obtain them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed to allow hospitals to determine the appropriate personnel to carry out the discharge planning. In proposed &sect;&sect;482.43(b)(2) and 482.43(c)(1), we stated that a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriate personnel (consistent with available community and hospital resources) must develop or supervise the development of the evaluation and discharge plan. We did not stipulate in the regulation what qualifications would need to be related to the size and location of the hospital and the variety of resources available for post-discharge care in the area. In our interpretive guidelines, though, we would instruct the surveyor to look at such factors as previous experience in discharge planning, knowledge of clinical and social factors that affect functional status at discharge, knowledge of community resources to meet post-discharge clinical and social needs, and assessment skills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be compatible with our other regulations we proposed to divide this condition of participation into several standards: the first, identification of Medicare patients in need of evaluation; the second, the evaluation process; the third, the discharge plan; and the fourth, referral or transfer of the Medicare patient, along with necessary medical information. (The statute does not explicitly require actual transfer or referral of patients after discharge planning is complete, so we proposed to retain, for clarity, the concept of current &sect;482.21(b)(2).) A fifth standard would require an ongoing reassessment of the discharge planning process to ensure that discharge plans are responsive to discharge needs of individual Medicare patients. Because the requirements in &sect;482.43 (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (c)(2) would be those required by section 1861(ee) of the Act, failure to meet any of these requirements could result in termination of the hospital's participation agreement in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. ESRD Conditions for Coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We also proposed several minor revisions to &sect;&sect;405.2135 and 405.2137 of the ESRD conditions for coverage. The purpose of the changes was to reduce the paperwork burden on ESRD facilities, in keeping with a request from the office of Management and Budget that we conduct an overall review of the paperwork burden and reporting requirements associated with HCFA regulations. We received no comments on the proposed changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, however, we are working with representatives of the ESRD industry and consumers to develop comprehensive revisions to the ESRD conditions for coverage. We believe that it would be confusing and inappropriate to adopt the minor changes from the June 16, 1988 proposed rule at a time when the ESRD community is anticipating extensive revisions to the conditions for coverage. Instead, we believe it would be more appropriate to reconsider the proposed changes as part of our overall revision of the ESRD conditions. Thus, we are not adopting the proposed changes to &sect;&sect;405.2135 and 405.2137.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

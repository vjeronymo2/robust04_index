			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD GRAPPLES WITH ITS WALL OF SHAME  </P> <P> The great seawall of Carlsbad, a half-mile-long concrete promenade that's  considered a beachfront jewel in this tony town, has turned into a wall of  shame that has upset the community's sensibilities.  </P> <P> Over the past 18 months, the smooth and graceful $3.5-million wall has become a  vast exhibit of raunchy urban-style graffiti, everything from racial slurs to  sexual expressions and surfer slogans.  </P> <P> Instead of lending Carlsbad's seashore a touch of linear majesty and  eye-pleasing precision, the wall now offers thousands of tourists and local  residents' crude letters spelling "rampage," "the Pope smokes dope," and "oingo  boingo." The ripest graffiti can't be quoted.  </P> <P> Graffiti problems are hardly unusual, but this is graffiti on a grand scale.  About 70,000 square feet must be cleaned, and city workers spend 20 hours a  week toiling at the wall. Yet they still can't stay ahead of the spray paint,  chalk and stubborn markings made with surfboard wax.  </P> <P> "It's available, and it's one of the few places where they have a big canvas to  paint on," said Larry Willey, the city's assistant director for utilities and  maintenance. "It wasn't a problem at first, it just seems to have escalated."  </P> <P> The wall, ranging in height from 12 to 17 feet, is only 2 years old. It was  built with city funds as a retaining wall to secure the erosion-prone bluffs  between Tamarack and Walnut avenues. But now it is the cause of complaint and  controversy.  </P> <P> "We've gotten complaints from residents who have taken friends down there to  see this jewel, then become totally embarrassed," said Lee Bohlmann, executive  vice president of the city Chamber of Commerce. Some markings are drippy  statements of adolescent love, "but it seems they're mostly gutter terms."  </P> <P> Downtown merchants who have labored to nurture Carlsbad's reputation as a  breezy, quaint seaside village that's perfect for tourism have had gnawing  concerns over the wall.  </P> <P> "It presents a very poor image for our city," said Hope Wrisley, co-chair of  the Carlsbad Village Merchants Assn., bemoaning that the graffiti problem has  gotten "overwhelming."  </P> <P> She often walks along the beach past the wall and discovered not long ago that  graffiti isn't the exclusive lexicon of beer-chugging youths. She spotted a man  "maybe 40 years old, spray painting. A nearly middle-aged man. How tacky."  </P> <P> "The wall is just too big a target," Wrisley said.  </P> <P> Still, it's obvious that most of the wall markings are left by young people.  The heavy jumble of words and phrases includes "team crack," "surf or die," and  "heavy metal rules." There are explicit drawings of nudity and characters  having sex. Somebody took 30 feet of wall space to paint "I do not know --  where do you want to eat?"  </P> <P> Chris Brady, a 39-year-old Carlsbad man, savors strolling along the beach  during mornings and sunsets. The sprawling array of graffiti anger him. "It  shows a lack of respect for other people's property. They're rebellious and  they don't care about anybody but themselves," he said. "It shows how the  society has gone."  </P> <P> City official Willey isn't immediately as concerned about society as he is with  the graffiti. Erasing it isn't an easy task, especially the markings made by  surfboard wax that are covered with sand and left to melt into the concrete's  pores.  </P> <P> In frustration, the city had hired a contractor to help eradicate the graffiti,  but the use of high-pressure water was eroding the wall's finished surface.  That process left a more porous surface that is even harder to clean of new  graffiti.  </P> <P> Finally, the City Council agreed this week to spend nearly $48,000 on another  contractor who will rid the wall of all graffiti, then apply a protective clear  wax coating to make cleaning easier. The coating will be replaced with each new  cleaning.  </P> <P> Willey hopes the new approach and prompt removal will discourage most people  who yearn for public expression.  </P> <P> Bohlmann suspects that the only way to eliminate the problem is to cover its  surface with an artistic mural, although that has not been proposed. "When  there is a mural or design painted on a blank surface, graffiti is not a  problem," she said.  </P></p>

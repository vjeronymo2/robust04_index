Kono, speaking at an LDP fund-raising party in Otsu, asked,  "can the SDP share political responsibility with Shinseito?"    Shinseto co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the  coalition's chief strategist, has called for raising the  consumption tax rate to 10 percent from present 3 percent, Kono  said.

Earlier this week, the SDP opposed Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's proposal to replace the 3 percent consumption tax  with a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in three years' time.    Kono, leader of the biggest opposition party, said he does  not think the present government's policies will benefit the  Japanese people.    "The LDP will struggle with a firm resolve to establish a  government that can meet the expectations of the people," he  said.    Kono also expressed concern with Komeito for joining the  coalition, saying he cannot agree with Komeito's deep  involvement in the country's policymaking.    He alluded to Komeito's links with Japan's largest Buddhist  lay organization, the Soka Gakkai.

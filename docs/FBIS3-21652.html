"We demand an apology from the US government over the  involvement of its two diplomatic staff in the crime of drug  trafficking," said members of the group, which claims to belong  to the Front for Indonesian Youths Saviour.    One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said  the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he  called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Moslem  world and was always forcing its interests on others.    "America, out ... America, AIDS ... America, narcotics ..."  the crowd alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging  of the two embassy staff.    The crowd, which according to police estimates numbered  2,000  people, delivered a statement to the US Embassy.    The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment.    The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an  airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from  Washington.    Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure Indonesia,  the world's largest Moslem-populated nation, to open ties with  Israel.    Indonesia, with about 88 percent of its 186 million  population following Islam, is a staunch supporter of the  Palestinian and Arab cause, and has no diplomatic ties with  Israel.    Reading out parts of the statement handed to the embassy,  they also accused US diplomats [of] "contempt for Indonesian  laws," for sending two embassy staff members, accused last month  of drug trafficking, to the United States last week.    The embassy has said the men would be court martialed in the  United States.    The demonstrators demanded that the two Americans,  identified  as Joseph Bryner and Michael Karajin, be returned to Indonesia  for trial and that the embassy apologize for their conduct.    The two, one holding diplomatic immunity, were among four  foreigners and two Indonesian nabbed by the police here for  their alleged involvement in the trade of a dangerous drug,  known as Ecstasy.    The group, also said Washington needs to be fair and honest  in viewing the rise of Islam and its followers and avoid the  influence of the Jewish lobby when determining its foreign  policy.    The group dispersed peacefully by themselves before police  made any move to end the demonstration. There were no arrests,  witnesses said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 14 KYODO -- The North Korean nuclear  situation has improved since the UN Security Council adopted a  statement last month urging it to let inspectors finish their  checks, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told a Japanese  newspaper executive.    Qian said also he understood Pyongyang's reasons for  immediately denouncing the statement, the chairman of the  Japanese-language TOKYO SHIMBUN, Miichiro Kato, told reporters  in Beijing after the interview Wednesday [13 April].    This is because North Korea insists that the issue should be  resolved in negotiations with the United States, without United  Nations intervention, Kato quoted Qian as saying.    The U.S. had lobbied Security Council members to pass a  resolution that would have prodded North Korea to accept  international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected of  being part of a weapons development program.    China, Pyongyang's last remaining major ally, convinced the  security council to adopt the nonbinding statement, however,  stressing the need for dialogue and warning against isolating  North Korea further.    On Wednesday, Qian said, "since the UN Security Council  announced the presidential statement, it appears that (the  situation) is heading gradually in a positive direction."    "North Korea was against the issue being discussed by the  Security Council, so I understand its denial (of the  statement)," Qian added.    The foreign minister said that there were "absolutely" no  plans for North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit China or  for Beijing leaders to journey to Pyongyang.    Regarding the renewal by the U.S. of most-favored-nation  (MFN) trade status for China, Qian stressed that support for an  extension of the status, to be decided on by Washington in June,  is "very strong" among American business leaders.    "If the U.S. does not want its economic relationship with  China severed, then problems should be resolved," he said Qian,  without mentioning Washington's linkage of human rights concerns  with a renewal of MFN.    On the possibility of Japan obtaining a permanent seat on  the  UN Security Council, Qian said there were differing opinions  among UN member nations, adding that no formal discussions are  scheduled on the issue.</p>

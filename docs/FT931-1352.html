			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / College teachers back strike call COLLEGE teachers in England and Wales have voted to hold a 24-hour strike on April 1 with a further one-day stoppage on April 28 in protest at threats in 194 colleges to introduce terms and conditions of employment for new staff which they believe will be inferior. Members of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher education backed strike action with 86 per cent saying they would support action short of a stoppage.</p>

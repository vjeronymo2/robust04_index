			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (2): No shying away from the challenge - Alice Rawsthorn tests the new prime minister's grip on the economy DURING this spring's general election campaign Mr Edouard Balladur, then one of the higher profile campaigners for the RPR Gaullists and now prime minister, was wont to say that the old socialist government had left the French economy in its 'worst state since the second world war'. Mr Balladur was exaggerating. It is fair to say that there was serious cause for concern about France's economic condition. Unemployment had reached record levels by breaching the 3m barrier. Real interest rates were among the highest in Europe, with bank base rates at 10 per cent and inflation at 2 per cent, thereby imposing pressure on consumer confidence and industrial investment. France had slid into recession, with the first quarter GDP figures showing a second successive quarterly reduction in the real rate of growth for the first time since the Gulf War. The socialists had also over-spent and the government deficit was rising rapidly. Finally, the French franc was threatened of a renewal of the money market attacks that had plagued it through the winter. That was the bad news. The new prime minister could, however, seek solace in the French economy's underlying strengths of low inflation, competitive wages, the well-equipped corporate sector with low levels of debt and the high rate of personal savings which might be coaxed out of SICAV money market funds and into the stock market. Mr Balladur's task is to redress France's weaknesses and to embellish its strengths, so that his centre-right coalition can prove that it has regenerated the economy and reduced unemployment by the time the French cast their votes in the 1995 presidential polls. The new premier could scarcely be accused of shying away from the challenge. One of his first initiatives was to ask his new ministers to find FFr20bn of cuts from their budgets, thereby setting a suitably austere tone for his administration. He then commissioned an audit of the French economy to assess the real state of government finances. Mr Balladur unveiled the audit's findings in mid-May, having delayed doing so as a mark of respect following the suicide of Mr Pierre Beregevoy, his socialist predecessor, earlier that month. The audit concluded that, if the budget deficit remained unchecked, it would escalate to FFr410bn, or 5.8 per cent of GDP, this year. The new prime minister then tabled a number of measures - including FFr7.7bn increases in tax on alcohol and tobacco and FFr21.5bn cuts in government spending - to try to restrain the 1993 deficit to FFr331bn, or 4.5 per cent of GDP. Mr Balladur hopes soon to accelerate the process of deficit reduction with the proceeds of his privatisation programme. It starts this autumn, and could include the sale of as many as 21 state-controlled companies over the next two years. His plans should also be aided by lower interest rates, which ought to make it cheaper for the government to service its debt. At the same time he is launching an economic regeneration programme - which involves public works, housing schemes and incentives to encourage job sharing - to stem the rise in unemployment and to stimulate growth. These initiatives will be financed by the special FFr40bn 'Balladur bond' issue scheduled for launch later this month. Again, Mr Balladur's efforts should be bolstered by lower interest rates. His government is fortunate in that its arrival coincided with a significant softening of the Bundesbank's attitude to reducing German rates, spurred by the deterioration in the German economy. French interest rates, both official rates and commercial bank base rates, have fallen steadily since the late March elections without imperiling the franc. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the monetarist economy minister, is now so sanguine about the franc's prospects that he claims French rates could fall below those of the Germans. In theory, the recent rate reductions should have restored confidence among consumers and the corporate sector, thereby stimulating expenditure and industrial investment. Lower rates should also make SICAVs less attractive as investment vehicles and encourage the public to switch to shares once the privatisation drive gets under way. But in practice there is no sign of a pick-up in confidence. French companies are churning out increasingly gloomy results, particularly as the strong franc is making it ever more difficult for them to remain competitive in export markets. These problems have been aggravated by the fragile state of Germany, which is France's largest trading partner. A further handicap to French recovery is the weakness of Japan and other European economies. The toll of job losses shows no sign of stopping. The latest figures show that the number of people without jobs rose to 3.1m, or 10.9 per cent of the workforce, in April. As a result consumer confidence has remained depressed, as has consumer spending. The new government had initially hoped to hold the fall in the real rate of GDP growth to 0.4 per cent this year. However the most recent official estimates suggest it will be closer to 1 per cent. Given that France needs to generate annual growth of 2 per cent just to keep employment stable, this means further increases in unemployment are unavoidable. Already more job losses are coming. Michelin, the tyre maker, has been forced to resort to emergency short-time working. LVMH, the luxury goods group, recently announced the first-ever redundancies in the history of Moet-et-Chandon, its flagship champagne house. The government itself plans to start scaling down the enormous French civil service at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent from the present staffing level of 2.1m. Meanwhile Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, only recently averted the risk of a sudden surge in the jobless figures early this summer when the socialists' contrats emploi-solidarite temporary youth work programme ends. Mr Giraud has not only extended the scheme - which was fiercely criticised by the political right when the socialists introduced it - but also he has increased the number of places on it from 450,000 to 600,000. It remains to be seen how effective Mr Balladur's measures will be. The most positive news since his government's arrival is the fall in interest rates - although the Bundesbank can claim much of the credit for that. The new prime minister has, however, scored high marks for his efficiency at getting to grips with the government budget, which has certainly helped to win the markets' confidence and thereby bolstered the franc. But it is still too soon to say whether Mr Balladur will succeed in being more than just an prudent manager of the public purse and if he has the chutzpah to persuade French consumers and industry to show more confidence in their own economy. If he succeeds, France should return to growth from next year onwards and unemployment may start to fall. But if Mr Balladur fails, the French economy will stay stuck in its vicious cycle of depressed confidence and weak demand, which augurs ill for the right's prospects of returning to power after the 1995 presidential poll.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE MOVIES: THE WEEK'S OTHER PRIME-TIME FILMS  </P> <P> James Toback's 1983 Exposed (KTLA, Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a drenchingly romantic  thriller, stronger in style than credibility, in which an ambiguous angel of  death (Nastassia Kinski) captivates a concert violinist (Rudolf Nureyev) and  also a Paris-based terrorist (Harvey Keitel).  </P> <P> Jackson County Jail (KTLA, Monday at 8 p.m.) is that terrific, provocative 1976  exploitation picture that landed liberated Los Angeles ad executive Yvette  Mimieux in a backwoods hoosegow with scary and pertinent implications. Here  Tommy Lee Jones makes an exciting screen debut.  </P> <P> King of the Gypsies (KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m.) brought Peter Maas' engrossing  1978 multigenerational saga to the screen in synthetic, all-star fashion.  </P> <P> The 1985 That Was Then, This Is Now (KCOP, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a sincere film  about two delinquents, starring Craig Sheffer and Emilio Estevez.  </P> <P> Switching Channels (KTLA, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), that frenetic, misfired 1988  attempt to update "The Front Page" to the cable business, traps Kathleen  Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in an enervating, joyless endurance  course.  </P> <P> Julien Temple's Earth Girls Are Easy (KTTV, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a jazzy,  snazzy 1988 rock musical about a dumped-on Valley girl (Geena Davis), who  ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, Damon  Wayans) around town after they crash-land in her swimming pool. Fluff, but fun.  </P> <P> Chariots of Fire (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner,  traces the parallel lives of two very different British athletes who competed  in the 1924 Olympics.  </P> <P> The 1985 Stick (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.) took a gem of an Elmore Leonard novel  and turned it into a mediocre Burt Reynolds vehicle.  </P> <P> Like all anthology comedies, the 1987 Amazon Women on the Moon (KTLA, Friday at  8 p.m.) is a hit-and-miss affair, with the hits outweighing the misses to yield  an amiable enough diversion.  </P> <P> Reckless (KTLA, Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a shallow, irresponsible 1984 feature  teaming then newcomer Aidan Quinn as a small-town Brando-Dean type entangled  with bored rich girl Daryl Hannah.  </P></p>

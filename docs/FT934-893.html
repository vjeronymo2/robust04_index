			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK's trade gap with non-EU countries widens to Pounds 767m Britain's visible trade gap with countries outside the European Union more than doubled last month after a sharp drop in the value of exports. The deficit with non-EU trading partners widened to Pounds 767m from October's Pounds 372m. This followed a 7.5 per cent fall in export values from Pounds 5.2bn to Pounds 4.8bn. Imports remained flat at Pounds 5.5bn. Excluding oil and such erratic items as ships and aircraft - a more reliable guide to the underlying trend - the deficit jumped from Pounds 386m to Pounds 634m. Although the widening of the trade gap looks alarming, it follows a small deficit in October which government statisticians believed to be unsustainable. Over the latest three months, the deficit appears to have flattened. In the three months to November, the trade gap was just over Pounds 2bn, the same as in the previous three-month period. Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said the UK 'must look to future opportunities in the Far East, India, South America and in Europe and the US which are fast coming out of recession'. But Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary said that unless the UK improved its ability to make and sell things in the world, recovery would not be sustainable: 'If we are unable to compete in world markets now, what is going to happen when GATT comes into force and competition hots up?' Measured by volume and excluding oil and erratic items, exports and imports continued their rise, but by only 0.5 per cent last month, compared with over 1 per cent in October. Exporters continued to increase prices substantially in November, in spite of little movement in the value of the pound since the first quarter, indicating that manufacturers are attempting to rebuild their profit margins through export sales. The Central Statistical Office said that in the three months to November export prices increased by 12 per cent, compared with the previous three months, against only a 4.5 per cent rise in import prices over the same period. The non-EU trade figures paint a different picture from the intra-EU statistics. Yesterday's non-EU trade figures show import volumes rising a seasonally adjusted 4 per cent in the three months to November, compared with only a 1 per cent rise in underlying export volumes. The EU figures suggest a relatively flat picture for imports. The deficit on trade with the US and Canada was Pounds 74m compared with a Pounds 130m surplus in October. In the latest three months the deficit was Pounds 5m compared with a surplus of Pounds 183m in the three months to August. Exports to western European countries outside the EU reached a record Pounds 934m in November. However, over the latest three months they were down slightly on the previous three-month period. The deficit held steady at just above Pounds 1bn. Exports of manufactured goods grew slightly faster than imports in the latest three months, compared with the three months to August. Compared with the same three months a year ago, exports of manufactured goods were up a seasonally adjusted 27 per cent against an increase of 19 per cent for imports.</p>

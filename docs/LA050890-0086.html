			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS PUT A DAMPER ON BIG REAL ESTATE DEAL;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS ARE OBJECTING TO THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR LANDMARK  LAND CO.'S PLAN TO SELL $967 MILLION WORTH OF ITS WELL-KNOWN RESORT PROPERTIES.  </P> <P> Landmark Land Co. said late Monday that the deal to sell its major resort  properties to Orange County developer Barry G. Hon for $967 million is in  danger of falling through because banking regulators object to how the sale is  being financed.  </P> <P> Carmel-based Landmark, a leading developer of resort and golf course  properties, said that regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision have  objected to the "credit concentration aspect" of the deal.  </P> <P> Though company officials and regulators were not available to elaborate,  regulators apparently are objecting to the fact that a savings and loan  subsidiary of Landmark Land, New Orleans-based Oak Tree Savings, was to finance  the sale completely. The deal was announced only three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Terms of the sale called for Hon to put up $200 million, with Oak Tree Savings  to finance the remaining amount.  </P> <P> The deal was to take place in two stages and be completed by next year.  </P> <P> Included in the sale are several well-known resorts in the Palm Springs area,  including Mission Hills Country Club, PGA West and La Quinta Golf &amp; Tennis  Club.  </P> <P> In all, 19 golf courses and four resort hotels are to be sold.  </P> <P> Oak Tree Savings owns the properties now, but it is being forced to sell as  part of the S&amp;L industry bailout legislation last year that forced thrifts  to get rid of their direct investments in real estate.  </P> <P> In a terse statement, Landmark Land said it is trying to refinance the deal "so  as to remove the (regulatory) objection."  </P> <P> Landmark said the deal will be canceled if the problem cannot be resolved.  </P> <P> Hon is an increasingly high profile developer in Southern California.  </P> <P> His projects include the 2,750-acre Foothill Ranch, a master-planned community  in south Orange County, and a proposed 850-acre development in Rancho Palos  Verdes that would include a 450-acre Ritz Carlton Hotel and two golf courses.  </P> <P> Hon could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Trading in Landmark Land's stock on the American Stock Exchange was suspended  Monday pending the announcement.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer James S. Granelli in Orange County contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

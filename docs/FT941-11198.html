			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Intl Food requests suspension of shares Shares in International Food Machinery, the troubled second-hand catering equipment supplier, were suspended yesterday on the Stock Exchange. A statement by the Humberside group said the temporary suspension was made at its own request 'pending clarification of the company's financial position'. The announcement followed a profits warning last November, when the company said its results for the year to December would be substantially below market expectations. Although IFM last year reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 878,000 (Pounds 292,000) on turnover of Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 3.39m), it subsequently ran into overstocking problems and debts mounted to more than Pounds 3m. Since then the share price has tumbled from 80p and was suspended yesterday at 14p.</p>

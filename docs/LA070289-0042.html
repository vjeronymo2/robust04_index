			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: PARENT CARE NOW TAKES THE MOST YEARS  </P> <P> For the first time, American couples are spending more years helping aging  parents than caring for children, according to a recent report by the Older  Women's League. It calls the consequences "monumental."  </P> <P> Take the case of Steve and Sara S., both in their 40s. He's a professor; she's  active in community affairs. Together with their 13-year-old daughter, they  live in a comfortable home in a small college town in Upstate New York. For  years they talked about building a house in the country after their daughter  entered college. Two years ago the plans changed. Steve's bfather was  hospitalized twice over a period of months, and Steve realized that his father  could not return home alone.  </P> <P> Steve and his wife invited his father to move in with them for six months. He's  still there. Says Steve: "My dad has made a life here he never had in New York  City. He's connected with people. He's a computer whiz in the college course  he's taking, secretary for the Little League and involved in local  environmental issues."  </P> <P> The once-temporary move is now permanent, and none of the family members talks  about change. Steve's dad helps with household chores, supervises his  granddaughter and insists on paying a small amount for room and board.  </P> <P> There have, of course, been changes. Instead of buying land in the country,  Sara and Steve enlarged their house to give themselves more privacy. They did  this just in time; in April, Sara's widowed mother moved in with them as well.  </P> <P> A year before, she suffered a stroke and, although she made a remarkable  recovery, life isn't the same. She gave up driving, which for her was a link to  siblings and friends. She visited Steve and Sara monthly, each time staying a  bit longer.  </P> <P> Experience has taught this intergenerational family what to expect. Sara's  mother is getting counseling to help her with the transition. Says Steve:  "She's having a harder time adjusting. She was very much a force in her own  community and an active church member for 43 years."  </P> <P> Steve and Sara have no complaints about the choices they made. They are  learning to live with the burdens and joys of aging parents. According to OWL,  women today can expect to spend 17 years caring for children and 18 years  assisting a parent. Nearly 2 million women are caring for children and parents  simultaneously.  </P> <P> Question: I'm a 78-year-old living in Santa Barbara, Calif. Since I retired 20  years ago, my home has greatly appreciated in value, while my income has  remained fixed. There are many things I'd like to do and buy, but I am  concerned about spending my small savings. I've heard about reverse mortgages,  but very little about sale lease-back plans. Can you tell me about them?  </P> <P> Answer: An increasing number of older people have substantial assets invested  in their home, but, like you, relatively little income to meet expenses.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Jon Pynoos of USC, aging in place is a strongly held  preference of most older persons. A recent survey found that 70% of persons age  65 and above, especially women over 80, agreed with the statement, "What I'd  really like to do is stay in my own home and never move." Such strong  attachment to place is associated with the benefits of familiarity, access to  neighborhood services, proximity of friends, psychological attachments to the  home and, especially for homeowners, financial security.  </P> <P> Because most older homeowners do not want to move or sell their homes, several  plans for converting home equity into cash without requiring occupants to  vacate the residence are available:  </P> <P> Sale lease-back plans were first introduced in 1978 by Fouratt Corp. in an  attempt to help an elderly Carmel, Calif., resident. According to Rick Watson  of Fouratt, the woman owned her home free and clear, did not want to move, but  was living in desperate conditions because of inadequate income.  </P> <P> Under sale lease-back plans, owners sell but retain the right to reside in  their homes. By contrast, reverse mortgages enable owners to borrow against  their home equity and repay the loan, usually within 10 years.  </P> <P> In most sale lease-back plans, the owner sells the home to an individual buyer  or investment firm, then leases it back for lifetime occupancy. If you entered  into this arrangement, you would become a renter in your home.  </P> <P> The purchase price usually is divided into a lump sum and fixed monthly  payments in amounts based on the seller's life expectancy. According to Walton,  the buyer also purchases a deferred annuity for the seller that begins paying  out when the loan ends. This guarantees the seller regular income over his or  her lifetime. If the seller dies before the full loan is repaid, the balance is  paid to the estate.  </P> <P> Seek legal advice to understand the options and risks of both sale lease-back  and reverse-mortgage plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Send questions about growing older to On Aging, P.O.

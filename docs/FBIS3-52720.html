All this has taken place very  rapidly in front of the government's eyes.    In view of our citizens' deteriorating living conditions,  difficulties, and suffering, it is a violation of your  government's constitutional and national responsiblity to be  indifferent toward these conditions and to fail to adopt the  required measures to tackle them. Motivated by its national  duty and historic responsibility, the Presidential Council  addresses this message to you to place you before your  responsibilities toward the continued deterioration of the  economic and administrative situation and toward citizens'  difficult living conditions. Also, there has been noticeable  failure to draw up and implement a clear and sound supply,  financial, and monetary policy. The Government has also failed  to activate the existing laws to curb illegitimate currency  speculation, stop price increases, and prevent monopolies. All  that has resulted in a great increase in inflation rates, high  unemployment, and low wages and incomes. In addition, the  state's facilities and departments have witnessed general  laxity, carelessness, and negligence. There has also been a  noticeable drop in the level of job performance in the state's  administrative system and institutions. All the above points  are at the heart of the tasks and duties which your esteemed  government should have carried out in accordance with the  Constitution and in implementation of the policy statement on  the bases of which it won the House of Representatives' vote of  confidence. All the masses of our Yemeni people looked to you  with hope and confidence that you would devote all your efforts  and energies to implement that statement to overcome the  shortcomings of the transitional period and the failures that  accompanied it and to firmly establish the pillars of the modern  Yemeni state.    Aware of these regrettable conditions, and of the growing  suffering that their exacerbation would cause to citizens, the  Presidential Council, during its session of 23 December 1993,  invited your esteemed government for a joint meeting with the  Presidential Council to discuss the current political crisis and  the economic situation and to examine ways of tackling that  situation. However, most regrettably, the Presidential Council  was surprised to receive the brother prime minister's message  No. 6/1,241 of 26 December 1993, which conveys an apology for  not attending the meeting on the date set by the Presidential  Council. Meanwhile, the repercussions of the crisis were  escalating and becoming more serious, thus increasing citizens'  suffering to such an extent that any delay was intolerable.  Suddenly, the national currency plunged to low and serious  levels. This coincided with a general paralysis in the state's  departments and facilities and with an absence of the  government's role. In view of that situation, we hold you fully  responsible for the deteriorating situation and for all its  repercussions and harmful effects on citizens' interests and the  homeland's stability.    Brother Prime Minister, Brother Ministers: The homeland is  passing through a crucial, historic juncture and works to firmly  establish the pillars of its existence and boost its promising  march toward a prosperous future, God willing. Thanks to the  will of the strugglers and the efforts of all its sincere sons,  our homeland was able on 22 May 1990 to revive a gigantic unity  which won the world's admiration and respect. All this requires  that you stand with responsibility, faithfulness, and sincerity  in front of your consciences and responsibility and to side with  the issues and interests of your homeland and people and to  place the supreme national interest above all selfish interests  and all narrow affiliations. If, at any moment, you surrender  to such affiliations, the homeland will gain nothing but loss,  and you will gain nothing from that but the dissatisfaction of  your people, who had expected much from you. You are today  before a historic and national responsibility which you should  not fail to carry, whatever the justifications may be. We in  the Presidential Council will be a support for you inasmuch as  you will be a support for yourselves and sincere to your  responsibilities and homeland in order to honor the trust and  reform the duty.    May God grant you success and help everyone in the interest  of Yemen and its progress and prosperity under the banner of  unity and democracy. May God's peace and blessings be upon you.    [Signed] Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman  of  the Presidential Council</p>

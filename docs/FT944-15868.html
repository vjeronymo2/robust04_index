			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Finns vote 'Yes' to EU in first of Nordic ballots Finland voted yesterday to join the European Union in the first of three Nordic ballots that could enlarge membership of the EU from 12 to 16. The result, showing a Yes victory by 53 per cent to 47 per cent, was welcomed by Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister. The turnout of 74 per cent was slightly higher than the turnout in the last general election. However, the margin was less than pro-EU supporters had hoped for, and fell below Austria's Yes vote of more than 66 per cent in June. In Brussels, Mr Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner for external affairs, said he hoped the referendum result would help win a Yes vote in Sweden and Norway. In both those countries opposition to membership has been much stronger than in Finland and Austria. The Social Democratic leadership in Sweden and the Labour party government in Norway looked to Finland for added momentum to their campaigns for a Yes vote. The Finnish vote was scheduled first in the hope of achieving a Nordic domino effect. In Sweden, which votes on November 13, most polls have shown a slight but unsteady lead for the Yes side since the summer. In Norway, where the referendum is on November 28, the No camp holds a solid lead. But a weekend opinion poll for the first time showed a clear majority for membership based on a Yes in both Finland and Sweden. The poll showed 46 per cent in favour to 41 per cent against - a turnaround from last month when the same poll showed a No lead of 47 per cent against 39 per cent. The majority of Finland's political establishment and business leaders argued that membership would underpin the Finnish economy, which this year has started to recover from a crippling recession that saw output shrink by 13 per cent between 1991 and 1994 and unemployment rise to almost 20 per cent of the workforce. Finland's parliament must ratify yesterday's referendum result by a two-thirds majority before the country can join the Union as planned on January 1 next year, but this is not expected to prove an obstacle.</p>

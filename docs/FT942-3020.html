			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amsterdam sets out to regain its place at the top - The exchange has high hopes after its overhaul Flush with its recent success in clawing back business in Dutch government bonds from London, the Amsterdam stock exchange is hoping that an Fl 8m (Dollars 4.34m) overhaul of its equity trading system will re-establish its position as the principal marketplace for Dutch stocks. The most important part of the reform is the decision to abolish Amsterdam's old-fashioned system of jobbers or hoekmen, whose inability to satisfy the large-scale trading demands by international investors resulted in the flight of such business to London. According to Mr Paul Arlman, the secretary-general of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, between 40 and 60 per cent of block trades in Dutch stocks are done in London, although many of these transactions are later unwound in Amsterdam. Last year, Pounds 22.3bn (Dollars 33.45bn) worth of business in Dutch stocks was executed in London compared with Pounds 43.5bn worth of turnover in Amsterdam. The lion's share of the turnover in London was on the Stock Exchange's automated Seaq International system. Mr Thom Hoedemakers, a spokesman for the Amsterdam stock exchange, says the exchange aims to reduce London's market share to around one-quarter from its current position of one-third. The new systems, which come into operation on October 1, will effectively divide Amsterdam into two markets, one for wholesale business and the other for retail investors, who own around 40 per cent of Dutch equities. The stock exchange will offer the wholesale market two systems, an order-driven and screen-based trading system called Aida through which orders can be executed automatically and with a high degree of anonymity. Those wishing to trade outside the system can advertise their prices on Asset, a screen-based system, which aims to compete with Seaq International. Although the hoekmen, who will act as US-style stock specialists, will have access to the wholesale market, they are likely to trade mainly in the retail market. Senior managers at leading stockbrokers in London, which are also members of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange through their Dutch subsidiaries, say the removal of the central role of the jobbers is the most sensible feature of the reforms. 'There will be a greater incentive to trade, or report trades, in Amsterdam as a result,' says the head of European trading at a leading UK bank. Brokers warn, however, that the diverse trading systems which Amsterdam has put in place must quickly prove that they can produce more competitive prices than London, since the flow of order-driven business will always be dictated by price. Some point out, for example, that prices on Asset are likely to be even less firm than on Seaq. In addition, they believe that Amsterdam will have difficulty in recouping business in the large Dutch stocks, such as Royal Dutch and Unilever, since they have been trading on an international basis for such a long time. However, they say that the exchange will have a far higher success rate in attracting back business in second-line stocks, such as Aegon or Ahold, which are also actively traded in London.</p>

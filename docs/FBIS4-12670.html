			<p>BFN     [Text] During today's open session of the Islamic Majles  the deputies approved a bill on establishing public and  revolution courts. The justice minister [Mohammad Esma'il  Shushtari] explained how this bill would affect the judicial  branch. We draw your attention to his remarks:    [Begin Shushtari recording] Under our existing legal  apparatus, penal and criminal cases are in fact investigated in  two stages; that is, in the prosecutor's office or tribunals  [dadsara] as the first stage, and in the law court [mahkameh] as  the second stage. The process is lengthy and each case lasts a  long time. Whereas the latest bill combines the two stages into  one. In other words, the prosecutor's office and the law court  will investigate each case simultaneously to close the file  quicker.    The second point is that at present we have many courts of  various categories investigating each case. Shortage of  manpower or other necessary resources in the towns with judicial  units has prevented the establishment of all such courts. As a  result the people have faced difficulties and have had to travel  to other judicial zones. Fortunately thanks to the latest bill,  every branch of different courts is qualified to investigate all  cases.    The third point here is in fact the abolition of the penal  and revolution tribunals. This does not mean such tribunals  will no longer exist; rather their existing system is to be  abolished and they will work with the courts as investigative  judges. From this date, the main judicial bodies are the public  courts and the revolution courts. The tribunals and  prosecutor's offices will be dissolved. They will be working as  investigative judges with and under the supervision of the  courts and court judges. [end recording]</p>

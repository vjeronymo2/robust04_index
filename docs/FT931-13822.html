			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Prime People profit warning as chief quits PRIME People, the Manchester-based specialist training group which recently completed a Pounds 2.8m reverse takeover of Bowford Engineering, issued a profits warning late yesterday and announced that its chairman, Mr Alan Greenough, had resigned. Mr Greenough has been replaced by Mr Peter Hearn, a chartered accountant and existing board member. In addition, Mr Chris Heayberd has joined the board as finance director and will conduct a cost reduction programme and introduce tight financial controls. The board said that as a result of a 'lower than expected level of activity,' principally in Bowford Engineering, results for the year to October 31 were expected to be 'significantly below expectations.' Ahead of the announcement Prime People's stock had closed unchanged at 4 1/2 p. Last November analysts expected the combined group to report a four-fold increase in annual pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1.1m.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Thorp; a testing option, and flawed economics (3) Sir, On June 28, 1993, environment secretary John Gummer called for an extended review period on the commissioning of Thorp and noted that, among other issues, plutonium production and the impact on the proliferation of nuclear weapons needed to be investigated more fully. WBMG Environmental Communications commissioned a report on the issue from the European Proliferation Information Centre (EPIC) which concluded that: Thorp would generate 50 tonnes of plutonium for export in the first decade of its operation, sufficient for 5,000 nuclear bombs. This would result in about 70 transports a year, representing a significant increase in terrorist opportunities. The nuclear regulatory bodies are already stretched as the quantity of material they are required to safeguard has trebled in the past 10 years while the number of inspectors has only increased by 50 per cent. They will be further hard pressed to deal effectively with a growing inventory of nuclear material. These findings, among others, were presented to selected secretaries of state, including Mr Gummer, and to opposition spokespeople. Press reports quoting government officials indicate that ministers have decided such wider issues are 'not relevant' to the debate on Thorp, confirming that Whitehall minds are firmly closed on the matter.

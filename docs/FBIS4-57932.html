			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Miguel Alfonso,  official spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, said he will  hold periodic meetings with the media to brief them on the  Ministry's activities and to answer reporters' questions. The  diplomat and scholar, who has been Ministry spokesman since  April, said his appointment was due to a "need that had been  felt for a long time." The Foreign Ministry spokesman is  virtually the only official of his kind in the Cuban Government.    Alfonso said that during the meetings with reporters, he  will  brief them on the activities of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  and other Ministry officials as well as comment on events in the  area. He did not say, however, if officials in other ministries  would assume a similar role.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman began his duties in April  during "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which was  attended by Cuban officials and approximately 200 exiles. On  that occasion, Alfonso was introduced as a conference spokesman,  but in ensuing weeks he continued as spokesman for the Foreign  Ministry's routine activities.    The Ministry spokesman is a professor at the Higher  Institute  of International Relations and until last year was a member of  the Cuban delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission based in  Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

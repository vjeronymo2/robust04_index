			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEATTLE RENEWS ATTEMPT TO MAKE BUSING WORK;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TEST 'CONTROLLED CHOICE' PLAN; SOME PARENTS CALL IT 'CONTROLLED CHAOS'  </P> <P> School officials have a name for the new racial busing plan that went into  effect last month: controlled choice.  </P> <P> Some unhappy parents have another name for it: controlled chaos.  </P> <P> Either way, the attempt to revive a faltering 12-year effort at school racial  integration is being quickly tested before facing a non-binding referendum of  the electorate in November.  </P> <P> Seattle is now the biggest school district in the nation to try controlled  choice. The busing plan was first designed by Cambridge, Mass., as an  alternative to the 1970s mandatory busing in neighboring Boston that fostered  violence and resistence. At least nine cities nationwide are believed to be  trying some form of the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Be Litmus Test  </P> <P> After a summer in which an alleged resurgence of racism was a hot topic in  movies, television documentaries and the media, this renewed attempt by Seattle  to make busing work -- in a liberal, mostly white city -- may prove a litmus  test of school integration.  </P> <P> Controlled choice offers parents a carrot: "magnet" schools that offer varied  curriculums to lure students across town. But if the magnets fail to draw  enough students, mandatory busing to achieve racial balance still can be  imposed.  </P> <P> The district recently won $3.3 million in federal funds to help create magnet  schools with specialties in subjects from performing arts to careers in the  aircraft industry.  </P> <P> Parents can choose from schools located in one of several geographic clusters  in the city, but getting their choice hinges on whether it will enable a school  to meet the district's integration guidelines. Schools are not supposed to be  more than 70% minority or have more than 50% of a single minority.  </P> <P> The new program got off to a rocky start Sept. 6. Some angry parents waited  four hours at school district information centers before being told an  overburdened computer system could still not place their late-registering  children in schools. Hundreds of students throughout the district were left  unregistered.  </P> <P> Others parents complained their kindergartners were riding buses up to 2 1/2  hours for 2 1/2 hours of school.  </P> <P> And 3,000 expected students initially didn't show up at all.  </P> <P> But problems are being ironed out. Students are assigned and parents are less  confused. Although figures are still being compiled, school administrators  believe the enrollment is growing.  </P> <P> Seattle's school district says that under controlled choice, 93% of the  students got their first or second choice of schools this September, many of  them closer to home.  </P> <P> The district says only 13% of the students are presently bused solely for  racial integration as compared to 50% under the old plan.  </P> <P> "People are feeling quite good," school district Supt. William Kendrick said.  "We've greatly reduced the number of students with mandatory busing  assignments."  </P> <P> "It's going to save a lot of money on transportation we can put into  education," promised Ellen Roe, a school board member who was the lone board  opponent of Seattle's 1977 mandatory busing plan and a crusader for this  replacement.  </P> <P> Kendrick, who has spent his three years at the helm of Seattle's schools  pushing the new plan into place, was optimistic it could stem the erosion of  students from his district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers Drop  </P> <P> In the past 12 years of mandatory busing, Seattle's student population has  fallen from 54,000 to about 42,000 -- leading to painful budget cuts -- and the  percentage that is minority has climbed from 33% to 54%.  </P> <P> But the debut of controlled choice was hampered by an administrative snarl as  overtaxed administrators and computers struggled to juggle the students into  racial, academic and geographic balance.  </P> <P> T. J. Vassar, the black chairman of the school board, said controlled choice  should not be judged from the first-day confusion. "The job is bigger than we  thought it was, and we're suffering from its magnitude," he said.  </P> <P> As the experiment progressed, Vassar said the parent reaction to the new plan  "may be 50-50 pro and con, judging from what I have heard personally."  </P> <P> But a formal judgment is not far away. On the November city ballot is a  citizens' initiative that in effect calls on Seattle to abandon racial busing  and go back to open enrollment and neighborhood schools.  </P> <P> "Busing is ignorant of human nature," said Kathy Baxter, a white parent  spearheading the initiative. "It ignores what people are likely to do and pays  attention to what people ought to do."  </P> <P> She contends busing has driven out the middle class from a community that  didn't have serious racial problems in the first place and replaced it with a  city "resegregated economically."  </P> <P> The busing issue has become a factor in school board races, with busing  opponents hoping to elect three members this fall who would provide the margin  to abandon controlled choice. It also has become the central issue in the  mayoral race, even though mayors have no control over schools. A white  Republican and controlled choice opponent, Doug Jewett, is facing off for the  mayor's seat against a black Democrat, Norm Rice, who favors the program.  </P> <P> If school integration can work in any big city, it should work in Seattle. The  city of approximately 490,000 is just 23% minority, with Asians and blacks at  about 9% each and the remainder Native Americans and Latinos. And politically,  the Emerald City's population is largely liberal, voting heavily Democratic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escapes Court Order  </P> <P> So it wasn't surprising when in 1977 the Seattle school board voted 6 to 1 to  adopt compulsory busing after a voluntary plan had failed. Seattle was the  first big city to do so without a court order. (In contrast, the Los Angeles  Unified School District underwent nearly three years of court-ordered mandatory  busing that ended in 1981 and now offers voluntary integration programs,  including magnet schools and a transfer policy that allows students from  racially isolated neighborhoods to attend the school of their choice.)  </P> <P> Seattle's compulsory busing program swiftly ran into problems. Some of the  richest, whitest neighborhoods were effectively exempted from busing of  elementary children to maintain political support.  </P> <P> And the same geography that makes Seattle a pretty city made it a nightmare to  thread buses through. Long and narrow, Seattle is cut by hills, waterways and  bridges.  </P> <P> Bus rides were long, and their administration often nonsensical, some parents  charged. Minorities in white neighborhoods, or white children in black  neighborhoods, were sometimes bused across town instead of helping balance  neighborhood schools where they already were.  </P> <P> Some whites and blacks who applauded the social goal moved in frustration to  the suburbs.  </P> <P> "Statistically," said former Mayor Wes Uhlman, "there's no question that the  plan hasn't really worked. I view it as a failed experiment, though a noble  one. We accelerated white flight with the experiment."  </P> <P> Despite integration and repeated reforms, minority test scores have stayed  stubbornly 20 to 40 percentage points below that of whites. And blacks were  also disciplined twice as often as whites, district studies found.  </P> <P> Worst of all, the rising ratio of minorities meant balancing numbers got  harder, not easier. By 1988, Seattle had the same number of schools flunking  integration guidelines as when busing had started.  </P> <P> Yet despite all these problems, public hearings on Seattle's busing program did  not turn up a consensus to abandon it, even though the threat of court-ordered  busing seemed more remote. In fact, a recent Chamber of Commerce poll showed  general satisfaction with the schools.  </P> <P> If controlled choice works as hoped, busing will not be eliminated. But  students who once could expect to be bounced among two or even three elementary  schools are now guaranteed the chance to stay through all six grades. Ditto for  junior high and high school.  </P> <P> Opinion remains sharply divided in Seattle on busing's cost and benefits.  Uhlman, for example, said busing seemed to worsen the racial attitudes of his  own son, and Baxter, the anti-busing initiative leader, blames it for emptying  some heavily targeted white neighborhoods of families.  </P> <P> Others say the city's changing demographics had little to do with busing. "I  don't think we have a white flight problem," Vassar, the school board chairman,  insisted.  </P> <P> Evidence of busing's effect on students has been equally conflicting. There are  many accounts of students making friends across racial lines, countered by  others where students separated in seating and socializing by race.  </P> <P> And some believe that school integration has promoted more social and  residential mixing of adults.  </P> <P> Now, "a lot more minorities live all over the city," said school board member  Roe.  </P> <P> "It has allowed people to get together, not only kids but parents as well,"  said high school Principal Andres Tangalin, who has been in the district 17  years. "Through that they get new impressions and insights they didn't have  before."  </P> <P> Oscar Eason Jr. was chairman of the citizens committee that led the three-year  effort to junk the old busing plan and try controlled choice. While he hopes  the new system works, the black activist does not agree with critics of the old  plan.  </P> <P> "Nobody likes busing," he said, "but history has shown that separate is not  equal. Minority schools simply deteriorate."  </P> <P> Is Seattle's experience, then, a success?  </P> <P> "Yes," said Eason. "If we hadn't had busing, I'd shudder to think what racism  would be like in our society today."  </P> <P> Bill Dietrich, a reporter for the Seattle Times, wrote this story for the Los  Angeles Times.  </P></p>

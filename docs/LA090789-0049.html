			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'STAR WARS' GOAL CUT, QUAYLE SAYS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE ROLE TO BE LIMITED; CALLS REAGAN'S PLAN 'POLITICAL JARGON'  </P> <P> Conceding that former President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" plan was only  "political jargon," Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday that the missile  defense concept has been revised into a smaller and cheaper program without the  pretense of being able to deflect a massive Soviet first strike.  </P> <P> Quayle said the Bush Administration's revised plan is intended only to cope  with a limited Soviet attack or with the sort of missile strike that could be  mounted by a Third World nation that might acquire a small arsenal of  relatively unsophisticated rockets.  </P> <P> "We have redefined (Star Wars and) put it into missions, requirements, doctrine  and strategy much differently than we did in the early 1980s," Quayle said  during a lunch with editors and reporters of The Times Washington Bureau.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once Staunch Supporter  </P> <P> The vice president was once a staunch supporter of the proposal, officially  known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan said would end the  danger of nuclear war by making atomic weapons "impotent." But Quayle admitted  Wednesday that the plan was never realistic.  </P> <P> He said Reagan "talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to be  completely leak proof. . . . I believe that, in the semantics of let's say  political jargon, that that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the  capability of a strategic defense system."  </P> <P> Instead of the system that Reagan said could protect U.S. cities, Quayle said  the Bush Administration is supporting a plan called "Brilliant Pebbles" which  would release swarms of mini-missiles to track incoming rockets. He declined to  estimate the cost of the revised program, but said it would cost far less than  the Reagan Administration's proposal.  </P> <P> The purpose of the plan, which is still in the research stage, is to thin out a  flight of incoming missiles, but it makes no claim of being able to get them  all. As a defense system for the U.S. retaliatory missile force, the system  might be effective. But supporters of the plan admit it would be of almost no  use in defending a city because even a single warhead could do incredible  damage.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials have expressed growing skepticism about the  original "Star Wars" concept in recent months. But Quayle, as the  highest-ranking of ficial to raise doubts about the plan, seemed to finish it  off.  </P> <P> Quayle said the Bush proposal could not turn back an "all out, bolt out of the  blue attack" by the Soviet Union. But he said it could be effective against a  limited Soviet attack and might protect the nation from accidental missile  launches or from attacks by other nations that recently have acquired missile  technology.  </P> <P> He implied that the Administration's more modest objectives might go a long way  toward removing a major obstacle to a U.S.-Soviet agreement to reduce strategic  offensive weapons. In the past, Moscow has insisted on stringent limits on the  U.S. missile defense program as part of any strategic arms agreement.  </P> <P> But Quayle made it clear that he continues to consider Moscow to be a dangerous  adversary, despite Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's relaxation of  central control over the nations of Eastern Europe and the constituent  republics that make up the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> He said the West has begun exploring how to "manage the decline of the Soviet  empire." This planning, he indicated, includes contingency plans for dealing  with a Soviet crackdown on reform policies in Poland or elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Clearly there have been discussions much more along the lines of 'OK, if you  (the Soviet Union) are going to open up and then there would be a clamp down .  . . ,' " he said without finishing the sentence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Heartened' by Poland  </P> <P> "I think we have to get away from the wild euphoria that somehow this  transition and change is going to come in the real near term," he said. "We are  very heartened by what's happened in Poland. Poland has made tremendous  progress. We're heartened by what is beginning to happen in Hungary. But we're  also realists and look at statements that are coming out toward the Baltic  states. . . . Let us remind ourselves that we're still dealing with a  totalitarian government and there are going to be bumps along the transition."  </P> <P> Quayle responded to questions, most of them focused on foreign policy, for more  than an hour without referring to notes or other references. Although he showed  brief flashes of the self-deprecating humor that he often uses to defuse  criticism, the vice president appeared confident throughout. He dismissed  opinion polls that indicate the public is skeptical of his ability to assume  the presidency.  </P> <P> "I do not worry about polls," Quayle said. "I'm not there to look at my polling  numbers. I'm there to look at the President's polling numbers and see how the  President is doing. This President is doing quite well in terms of the American  public. I'm part of the team."  </P> <P> On a domestic topic, Quayle said Bush hopes to be able to sign a child-care  bill this year. But he said the President would not hesitate to veto a  Democratic-backed bill that he considers too costly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush 'Firmly Committed'  </P> <P> "This President has submitted a child-care proposal," Quayle said. "He's firmly  committed to his proposal.  </P> <P> "I would say a good precedent is the minimum wage proposal," he added. "The  President said this is unacceptable as it stands. The Congress went ahead for,  I believe, basically political reasons and tried to put the President in a  corner. He vetoed it. As a result, we don't have a minimum wage bill. I don't  think they want to do the same thing on child care, but that will be their  decision."  </P> <P> Bush has proposed a child tax credit for poor families, assuming that the  recipients will use the money for child care and that they will be able to find  the services they need. The Democrats are backing a bill that would provide  states with money not only to offset poor families' child-care payments but  that would expand and enhance child-care facilities.  </P></p>

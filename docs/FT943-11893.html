			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: China threatens hard line on trade liberalisation China yesterday threatened to back away from commitments to further liberalise its trading regime in an angry response to what it perceives as US attempts to impose tough conditions on its re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chinese officials have made no secret of their displeasure at the US role in complex negotiations over the resumption of China's Gatt status. Mr Miao Fuchun, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, said Beijing's patience was wearing thin and it was unclear whether compromise was possible under present circumstances. 'The negotiations have reached a critical moment. Our application is supported by a majority of the contracting parties, including Japan and the European Union. But the US has made excessive demands we cannot accept,' he said. 'It is not treating us as a developing country, which we obviously are. We will not rejoin Gatt just for the sake of it. If China is unable to resume its Gatt status, it will not be bound by Gatt and all the commitments made over the past eight years will be nullified.' Mr Miao repeated similar threats issued by other senior trade officials, including Mrs Wu Yi, the foreign trade minister. But his remarks were sharper and underline growing Chinese frustration over what Beijing sees as the slow progress of negotiations. Talks on China's application to rejoin Gatt, which it left in 1949, are due to resume in Geneva this week. But though Beijing is keen to conclude them in time to become a founding member of the World Trade Organisation early next year, observers say that will require rapid progress in the next few months. Though Gatt members hope to agree soon on the basis for a draft protocol for China's accession, the US and the EU insist that much will depend on whether Beijing presents a package of acceptable concessions in September. The EU is prepared to grant Beijing's request for a transition period to adjust to Gatt obligations after it joins. The US argues that China should enter on terms similar to those required for a developed country.</p>

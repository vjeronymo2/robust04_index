			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Directors who flout safety law face ban, HSE warns BUSINESS CHIEFS who flout health and safety law may be banned from being company directors and face heavy fines, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. Lewes Crown Court, sitting at Hove, recently clarified its unprecedented use of powers under the 1986 Company Directors Disqualification Act. The court disqualified Mr Rodney Chapman, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, from being a company director for two years and fined him Pounds 5,000 in a prosecution brought by the executive earlier this year. His company was also fined Pounds 5,000 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 3,553. The court clarified the ban at a second hearing in October. It is the first time a director has been banned under this act for breaching health and safety law. In 1990 a prohibition notice was served on Chapman Chalk Supplies, of Jevington, East Sussex. The executive said that a site run by the company was dangerous because of falling rock where employees were working. Mr David Eves, theexecutive's deputy director-general, said: 'It's another weapon in our armoury.' The Health and Safety Commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows that accidents and ill health at work are costing employers up to Pounds 9bn a year. The report shows 466 deaths, 28,961 major injuries and 150,427 other serious injuries provisionally recorded, compared with the previous year's final totals of 538; 30,684; and 158,000. The 1991-92 final figures are expected to be nearer the 1990-91 totals. Sir John Cullen, HSC chairman, said yesterday that health and safety enforcement on the railway post-privatisation would be more expensive. He said the commission would 'need to put in the resources and the people' to protect safety standards on a 'fragmented' rail network.</p>

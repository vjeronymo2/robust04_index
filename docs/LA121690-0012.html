			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: FICTION  </P> <P> THE SUMMER OF THE PAYMASTER by Alfred Nielsen (W. W. Norton: $19.95; 379 pp.)  This riveting book is easy enough on the surface to dismiss as another "coming  of age" novel centered around a group of boys growing up in the late '60s on  Staten Island.  </P> <P> But the summer of '68 is a critical one as Andrew (the Chun) Hapanowicz --  toiling as a pump jockey at Pete's Mobil station next to the world's largest  garbage dump -- eagerly, but apprehensively, awaits the return of his special  best friend, Jimmy Dietz, from Vietnam. The mystic paymaster of the title, a  roving Mobil Oil representative who prowls the company's filling stations and  rewards pump jockeys for outstanding work, gives some purpose to the Chun's  life at a time when his self-worth is under a severe strain. These are tough  and complex kids, makings for a strong debut novel. Donald G. Campbell  </P></p>

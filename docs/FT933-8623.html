			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unilever ahead of City forecasts - Second quarter advance of 7% leaves half year result at Pounds 984m UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, lived up to its reputation for dependability yesterday with a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the second quarter to end-June. The rise was the same as that in the first quarter, and the company said it expected the performance to be maintained in the second half. The results were slightly better than market expectations, and the shares rose 11p to 986p. The rise to Pounds 564m against Pounds 526m, makes Pounds 984m (Pounds 919m) for the half year. The increase was at constant exchange rates and Unilever said its net profit - up 8 per cent on the same basis - was up 21 per cent if recalculated at current exchange rates, thus giving effect to sterling's devaluation last September. Mr Michael Perry, the chairman, said the performance was much weaker in the US and Europe than in the rest of the world. US operating profit for the quarter was down 8 per cent, mostly because of increased competition in detergents and pasta sauces, while European profit was down 1 per cent. He added that in the rest of the world, profit was up 45 per cent. This was partly due to the full consolidation of Brooke Bond and Lipton in India, and the Dollars 284m (Pounds 190m) acquisition of the Cica tomato-based food business in Brazil. However, Unilever said there were widespread increases in sales and profits outside the US and Europe, and its operations in Japan, lossmaking for some years, were on target to break even this year. In the second quarter, operating margins in Europe fell from 9.7 per cent to 9.4 per cent, and in the US from 6.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Margins in the rest of the world rose sharply from 8.2 per cent to 9.6 per cent. Sales in the first half were up 6 per cent. Unilever said the increase was made up of 2.5 per cent extra sales volume, 2.5 per cent increased prices and 1 per cent from acquisitions net of disposals. Acquisitions in the period contributed Pounds 31m of operating profit on sales of Pounds 285m. In the first half of 1992 subsequently discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 200m of turnover and Pounds 7m operating profit. Partly as a result of the acquisition programme, interim net debt was Pounds 1.925bn, compared with about Pounds 1.5bn the year before. Group sales for the second quarter and half year respectively were Pounds 6.66bn (Pounds 6.31bn) and Pounds 12.69bn (Pounds 11.94bn). Operating profit was Pounds 585m (Pounds 548m) and Pounds 1.03bn (Pounds 967m). Interest payments net of investment income came to Pounds 21m (Pounds 22m) and Pounds 44m (Pounds 48m). Earnings per share, at current exchange rates, were 20.58p (16.98p) and 36.38p (30.07p). The interim dividend will be declared with the third quarter results in November. See Lex</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Inquiry demanded into Malaysian central bank THE OPPOSITION in Malaysia has called for a full inquiry into the activities of Bank Negara, the country's central bank, following a dramatic fall in the bank's special reserves. Bank Negara's 1992 accounts, published earlier this month, reported a MDollars 10bn (Pounds 2.53bn) charge last year against special contingency funds arising from a loss in its gold and foreign exchange holdings. Analysts in Kuala Lumpur allege that the central bank, known in London, Tokyo and New York as an aggressive, and at times flamboyant, foreign exchange dealer, lost millions of dollars last year in foreign exchange trans-actions. Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action party, told parliament the fall in the special reserves account was equivalent to an entire year's government development expenditures. Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, said this month the fall in the special reserves had been misrepresented.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Yen pauses for breath The dollar yesterday fell against leading currencies, but traded above its Monday low against the yen, writes Philip Gawith. Panic selling in New York on Monday drove the dollar down to Y101 at one point, but trading was calmer yesterday with the US currency closing in London at Y103.1, one yen lower than Monday's close. The dollar has fallen by about six per cent since President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa last week failed to agree steps on how to curb Japan's large trade surplus with the US. Traders said the market had paused to assess how the US administration planned to respond to the breakdown of the talks. The US administration has in the past used a stronger yen to curb the deficit, since it makes Japanese exports more expensive. In Europe, meanwhile, sterling weakened after the release of lower than expected industrial output figures. The D-Mark was stronger against most EMS currencies with the market anticipating no easing of policy at Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. Observers were split yesterday on the short-term outlook for the yen. Although there is widespread agreement that economic fundamentals favour a stronger dollar, some argue that the market implications of this have been misjudged. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, says the weakness of the Japanese economy has encouraged capital repatriation which has put upward pressure on the yen. He said the failure of the trade talks was merely a trigger for investment funds to liquidate dollar holdings bought in anticipation of a recovery in the US currency. Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the market had got itself into a difficult position by assuming 'more of the same' and driving the yen significantly higher. The problem is that Y100.3 is the level at which the US Federal Reserve last intervened to support the dollar when it was weak last August. Mr Cocker said the market now appeared to be waiting to see what sort of punitive measures the US implements, before seeing whether it can push the yen higher. Intervention by the Bank of Japan and profit-taking also reduced the momentum of yen appreciation. Market reports suggest the BOJ may have spent as much as Dollars 1bn trying to prop up the dollar. A statement from the US Treasury that the Clinton administration was not trying to talk up the yen also helped, although some in the market questioned its credibility. Mr Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase Manhattan, argues that 'it is hard to foresee any action from the US that will help prevent yen strengthening until there are some trade concessions forthcoming, or until the yen has reached a level where further declines would clearly be damaging for the US economy.' The dollar dropped across the board as its weakness against the yen flowed across to other currencies. It finished in London nearly two pfennigs lower at DM1.7255 from DM1.7438. The strength of the D-Mark was assisted by comments made in Washington by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German Minister of Economics, who said he did not expect German interest rates to decline 'in the next few days or weeks'. This lent support to the market view that the Bundesbank council will not cut interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday. The central bank is considered unlikely to ease policy while a strike threat over wage settlements looms in the key engineering sector. The Bundesbank's February monthly report, due for release this morning, should give an indication of what can be expected on Thursday. The D-Mark was also firmer against most European currencies, trading near the top of its trading range against the French franc, sterling and the Italian lira. Economic data suggesting the UK economic recovery may be less robust than previously thought undermined sterling which closed in London at DM2.5463, down from DM2.5622 on Monday. The poor figures gave rise to renewed speculation that the government may again ease monetary policy. Interest rates were cut by 25 basis points last week. UK industrial production figures showed a 0.6 per cent fall in December after a revised 0.2 per cent rise in November. Manufacturing output in the same month fell 0.5 per cent. Earlier the Confederation of British Industry said in its monthly survey for January that UK retail sales growth remains patchy, with the outlook for modest growth only. The rate of growth in sales was the slowest for 12 months. Sterling did not really join in the rally against the dollar. After trading as high as Dollars 1.4830, it fell after the release of the output numbers to close in London at Dollars 1.4757 against the weak dollar, only slightly higher than Monday's close of Dollars 1.4693. The way forward for sterling will be determined today by the release of key data, particularly January's retail sales and the retail prices index. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.605bn of assistance. This compared with a forecast of a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.6bn, revised down from an earlier forecast of Pounds 1.7bn.</p>

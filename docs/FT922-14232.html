			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (10): User-friendly systems  -Pen-Based Computing THE COMPUTER keyboard is widely accepted to be, at best, an awkward interface between man and machine. Apple's success with the Macintosh, Microsoft's with its Windows icon-based operating environment, and the proliferation of pointing devices - such as the mouse - all appear to reflect the desire for a more intuitive interface. The best hopes for developing a truly 'natural' interface probably lie in either voice activated or pen-based computing (or a combination of both). Of the two, pen computing is more developed with a handful of commercial products already in the market and predictions from some manufacturers and industry analysts that it will be 'the next personal computer boom business'. Portable computers, including hand-held units, are expected to be the main PC growth market through the middle of the 1990s and BIS Strategic Decisions, the market research company, predicts the market for pen-based computer systems will be worth Dollars 1.5bn by 1995. Among the first full function machines to reach the market are those from manufacturers such as Grid, part of Tandy's Victor Technologies unit, AT&amp;T's NCR subsidiary, Californian start-up Momenta, and Fujitsu's Poqet Computer. These pen-based machines come in several guises. Momenta's new machine, built around Intel's 80386sx chip and developed with Dollars 40m of venture capital, is a hybrid since it comes with a wired copper-tipped electronic 'pen' and a small keyboard which its manufacturer claims makes it ideal for applications such as taking notes at meetings, business planning or for editing and correcting reports. The machine runs industry standard MsDos, Momenta's own operating software, Momenta Software Environment (MSE), and Microsoft's PenWindows. However, most pen computers do not have keyboards - although some, including Grid's new Gridpad SL, have ports at the back for a plug-in keyboard and VGA monitor. Usually, however, they make do with LCD screens with digitiser pads underneath that enable the screen to double as an electronic tablet or slate, and a plastic stylus or 'pen' for 'writing'. The pen is used to write free text, using one or more of the pen operating systems, complete electronic forms by filling in boxes, or indicate sections of a diagram on the computer screen - for example, marking the position of damage on car bodywork. One advantage claimed for pen systems is that they are simple to use and will enable even the most keyboard-illiterate, from the chief executive to the humblest blue-collar worker, to exploit computer technology. The simplest pen-based systems are intended for applications where a paper copy is required but where a printer would be cumbersome or too expensive. One example of such a machine is the ScriptWriter, produced by Peripheral Vision of the UK, which can be used for taking down an order, and leaving a hard copy with the customer. Because they are relatively simple, these electronic clipboards are considerably less expensive than their more sophisticated counterparts. Other machines are primarily intended for vertical applications, where customised software enables engineers, market researchers, nurses or surveyors, for example, to gather data. In this role, the pen operates as a kind of glorified mouse, pointing to items on the screen to select them. The pen can also be used to tick boxes and to draw with the result saved as an image for later retrieval. For example, insurance company assessors are using one application on the Gridpad pen computer to calculate the cost of motor accident repairs by displaying expanded vehicle diagrams on the screen. By touching individual components on the screen with the pen, the machine records the parts that need replacing. The more sophisticated applications for pen computers depend on the handwriting recognition software which comes with most of the latest machines. Using this software, pen-based systems can recognise and interpret letters or numbers. However, the ability to use a pen computer like the traditional notebook and pen is still some way off. This is because you have to 'train' the software to interpret the quirks of individual writing styles and even then most software will fail to correctly identify as much as 20 per cent of the text. What is more, most typists, even the two-fingered variety, can write more quickly with a keyboard. For these and other reasons some critics argue that the advantages of pen computing are being overstated. Stephen Arnold, chairman and founder of Softa, a UK-based independent systems consultancy, says that pen computing appears to be a solution looking for an application.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Portillo leads race for Tory chairman Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, emerged yesterday as a leading candidate to replace Sir Norman Fowler as chairman of the Conservative party. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is understood to be considering four candidates to replace Sir Norman when he stands down in the summer. Mr Major would like the job to go to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who is regarded as the government's best communicator, in spite of a heart attack last year. However, Mr Heseltine has told friends he is not interested in the job. He wants to continue at trade and industry at least until the next elec-tion. Mr Major's second choice is Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who is a leading cabinet standard-bearer for the Conservative left. But Mr Hunt has also let it be known that he would rather remain in a departmental post. The reluctance of the two frontrunners leaves the field to Mr Portillo and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, who is seen as attractive to women voters. Lord Archer, the novelist and former deputy party chairman, would like the job, but is regarded as an outside candidate. Mr Major has given Mr Portillo an opportunity to display his organisational skills by putting him in charge of the Conservative campaigns in London and the south-east for this year's local and European elections. The government expects to be trounced in both elections. But the polls will allow Mr Portillo to raise his public profile and demonstrate his campaigning ability. A better-than-expected result would provide a sound platform for promotion to the party chairmanship, seen as a key role in the run-up to a general election.</p>

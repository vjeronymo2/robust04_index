			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Linde hit by strength of D-Mark LINDE, the German engineering group, yesterday announced a fall of just more than a third in pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year. It predicted profits for the full year would also be down. Hit by the effects of a strong D-Mark and by domestic recession, pre-tax profits fell to DM161.1m (Dollars 96.7m) from DM243.1m in the first half of last year. Turnover fell 6.9 per cent to DM3.23bn. Linde warned that sales would be down 5 per cent for the whole year. Order intake rose to DM5.99bn, 10 per cent higher than at the end of 1992. This reflected a number of new plant construction contracts. Linde said demand for fork-lift trucks and warehousing equipment was sharply lower than expectations. The European market for fork-lift trucks, for example, shrunk 26 per cent in the six months. Without recent acquisitions, the group's turnover in this market segment was down 16 per cent, and order intake by 18 per cent. The strengthening of the D-Mark against European currencies also hit the fridge manufacturing business.</p>

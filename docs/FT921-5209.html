			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Pension agency proves a hard-nosed player / A look at the court-room battles brought about by underfunding WHEN LTV, the large but bankrupt US steelmaker, unveiled its long-awaited reorganisation plan earlier this month, the first applause came from a seemingly obscure direction. Jolly good, said the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Don't be fooled. The PBGC may sound like a well-intentioned quango, but it is frequently one of the most controversial, and hard-nosed, players in the US bankruptcy process - and never more so than in the six-year-old battle over LTV's carcass. This federal agency has no real counterpart in the UK. It was created in 1974 by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa), and its title accurately describes its mandate: to guarantee the payment of basic retirement benefits. In practice, the PBGC - technically, part of the US Labour Department - does this by insuring most private employee pension plans and collecting premiums from employers to fund its efforts. Over 40m American workers, in around 85,000 pension plans, are covered by PBGC insurance. But the agency's task has not been easy of late. According to the 1991 annual report, released last month, total underfunding in plans guaranteed by the PBGC has reached a staggering Dollars 40bn. Is this, pessimists mutter darkly, another thrift industry crisis in the making? Well, perhaps not quite. Calculations of underfunding depend on actuarial assumptions, and there is some political incentive for the PBGC to paint a gloomy picture. Nevertheless, the agency's losses in recent years have been significant: the accumulated deficit in the main 'single-employer' programme topped Dollars 2.5bn at end-1991, while PBGC itself reported a net Dollars 542m loss for 1991, after investment income. Obviously, this dismal state of affairs is linked directly to corporate America's parlous finances. Subject to some complex rules, PBGC's guarantees are triggered when either an employer or the agency itself 'terminates' a pension plan. If it is underfunded, the PBGC becomes a trustee for the plan and, while paying out something between the basic and maximum benefit levels, fights to recover whatever monies it can. Not surprisingly, the most high-profile terminations involving 'underfunded' plans have occured in bankruptcies. At Eastern Airlines, for example, where seven pension plans were terminated in October 1990, the PBGC estimated the underfunding at around Dollars 700m. At Pan Am - where the PBGC itself moved to terminate two of the three plans last July - the agency calculated a Dollars 914m deficit. At LTV, the unfunded pension obligations are put at Dollars 3.1bn. So how has the federal agency - whose own internal auditing procedures were subject to criticism two years ago - reacted to the mounting challenge? Part of the answer lies in higher employers' premiums. But, on a second front, the PBGC has also been involved in fisticuffs in the courts as it tries to maximise the return from reorganisation plans hammered out between bankrupts and their numerous creditors. It is in this context that LTV has become a landmark case. The steel-based conglomerate had four pension plans - one of which ran out of money shortly after the bankruptcy filing in 1986, forcing the PBGC to take it over. The others were terminated in early 1987. Since then, the agency has been trying to push responsibility for the latter trio of plans back on to LTV, and the US Supreme Court, no less, has weighed in, in support. In practice, the upshot at LTV looks likely to be a deal, whereby the company takes back the three plans and makes an immediate cash injection of around Dollars 1.5bn. The steelmaker will then make up the pension shortfall over a 30-year period. The PBGC, meanwhile, will receive 30-year zero coupon notes to help satisfy a Dollars 700m claim for underfunding in the fourth plan. The agency's enthusiasm for a reorganisation along these lines is understandable. Assuming the scheme goes through as filed - and this may depend on union concessions - LTV's unsecured creditors will end up with only a small portion of their claims, satisfied largely in common stock. But if LTV is ending in victory for the PBGC, new battles are looming. The pension scheme at Trans World Airlines, the ailing carrier which is owned by Mr Carl Icahn and which filed for bankruptcy in January, is reckoned by the agency to be underfunded to the tune of Dollars 933m. Of this, Dollars 440m refers to guaranteed benefits. Because Mr Icahn owns over 80 per cent of TWA's equity, his other private companies (some of which are more healthy) are deemed to be jointly and severally liable for the TWA pension plans. However, for most of last year it looked as if an outline reorganisation plan at TWA would cut Mr Icahn's stake to a minority interest, and that the PBGC would thus lose recourse to the businessman's other interests. Then, with remarkably little publicity, the Missouri senator Mr John Danforth introduced an Erisa amendment which was quietly enacted late in 1991. This would preserve the contingent liability of other Icahn-controlled companies for TWA's pension plans, even if the tycoon's ownership interest in TWA fell. Even now, the struggle is not over. For a start, the PBGC is trying to ensure that proceeds from any sales of TWA subsidiaries are applied to the pension deficit, and are not distributed more generally. This was an immediate concern, and round one has gone to the PBGC. Last week, the airline and the pension agency agreed that the Dollars 50m proceeds from the sale of the Travel Channel subsidiary should be applied to the pension problem, and not used to fund operations. Longer-term, the agency says its aim is to protect the underfunded pension plans against any move by Mr Icahn to sell out altogether. Meanwhile, at Continental Airlines - in bankruptcy since late-1990 - the tussle is remarkably similar. Continental was the sister company of the now-defunct Eastern Airlines, both being part of Mr Frank Lorenzo's airline group. The PBGC is trying to recover Dollars 752m on behalf of the Eastern plans from Continental, and opposing the proposed Dollars 290m sale of Air Micronesia (in which Continental holds a controlling stake) - again on grounds that these proceeds should go to the Eastern pension plans. Continental's recently-filed reorganisation scheme, however, treats the PBGC's claim in line with other unsecured creditors. The carrier has said that if the PBGC is given priority status, there will be little left for other unsecured creditors - although it has stressed the desirability of avoiding 'prolonged litigation'. In principle, it would seem thoroughly fitting that the PBGC, in the interests of pension protection, should play tough. But not everyone thinks so. Some LTV creditors have complained loudly at being squeezed so far down the repayment queue. Critics have also argued that there may be a general reluctance to trade with, or supply credit to, financially-stretched companies with heavily underfunded pension plans. Should bankruptcy ensue, runs the argument, these parties know their claims could play second fiddle to making the pension plans whole. An even more basic complaint is that companies' attempts to reorganise are being thrown off track. Whatever the flaws in Mr Lorenzo's past stewardship, for example, is it entirely fair that Continental's efforts to become a viable company should be hampered by its past association with Eastern? Or that legal wrangles in the LTV case should have delayed reorganisation for so long? In reply, the PBGC maintains that it is merely seeking to 'get its rightful due' under US law - and that this, after all, is its job. It is hard to quarrel with such a stance, but the fundamental question goes unanswered: are the bankruptcy laws themselves satisfactory?  --------------------------------------------------------------        LARGEST UNDERFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES (Dollars)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Company                  Guaranteed     Assets      Unfunded                          benefits                  guaranteed                          liability                  liability LTV                       3.39 bn       204 m        3.18 bn American Nat Can           816 m        387 m         429 m Uniroyal-Goodrich          826 m        392 m         434 m Chrysler                  8.41 bn       5.1 bn       3.33 bn Bethlehem Steel           4.56 bn      3.25 bn        1.3 bn Navistar Int'l            2.48 bn      1.95 bn        536 m General Motors              42 bn     34.89 bn       7.15 bn Westinghouse Elec         4.33 bn      3.64 bn        692 m  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source PBGC  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: US retailer disappoints in spite of record year Sears, Roebuck, the US's third-largest retailer and the majority owner in Allstate Insurance, has reported record earnings for 1993. However, it disappointed Wall Street with flat fourth-quarter results. The shares fell steadily throughout the day to close Dollars 3 1/4 lower at Dollars 47 3/4 . After record losses in 1992, Sears underwent heavy restructuring last year, selling its brokerage business, Dean Witter Reynolds, its Coldwell Banker real estate unit, and a portion of its Allstate holding. Sears posted fourth-quarter income from continuing operations, excluding special items, of Dollars 544.6m, or Dollars 1.39 a share, compared with Dollars 482m, or Dollars 1.29, in the fourth quarter of 1992. Revenues dipped to Dollars 14.7bn, from Dollars 15bn a year ago. However, Sears said revenues from continuing operations were up 8 per cent over last year. For the year, Sears had income from continuing operations before special items of Dollars 1.70bn, or Dollars 4.36 a share, compared with Dollars 1.03bn, or Dollars 2.78, in 1992. Revenues fell to Dollars 50.8bn, from Dollars 52.3bn last year. However, Sears said revenues from continuing operations were up 6.5 per cent. Considering a Dollars 635.1m gain on the sale of Allstate, Dollars 76m in tax benefits during 1993, losses from insurance claims linked to Hurricane Andrew, and restructuring charges in 1992, net income was Dollars 2.37bn in 1993, compared with losses of Dollars 3.93bn in 1992. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said restructuring saved the company Dollars 200m in corporate expenses in 1993, mainly due to lower interest expenses. 'While we are very pleased with the success of the dramatic actions in 1993, we are most excited about the operating performance of our merchandising and insurance businesses, the foundation of the new Sears,' he said. 'We established significant momentum in 1993 and are focusing our efforts to continue it in 1994.'</p>

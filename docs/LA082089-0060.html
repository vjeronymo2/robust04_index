			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: S&amp;L REGULATORY SYSTEM STILL  FLAWED  </P> <P> Congress has finally completed legislation to stop the losses in the thrift  industry. The taxpayers will pick up a bill for $150 billion, give or take $20  billion or so. The failing thrifts are being taken over by the government. The  worst will be liquidated; most of the others will be sold for their salvage  value.  </P> <P> Another crisis surmounted by wise public policy? Hardly. Some useful steps have  been taken, but we have not seen the end of thrift industry problems. And not  enough has been done to change the incentives that were the cause of past  failures.  </P> <P> Thrift industry failures and losses did not occur suddenly in 1989. For 20  years, books and papers have warned about the industry's weaknesses. Most of  this material was not hidden in obscure academic journals. It was known to  congressmen, Treasury officials, Federal Reserve governors, presidential  counselors and to the officials responsible for supervising and regulating the  thrift industry.  </P> <P> The basic problem is neither obscure nor arcane. Deposit insurance gives owners  of thrift institutions (and banks) an opportunity to take a one-way gamble.  Heads they win; tails the taxpayers lose. The gamble only takes that form when  the savings and loan or bank is insolvent or has very little net worth. That's  why the problem didn't become serious until years after academic researchers  first spotted it.  </P> <P> Here's why the failures grew. Inflation eroded the net worth of the thrift  industry by lowering the value of the mortgages that they held. Everyone who  took a fixed-rate mortgage in the 1960s or 1970s knows that he gained. The  losers were the lenders -- the savings and loans that owned the mortgages. The  end of high inflation in the early '80s and the collapse of the oil boom  lowered the value of the mortgaged property and led to defaults. The  accumulated losses wiped out the net worth of many thrifts. They were bankrupt.  They remained in business, however, because deposit insurance protected them  from bank runs. The customers had no reason to worry about the safety of their  deposits. They were guaranteed by the government or, more accurately, by the  taxpayers.  </P> <P> Bankruptcy changed the incentives for the managers and operators. Risky  investments became more attractive -- so attractive that they flocked to them  with open pocketbooks. Alas, many of these investments didn't pay off. That's  the way it is with risky gambles. Did the operators shut down? Not at all. Many  paid above-market interest rates to attract large deposits and invested in  other risky ventures. The depositors had little to fear. They were insured, so  losses rose and the problem grew.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plenty of Blame to Go Around  </P> <P> The losses became so large that they wiped out the reserves set aside by the  government's insurance fund. The government's insurer, the Federal Savings and  Loan Insurance Corp., known as FSLIC, was itself bankrupt. By the 1980s, many  thrifts, with government approval, were using accounting gimmicks to hide the  losses.  </P> <P> The regulators mostly dithered. The Reagan Administration made a few  unimpressive attempts to shut down the worst offenders. Congress looked the  other way or, in some cases, pushed the regulators toward greater laxity. There  is so much blame to go around that nothing much is said.  </P> <P> This is a scandal, a government regulatory failure. The costs to the taxpayer  are far larger than the headline-grabbing mismanagement of defense contracting  or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The public picks up a bill  for $600 or more per person, or $1,500 per taxpayer. And no one seems  interested enough to take a thorough look at what can be done to prevent  additional scandals and more losses to the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Deposit insurance has not been reformed. A few modest changes have been made,  but a bankrupt thrift (or bank) still has an incentive to take large risks.  And, once memories of the scandal fade, some will do so.  </P> <P> Deposit insurance makes sense for small depositors, or small amounts, as  originally intended, but not for large. The system started with a maximum of  $2,500 per account in 1934. Adjusting for inflation, today's equivalent would  be about $25,000. This is sufficient to protect small depositors. In 1980,  Congress expanded deposit insurance, however, to cover deposits of up to  $100,000. In practice, even accounts above $100,000 are often protected in case  of failures.  </P> <P> This system removes any incentive that large depositors have to keep track of  the safety and soundness of their bank or thrift. They know that if the bank or  thrift fails, their deposits are secure. Large firms are accustomed to  monitoring the position of people who owe them money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Ceiling Needed  </P> <P> A ceiling on deposit insurance at $25,000 would give large depositors an  incentive to shift deposits to strong banks. Knowing that large withdrawals can  occur would spur the manager of the bank or thrift to avoid those one-way  gambles. Market discipline creates incentives for responsible management even  where net worth is low.  </P> <P> An alternative, favored by many observers, would have deposit insurance  protection decline with the size of the deposit. Deposits could be fully  insured up to $25,000, then 80% insured from $25,000 to $50,000, with lesser  percentages on larger amounts. Or, Congress could increase incentives for  management by raising insurance fees at risky banks. Most important of all,  regulators should require banks to price assets at market value to the fullest  extent possible instead of hiding losses from sight.  </P> <P> Congress and the Bush Administration have ignored these and many other  proposals. Some increase in capital requirements and higher average fees for  deposit insurance at all thrifts, whether safe or risky, and modest changes to  encourage self-regulation are about all that the taxpayers got for their money.  It's not enough.  </P> <P> In fact, the government bailout creates a new risk. When the bankrupt thrifts  are taken over by the government, the land and buildings that have been  foreclosed become public property. Someone has to decide when to sell, to whom  and at what price. The opportunities for political favors are large. A  government decision to sell creates problems for any local developer of  competing properties, so he will have an interest in encouraging a delay in the  selling of the foreclosed properties when he has his own properties up for  sale.  </P> <P> Problems of this kind are not new, but the magnitude of the problem is  unprecedented. In parts of California, Arizona and Texas especially, government  has a lot of property to sell.  </P> <P> How can the public recover the remaining value of these assets and reduce  opportunities for more raids on the taxpayers' pocketbooks? I believe that the  best solution is for the government to sell the foreclosed properties at public  auction within a fixed period, say six months or a year from the time that they  are acquired. Unless there is a fixed time schedule for sales, pressures for  delay will be powerful. Unless properties are sold at public auction,  opportunities for favoritism will be difficult to overcome.  </P></p>

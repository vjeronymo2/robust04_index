			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of any other person is an affiliated person of that person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 17(a), in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered company, or any company controlled by such registered company, any security or other property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 17(b) provides that the Commission may exempt a transaction from the provisions of section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases or sales of substantially all of the assets of registered investment companies that are affiliated persons solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers, provided that certain conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. As noted above, the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds have a common investment adviser. Thus, the Reorganizations would be exempt from the provisions of section 17(a) by virtue of rule 17a&hyph;8, but for the fact that the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds may be affiliated for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. First Trust, which is under common ownership and control with the Adviser, and its affiliates hold of record in their own name and in the name of their nominees more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of each of the Acquiring Funds and one of the Acquired Funds and hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. Because of this 5% ownership, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of First Trust under section 2(a)(3)(B). First Trust, in turn, is an affiliated person of the Adviser under section 2(a)(3)(C) by virtue of their common ownership and control by FBS. The Adviser, in turn, is an affiliated person of each Acquired Fund under Section 2(a)(3)(E) by virtue of its investment advisory relationship with these funds. Therefore, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of an affiliated person of each Acquired Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such registered company is a joint, or joint and several, participant with such person in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered company on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participant. Rule 17d&hyph;1 under the Act provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the Commission grants exemptive relief after considering whether the participation of the investment company is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The proposed sale of assets by each Acquired Fund to its respective Acquiring Fund and the related transactions involved in the Reorganizations might be deemed to be a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which a registered investment company and affiliated person of such company are participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants submit that the Reorganizations meet the standards for relief under section 17(b) and rule 17d&hyph;1, in that the terms of the Reorganizations, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the Reorganizations are consistent with the policy of each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund; the Reorganizations are consistent with the general purposes of the Act; the participation of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds in the Reorganizations on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act; and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants does not outweigh the advantages of such participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

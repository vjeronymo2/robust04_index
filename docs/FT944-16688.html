			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Chrysler cruises ahead Of the big three US car manufacturers, Chrysler was the one deemed most likely to collapse during the last recession. But the company was so successful in responding to the crisis that it quickly evolved into investors' favoured stock in the sector. Its shares have outperformed the market by a factor of three in so many years, and the automotive sector by 100 per cent. The out-performance of Chrysler's shares, along with that of Ford and General Motors, came to a halt early this year; since then the shares have fallen back sharply amid worries about rising interest rates and the scale of recovery in the US car market. Yesterday's record third quarter results from Chrysler reflect the impact of good luck and good management - good luck because Chrysler is traditionally strong in the buoyant sports utility segment of the market, good management because of the group's success in introducing new models such as the Neon and the Grand Cherokee at the right point in the cycle. The figures also raise the question as to whether the correction in US auto share prices has been premature. True, history suggests that automotive stocks should be sold well before the cyclical peak. But that peak now looks more distant than was thought earlier. Analysts now predict the turn in US car sales will not come until well into 1996. A small further increase in interest rates will hit investor sentiment, but is not likely lead to a material downturn in sales. Thus US car manufacturers look undervalued on a multiple of six times consensus earnings for next year, a discount of more than 50 per cent to the market as a whole.</p>

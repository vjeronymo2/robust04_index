			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Support of Reforms"] </F>   [Text] If Russia pursues a policy which forces us to  return to the Cold War period, irreparable harm will be done to  U.S. national security. This thought was expressed by Anthony  Lake, assistant to the president for national security. In an  interview on CNN's International Hour he pointed out that the  administration keeps a close watch on the development of the  political and economic situation in Russia and expresses its  concern to a certain extent. "The transition to democracy and  the market in Russia is a long and painful process," the  high-ranking administration representative said. "Of course, we  will celebrate the Russians' victories along with them and  commiserate with their defeats. However, the most important  thing is that the country's main development should not  jeopardize U.S. interests."    "It should not be forgotten," Lake went on, "that Russia is  now at the stage of developing the plan for the further  development of the economy. Government Chairman Chernomyrdin  has assured everyone that he remains committed to the process of  reforms. We can only adopt a wait-and-see stance and follow  their further progress. Let us also remember that despite a  certain departure from the original course, the past year can be  described as successful in Russia. Approximately three-fourths  of small enterprises and one-fourth of medium and large  enterprises in Russia have now been privatized. More than 90  percent of goods are currently sold via the free market. We can  see progress, and our task is to support it by every available  means."    Lake voiced U.S. concern at the possibility of growing  tension in Russian-Ukrainian relations following Yuriy Meshkov's  victory in the presidential elections in the Crimea. "At the  same time we are completely satisfied with the reaction to this  event of the Ukrainian and Russian governments, which have  adopted a well-considered stance in this situation," the White  House representative observed. "We are also satisfied with the  policy pursued by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk since his  meeting with Bill Clinton."    Commenting on the statement by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, that air strikes by  NATO forces on Serbian positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina would  be regarded as a declaration of war on Russia, Lake observed:  "I think we should be glad that Zhirinovskiy does not speak for  the Russian Government and has not been involved in shaping  Russia's foreign policy. If that happened, we would now be  arguing with Russia over the ownership of Alaska."</p>

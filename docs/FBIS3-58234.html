As for President Mitterrand, he called on the Atlantic  alliance to give concrete expression to pledges to Bosnia  through actions, in particular UN resolutions on the protection  of UN soldiers.    Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said that, if a  solution is to be found, it can only be a political one. He  spoke to our correspondent in Brussels, Quentin Dickinson:    [Begin recording] [Dehaene] It is clear that a solution in  Yugoslavia will either be a political one, or there will be no  solution at all. There is no such thing as a purely military  solution because if a durable solution is to be found, there  must be an agreement between the various parties.    However, when no rule is being respected, when no agreement  is being respected, I believe that it is necessary to step up  pressure, probably by increasing sanctions and by using relevant  means in order to have the UN resolutions enforced on the  ground, possibly by demanding an air force, as was planned at  some stage. In any case, if we demand the enforcement of the  resolutions, it is also necessary to draw conclusions.    [Dickinson] Air strikes?    [Dehaene] I think it is a means we should be able to use. If  we say that we want all UN resolutions to be enforced, it is one  of the consequences. Or else it is better not to say that.  [end recording]</p>

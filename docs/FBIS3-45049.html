Private enterprise needs to be developed faster, especially  in the service sector, said Liu Minxue, head of the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the country's  top business watchdog.    Liu told a national conference in Beijing yesterday that  governments at all levels should encourage cooperation between  the private businesses and other economic sectors to create a  mixed economy.    The State had a policy of encouraging private enterprise in  all kinds of areas -- except key national economic sectors and  industries like defence, Liu said.    A strong private sector is one of the preconditions of fair  market competition, he said, adding that local governments  should consider it part of the country's economic structure and  work hard to develop it as a principal component of an  integrated socialist market.    Encouraging the private sector is part of the State's plan  to  develop a sound market system based on the new laws against  unfair competition and on consumers' rights.    SAIC reports say the private sector is becoming more and  more  important to local economies in both the better-developed  coastal regions and some poor inland areas.    Twenty-eight provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities  have issued local measures and policies to promote private  business.    As a result, the country had 16 million private businessmen  and women by the end of September, 11.7 percent more than 12  months before. There were 210,000 private enterprises, 73  percent more than the previous year, Liu said.    Last year's tax payment from private businesses and  enterprises was expected to be 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion),  according to the State Tax Administration.    Meanwhile, Liu said at the conference that China will do  more  to ensure fair competition among enterprises.    The measures are expected to come out soon following the  introduction nationwide of a new business registration system, a  move considered very important to the growth of the market  economy.    The new registration system aims to give enterprises the  chance to make their own decisions and make them responsible for  profits and losses, said Liu.    He said the reform means less direct government control,  except in key State enterprises.    Most enterprises will now sign on directly at registration  departments instead of first getting approval from government  departments as before, he said.    Liu also pledged to enlarge the scope of registration to  include businesses run by universities and research centres.    By the end of last September, the number of registered  businesses in China was 7.113 million, 22 percent more than nine  months before, Liu said.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: McLaughlin &amp; Harvey Pounds 6.8m in loss LOSSES AT McLaughlin &amp; Harvey, the County Antrim-based construction group, widened from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6.8m pre-tax for the year to end-December. Turnover fell Pounds 35m to Pounds 63.2m. The deficit took account of a reduction in both interest charges to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.71m) and exceptional provisions to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 4.13m). The group's principal objective for 1992 was to cut borrowings. At year end these amounted to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 11.2m). The reduction was partly achieved at the expense of profitability, particularly in the housing division where prices were reduced to secure sales and reduce exposure in this sector. Additionally, the sale of the Mallusk Park investment property made a significant contribution.</p>

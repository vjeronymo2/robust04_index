			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: US economy Another disappointing set of US jobs figures did nothing for confidence on Wall Street or the dollar. While the headline growth in employment during September looks healthy enough, the unwillingness of manufacturing companies to hire permanent staff looks like the Achilles heel of the US economy. President Clinton's proposed reform of the healthcare system could make matters worse by increasing employment costs. The healthcare industry - itself an engine of private sector job creation - faces a period of great uncertainty. While consumer spending is growing, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be diverted from its cautious attitude towards interest rates. The worry must be that a weak jobs market will eventually catch up with consumers. There is no sign of that yet, but the savings ratio remains low by historic standards and federal tax increases will start to bite early next year. The fourth quarter may hold out more promise if companies start to rebuild stocks which have been run down over the summer. There is also the promise of increased construction activity as Midwest states clear up after the floods. But unless that burst of activity provides the spark of confidence which is currently lacking, it is hard to see the improvement being sustained.</p>

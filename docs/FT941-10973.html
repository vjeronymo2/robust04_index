			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Welcome return of the busy factory  -General Motors/Ford General Motors and Ford, the two largest US vehicle manufacturers, are expected to announce sharply improved fourth-quarter earnings this week. US car and light truck sales rose 8.4 per cent in the final three months of 1993 compared with the same period of 1992, and the higher volume has allowed carmakers to run their plants closer to capacity and reduce the costly rebates used to sell vehicles during the downturn of the past few years. The most interesting part of GM's results will be how much the company has managed to turn around its bloated North American operations, which lost Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.30bn) between 1990 and 1992. The mean Wall Street forecast is for GM to earn around Dollars 1.02 a share, according to IBES, the securities information service. The company has set itself a target of at least breaking even in North America in 1993 before interest, tax and other special charges. Ford has made big gains in market share in North America over the past year, helped by strong-selling vehicles, such as the Explorer, and the recently relaunched, sporty Mustang. Its European operations, which have suffered severely from recession in Britain, are also on the mend, and the company recently forecast a return to profits in Europe in 1994. Wall Street's mean expectation is earnings of Dollars 1.13 a share.</p>

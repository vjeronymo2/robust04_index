			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Labour renews jobs campaign A RENEWED campaign to put jobs at the top of the political agenda will be launched early in the new year, Labour pledged yesterday. Mr John Smith, the party leader, said: 'In 1993 Labour will campaign with vigour and determination for an end to rising unemployment and for a programme of national recovery based on the vital importance of investment and training.' At the heart of the campaign will be a demand for an emergency employment programme to be introduced before the budget in March. The need for skilled jobs to help rebuild the economy will also be emphasised. The party's call for action to create jobs in the construction industry and to improve and expand training programmes will come against a background of continuing rises in the jobless numbers. The TUC expects unemployment to rise by about 50,000 a month over the next three months, reaching 3m in January or February. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, gave a taste of the type of Westminster campaigning that ministers can expect. He published a list of the increases in unemployment over the past two years in cabinet ministers' constituencies. The total in the 20 seats has more than doubled, rising from 34,000 in November 1990 to 71,000 in November 1992. Labour's initiative also contains a significant element of grassroots campaigning. Material issued to local party branches this month says the key task is to link the government's difficulties over pit closures with the wider issues of recession and unemployment.</p>

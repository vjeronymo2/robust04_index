			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- The Consulate General  of India has dismissed reports that it had contigency plans to  airlift Indian nationals from South Africa should political  instability persist. In a statement on Tuesday [11 April] the  consulate general said there were set procedures which it would  follow should any evacuation become necessary.    The consulate urged India passports holders to register with  the consulate in Johannesburg to update records.    "In the case of South African citizens, they are entirely  the  responsibility of the South African Government."    The Indian Government would view with concern any  development  affecting the SA Indian community adversely because of  historical and cultural links between people of India and the  South African Indian community, the statement added.    "India has consistently and strongly supported the just  struggle against apartheid in South Africa and looks forward to  the coming elections as a positive development in the transition  to a fully democratic system."</p>

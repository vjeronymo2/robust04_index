			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah  arrived in Cairo from Israel today on a four-day visit.    Upon his arrival, al-Natshah said the aim of his visit was  to  meet President Yasir 'Arafat to brief him on the situation in  Hebron and to listen to his instructions for easing the  suffering of the Hebron inhabitants, who were under curfew for  30 days after which the city center was closed on the pretext of  protecting Jewish families.    Al-Natshah explained that this closure inconvenienced  120,000  Palestinians. He said he would ask 'Arafat to explain this  tragedy to President Mubarak so that he could try to help in  this direction.</p>

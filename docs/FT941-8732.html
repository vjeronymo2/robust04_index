			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Counties study finds confusion Market research by the Local Government Commission for England in the next 12 counties for which it must make proposals for council reorganisation has found a confused picture. It reveals a strong preference for devolved government to small local areas  -beyond the scope of the current review - but little enthusiasm for either the current districts or county councils. Overall, most people identify most strongly with their immediate local community. Only about half feel strong local identity with their district councils - about the same proportion who identify strongly with their counties. A majority of residents in virtually all the counties surveyed favoured the general principle of unitary authorities - that all services should be provided by one council rather than being split between counties and districts - although nowhere was there an overwhelming majority. People who claimed to be aware of the planned reorganisation tended to be less supportive of unitary authorities. Several local authorities have conducted their own polls, asking residents more precise questions in an attempt to find backing for local proposals. One by Devon district councils found that 92.8 per cent wanted change in some form. The most popular option, supported by 51 per cent of those who replied to the districts' questionnaire, was for Plymouth to become a separate unitary authority, with a two-tier structure remaining for the rest of the county.</p>

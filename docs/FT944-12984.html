			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris puts on 2.5% ahead of long weekend Traders called it the 'mauling of the dollar bears'. US economic data came in with less of an inflationary feel than expected and currencies, bunds and equity futures responded, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS regained the 1,900 level for the first time since October 18, the CAC-40 index climbing 47.58 to 1,905.69 for a 2.5 per cent gain both on the day and on the week. Turnover, boosted by the expiry of October futures, was FFr6.1bn. French markets will be closed on Monday and Tuesday for public holidays. Eurotunnel, up 20 centimes at FFr19.20, shrugged off news that the COB, the market watchdog, had launched an official inquiry into whether the channel tunnel operator had presented its financial position fairly in its rights issue prospectus published in May. The other Euro stock, EuroDisney, added 35 centimes to FFr7.10 ahead of full-year figures due next Thursday. Analysts did not expect surprises in the figures, since the bad news was already in the price, and forecast losses of between FFr1.6bn to FFr1.8bn. Sanofi put on FFr11.90 to FFr259.90 before reporting an 8.8 per cent gain in nine-month sales. FRANKFURT did not emphasise short covering, or the percentage point rise in the Dow at the US midday. However, a 27.12 rise to 2,040.32 in the Dax on the official session, which left it up 0.9 per cent on the week at this point, was left far behind in the post bourse where the Ibis-indicated Dax put on 38.49, or 1.9 per cent at 2,064.86. The day, and the week was marked by relative strength in chemicals. BASF, Bayer and Hoechst rose DM8.40 to DM318, DM8.50 to DM350 and DM4.60 to DM325.60 by the end of the afternoon; Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett said that the sector had been excited by Thursday's progress report from ICI, and anticipation of third quarters from DSM, Akzo Nobel and Rhone Poulenc next week before Germany's 'Big Three' report later in November. Turnover rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.4bn. BMW was the carmaker of the day as it produced nine-month turnover figures and the shares rose DM17 to DM771 after hours. Deutsche Bank moved from underperformance during the session to outperformance in the afternoon, where it closed DM17.50 higher at DM739. ZURICH's rise of 31.9, or 1.3 per cent in the SMI index to 2,490.5 left it 4.5 per cent down on an introspective week. UBS closed well off its worst for the day, but the bearers still dropped another SFr12 to SFr1,200 and the registered SFr2 more to SFr273, reflecting the board's battle over voting powers with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision. Among insurers, however, Winterthur climbed SFr19 to SFr634 ahead of a progress report next Thursday. AMSTERDAM made a resolute end to the week, the AEX index closing up 5.18 at 409.05 for a week's improvement of 2.3 per cent. There were good rises in a number of stocks reporting third quarter figures next week, among them Philips which rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 54.10 in heavy volume, and DSM, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 147.80. Royal Dutch saw one of the best performances, lifted by the dollar and a good overnight set of results from its US subsidiary, Shell Oil, closing with a gain of Fl 5.60 to Fl 195.20. Nutricia, the manufacturer of baby food, was lifted Fl 1.80 to Fl 89.80 on reports that Unigate of the UK might be about to sell its 32 per cent stake. Unigate denied the reports. MILAN remained focused on the banking sector following Thursday's news of a L2,000bn bid by Credito Italiano for Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo, which, said some brokers, could herald a shake-up in the sector. The Comit index ended up 11.48 at 624.21 for a 1 per cent rise on the week. There were suggestions that the next bid target could be one made by Banca Commerciale Italiana, up L72 at L3,462, for Ambroveneto, up a further L442 to L4,774 on top of a 11 per cent gain on Thursday. Romagnolo, which said that the takeover bid was 'not friendly' put on L798 to L16,878, while Italiano added L16 to L1,605. MADRID moved from depression to ebullience, the general index rising 4.32, or 1.5 per cent to 295.33 on the day, but only 0.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was up from Pta19bn to Pta25.1bn, a lot of that in banks which were relatively muted in share price terms. Gains of Pta55 to Pta3,255 in BBV and Pta60 to Pta4,835 in Argentaria compared with rises of 2 to 3 per cent in the big ADR stocks, Endesa, Repsol and Telefonica, 3 per cent or more in constructions and Pta770, or 5.8 per cent in Acerinox, the stainless steel group, which reported a 72 per cent gain in nine-month pre-tax profits on Thursday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 28                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1310.55   1310.50   1310.18   1312.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1370.12   1369.43   1369.43   1370.44  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1313.77   1316.12   1324.85   1326.61 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1373.30   1375.49   1384.22   1386.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Oct 27    Oct 26    Oct 25    Oct 24    Oct 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1303.28   1300.71   1296.00   1312.32   1304.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1361.02   1358.10   1356.47   1372.56   1361.84  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 -  1327.36 ; 200 -  1387.15 Low/day: 100 -  1309.71  200 -  1368.53  ?

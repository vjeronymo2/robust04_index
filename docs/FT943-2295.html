			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sovereignty at issue, not fisheries conservation Sir, Your article 'Falklands rivalry tests quick tempers' (August 30) accurately states that the south west Atlantic is one of the few regions in the world rich in fishing resources. However, its author does not present a complete picture of the issues involved in the area. Allow me to address those of greater relevance. Argentina rejected the UK's extension of its alleged jurisdiction over undisputed waters north of the Malvinas Islands on grounds of their appurtenance to land territories subject to controversy, and because it had always exerted exclusive rights of sovereignty over those waters. The issue at stake has nothing to do with fisheries conservation but with sovereignty. The Argentine government has developed an effective conservation and fisheries administration policy. The Argentine Navy has substantially increased its patrols in the Argentine economic exclusion zone, and provisions are being made to increase them further. At the same time, the National Institute of Fisheries Research enjoys greater financial and technological resources and produces state-of-the-art research in the subject. In the case of Illex squid, it is worth recalling that between 1987 and 1992 Argentina captured less than a third of the totals fished in waters close to the Malvinas Islands. The reference to the Argentine-EU agreement seems to be misleading since it only came into force on May 24 1994, and it has not yet been implemented. Surely, the article in question would have benefited from further research on Argentine fisheries policy and from consultation with Argentine official sources.

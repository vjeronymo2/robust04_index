			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Hurd heads EC mission to S Africa THE TROIKA of EC foreign ministers will arrive in Johannesburg today on a two-day visit in which they hope to finalise a proposal to dispatch up to 20 European observers to monitor township violence in South Africa. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, left London yesterday to head the mission, which the ministers hope might also catalyse progress towards a resumption South Africa's stalled constitutional talks. With Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, Mr Fernando Diez Barroso, the Portuguese deputy foreign minister and Mr Hans Andriessen, the EC Commissioner for external affairs, he will meet leaders from all parties to the talks and members of the National Peace Secretariat, with which the EC observers would work. The observers, to be drawn from experts in community policing across the EC, will join those already pledged by the Commonwealth under a United Nations sponsored plan to assist South Africa's year-old National Security Accord monitor and end violence in the townships. Between 30 and 50 observers are expected to take part in the proposed monitoring. The EC ministers also expect to discuss ways in which they could offer material support, perhaps including training, for the South African police. Their visit will include a trip tomorrow to the Alexandra township for talks with a local dispute resolution committee formed as part of the peace accord. The EC team saw signs that parties to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa are inching towards a possible resumption of talks. Former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said yesterday he had accepted an invitation to mediate between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party, Reuter reports from Lusaka. The invitation had come from the peace secretariat.</p>

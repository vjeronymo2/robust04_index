			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies European central bankers may be feeling secretly grateful for the revival of tensions in the Middle East. That is one of the main reasons for the dollar's two-pfennig rise since the Christmas break. In theory yesterday's positive US data on consumer confidence and home sales should support the trend. They suggest the US economy is indeed on a recovery path - in stark contrast to that of Germany. Were the dollar to remain strong, a fresh crisis in the ERM might just be deferred until the Bundesbank is ready to start cutting interest rates. It would be rash, though, to claim victory too soon. The dollar's rise has come in a thin market. It may not have the strength for a further advance once trading volumes return to normal in the new year. Besides, the real doubt about the ERM concerns the degree to which participants are prepared to allow Germany to lead them into recession. The foreign exchange market may have placed too much weight on the seemingly encouraging weekend remarks on interest rates from the Bundesbank's Mr Helmut Schlesinger. The bank is unlikely to move before it can gauge the inflationary effect of next month's VAT rise, not to mention the outcome of current wage negotiations and the new year trend of the money supply. It may be February before it can even consider lower interest rates. That realisation alone could reverse the dollar's gain and put fresh strain on the ERM. The longer the Bundesbank delays, the more pressing the need for lower rates elsewhere and the deeper it would eventually have to cut to calm the system down. The clear misalignment of the Irish punt still provides a weak link for speculators to have a go at the system as a whole.</p>

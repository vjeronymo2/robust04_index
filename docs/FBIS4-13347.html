Mubarak  is scheduled to visit China following his visit here. Yesterday  the Egyptian president and the Omani monarch reviewed the  situation on the Arab and international scenes.    According to well-informed sources, Mubarak and Qabus  discussed the Yemeni crisis and the Omani monarch's efforts to  contain it. Sultan Qabus arranged a meeting between Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid in Salalah on 3 April. During that meeting, the two  Yemeni officials are said to have reconciled their personal  differences.    The same sources say that Mubarak will brief Sultan Qabus on  the efforts Egypt and the United Arab Emirates made recently to  contain the differences between the Yemeni sides and ensure the  implementation of the Pledge and Accord document signed in Amman  in February.    President Mubarak wants to start his mediation from the  point  the Omanis end theirs. Egypt and Oman are eager to preserve  Yemen's unity and stability, according to the same sources.</p>

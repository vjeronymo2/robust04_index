			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Duty free EU finance ministers last week raised duty free allowances for travellers coming to and travelling within the EU. Under rates which come into force on April 1, travellers arriving from non-EU countries will be allowed to bring in duty-free goods worth 175 European currency units (Dollars 195), almost four times the current limit of 45 Ecus. For travellers between EU states the limit will doubled to 90 Ecus.</p>

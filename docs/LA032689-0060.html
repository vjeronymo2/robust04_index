			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTRA PACKAGE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has reached agreement with Congress on what it  advertises as bipartisan policy towards Nicaragua. Unfortunately, the "new"  approach includes a very troublesome part of the old policy -- continued aid to  the Contras.  </P> <P> Under the agreement hammered out largely between Secretary of State James A.  Baker III and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), the new Administration has  agreed to give up the Reagan Administration's naive notion that the Sandinistas  can be overthrown. Instead, the new policy revolves around the idea of  confining the Nicaraguan revolution to that country and using diplomatic and  economic pressure to get the Sandinistas to be more democratic.  </P> <P> This level-headed approach to Nicaragua has long been the policy option favored  by career professionals in the State Department. But former President Reagan  preferred to follow the course set by right-wing activists in his  Administration who were determined to oust the Sandinistas even if they had to  break the law to do it. Baker had a difficult time winning support for  President Bush's new approach because too many congressmen vividly remember the  last eight years.  </P> <P> With the important exception of the Contras, it appears that things have  changed. Baker told dubious members of Congress, for example, that the  Administration will now support the peace process recently begun by the five  Central American presidents. That is in refreshing contrast to Reagan's stance  of trying to delay, or even sabotage, peacemaking efforts in the region. But  the Administration's request for 10 more months of "humanitarian" aid to the  Contras will not help the peace process launched by Costa Rican President Oscar  Arias.  </P> <P> A key agreement in the Arias peace plan requires that the 11,000-person Contra  army, now waiting in Honduras for more U.S. aid, be demobilized before  elections are held next February in Nicaragua. Bush and Baker want to continue  sending more than $4 million a month to the Nicaraguan rebels until February,  demobilizing them only after the elections. They argue that the Contras are  needed as a potential "stick" to keep Managua in line.  </P> <P> The trouble with this second-hand logic is that nobody outside of Washington  takes the Contras seriously anymore -- at least not as a fighting force.  </P> <P> The Hondurans worry about them only as a crime problem. The Sandinistas are  convinced that Reagan's surrogate army is defeated and are unlikely to be cowed  by threats the Contras will be unleashed again. Arias and other peacemakers  warn that continued funding of the Contras gives the Sandinistas an excuse to  resist pressure to open up the Nicaraguan political system.  </P> <P> That worrisome possibility seems more likely now, given the hostile reaction in  Managua to Bush's announcement Friday of his request for more Contra funding.  "Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a contradiction in terms," a  Sandinsita spokesman said. "Either you approve the dismantling of the Contras  or you don't."  </P> <P> The new Bush-Baker strategy towards Nicaragua is sensible in many ways. But it  would have a far better chance of success if the Administration gave up the one  remaining fantasy of Reagan's that still hampers Washington -- that the Contras  can be a "viable" force in dealing with the Sandinistas. That policy has failed  dismally and the Administration would be better off helping the Contras  withdraw from the battlefield.  </P></p>

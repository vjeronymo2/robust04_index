			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POOL COOL;  </P> <P> WITH NUDGE FROM NEWMAN AND CRUISE, POCKET BILLIARDS UNDERGOES REVIVAL; THERE IS  NO SHORTAGE OF PLACES TO LISTEN, LEARN, PRACTICE OR JUST HANG OUT  </P> <P> First came Paul Newman and "The Hustler." Later it was Tom Cruise and "The  Color of Money." That might be Hollywood, but you can't walk into a pool hall  in San Diego without the images of Cruise and Newman lingering over a corner  pocket.  </P> <P> Oh, you can try. You can sit in a pool hall, watching a waitress knife her way  through a smoky haze while listening to the strains of Percy Sledge above the  pops of pool ball on pool ball.  </P> <P> But then, Bob Johannis, the day manager at the College Billiards Center -- San  Diego's biggest and oldest pool hall -- brings up Cruise.  </P> <P> " 'The Color of Money' gave pool a shot in the arm," Johannis says, expelling a  puff of smoke. "It was flashy and showed a guy in different situations, going  around meeting different types of people. It helped sell the game again.  </P> <P> "But that doesn't mean guys dance around the table the way Cruise did, twirling  their cue sticks like a baton and whipping them around. Especially when a guy  has paid $500 or $1,000 for a cue stick."  </P> <P> Jay Swanson, known professionally as Swanee, sits across the room. He's ranked  12th in the country by the Men's Professional Billiards Assn. He returned from  Germany two weeks ago, and he's leaving tonight for a championship tournament  in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The color of money? First prize in the Las Vegas tournament is $15,000.  </P> <P> "Every pool room in the country has a waiting list at night since 'The Color of  Money' came out," Swanee says. "I didn't really like the story. The kid got  smart, but too smart. He started dumping games off and betting the other way  just for the money. That's why Newman said, 'I'm on my way back.' "  </P> <P> Maybe a dozen tables are in use on this hot, lazy afternoon at the College  Billiards Center. Voices are low, cigarette smoke is thick, and life is easy.  </P> <P> "Be right with you, Earl," Johannis calls out to a regular.  </P> <P> Any place which attracts a teacher from one high school and a couple of  students from another, maybe two hours after the final bell, can't be all bad.  Jerry Schimke, a 45-year-old literature and journalism teacher at Poway High  School, sits on one side of the room. Chris Asad and Eric Gainey, who will  graduate Saturday from Crawford High School, are at a table on the other side  of the room. All three had finished their school year earlier in the day.  </P> <P> On Father's Day, Schimke had taken his 20-year-old daughter, Amy, to the  Billiards Center for a few games. Later in the week, he plans to take her on a  trip through Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  </P> <P> "Basically, what you find here are lots of exceptional people who seem to be  easily bored," said Schimke, who just completed his 18th year teaching at  Poway. "People who like to see life on the fringe. You can meet some incredibly  interesting people.  </P> <P> "Everyone's a character. Everyone will tell you off. One of the apostles could  come in here and people would say, 'Hey pal, you can't come in this hall with  sandals.' Or if St. Paul were sitting on the table, someone would toss him out  for that. And there's too much smoke. Everyone smokes.  </P> <P> "There's some dirt going on, but there are also doctors, lawyers, teachers and  college professors. It's the only place I know where you can sit at the bar  with a beer and talk about the human condition. I had a two-hour talk yesterday  about existentialism. You won't get that in a bowling alley, at home . . . you  won't even get that at school."  </P> <P> The College Billiards Center has 17 pocket billiards tables, one cushion  billiards table, one snooker table and two coin-operated pool tables. You'll  find regulars and newcomers. "The Color of Money," says Johannis, seems to have  brought in a new crowd.  </P> <P> Now that they're 18, Gainey and Asad can play late. You have to be at least 16  to enter the College Billiards Center, and you can't stay past 10 p.m. unless  you're at least 18 and have valid identification. Gainey and Asad play here a  couple of times a week.  </P> <P> "This place doesn't close until 2," Asad said. "That's another cool thing."  </P> <P> Right now, the College Billiards Center, which opened in April, 1963, is the  biggest pool hall in town. The Billiard Tavern, on Broadway downtown -- which  had about 50 tables -- is changing management and will re-open sometime next  month.  </P> <P> If you're a beginner, there are a few regulars at the College Billiards Center  who offer lessons.  </P> <P> "A lot of times we'll help people out," Johannis said. "If somebody is doing  something bad, I'll tell them. You pay back what you've learned."  </P> <P> Schimke recommends lessons for beginners.  </P> <P> "This is the only sport, except maybe golf, where people enter tournaments  before they know the rules," he said. "People come in here and do the  metaphorical equivalent of driving a golf cart on the greens. You don't walk in  here, rent a table and then put a pitcher of beer on the table or sit on the  table."  </P> <P> If you're already a terror on the pocket billiards table in your basement,  there are plenty of tournaments around town. You can find one almost any night  of the year.  </P> <P> Billiards By-Line, in its fifth year, is published in San Diego, available for  free at most pool halls, and includes listings entitled "Upcoming Events" and  "Where to Go." Or you can join the U.S. Pool Players' Assn., be apprised of  various tournaments and get your own handicap. A USPPA tournament -- with  handicaps -- is held at the College Billiards Center every Monday.  </P> <P> "Most of these tournaments are for the average Joe in a bar to put in $5 for a  few laughs and good times," said Jerome Garnsey, 35, who helps editor Kathleen  Klein put out Billiards By-Line. "It's like anything else. If you want to  become a professional race car driver or pool player, you do it every day. San  Diego is starting to boom in terms of getting more publicity."  </P> <P> Garnsey doesn't compete much anymore.  </P> <P> "Once upon a time, I gave them a good run," he said. "But it's something you  have to play every day if you want to get serious about it."  </P> <P> Johannis said he has been playing pool for 41 of his 54 years.  </P> <P> "I started playing at the YMCA on 8th and C in San Diego," Johannis said. "That  was like playing in a cow pasture. There were big holes in the cloths, the  chalk had holes in it, the cue sticks were in need of constant repair."  </P> <P> There are several rules posted at the College Billiards Center to help avoid  these problems. No sitting on tables. No masse or jump shots (difficult shots  which, when attempted by beginners, usually produce ripped cloths and  stationary balls.) No loud or abusive language. No fighting.  </P> <P> "This isn't only for serious pool players, this is also for guys who want to  bring their wives and kids in here," Johannis said.  </P> <P> The first rule on the list, though, is "No Gambling." That's a state ordinance.  There are, to be sure, times when this rule is broken.  </P> <P> "If you behave yourself, you won't get hustled," Schimke says. "You won't get  hustled unless you ask for it. If you walk in drunk and lay $100 down on the  table, then it's plastic teeth time."  </P> <P> Still, the boozy, pool hall fight over a high-stakes game is strictly  Hollywood, say a handful of people this afternoon.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen a fight in a long time," Swanson said. "If there's any trouble,  we all get in on it and stop it."  </P> <P> Said Garnsey: "It's never out of hand. I've never been in a place in San Diego  where there was a fight over a game. Probably the most you ever run into is a  fight over whose quarter is up next. I've broken up many of those."  </P> <P> Asad and Gainey shoot pool for fun, not for money.  </P> <P> "Having to put up with the person who wins for the rest of the day is worse  than paying money," Asad said.  </P> <P> But pocket billiards is like any other sport. Sure, you can watch movies about  pool sharks. Yes, you can play for money. But the bottom line is, most of the  players play because they enjoy it.  </P> <P> Said Schimke: "Don't believe 'The Hustler' or 'The Color of Money.' That's not  the way it is. This is a game of psychology played with pool balls. You're  expected to figure out what to do, how to do it and you can't get nervous doing  it."  </P> <P> And then there are the professionals, such as Swanson. He went to Germany last  month to gamble and said he "did all right." He makes his living by playing  pool and said he makes about $40,000 in an average year by playing in as many  as 12 to 15 major tournaments.  </P> <P> His income could be supplemented in the near future if he accomplishes a  current goal, which is to open his own pool hall.  </P> <P> "San Diego needs more pool halls," he said. "There used to be 20 or 30 around.  Now there are only four or five."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "There was a phase when pool wasn't doing anything, and this is an outdoor  town," Swanson said. "A bar used to be four pool tables and a spittoon. Now,  you can get cocktails, watch Monday Night Football on a big screen television .  . . anything you want."  </P> <P> So that leaves a void Swanson would like to fill.  </P> <P> "So many people come in here every day," he said. "Since 'The Color of Money,'  pool has boomed."  </P> <P> It's getting back to where it was after "The Hustler" came out.  </P></p>

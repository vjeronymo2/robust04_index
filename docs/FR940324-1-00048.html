The USDA has adequate facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these three ports to the list of designated ports would facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted on or before May 23, 1994.

Section 9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538(f)) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations contained in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in &sect;24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section 24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES. (The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation of plants through those ports.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of its enforcement of the Act and CITES, the Service requires that a port have personnel with expertise in identifying endangered or threatened plants, and CITES listed plants, to ensure that such plants are properly identified by their accompanying documentation. A port must also possess adequate facilities for holding live plants and plant material, since plants are subject to seizure if imported, exported, or reexported in violation of the Act or CITES. The Service further requires that, whenever possible, ports be located to coincide with established patterns of plant trade in order to help reduce shipping costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

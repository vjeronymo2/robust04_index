			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 23 -- Industry Minister Marek Pol  suspended on Friday night [22 April] his decision concerning the  preparations for the restructuring of the brown coal mining  sector and appealed to striking miners to end the strike and  start negotiations immediately.    The minister's decision of March 23, 1994 concerned the  organization of work designed to set up holdings in the power  engineering sector. Under the decision, the minister appoints  commissioners for the organization of holdings, establishes task  teams and defines their competences. The decision provides for  the establishment of 3 holdings, namely, the Belchatow holding,  the Konin-Adamow power engineering and fuel holding, and the  regional Turow brown coal power engineering.    The striking miners decided to continue their protest until  the decision was annulled and not temporarily--as they describe  it--suspended.    Having in mind the existing threat to Poland's power  engineering security, Minister Pol sent a letter to chairmen of  the brown coal mining trade union organizations in which he  informed them that he had suspended the decision.    Pol told a press conference on Saturday that "if there were  no breakdowns in power plants, on Saturday and Sunday there  should not be any problems with supplies of energy for industry  and individual customers." The minister added that there might  be certain restrictions on Monday but the government would try  to minimize their effects.    The minister explained that the decision made on Friday to  dismiss Deputy Industry Minister Eugeniusz Morawski was caused  by the "improper implementation of the decision of March 23."  Pol did not explain what mistakes Morawski had made and added  the decision to dismiss him was taken by Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak.    On Saturday afternoon, the striking miners sent a letter to  Minister Pol in which they asked him to precisely define whether  his decision was still binding. In their opinion, the  suspension of the decision does not mean its annulment. The  miners decided to continue the strike action.    The government press office issued a communique on Saturday  which said that the suspension of the decision was not accepted  by the strike committee.    In connection with this, the government press office was  authorized to report that any further decisions by the industry  minister concerning the issue were not possible without talks  and exchange of views between the two sides. Minister Pol was  ready to hold talks concerning industrial questions, the  communique stressed, adding that other issues should be  discussed with the Labour Ministry and the tripartite  commission, the meeting of which would be held on April 29.</p>

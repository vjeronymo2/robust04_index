			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> REMODELED BREAKERS WILL REOPEN AS SENIOR HOUSING  </P> <P> The Breakers, formerly a well-known resort hotel in downtown Long Beach, is  reopening this weekend as an apartment house for senior citizens after being  closed two years for renovation.  </P> <P> Built in 1925, the oceanfront building served as one of the city's most popular  and elegant hotels and remains an important architectural landmark.  </P> <P> The financial failure of the hotel in 1988 raised the fears of historical  preservationists that the building, at 249 E. Ocean Blvd., would be demolished.  Instead, a company called Senior Living Communities, a Long Beach-based  subsidiary of Shamrock Holdings Co., undertook extensive interior and exterior  renovations to create what the developer now touts as a "highly specialized  environment designed to accommodate the lifestyles of today's active and  independent seniors."  </P> <P> Among other things, the building -- which the developer says has been restored  to its original historic condition -- features a large lobby with a grand  piano, an elegant dining room, library, mail and information center, beauty and  barber shop, private guest dining room, ballroom, and areas for meetings, games  and crafts.  </P></p>

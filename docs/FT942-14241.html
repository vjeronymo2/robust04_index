			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: APV's hot competition APV Baker, a subsidiary of food processing equipment group APV, shares a Queen's Award for Technology for the commercial development of ohmic heating. APV Baker secured a licence for the system from EA Technology in 1984 and spent millions of pounds turning it into a commercial product which was launched in the late 1980s. The technology has been showered with awards over the last few years yet in spite of its significant advantages over existing heating processes APV has sold only Pounds 6m worth of equipment so far. APV blames conservatism in the food industry. 'The western food giants are approaching it with caution though the Japanese have seized on it,' said a spokesman. Among the 13 installations ordered worldwide six have been sold in Japan. These include the Wildfruit Products Division of Nissei which supplies the Japanese market with processed fruit for use in bakery and dairy products. The only commercial scale installation in the UK is at Deeside-based Sous Chef, a company formed specifically to capitalise on the new technology which was recently acquired by Heinz. The other installations and the identity of the 'dozens' of food manufacturers that are evaluating the technology are confidential. Even the UK food manufacturer which worked with EA and APV on the technology remains anonymous. 'No-one wants their competitors to know what they are doing,' said APV.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: Trade minister cites exporting as weak link in corporate chain Sir, The latest six-monthly survey of the pay of executives immediately below board level published by your Jobs Column (March 31) includes a wide range of executive functions, but as usual excludes exporting. The work of the export executive demands a high level of commitment, training, experience and, of course, reward. The Jobs Column will no doubt say that it is merely reporting on the latest of a series of surveys by a consultancy, and is not responsible for the categories. Those who conducted the survey, if taxed in the same way, would probably reply that exporting is not treated as a separate function in the organisation of the majority of the companies they looked at. But isn't that where the Jobs Column should come in? Jobs are exactly what exporting is about. Jobs can be lost by firms which leave exporting to be done by marketing and sales staff as a kind of optional add-on to the home market. They are likely to find their home market eroded by foreign competitors who are more far-sighted than they are. On the other hand, jobs can be won by companies which take a strategic approach to exporting, as a way of securing a wide sales base and an increased market share at home and abroad. Richard Needham, minister for trade, Department of Trade and Industry, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6RB</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Prudential rises 16% despite fall from UK life Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, reported a 16 per cent rise to Pounds 280m in first-half pre-tax profits, but profits from the UK life business fell. The drop in profits from the UK long-term business, from Pounds 139m to 132m, reflected a decline in sales of insurance products and the cost to shareholders of financing new unit-linked business. It also took account of provision for potential reductions in bonuses on its with-profits policies which are not set until the year-end in March. Prudential and other insurers have cut bonus rates in line with lower investment returns in recent years. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, expected UK sales to be subdued in the second half, but said that in the longer term the need for savings and protection products should mean substantial demand. The interim dividend was raised 9 per cent to 4.9p (4.5p). Commenting on factors behind the uncertainty and caution among customers, Mr Newmarch highlighted two areas of regulatory activity. The first was the report from City regulators on compensating customers who have suffered from poor advice to transfer out of occupational pension schemes, which is due next month. The second means that from the start of next year life insurers have to volunteer more information to customers about policies and charges. Prudential's pension transfer sales are also being informally investigated by Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry. The inquiry began in April, and could last another couple of months. Prudential said it has acted properly on pension transfers and has always conducted its sales activities well within regulatory rules. Pre-tax profits from Jackson National Life, Prudential's US subsidiary, rose to Pounds 36m (Pounds 31m), while total profits were also helped by Pounds 17m from other international business, compared with a Pounds 6m loss last year. This profit included Pounds 5m for the sale of Prudential's Irish subsidiary to the Irish Permanent Building Society. Pre-tax profits from Prudential's general insurance businesses - UK domestic and motor insurance and Mercantile and General Reinsurance - were sharply increased to Pounds 53m (Pounds 18m). Shareholders' other income fell to Pounds 32m from Pounds 53m as a result of lower investment returns and a rise in corporate spending.</p>

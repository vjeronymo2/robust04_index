			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / DTI confirms du Cann asset probe AN INLAND Revenue bankruptcy petition against Sir Edward du Cann, the former Lonhro chairman, was automatically dismissed yesterday because a bankruptcy order had already been made. The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that a bankruptcy order was made against Sir Edward in the High Court on a petition by the solicitors Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warren on March 12 for unpaid fees. The case has been transferred to Taunton Crown Court near Sir Edward's residence in Somerset. The department yesterday said an official receiver had been appointed to look at the circumstances of Sir Edward's bankruptcy and to ascertain his assets and liabilities. Sir Edward faces separate proceedings against him and six other directors of Homes Assured, a financial-services company which was wound up in October 1989. Proceedings were started by the Department of Trade and Industry under Section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Under the Act Sir Edward could be disqualified from holding office as a company director. Earlier this month Sir Edward failed to appear in a separate hearing at Taunton County Court involving the National Rivers Authority. The authority alleges that it is owed Pounds 425.25 in respect of a consent to discharge sewage from a local property in 1991. Sir Edward's political career has has included several high-level posts including the chairmanship of the Conservative party and of the influential 1922 Committee in the Commons. He has been a privy councillor since 1964. The Privy Council said yesterday that there were no rules governing members who might be declared bankrupt and would not comment on Sir Edward's case. Only two privy councillors have resigned voluntarily this century: the former war minister John Profumo, and the former Labour MP John Stonehouse. The only privy councillor forced to resign this century was Sir Edgar Speyer, a financier who had his council position revoked in 1921 after being accused of pro-German activities.</p>

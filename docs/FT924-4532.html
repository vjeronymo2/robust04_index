			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Bank defends Australian Dollars THE Australian Reserve Bank intervened yesterday to defend the currency after the government announced sluggish growth figures and a sharp rise in net foreign debt in the September quarter. After touching a five-year low of 67.8 US cents, the Australian dollar recovered to 68.25. Gross domestic product grew only 0.5 per cent in the quarter, confirming that the economy is recovering more slowly than forecast. The government said the figures, combined with revisions to earlier quarters, showed the economy had grown by 2.1 per cent since September 1991, when the recession ended. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said the economy was growing relatively strongly by international standards. He forecast accelerated growth towards the end of the financial year in June. However, economists said leading indicators suggested that growth would decelerate in the December quarter because of a reduction in stocks and a lower contribution from net exports. Balance of payments figures issued on Monday showed that Australia's current account deficit is likely to exceed the government's ADollars 15bn target, mainly because exports have continued to grow more slowly than imports. Net foreign debt grew by 8.6 per cent to ADollars 163bn (Pounds 73.7bn) equivalent to 42 per cent of GDP, compared to 36.5 per cent in September 1990. The increase is likely to prompt a review of Australia's debt rating by credit agencies. However, economists said Australia was unlikely to be downgraded because of an improved ability of the economy to service the debt, as measured by the ratio of interest payments to exports. The ratio fell to 15.4 per cent from 16.5 per cent in June and 19.1 per cent in September 1991. Part of the increase in the Australian dollar value of the debt is likely to have been caused by a devaluation of the currency by more 13 per cent in trade weighted terms over the past year. The poor economic figures suggest that the government may fail to achieve its target of 3 per cent GDP growth through the financial year. Growth of less than 3 per cent is unlikely to be sufficient to reduce unemployment significantly from its 11.3 per cent level. The figures are a blow to the Labor government, which is hoping for evidence of substantial recovery before the federal election, due by June.</p>

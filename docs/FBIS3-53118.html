The minister, who was addressing a cultural meeting at 'Ayn  Shams university, said the restoration of al-Aqsa mosque was a  most important issue which should receive the attention of the  Islamic world.    He pointed out that the al-Aqsa mosque remained under the  protection of the Islamic world for long centuries within the  framework of the brotherhood of mankind away from fanaticism and  bloodshed.    Egypt's Islamic affiliation is an undisputed fact, the  minister said.    Egypt has across history been the guardian and protector of  the teaching of Islam.    The minister said that not a single law was issued in the  (?reign) of President Husni Mubarak which was contrary to  Shari'ah (Islamic law).    Any attempt to undermine Egypt's position and its pioneering  role in the world was doomed to failure, the minister of awqaf  said.</p>

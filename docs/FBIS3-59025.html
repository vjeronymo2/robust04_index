As a matter of principle, Germany  should be in a position to fulfill its obligations as a UN  member, or as a member of the Western European Union or NATO, he  said.    "It is a matter of saying yes in principle, so that it is  possible to say no in each individual case without raising  issues of reliability," Naumann said today before the Hamburg  Overseas Club. However, a military operation of this type must  not always be the last resort: "It is by no means the case that  we soldiers need such a mission for purposes of  self-confirmation."</p>

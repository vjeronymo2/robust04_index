			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Nigeria fuel distribution recovers Nigeria's domestic fuel distribution is slowly recovering from the near-paralysis of last week, as the government's ultimatum for its state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to ease the shortages has expired without further comment from the military regime, Paul Adams writes from Lagos. NNPC's two oil refineries in Port Harcourt are back in operation and large imported fuel shipments have arrived, but NNPC and the private-sector fuel marketers warn the relief is temporary and fundamental problems remain within the industry. The low price of N3.25 (6 US cents) a litre of petrol imposed by the government is half the cost of importing the fuel or producing it in Nigeria, depriving the domestic oil industry of working capital and giving black market operators, who smuggle it abroad or hoard it in Nigeria for sale during shortages, 500 per cent margins.</p>

M. Danny Wall, director of the Office of Thrift  Supervision, said in an interview that regulators do not expect Irvine-based  Lincoln to be the costliest thrift clean-up ever, as many analysts had  projected. Industry experts previously have pegged the clean-up cost at $2  billion to $2.5 billion.  </P></p>

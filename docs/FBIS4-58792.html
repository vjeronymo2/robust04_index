			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview With Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian negotiating team to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by  Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports say you  apologized to Yasir 'Arafat regarding your appointment in the  Palestinian national authority. How true are these reports?    [Sha'th] I was not nominated for this authority and I have  not apologized. I do not know the source of these two reports.  Thus far, no appointments have been announced and no one has  been asked to do anything. I have not apologized to anyone for  anything. These are only rumors.    [Mu'addi] The PLO leadership is discussing the formation of  the Palestinian National Authority. How far have these  discussions gone?    [Sha'th] I believe that in the next few days, maybe in the  next three days, these names will be announced and given to the  Israeli Government.    [Mu'addi] Let us move to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement  signed last week in Cairo. What are the future steps,  particularly regarding the deployment of Palestinian police  force in Gaza and Jericho?    [Sha'th] These forces are now massing in Rafah, on the  Egyptian side of the border, and in Jordan, to prepare to cross  into Gaza and Jericho. Naturally, there is some delay resulting  from the civil war in Yemen and the fact that planes cannot fly  in Libyan airspace. Our troops in Yemen will have to move by  land to Saudi Arabia first, and our troops in Libya will have to  move by land from Libya to Rafah. This will naturally cause  some delay. But, troops are now in Rafah waiting for permission  to cross. Troops are also in Amman preparing to move to the  Jordan Valley and cross the Allenby Bridge. I think that in the  next week or 10 days, these troops will enter to form the bulk  of the Palestinian police force.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the talks on refugees, this  issue has drawn some reaction in Israel. What did the Oslo  Agreement stipulate in this regard?    [Sha'th] The Oslo Agreement is very clear. However, there  are some people on the Israeli right who do not wish to read, or  if they do read, do not wish to understand the agreement. The  agreement says the four-sided committee--comprising Jordan,  Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian authority--will discuss the  return of refugees who left after 1967 from only two aspects:  Establishing the measures for their return and the measures to  protect security and public order. There are no restrictions on  the numbers or the principle of the return of these individuals.  The issue concerns only measures.    [Mu'addi] When will the proceedings of the four-sided  committee start?    [Sha'th] The decision was made in the letters exchanged  between Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin that Israel  and the PLO should invite Jordan and Egypt to the first meeting  within a month after signing the agreement. That will be before  4 June.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

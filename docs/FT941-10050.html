			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Roof bolts cleared in mine fall probe The Bilsthorpe Colliery accident last August in which three miners were killed was not caused by any defect in its roof-bolting system, according to a report into the accident published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive. The roof fall at the Nottinghamshire site occurred in a roadway being driven through coal close to an exhausted area - a practice known in the industry as 'skin-to-skin' working. The report said the roof fall was caused by rock movement 'probably' triggered by 'the relatively high rate of advance of the working in the roadway'. It recommends stopping 'skin-to-skin' working. It exonerates the use of roof-bolts at Bilsthorpe, even suggesting their presence may have helped men to escape from the rock fall. Mr John Rimington, HSE director-general, said the accident had 'not been reasonably foreseeable'.</p>

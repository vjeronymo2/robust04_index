			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Rally continues in Europe ahead of Danish vote EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets continued to rally on expectations that Denmark will vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty and thereby help to revive moves towards economic and monetary convergence in Europe. Bond market participants said some investors were adopting a 'wait-and-see' strategy ahead of today's Danish referendum, and the Bundesbank Council's meeting tomorrow. The Spanish government bond market continued to rally following last Thursday's devaluation of the peseta and Friday's interest rate cuts. The Bank of Spain lowered its money market overnight rate from 12.77 per cent to 12.00 per cent yesterday, raising hopes of further cuts in the central bank's key interest rates. The Meffsa contract quoted on the Spanish futures exchange jumped from 87.79 to 88.43, and in the cash market, five-year bonds slightly outperformed the 10-year area, lifted by healthy foreign investor buying. The 10-year, 10.90 per cent bond yielded 10.99 per cent against 11.11 per cent at the previous close. ITALIAN government bonds rallied on a combination of convergence hopes, expectations of good inflation figures, and a favourable L1,500bn bond auction. The Liffe futures contract rose from 98.39 to 98.65 as net yields fell at yesterday's 10-year BTP auction from 11.09 per cent to 10.71 per cent. The tranche of March 1, 2003 BTPs, paying a coupon of 11.50 per cent, were assigned at a price of 97.45, compared with 95.30 at the previous tranche of the paper on May 3. THE ECU bond market closed about a quarter point higher on positioning ahead of Denmark's Maastricht vote. Analysts said theoretical Ecu bond yields were already approaching 30 basis points below the actual composite yield as the market discounted a Yes vote. ACTIVITY in the German bond market was muted ahead of today's Danish referendum and German repo result, and tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting, dealers said. The Liffe bund futures contract traded down from its high of 94.78 to a low of 94.54 before short-covering helped to push the contract up to 94.72 by late afternoon. Dealers warned that a Danish vote in favour of European economic and monetary union would probably prompt further switching out of bunds and into the higher-yielding European bond markets. FRENCH government bonds made small gains, outperforming the German market with the result that yield spreads narrowed even further - from 39 basis points to 37 basis points in the 10-year area. On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the June bond futures contract ended at 117.44, up 0.10. THE UK government bond market opened on a weak note but rallied later to make up most of Friday's losses. The gilt market lost half a point on Friday, with prices pulled down by the Bank of England's auction announcement. The Bank plans to auction stock in the 10 to 15- year area, and further details of the specific stock, coupon and amount will be announced today. In the futures market, the futures contract rose from 103.07 to 103.23 in relatively light volume, while cash bonds slipped back slightly in the auction stock area. Dealers expect the gilt market to be distracted by the slew of economic data and news due to be released this week, as well as the Danish referendum result and Bundesbank meeting. THE JAPANESE government bond market continued to take its cue from the stock market, with bond prices ending lower as the Nikkei average closed up 91.36 points at 20,565.51. Bond dealers said the bond market's weakness also reflected supply concerns. Last week saw some local government bond issuance, while this week dealers expect utilities to tap the market, and the regular government bond auction is due to take place next week. The September futures contract opened at 107.13 and reached a high of 107.22 before ending the day at the low price of 106.84. Prices weakened further in London trading with the contract moving to 106.75. THE US Treasury yield curve flattened yesterday after longer-dated prices fell amid continued concern about the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 101 15/16 , yielding 6.966 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.009 per cent. In the wake of last week's unexpectedly strong consumer and producer prices figures, investors have become very nervous about inflation and how it might affect the Fed's stance on monetary policy. Although analysts said that policy was likely to remain unchanged, at least until more prices data was available, investors fear that the apparent resurgence of inflation may force the Fed to raise interest rates to slow the pace of economic activity. It was this fear that was behind the drop in longer-dated prices yesterday.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Just as nobody is so prudish as a reformed tart, so no one is more devoted to integrity than an ex-MP. In Without Walls: Bad Ideas of the Twentieth Century (9pm, Channel 4) Matthew Parris excoriates the public relations industry with a sense of outrage that occasionally topples into moral confusion. Does the fact that the eye-witness of alleged atrocities in Kuwait is a royal and the daughter of the ambassador to the US automatically discredit her testimony? And why discount U2's charity work simply because Parris accusingly brands them 'the world's richest band'? Much of the film shows Parris being groomed (haircut, new underpants, pedicure) by a PR lady called Shaa Wasmund (if it's an anagram I haven't worked it out yet). 'I have felt conscious of the presence of a camera all morning,' he observes with the percipience that marked him out for politics and journalism. And there's the rub: he hates PR because it can corrupt his own profession. He may have a point, but this exercise in over-decent exposure doth protest too much.</p>

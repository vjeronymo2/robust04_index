			<p>BFN     [Text] A treaty on the unification of the Belarusian and  Russian monetary systems and the conditions for operating a  common monetary system, including a package of related  agreements, were signed in Moscow on 12 April. These documents  provide that all credit and monetary policy in the common  Russian-Belarusian zone will be determined by one body -- the  Central Bank of Russia. This provision comes into conflict with  the Belarusian Constitution, which entrusts the Belarusian  National Bank with all functions of determining credit and  monetary policy on Belarusian territory. This was pointed out by  Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, who  signed [as received] the mentioned treaty with appropriate  remarks. In addition to him, the treaty was signed by Russian  Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, as well as Prime  Ministers Vyacheslaw Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin. According  to V. Kebich, it is necessary to introduce appropriate  amendments to the Belarusian Constitution and other legislative  acts to make the final step toward unification. He believes  that this can be done by means of a referendum. Most probably,  this referendum can be held along with Belarusian presidential  elections on 23 June.    Under the provisions of the Moscow documents, the  unification  of monetary systems will proceed in two stages. In particular,  from 1 May 1994, trade customs duties will be lifted, the  transit of Russian shipments through Belarus will be free of  charge, and Russia will lease Belarusian facilities, which are  occupied by Russian strategic forces, free of charge.    The second stage -- the actual exchange of Belarusian  National Bank tenders for Russian rubles -- should be preceded  by the Belarusian people expressing their political will  regarding the unification of the two monetary systems. A  one-to-one exchange rate will implemented with respect to every  person for a sum not to exceed 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash  and 1 million Belarusian rubles in bank deposits and deposit  certificates as of 1 April 1994. Belarusian rubles over the  mentioned sum will be exchanged according to a rate determined  by the national committees of statistics comparing baskets of  consumer goods, as well as according to the cross-rate in  dollars. With regard to legal entities, their assets and  liabilities will be exchanged according to the cross-rate, as  well.    Beginning from the time of the actual unification of the  monetary systems of Belarus and Russia, trade between both  countries will be implemented with the use of the mechanism for  regulating prices, which is being used on the internal market.  As of 1 July, Belarus will begin receiving credits valued at  200 billion Russian rubles.    The bilateral agreements, which were signed at the same  time,  are an integral part of the treaty on monetary unification.  They include an agreement on a single mechanism for controlling  budget systems; an agreement on trade and economic relations in  the first stage of monetary unification; and protocols on the  introduction of single procedures and tariff regulations in  trade, on a system of free trade without confiscations and  restrictions, and on the conditions and procedures for using  temporary restrictions in mutual trade. An agreement on certain  conditions for maintaining military units and formations on  Belarusian territory was also signed.    "We removed many obstacles which curbed relations between  our  countries," Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists after the  signing ceremony. The Russian prime minister emphasized that it  is the first time two states within the CIS economic union have  achieved such a close level of cooperation.</p>

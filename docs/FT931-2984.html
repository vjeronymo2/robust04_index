			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Georgia claims Russia bombed Sukhumi GEORGIA claimed yesterday that aircraft with Russian markings had bombed the Black Sea town of Sukhumi in support of the region's secessionist Abkhazian rebels, agencies report. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said at least 70 people were killed overnight in a rebel offensive against the Georgian-held capital of the breakaway province.

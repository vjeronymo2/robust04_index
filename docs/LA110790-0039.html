			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT LOOMS FOR 4 OF 5 BOND, TAX MEASURES;  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS: VOTERS EVENLY DIVIDED ONLY ON SALES LEVY FOR TRANSIT PROJECTS.  MONEY FROM OTHER ISSUES WOULD HAVE AIDED VARIETY OF LOCAL PROJECTS, INCLUDING  JAILS, HOLLYWOOD BOWL, LOS ANGELES ZOO AND 911 SYSTEM.  </P> <P> A new 911 emergency phone system, a sweeping parks measure and an ambitious  jail construction program were among an array of Los Angeles County projects  headed for defeat Tuesday, but voters appeared about evenly divided on a new  half-cent sales tax for transportation projects.  </P> <P> With more than three-fourths of the vote tallied, prospects for four of five  tax-raising measures appeared dim, but supporters held out hope for Proposition  C, the transit tax measure pushed by Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> "It looks very hopeful," said Carrie Chasin, a worker on the transit tax  campaign. Although it was unclear at midnight which precincts remained  uncounted, Chasin noted that those which depend more heavily on mass  transportation would weigh in more heavily in favor of the tax.  </P> <P> The measures were largely backed by city and county officials whose budgets are  strained to their limits. Without the increases, they argued, essential  services would face cuts and cultural attractions would fall further into  disrepair.  </P> <P> Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., which opposed most of  the measures, said, "I think that the voters decided to pick and choose between  tax increases." In the past, "the voters have been duped into providing good  money after bad," said county Supervisor Pete Schabarum, an opponent of the  measures. This time, taxes were rejected because, "the proponents weren't able  to prove they were going to spend the money wisely," he said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County and city measures on the ballot were:  </P> <P> Proposition A  </P> <P> County Jail Construction  </P> <P> Voters were asked to approve a half-cent sales tax increase to fund  construction and operation of new jails and juvenile halls. The measure needed  approval by a simple majority of the voters.  </P> <P> If passed, the new tax was expected to eventually relieve the jail overcrowding  that have forced the early releases since mid-1988 of 325,644 people accused or  convicted of misdemeanors.  </P> <P> Opponents included Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and Los Angeles Taxpayers  Assn., who said the measure amounted to an end run around Proposition 13's  requirement of two-thirds voter approval of tax hikes.  </P> <P> Proposition B  </P> <P> County Parks  </P> <P> The largest bond measure in the county's history would have boosted property  taxes to pay for an $817-million array of recreational and cultural projects.  It attracted a wide range of supporters, including such ideological opposites  as conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich and liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> The key was its novel something-for-everyone approach.  </P> <P> Included in the measure was $50 million for county beaches and harbors, $35  million for the Hollywood Bowl, $30 million for the Los Angeles Zoo, $13  million for the County Museum of Natural History, $10 million for the County  Museum of Art, $13 million for Griffith Observatory and $5 million for trout  streams.  </P> <P> If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the measure would have added about $20  a year for 20 years to the tax bill of a home assessed at $250,000.  </P> <P> Proposition C  </P> <P> County Transit Projects  </P> <P> The measure would authorize a half-cent sales tax increase to fund transit  projects, bringing the county's rate to 7%. Like Proposition A, it required a  simple majority for approval.  </P> <P> The measure would raise an estimated $400 million annually to build and operate  rail systems, maintain bus service and improve streets.  </P> <P> Proposition J  </P> <P> 911 System  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department lobbied hard for the municipal measure to  raise $235 million to replace its 911 emergency calling and radio systems. The  department says that as many as 100,000 calls to 911 will go unanswered this  year because of its outmoded system.  </P> <P> The measure would have cost the owner of the average 1,500-square-foot home  about $12.50 a year for 20 years. Two-thirds voter approval was required.  </P> <P> Proposition K  </P> <P> Housing Preservation  </P> <P> The $100-million bond measure would have provided $80 million for nonprofit  groups to buy and rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartment units that are at  risk of being lost to earthquakes, demolition or gentrification. Another $10  million was set aside for building shelters for homeless, and $10 million would  have gone to loans for low-wage home buyers shut out of the costly Los Angeles  market.  </P> <P> The measure required a two-thirds vote and would have added about $4.95 a year  to the average tax bill for 20 years.  </P> <P> Contributing to election coverage were Times staff writers Eric Bailey, Bob  Baker, Stephen Braun, Stephanie Chavez, Mathis Chazanov, Henry Chu, Rich  Connell, Maura Dolan, Virginia Ellis, Paul Feldman, Larry Gordon, Berkley  Hudson, Ted Johnson, Charisse Jones, Robert A.

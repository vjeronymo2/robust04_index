			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London aluminium price touches a 39-month high Aluminium touched Dollars 1,530 a tonne, a 39-month high, on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as investment funds continued to make their presence felt in the metal markets. However, some profit-taking emerged and there was no support for prices from the US, where markets were closed for Independence Day. As a result aluminium for delivery in three months eased back to close at Dollars 1,519, up Dollars 9. Aluminium's fundamental situation was improving, said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, 'but the market appears to have run ahead of itself to some extent'. Cuts in western world daily output had yet to translate into a sustained fall in the huge stocks overhanging the market. Mr MacMillan said that, if prices continued to strengthen, producers might be tempted to restart capacity at present shut down. However, for the time being Billiton was assuming this would not happen and it had revised its aluminium price forecast for 1994 up from an average of 54 cents a pound (Dollars 1,190 a tonne) to 60 cents.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / LDP godfather on income tax evasion charges JAPANESE politicians were wondering last night who would be next to be investigated for tax evasion after Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced godfather of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was charged with evading Y118m (Pounds 690,000) in income taxes. The prosecutors' pursuit of Mr Kanemaru follows public complaints that they treated him with undue lenience for an earlier violation of the Political Funds Contral Law, and there were calls yesterday for an investigation into the finances of other leading politicians. Mr Kanemaru, 78, faces further charges, as the Y118m arises from fiscal 1987 and it is believed that prosecutors intend to take action against him for alleged evasion in each year up until last year. Prosecutors also charged Mr Masahisa Haibara, 49, Mr Kanemaru's former aide, with evading Y26m in income tax on undeclared income of at least Y50m in 1987. Mr Haibara also faces further charges, as the first indictments were rushed through to beat a deadline set by the statute of limitations. The indictments follow raids on Mr Kanemaru's home and office which uncovered cash, debenture certificates and gold bullion worth almost Y7bn, apparently used to maintain his influence as the head of the LDP's largest faction. He faces a maximum of five years' imprisonment and a Y5m fine. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said that the indictments are 'truly regrettable', as 'public distrust for politics is worsening due to consecutive scandals.' But the LDP is still divided over reforms to political funding legislation, in particular a suggested ban on donations to the support groups which bankroll most politicians. Most party members apparently agree that there should be tougher controls on funds received by individuals but are reluctant to agree a ban on the funding of these support groups.</p>

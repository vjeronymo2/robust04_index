			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LOCK-UP LETS LOOSE AT CLUB LINGERIE  </P> <P> As a Silverlake performance artist, Brian Grillo undulated through fish dances,  writhed upside down in a loincloth from the rafters of a nightclub, and led  campy neo-Motown revues. But as the frontman for Lock-Up, the funky Hollywood  band that performed at Club Lingerie on Thursday, Grillo did a remarkable  impersonation of a talented regular-guy rock singer.  </P> <P> It's as if Eric Bogosian were actually to become a talk-show host or Ann  Magnuson a heavy-metal queen, and did it better than the guys they were  parodying. Thursday Lock-Up's arty edges were limited to the fine  Basquiat-esque totem-pole-style backdrop; this was rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Grillo belts like Huey Lewis or somebody, and dances a modified version of the  Springsteen Shuffle. His band blasts tight Ohio Players riffs by way of Guns N'  Roses -- hey, Lock-Up records for Geffen now -- that sound more like decent  commercial hard rock than like the atonal ecstasies of, say, the Red Hot Chili  Peppers. People danced to this stuff, even some of the jaded industry crowd,  and women screamed like Beatlemaniacs during the ballad. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's next steps THE signs are that Mr John Major's re-shuffle of his Cabinet has failed to free him from factional strife inside his party. There is talk that the prime minister may well face a leadership challenge in the course of 1994. Given the wounds of the Newbury by-election and the likelihood that Christchurch will inflict a further gash, there is cause for prime ministerial anxiety. Perhaps there is no escape from this dizzying descent into political ineffectiveness. Mr Major, a man of unsure political identity, was chosen because his colleagues wanted no more of Mrs Thatcher, but did not know what they wanted instead. Normally, parties in identity crisis recuperate in opposition. That the Conservatives are not doing so is a fearsome indictment of the Labour party. The continuing feebleness of the opposition is one of several reasons why Mr Major need not feel entirely gloomy. Bigger ones are the economic recovery and fact that parliamentary warfare over Maastricht is as good as over. Last week's timid re-shuffle might yet add a fourth, if the new team can help define a post-Thatcher conservative project to unite all but the most embittered Europhobes inside the party. In his interview with the FT last week, Mr Major displayed his strengths and his weakness. His strong points include a doggedness of purpose and personal charm, once considered a decisive electoral asset. He has also dealt with the debris Mrs Thatcher left behind: the poll tax, soaring inflation, recession and chaos inside her own party on Europe. Even his responsibility for Britain's unedifying tangle with the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system cannot obscure the achievement. Of the weaknesses, one, the slimness of Mr Major's majority in the House of Commons, is without remedy. A second, the government's reputation for competence, is closely linked to the first; a government which speaks loudly and carries a small stick is apt to look foolish. On coal, education and penal policy, Mr Major and his ministers have appeared by turns vainglorious, penitent and incompetent. Even last week, recrimination surrounded the launch of policies for transport and science, suggesting a government which might have difficulty organising a sing-song at a Welsh drinking party. If he cannot run a competent government, Mr Major will not deserve to go on governing. The vision thing But there is a third weakness which lies at the heart of his difficulties. In the interview, he was asked where, in a Cabinet of consolidators on one side and radicals on the other, he stands himself. In rejecting such labels, he said: 'When I see something that I believe is wrong, I will want to change it. Where I see something that operates broadly with the grain of the British instinct, I won't want to change it.' As an appeal to a national temperament which dislikes ideologues, this is fine, but it is not the basis for a political platform, on which others can build; it lacks, in President Bush's words, the vision thing. A prime minister has to be able to set out the political principles against which choices must be made. If he cannot, those who wish to support him will lack a framework for so doing, and his opponents will see him as so much chaff. What might a new Conservative vision involve and how could it bear on the two great questions in British politics: the economy and Europe? Here is a suggestion: the government will seek to return as much power as possible to its citizens. It can do so in a number of ways: by restraining the level of taxation, so that individuals have maximum discretion over spending; by giving the public more information, better right of redress and effective, open and accountable government at the local, national and European level. In other words, Mr Major would turn the tide on the centralised state which Mrs Thatcher used to attack deep ills. He would do so while building on the foundations of Thatcherism - a liberal, open economy exposed to the maximum competitive pressure; a corporate sector freed from excessive taxation and damagingly powerful trade unions; a commitment to low inflation and prudent public finances, including a determination to contain the public sector at around 40 per cent of GDP. This year, driven partly by the recession, the figure will exceed 45.5 per cent, at a time when revenues represent only 37 per cent of GDP. Timorous step It is clear that Mr Major is instinctively attracted by much of this, but his actions, such as the citizen's charter, have been inadequate. He heads a government machine which prefers governing in the dark, where Whitehall knows best and the Treasury knows best of all; never mind that this gave Britain the poll tax, boom and bust, the ERM, the pits debacle and the confrontation over school tests. It is not true that nothing can be done. The panel of advisers at the Treasury is a timorous step in the right direction, but what the UK really needs is an independent central bank, accountable for achieving a specific inflation target, and a council of economic advisers capable of carrying independent weight in the pay-setting debate. Whether or not the Bank of England is made independent, fiscal policy has to be tightened. If not, an appreciating exchange rate may again be used as the main instrument for securing low inflation, thus again tending to destabilise incentives for the production of tradeable goods and services. This implies a firm attack on public expenditure, which in turn calls for the political boldness to target benefits on those who most need them, rather than re-cycling middle-classes taxes as middle-class subsidies. Where services are efficiently provided by public-sector agencies, individuals who can afford to should be asked to pay, and they should be able to pay directly for a premium level of service. Obvious targets are subsidised home-ownership and free higher education for all, but the scale of the financial problem demands that the principle also be applied in social security, pensions and the health service. There is a connection between public finances and better governance. In the first place, big changes to the welfare state require consent, and consent requires debate. Also, the excellent principle of the purchaser-provider splits in public services demands more effective mechanisms to develop competition among providers and to make the purchasers (for example, health authorities) accountable. Whitehall cannot be the sole conduit for this process, nor can Whitehall's ugly quango offspring. A start must also be made in restoring fiscal autonomy to local authorities, which today depend upon central government grants for 85 per cent of their income. Poor watchdogs Pluralism in governance is healthy because it places power and responsibility at the right level and because it encourages diversity. The government recognises this in the EC context, where Mr Major wants the community to take a hard and realistic look at the role of the commission, the European Parliament and the council of ministers which, jointly and severally, fall well short of acceptable standards of openness and accountability. This debate, however, cannot avoid examining the role of national parliaments, which have been poor watchdogs of the EC thus far; perhaps Britain's House of Lords could be made democratic and given such a role. Here then, is an agenda for Mr Major. In it, he champions individual responsibility and opportunity and attacks monopoly power and overmighty institutions. He constrains the state, but makes it more democratic, more economically productive. Perhaps he even unites his party and looks like a winner again.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / De Benedetti under investigation over Olivetti bribes MR CARLO De Benedetti, chair-man of Olivetti, was yesterday formally placed under investigation by Milan magistrates. The move follows his voluntary statement to the authorities on Sunday outlining illicit payments by Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, to Italian politicians totalling nearly L20bn (Pounds 8.5m) during the past decade. His statement spoke of threats to obtain money which amounted to 'racketeering'. It is the most outspoken attack so far by a leading industrialist on Italy's political establishment and the climate in which business was obliged to work during the late 1980s. Mr De Benedetti is one of most prominent businessman among about 700 politicians, officials and entrepreneurs caught up in Italy's ever-widening corruption scandal. However, Mr Marco De Luca, the Olivetti chief's lawyer, said no charges had been laid against him. In volunteering the deposition, Mr De Benedetti said he assumed responsibility for all actions by the company, whether or not he was personally involved. In a statement to the Financial Times yesterday, he repeated that he, personally, had 'never paid over any money to politicians or officials'. In his 11-page deposition, Mr De Benedetti said that at one stage Olivetti had rejected requests for money and had been put 'on the black books of the state railways' and excluded even from bids. Later, the pressure from the parties and their representatives in the state entities 'reached an impressive crescendo . . . of menaces and extortion to become in the last few years nothing short of racketeering . . . The demands from the representatives of the parties were systematic and unavoidable on everything they controlled without exception'. Mr Giovanni Cherubini, former head of Olivetti's Rome operations, who is understood to have acted as an intermediary with treasurers of main Italian parties and with ministry officials, appeared voluntarily before Milan magistrates yesterday. It is believed that, through him, Olivetti agreed to begin making payments in 1988 to a Rome 'collector' for the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. This was in return for a purchase agreement with the Ministry of Posts, Mr De Benedetti's deposition said. The payments represented 2 per cent of the value of the ministry's purchases. Between 1988-91 Olivetti paid more than L10bn this way. No details of other Olivetti payments have been released but Mr De Benedetti said there had been five separate episodes since 1978. He gave two other examples to underline the climate of hostility - the blocking of a takeover of the publisher Mondadori in 1981 and the intervention of the former Socialist prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, on the sale of SME, the state foodstuffs and distribution group in 1985. 'The strong reaction of . . . Mr Craxi blocked and subsequently annulled the latter operation.' Yesterday ordinary shares in Olivetti rose 2.8 per cent before falling back marginally.

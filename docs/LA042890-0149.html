			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WIFE SAYS STEPMOTHER REVVED CAR, 'THEN SHE HIT HIM';  </P> <P> HEARING: A NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN IS SUSPECTED OF FELONY HIT-AND-RUN DRIVING IN  FATALLY STRIKING HER STEPDAUGHTER'S HUSBAND WITH HER MERCEDES-BENZ.  </P> <P> Fighting back the tears, Wendy Ward recalled in court Friday the horror of  seeing her husband struck without warning and carried on the hood of her  stepmother's Mercedes-Benz before he tumbled into the street, fatally injured.  </P> <P> Ward, 31, of Costa Mesa testified on the first day of a hearing that will  determine whether to try Betty Young Davies on charges of involuntary  manslaughter and felony hit-and-run driving.  </P> <P> Davies, 58, of Newport Beach is accused of running down James R. Ward about 8  p.m. Dec. 19 during a confrontation in front of the Wards' home at 840 Congress  St. in Costa Mesa. A 31-year-old father of two children, he sustained severe  head injuries and died four days later at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "I was yelling at Jim to move," Wendy Ward testified before a courtroom filled  with friends and relatives. "She started the car. I heard the motor racing.  Then she hit him."  </P> <P> Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum, Ward said her  stepmother did not honk, give a warning or try to avoid hitting her husband,  who was standing about two feet in front of the maroon Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL.  </P> <P> After her husband was struck, she recalled, Davies sped away and did not stop.  </P> <P> "He had no chance to move," she said as she broke into tears.  </P> <P> Friday's testimony in Harbor Municipal Court indicated that the fatal encounter  with Davies began about 7:45 p.m. when a neighbor, Wendy Bidner, spotted Davies  spying on the Ward home from behind a tree across the street.  </P> <P> Bidner said she called the Wards to warn them and later overheard what she  considered threatening remarks that Davies made to James Ward. She recalled  that Wendy Ward soon came out and yelled at her stepmother: "Get out of here!  Leave us alone!"  </P> <P> Ward said she and her husband confronted Davies in the street in front of their  home and persistently demanded to know why she was there, but Davies did not  answer questions.  </P> <P> "I was upset by her presence," she testified. "We were not friendly with her.  She was not an invited guest. She didn't acknowledge anything."  </P> <P> Police said the Wards' relationship with Davies had been difficult for several  years. Records show that the couple complained at least four times that the  stepmother had vandalized their car, made annoying phone calls and had spied on  them.  </P> <P> In one incident, the paint on the Wards' Honda Civic was scratched with a sharp  object from bumper to bumper, according to police reports.  </P> <P> Wendy Ward testified that on the day of her husband's death, the two of them  finally escorted Davies to her car, which was parked down the block from their  home. She recalled that her husband never struck Davies or her car before he  was run down.  </P> <P> Defense Attorney Marshall M. Schulman declined to comment on the testimony.  Schulman is scheduled to question Wendy Ward on Monday when the preliminary  hearing resumes.  </P> <P> "It's a sad situation all around," Schulman said. "It will all come out in the  wash, but I don't want to put any fuel on the fire right now."  </P> <P> Friday's hearing was repeatedly disrupted and delayed by legal sparring between  Rosenblum and Schulman, prompting warnings by Judge Susanne S. Shaw. At one  point, Shaw threatened both attorneys with contempt if they could not control  themselves.  </P> <P> "We're not sixth-graders," Shaw said. "Let's get on with it. You are so busy  bantering around that we can't get the facts out."  </P></p>

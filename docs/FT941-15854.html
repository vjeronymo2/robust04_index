			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Duncan 'ducks' Commons probe Mr Alan Duncan, the Conser-vative MP under attack over his purchase of a former council house, was said to have decided to 'duck and run' when the issue was raised in the Commons last night. Mr Duncan resigned last week as a minister's parliamentary assistant after the disclosure that he had lent money to a neighbour, Mr Harry Ball-Wilson, to buy his house from Westminster City Council at a discount, and that Mr Duncan had then bought the house from him. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday expressed 'astonishment' that Mr Duncan, MP for Rutland and Melton, was not in his place in the Commons, although he had been given notice that the matter was to be raised. Mr Straw questioned whether it had been right for the council's 'subsidy' to have been passed on to Mr Duncan when he acquired the property. The answer, he said, was dependent on the circumstances in which Mr Duncan agreed to lend Mr Ball-Wilson, the statutory purchaser, most of the purchase price. He also called for an inquiry to establish whether the property should have been subject to business rates because it had been used as campaign headquarters for Mr John Major in the 1990 Conservative leadership contest. Westminster City Council is 'seeking an informal interview' with Mr Duncan to clarify allegations that he had been using one of his two houses in Gayfere Street, Westminster, for business purposes. 'If there has been a material change of use (from domestic to business premises) then we would want to investigate,' it said.</p>

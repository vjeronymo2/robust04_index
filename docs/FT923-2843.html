			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Tecs seek earlier training for jobless TRAINING and Enterprise Councils are seeking cuts in the amount of time unemployed adults must wait before qualifying for training and job-search opportunities. The 82 Tecs, which administer publicly-funded training programmes in England and Wales, propose provisions such as a Jobclub for the unemployed starting in the first weeks of unemployment building up to entitlement to a broad range of services at 13 weeks' unemployment. At present such services are concentrated on people unemployed for more than six months. Tecs have told the government the plan could lead to a sharp increase in the number of jobs offered to the unemployed, but would not require more government funds. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is reviewing publicly funded provision for the adult unemployed. Tecs would also like the funding arrangements for Employment Training, the main training scheme for the adult long-term unemployed, changed so that individuals received pay instead of benefits. Tecs believe this would improve the image of ET. Tecs also ask for clearer lines of responsibility between them and the government's Employment Service, which at present provides services such as Jobclubs. Tecs would like to provide some of the services.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> GOLF COURSE SITE'S FUTURE TO BE STUDIED  </P> <P> The City Council authorized spending up to $10,000 to study what should happen  to the Santiago Golf Course site, which was most recently slated for 160 houses  and a shopping center.  </P> <P> After nearly 10 years of fighting about at least three different proposals to  develop the site, residents led by the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee  persuaded the council in August to stop development of the site. The group  wants the city to explore purchasing the former 37-acre golf course to create a  city park or greenway.  </P> <P> The funds approved this week are the first city monies to go toward the project  and will be used to hire a consultant who specializes in the acquisition and  design of urban open spaces.  </P> <P> The consultant will study recreational uses for the site as well as research  funding sources to help purchase the land, said Howard DeCruyenaere, president  of the Santiago Creek Greenway Committee. The value of the site, which includes  the golf course, a former housing tract and city and county land, will be  determined within six to eight weeks by an appraiser approved by the committee  and city staff, said Scott Morgan, senior assistant to the city manager.  </P> <P> Michael Hennessey, a member of the Greenway committee, said he was encouraged  by the city's cooperation and asked for continued support.  </P> <P> "We are as determined now as the day we started," Hennessey said. "We will not  let go. We will not relent."  </P> <P> The city also lifted the 90-day moratorium on development proposals for the  site in response to a request from Santiago Associates, a partnership of the  William Lyon and Burnett-Ehline Development companies.  </P> <P> Lynn Burnett told the council that any action by his firm would not affect the  Greenway committee's efforts, but he reminded the council that "we have not  been on hold for just . . . 90 days, we've been involved with this project for  4 1/2 years."

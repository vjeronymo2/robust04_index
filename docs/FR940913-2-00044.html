Because this percentage supports the currently effective Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage of 2.25% requested in FGT's out-of-cycle filing on May 11, 1994, in Docket No. TM94&hyph;5&hyph;34 and approved by Commission order issued June 17, 1994, and because changes in the Percentage must be reflected in all Shippers' arrangements with suppliers and upstream transporters and/or gatherers, FGT is not proposing any revisions at this time. Therefore, no tariff sheets are filed with the report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT further states it will continue to closely monitor the actual quantities of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas as information becomes available and make such adjustments to the Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage as warranted in accordance with Section 27 in order to closely match the fuel retention with actual operating experience and minimize the over or under retention of company used fuel and unaccounted for volumes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the filing and the interested state commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

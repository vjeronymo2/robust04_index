			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Russian Defense Ministry Information and Press </F> Administration: "Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  Collegium Discusses Conscription Problems"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Minister, General of  the Army Pavel Grachev, held an expanded session of the Russian  Defense Ministry Collegium on March 26 to discuss the results of  the fall 1993 conscription of citizens for military service in  the Armed Forces and measures to improve the work of military  commissariats. The collegium session was attended by officials  of the president's administration, the government, the Russian  Procuracy, military district and fleet troop commanders, and  military commissars from a number of Russian oblasts.    The session participants said that the Russian Federation  Armed Forces General Staff, military district commands and  staffs, and military commissariats, in conjunction with chief  administrators, had made strong efforts to support the fall 1993  conscription of citizens for military service and manpower  acquisition for the Russian Federation Armed Forces. Despite the  measures taken, however, the military conscription target was  not met completely. This was the result of a number of factors,  including the continuing increase in the number of instances of  evasion of military service.    In order to carry out the conscription of citizens for  military service and manpower acquisition programs for the Armed  Forces in 1994 in a well-organized fashion, collegium members  adopted a decision to request the Russian Federation government  to accelerate the process of reviewing and confirming statutes  on military registration, military conscription, and medical  examinations for military conscripts and a schedule of rated  military specializations. The Defense Ministry Collegium also  resolved to make every effort to ensure the high-quality  selection and recruitment of citizens for contract military  service in accordance with established targets and to fill all  warrant officer vacancies in the Army and Navy. The session  participants called attention to the need to enlist as many  representatives of labor collectives, educational institutions,  and public organizations as possible in work with conscripts  during the spring conscription campaign.</p>

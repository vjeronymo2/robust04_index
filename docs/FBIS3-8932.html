			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 March (MTI) -- In a statement sent to  MTI today, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Press Department  said:    "An article in the 1/1994 issue of PARLAMENTNY KURIER, the  official periodical of the Slovak National Council, comments on  Hungary's coat of arms, a national symbol of this country, in a  manner insulting to the sovereignty of Hungary." The article  accuses Hungary's coat-of-arms of unlawfully depicting three  hills and a double cross, which it claims are Slovak symbols.    The statement says, "On March 11 the head of the Foreign  Ministry's relevant regional department summoned the Slovak  charge d'affaires and presented him with a verbal note.    "In the note, the Foreign Ministry recalled that several  European states, as well as others, use among their national and  state symbols ones that are identical or similar. This is  regarded as a symbol of connection between the various peoples.  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry considers it contrary to  traditional friendship between the two peoples that the national  symbols are made a matter of debate between the two countries.  The Foreign Ministry has asked the Slovak side to adopt a  formal position on the issue."</p>

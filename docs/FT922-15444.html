			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Collor in talks on new government BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor is expected to announce a government of 'national conciliation' following the resignation of his administration on Monday. The resignation of more than 30 ministers and federal secretaries was apparently initiated by Mr Collor, disturbed by the avalanche of corruption scandals involving senior government figures. He spent yesterday morning meeting state governors from different political parties, apparently to broaden his political base. Several of those approached yesterday to assume office refused and so far Mr Collor has announced only three new government members. Mr Eliezer Batista , the well-respected international director of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company, takes over as secretary for strategic affairs head of domestic intelligence. Mr Celio Borja, head of the Electoral Commission, is to become the new law minister. Mr Helio Jaguaribe, a leading political scientist and critic of Mr Collor from the Social Democratic party (PSDB), has been named secretary for science and technology and will act as co-ordinator of social policy. Eight ministers have been confirmed in their posts - those for economy, education, health, labour and social action, and the three military ministers. But there has been no word yet on three big ministries - foreign affairs, agriculture and infrastructure  - or on 26 of the federal secretaries. Mr Cesar Maia, a congressman from the main opposition party, criticised the move as 'a very dramatic way of getting rid of a few people'. He added: 'You don't need to burn the house down to replace a sofa.' But reaction in Brazil has been generally positive. The Rio and Sao Paulo markets rose 7 per cent yesterday. There was widespread relief too that the wave of corruption charges against Mr Collor's government had not resulted in a military takeover, like that recently attempted in Venezuela. That Mr Collor could deal with it in a democratic manner has reinfirced political stability.</p>

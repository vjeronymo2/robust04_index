			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> DOODLIN TO FACE A TOUGH FIELD TONIGHT  </P> <P> The Gusty Stable's Doodlin may be facing the toughest task she's had in quite a  while as she battles a field of eight in a $10,000 distaff pacing invitational  tonight at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Also tonight, eight of thoroughbred racing's finest jockeys will try their hand  at driving rather than riding horses.  </P> <P> The occasion is the All-Star Jockeys Pace, an exhibition harness race featuring  Laffit Pincay, Chris McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye, Ray Sibille, Gary Stevens,  Robbie Davis, Alex Solis and Corey Black. The race will benefit the Don MacBeth  Memorial Jockey Fund, which was created to benefit disabled jockeys.  </P> <P> In post position order, the field for tonight's main attraction: Azurae, Gene  Vallandingham in the race bike; Set To Go, Jim Lackey; Ja Ja Fajasm, Peter  Wrenn; Gee Gee Gem, Ross Croghan; French Heritage, Marc Aubin; Solid Bett, Jim  Butler; Terri S, D. R. Ackerman; Admiral's Rule, Joe Anderson, and Doodlin,  Rick Kuebler.  </P> <P> The invitational goes as the eighth wagering event on the 12-race program.  </P> <P> Doodlin was impressive last Friday night as she captured a similar race in  1:58.  </P> <P> Doodlin will have her work cut out for her Friday night as she will start from  the No. 9 post. The winner of more than $310,000 is capable of scoring from the  outside slot but will have to be at her best (and not get overly hard used  early), as many in the field have the credentials necessary for a winning  effort.  </P> <P> Kuebler will have to make his decision immediately after the start whether to  send the mare or sit back and wait.  </P> <P> The Anderson reined and trained New Zealander Admiral's Rule could not catch  Doodlin last week after a relatively easy trip.  </P></p>

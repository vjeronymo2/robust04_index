			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / SAS pushes on with four-airline merger talks SCANDINAVIAN Airline System (SAS) confirmed yesterday that a merger of four of Europe's medium-sized airlines - SAS, KLM, of the Netherlands, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - is under consideration. However, it denied that a decision has been taken and said a merger was one of several forms of co-operation being studied by working groups set up by the airlines. SAS was responding to reports in the Danish media claiming that the managements and boards of the four airlines had already agreed on the principles of and a timetable for a merger. The four airlines have 87,000 employees and carried 30.6m passengers in 1991, more than either British Airways or Lufthansa. The four airlines are planning to transfer their assets to a jointly-owned company in which SAS, KLM and Swissair will each hold 30 per cent and Austrian Airlines 10 per cent, according to a press report. The board of the new company will have 14 members, four each from the three larger airlines and two from Austrian Airlines. The new company will own four operating companies, which will fly under a common logo, with common colours and flight schedules and a joint headquarters, the report added. Starting date for the co-operation is next new year, said the paper, but there would be a transitional phase before the merger was completed. Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS chief executive, is a long-standing proponent of transnational airline co-operation to enable European airlines to compete with the large American and Asian carriers when the European air transport market is liberalised in coming years. The plans for extensive co-operation between the SAS, KLM, Swissair, and Austrian Airlines, made known earlier this year, have met with scepticism in Copenhagen, where the Danish capital's Kastrup International Airport is the hub airport for SAS.</p>

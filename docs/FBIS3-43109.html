Adsorption isotherms of the  LaNi[.sup]5[/]-H[.sub]x[/] system, i.e., the dependence of  the equilibrium hydrogen pressure on its specific mass content  at various temperatures, the relationship between the heat  delivery and extraction temperatures of the hydride compressor  radiators, the hydrogen refrigerator T-S-curve, and  the dependence of the total radiator area on the precooling  temperature at various pressures are plotted. The total radiator  area has a clearly marked precooling temperature minimum which  also depends on the refrigerator's remaining parameters. Figures  5; references 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Neil's good times Busy chap Andrew Neil. As if the ex-editor of the Sunday Times did not have enough to do launching his new US current affairs show, he is about to start writing the memoirs of his ten action-packed years at the Sunday Times. Contrary to rumours, Neil says he has had no difficulty finding a publisher. Harper Collins was ruled out because it is owned by Rupert Murdoch, but four others put in bids and MacMillan won with a hefty advance. Neil has even thought up a title - 'Making Waves' - which refers to an unfavourable article by Hugo Young, a former political editor of the Sunday Times, who said that under Neil the paper would 'make money but not waves'. Neil intends to set the record straight. But why the hurry? Could it be a precautionary move in case his US TV show flops and he is not invited back to edit the ST?</p>

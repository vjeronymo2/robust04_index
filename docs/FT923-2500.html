			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Retail sales grow but gloom remains A BIGGER rise than expected in high street sales last month failed to lift sentiment about prospects for the UK economy. Hopes that consumer confidence was showing flickers of activity - after the highest increase in retail sales since the beginning of the year - receded when commercial banks raised their base lending rates to 12 per cent. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the volume of sales on Britain's high streets rose by 0.8 per cent during August after a small fall in July. It was the biggest month-on-month increase since November last year. In the three months to August, the volume of sales was 0.5 per cent up on the previous three-month period and 0.3 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year before. Non-food retailers reported better sales than food and department stores. Volumes rose by 1.1 per cent compared with the three months to the end of May and were 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. Within that, sales of clothing and footwear rose 2 per cent on the previous three months, reflecting clothes retailers' summer discount sales. Sales of household goods rose 1 per cent in the latest three months, but were up 3 per cent on the corresponding period a year before. Food retailers fared less well. Sales fell 0.2 per cent in the latest three months but were 0.3 per cent up on a year ago. The more promising state of retail sales last month is unlikely to be repeated this month. The latest Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey suggests that retailers do not expect demand to improve over the next three months. Yesterday's increase in interest rates will dampen consumer confidence further as mortgage rate rises reduce the amount of money people have to spend. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland Montagu, the investment bank, said: 'Had there not been the pressure on sterling this week, I think the retail sales figures and better-than-expected news on government borrowing would have been taken together as good news for economic prospects.'</p>

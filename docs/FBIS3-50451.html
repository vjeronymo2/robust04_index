			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santiago, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Enrique  Silva Cimma today confirmed that the Chilean Government is  looking into the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations  with Cuba. He did not specify, however, whether this would take  place before the change of government on 11 March.    Silva Cimma told the media that the subject is being studied  "carefully" and that "every aspect of what the relationship  between Chile and Cuba represents" is being taken into account.    Diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken  following the 11 September 1973 coup to oust Chilean President  Salvador Allende.    When Patricio Aylwin assumed the Chilean presidency in March  1990, relations were restored at the consular level, despite the  interest of the socialist sector of the governing Coalition of  Parties for Democracy in fully resuming relations with an  exchange of ambassadors.    Since then, however, there has been a strong rapprochement  in  the commercial field between the two countries and several  Chilean businessmen have invested in the tourism and  agroindustrial fields in Cuba.    From the political viewpoint, Carlos Lage, vice president of  the Cuban State Council and executive secretary of the Council  of Ministers, visited Chile in response to an invitation from  the Chilean Government. Lage said that the invitation was a  demonstration of the mutual interest in moving toward a gradual  integration process    Last November, Chile voted at the UN General Assembly in  favor of lifting the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba.    According to political sources mentioned by the Santiago  daily EL MERCURIO, the Chilean Government wants to resume  relations before 11 March in view of Cuban President Fidel  Castro's interest in attending the presidential inauguration.    EL MERCURIO goes on to say that within the Chilean  Government  there are also some who are against this idea. They consider it  inadvisable that Castro be at the ceremony because the display  he makes during his trips abroad might overshadow Chilean  President-elect Eduardo Frei.    According to EL MERCURIO, these sectors also believe that  Castro might create problems with other countries with which  Chile wishes to maintain good relations. The daily thus  recalled the public disputes between Castro and Argentine  President Carlos Menem a few months ago in La Paz during the  inauguration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada.</p>

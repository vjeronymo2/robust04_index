			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Bush attacks Clinton over trade policy PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday shifted the focus of his attack on Mr Bill Clinton, accusing his Democratic rival for the presidency of being a closet protectionist who was trying to exploit 'fear of foreigners' in his campaign. At the same time, it was announced that Mr Robert Mosbacher, former commerce secretary, had quit as general chairman of Mr Bush's re-election effort. His switch to fund-raising for the Republican party came just days after Mr James Baker had arrived to try to breathe new life into Mr Bush's campaign. In his latest broadside at Mr Clinton, the president specifically attacked his proposals to raise the transfer taxes on foreign investment in the US. This, Mr Bush charged, was tantamount to 'an eviction notice' to US workers and should be seen in contrast to his own commitment to freer trade and greater investment. 'By attacking the bogeymen of foreign investors,' the president told a rally in St Louis, 'Governor Clinton hopes to exploit the darker impulses of this uncertain age: fear of the future, fear of the unknown, fear of foreigners.' The president's speech contained no reference to his opponent's character, nor did it invoke the 'family values' that featured in the Republican campaign during the last week. This fits comments on Wednesday by Mr Charles Black, a senior campaign official, who dismissed as 'wild rumours, gossip and red herrings' the personal vitriol poured recently on Mr and Mrs Clinton by assorted presidential surrogates. Even so, both Mr Bush and Mr Black said they would continue to stress traditional family values in the campaign, implying at least a modified continuation of the present 'high road, low road' tactic, whereby the president can distance himself from any personal attacks on the Clintons. The polls have found that many voters want to hear more about concrete economic and social policy proposals.</p>

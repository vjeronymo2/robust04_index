			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bakr Mahmud Rasul, general manager of the Arab Labor  Organization, warned of a threatening unemployment crisis in the  Arab world. He said that the [unemployment] rate rose to 14  percent last year and that there are 10 million unemployed  workers, mostly in densely populated countries such as Egypt,  Sudan, Morocco, and Algeria, but also in sparsely populated  states such as Jordan. He further warned that the oil producers,  even though they are sparsely populated, are also threatened by  [unemployment] because of numerous programs for Asian  immigrants and migrant workers. Bakr Rasul added that  unemployment is most rampant among degreed recent entrants into  the labor market, and said: "Some 2.5 million [workers] enter  the Arab labor force annually with no chance of providing them  with employment opportunities."    He said that economic reform programs in the Arab world may  help correct the imbalances in domestic and external general  balances and reduce the burden of debt, but they do not address  unemployment.    Bakr Rasul pointed out that there are short, medium, and  long-term solutions to unemployment problems and that the latter  would depend on the success of existing economic reform programs  and on making progress toward Arab cooperation based on mutual  and entwined interests. He added that such Arab cooperation  should be calculated, comprehensive, and rewarding to all  parties, since it would also contribute to the success of reform  programs that depend on export policies, broad market economies,  expanded competition, and successful technological assimilation.  He said that the Arab employment strategy, approved by the Arab  states at last April's meeting of labor ministers, could be the  means to resolve the unemployment crisis.    On the Organization's contributions to the success of the  self-rule experiment in Gaza, Bakr Rasul said that "the Arab  Labor Organization held an educational symposium last month for  some 50 Palestinian union and labor leaders from the occupied  territories. The meeting touched on all aspects of labor such as  legislation, as well as laws and regulations dealing with social  security, health security, shop safety, the work environment,  labor unions and their role, labor education, and the right to  organize. The forum also touched on the Palestinian economy and  its components, unemployment in Palestine and how to deal with  it, and the impetus for the Palestinian labor force and ways of  stimulating it." He added that the meeting was worthwhile in  that it enables Palestinian labor leaders to carry out their  future responsibilities and help build the Palestinian state.    He said that the Arab Labor Organization's plan for 1994/95  involves programmed activities as an initial step to benefit the  parties to production in Palestine. He said that the  Organization's specialized experts drafted a Palestinian labor  law, which was submitted to Palestinian authorities for their  review and comments before the Organization puts it in its final  form.    Bakr Mahmud Rasul criticized the extent of Arab commitment  to  joint Arab labor agreements and said that "since its inception  and until its last meeting in Amman last year, the Organization  has been able to reach and ratify 14 Arab labor agreements  dealing with such issues as transport of Arab labor, protection  for women and minors, vocational training, labor culture, union  freedoms, guarantees, and social security. Even though all these  agreements underwent lengthy procedures, and even though they  were passed unanimously with no reservations by any party, the  rate of approval that would commit a state to an agreement  remains low. Some Arab countries have ratified no Arab labor  agreement at all. Other countries, even though they are founding  members of the Organization, have ratified only one or two  agreements. A third group of countries ratified the agreements,  but took positions that proved contradictory to their  provisions. He added that commitment to the agreements is a  matter of moral, cultural, and national obligation.    Bakr Rasul said that the agenda of the upcoming Cairo  session  to be held early next April, involves discussion of the  secretary general's report, in which he debates the subject of  small industries and traditional crafts. This matter is of  special interest because it is closely linked to the social and  economic changes taking place in most of the Arab states as a  result of economic restructuring that impacts employment and the  war on unemployment as well as the optimum utilization of  natural, technical, and human resources. Another important item  on the upcoming meeting's agenda deals with economic reform  programs and restructuring and their impact on labor issues.    The agenda also includes items on union freedoms and rights  in the Arab nations and the ratification of the Arab plan of  action at the 81st session of the International Labor Congress  scheduled for Geneva next June.</p>

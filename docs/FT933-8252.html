			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Credit terms too favourable Sir, Readers may have been surprised by the revelations on discounting contained in the Winkler marketing survey ('Watch those freebies', 10 August). But those findings are likely to represent only part of the picture. In the work that my organisation does with companies on their trade receivables I have been surprised by the extent to which extended credit terms have been granted - often, as with discounting, in the belief that such terms are a precondition of remaining competitive. I refer not to the late payment of debt but to the formal sanctioning of credit periods of double or more the supplier's preferred terms. Such terms can be especially attractive within the organisation as, unlike most forms of direct discounting, the impact is often not measured as a cost of sale and is therefore more readily perceived as a no-cost option by those who grant it. Looking at these activities in the context of your editorial of the same day ('Profits please') perhaps managements and leader writers should remember that it is not government or wage bargainers who are the prime determinators of profits and margins.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Structural Policy: Cohesion Fund </F> Projects Approved for Portugal''; as released by Brussels  Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] Portuguese water treatment and road building  projects worth 79.6 million Ecus were approved by the EC Budget  Commissioner, Peter Schmidhuber, on October 21. The money falls  under the Community's Cohesion Financial Instrument, an interim  measure in place until the beginning of November, when the  Maastricht Treaty and its Cohesion Fund legislation are due to  come into force. Of the six projects approved, four are to treat  or supply water while the others are road projects linked to  plans for the Trans European Networks.    The latest Cohesion Fund projects for Portugal, all of which  will receive 85% EC funding of their total costs, come after the  European Commission approved a first batch on July 29. The  largest of the environmental projects, due to attract 21.6 mEcus  [million ECU] from the Community, involves the building of three  plants, at Gondar, Rabada and Agra, to treat industrial and  domestic waste water in the Ave river basin. A second, due for  5.1 mEcus EC aid, is to improve water supplies to most of the  towns in the Barlavento (Algarve). EC funds of 4.6 mEcus will go  toward an upgrade of water treatment capacity at the ETA  Asseiceira while a further 11.4 mEcus will part-fund water  supply projects to places including Vila Nova da Barquinha and  ConstEncia.    Cohesion Funds are intended to help Greece, Spain, Portugal  and Ireland, the Community's poorest countries, to improve their  transport and environmental infrastructure as a means to bring  their economies closer to the convergence criteria required for  European Economic and Monetary Union. This year, the first in  the seven-year programme, available funds total 1.565 billion  Ecus, of which Portugal is to get a 16-20% share. The aid  is in  addition to that granted under the Community's Structural Fund  programmes.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Arjo Wiggins cuts dividend by 19% ARJO Wiggins Appleton, the troubled Franco-British paper group, unexpectedly cut its dividend yesterday by 19 per cent from 3.3p per share to 2.65p. The group's shares fell 29 per cent from 182p to 129p. Profits before tax for the first six months to June 30, fell 26 per cent from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 99.1m, although they were in line with expectations. Earnings per share fell from 10.7p to 7.5p. Operating profits were Pounds 112.4m against Pounds 146.1m a year ago as the company struggled in difficult trading conditions. Group turnover was Pounds 1.30bn compared with Pounds 1.26bn for the same period last year. Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the results were far better than those of its competitors. The fall in profits had been almost entirely attributable to the weak European market, he said. Mr Tony Isaacs, finance director, said most of the problems were in the European carbonless paper and coated paper markets. Results in the carbonless sector remained poor, with capacity utilisation of only 85 per cent to 88 per cent. Prices had fallen about 20 per cent over the past two years. The coated market was continuing to grow fast, but new capacity had come on stream, forcing operating rates down to about 85 per cent and prices down about 10 per cent. The company was also hit by the dollar's fall which affected earnings from the US Appleton operations. The company lost about Pounds 3m for each 10 cents the dollar lost, he said. Mr Stenham said the outlook was grey for the balance of the year and 1993. Gearing, which began the year at 13 per cent, would more than double by the end of 1992. The company is a third of the way through a Dollars 170m paper investment in the US. The group was still looking for two British board members to replace Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, who resigned, and Mr Ian Kennedy who retired, said Mr Stenham. One replacement was likely to be British, while the other might be American or a non-French continental European. Mr Stephen Walls, the former British chief executive, was replaced this summer by Mr Alain Soulas, formerly chief executive of Saint-Gobain's paper division. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 40</p>

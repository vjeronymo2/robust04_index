Policies and Guidelines for Renewals of Existing Grantees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the Corporation anticipates renewing grants for existing programs that meet quality standards. Renewal funding will not be automatic. Decisions will be based on two factors: progress to date (80%) and future plans (20%). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Information on progress to date will be collected primarily through the semi-annual progress report (quarterly report for demonstration programs) and secondarily through other methods, that include informal monitoring, contact with program personnel and site visits. Progress reports will include the following information, which translate into criteria for renewal decisions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Number of participants: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The degree to which recruitment goals have been met. The amount of attrition observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Service and learning activities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The quality of service placements. The degree to which activities are well-supervised, well-suited to participants' skill and training, and designed to achieve demonstrable impacts on community needs. The quality of reflection activities. The clarity of learning objectives associated with these activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Implementation: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The extent to which high-quality program staff have been recruited, selected, trained, and placed. The degree to which the program is following its timeline and implementation plan. The reasonableness of explanations for deviations from or adjustments to the timeline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Progress toward objectives: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The degree to which there is quantitative or other evidence of progress toward approved objectives related to community, participants, and institutional impacts. The degree to which the program has developed a system to collect data and demonstrate outcomes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Progress toward sustainability: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The degree to which the program has explored alternative sources of funding and built stronger institutional and community support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Important findings from internal evaluation and monitoring: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The reliability of mechanisms for feedback and continuous improvement. The degree to which participants, service beneficiaries, and partners are satisfied with the program. The extent to which the program has identified problems, areas for improvement, or lessons learned, and taken appropriate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Financial management and match: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The extent to which the match has been raised. The extent to which a fundraising plan has been developed. The extent to which quarterly financial reports and up-to-date records of line-item expenditures show balanced and appropriate spending across program areas. The reasonableness of explanations for unusually low or high expenditures in particular budget lines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. In addition, in making renewal decisions, the Corporation will take into account grantees' responsiveness to inquiries and requests from program staff and their timeliness in notifying program staff of major problems in implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Information on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> future plans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be collected through a brief application for renewal funding. Proposals should build on progress in the previous year, reflecting lessons learned and actions that correct weakenesses. The information will include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Clear outcome objectives for the next year, consistent with objectives for the current year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Next year's activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Implementation plan and timeline, reflecting lessons learned from the current year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. An update on expenditures and obligations under the current grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Next year's budget with detailed narrative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, first-year programs (non-demonstration) may apply for 90 percent of their current grant amounts. Second-year programs may apply for 80 percent of their current grant amounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POCKETS OF THE PAST  </P> <P> They are remnants of a bygone Orange County, pockets of the past on a landscape  grown increasingly urban. A gas station in Orange built when Packards and  Duesenbergs ruled the road. A one-room schoolhouse in El Toro. A historic San  Juan Capistrano neighborhood with homes dating back to the time of mission  founder Father Junipero Serra. Like a mom and pop grocery store in a  supermarket age or a two-chair barber shop in an era of trendy hair-styling  salons, these settings hearken back to a simpler time before orange groves and  bean fields gave way to crowded freeways and look-alike housing tracts. Their  survival amid dramatic change is somehow reassuring. And, like rummaging  through an attic and discovering a dusty old family photo album, stumbling upon  one of these relics of the county's colorful past invites a pause to reflect on  times gone by.  </P></p>

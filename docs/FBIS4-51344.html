			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- In a clear move to  enhance its role as a central bank, the People's Bank of China  (PBC) will publish its national financial and economic forecast  for the first time since its establishment in 1984.    "China Financial Outlook", serving as PBC's annual forecast  for 1994, features articles, charts and tables of figures.    The forecast anticipates that, by the end of July, the  Central Bank will be able to withdraw the new banknotes put into  circulation during the first half of this year.    It also predicts that personal savings in Chinese banks in  1994 will total more than 400 billion yuan.    To ensure smooth economic development, "China Financial  Outlook" recommends that the bank continue to adopt a tight  monetary policy.    "We are generally satisfied with the book as we've tried our  best to present a true picture of the country's financial  landscape in 1994," said Xie Ping, a leading PBC researcher and  writer of "a preview of China's financial situation in 1994",  one of the two keynote articles in the book.    According to him, analysis and forecasts are also made in  areas of investment, prices, foreign trade, financial markets,  and international current accounting.    The book's intensive focus on the Central Bank's monetary  policy for this year is intended to make it better understood  and accepted, especially by departments and local leaders.    "It is time that the Central Bank's voice should be heard,  and its views heeded and shared," said Xie, adding that sensible  enterprises will readjust their strategies in line with Central  Bank signals.    This will in turn contribute to the successful  implementation  of the monetary policy, noted Xie.    The book will come out in late July and will most likely  become the Central Bank's model for future annual forecasts.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Signals differ in Bonn and Frankfurt THE German government yesterday issued its gloomiest 1993 economic forecast to date as the Bundesbank shrugged off warnings of lasting recession, either at home or abroad. International growth this year would be modest, especially in the G7 countries, but there was no threat of collapse, according to Mr Otmar Issing, who is a leading member of the central bank's directorate. Recovery in the US was already showing signs of robustness, he said in an interview. However, the German Economics Ministry warned at the same time that 'a painful, long-lasting recession' in Germany could be avoided only if pay and public spending were controlled sufficiently to allow the central bank to cut interest rates. Downgrading its forecasts, the ministry said gross domestic product in the west would shrink this year by around 1 per cent, after growing overall by a real 1.5 per cent in 1992. Mr Issing acknowledged the domestic economy's fading fortunes, but said short-term growth prospects were not decisive. 'What matters is whether, after weak first and second quarters, we move into an upswing in conditions which make recovery sustainable. We do not need a short burst of activity but stable and lasting growth,' he added. Mr Issing's comments underlined Bundesbank hardliners' determination to maintain tight control over monetary policy despite some indications of wavering among other central council members. It is understood that regional members, worried by the domestic economic situation and unemployment in particular, failed by only the narrowest voting margin to force cuts in key Lombard and discount rates at the council's last meeting on January 7. 'We view the threatening increase in unemployment with great concern,' Mr Issing said. 'On the other hand the Bundesbank is guided primarily by monetary developments.' Anyone who said inflation was no longer a problem had found acceptable rates of price increases which did not tally with the Bundesbank's legal obligations to maintain stability, he said. Mr Issing's remarks on recession also appeared to be intended to help counter the slump in business and popular confidence within Germany and pre-empt possible interest rate speculation before Thursday's meeting of the bank council. There was little reason to fear self-perpetuating recession in Germany, Mr Issing claimed. The country had successfully avoided the danger of asset inflation through 'excessive developments' in the construction sector. 'This means there are no grounds for concern that Germany will take a relatively long time (as in other G7 countries) to find the basis for an upswing,' he added.</p>

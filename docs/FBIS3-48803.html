			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has firmed up the outline of a new  package of stimulus measures in an attempt to pull Japan out of  the prolonged recession. In the new package of stimulus  measures, the government plans to add approximately 2.9 trillion  yen for general public works projects and other public works  projects to be implemented by the Japan Highway Public  Corporation, while asking local governments to increase budgets  for their own public works projects. The Finance Ministry and  the Construction Ministry have entered the final stages of  coordinating a plan to increase the number of houses eligible  for loans from the Housing Loan Corporation to about 60,000. A  set of financial measures to help small- and medium-sized  enterprises will be incorporated in the new pump-priming package  and the size of public investments and loans will amount to  nearly 9 trillion yen. The new pump-priming package, if income  tax and residential taxes are cut drastically, will be the  largest ever, far exceeding the 1993 April pump-priming package  of 13.2 trillion yen. The government intends to put Japan's  economy on track toward recovery with the new package of  stimulus measures, and to raise the real growth rate by 2  percent in 1994.    With the package of political reform bills rejected in the  House of Councillors, it remains uncertain when the government  will compile the new pump-priming package, and there is a  possibility the government will formally decide on the new  package in February. The government plans to submit the third  supplementary budget bill to the Diet when its ordinary session  is convened after deciding on the new pump-priming package, but  the government's plan will be affected largely by the political  situation which is reeling from disputes over political reform.    The pillar of the new package of stimulus measures is the  addition of public investments. In public works projects to be  implemented by the central government and public corporations, a  substantial amount of the budget will be allocated for  life-style-related projects aimed at upgrading current sewage  systems and other things in line with the Hosokawa government's  policy of improving the "quality of life" for the people. In  the new package of stimulus measures, 600-700 billion yen will  be additionally allocated as the so-called facility budget for  research and development institutes in universities and welfare  and medical facilities, but there is a possibility the budget  will be further increased. The government will issue  construction bonds to secure necessary financial resources.    The government, that is now studying ways to set aside about  200-300 billion yen in the package for public works projects and  the project of upgrading sewage systems to be implemented by  local governments, plans to ask local governments to submit  their respective supplementary budgets to their assemblies in  March this year.    A plan is being coordinated within the government to  allocate  approximately 600 billion yen to the central government and the  Housing and Urban Development Corporation, and 1.5 trillion yen  to local governments to help them buy land for public works  projects. Approximately 500 billion yen will be allocated to  private urban development organizations to help them buy land.    The number of houses eligible for loans from the Housing  Loan  Corporation will be increased to about 60,000, and the amount of  the loan will be raised to 1 trillion yen. 1.3 trillion yen  will be set aside for loans by the Small Business Finance  Corporation and other government-invested finance corporations  to small- and medium-sized businesses. The new package of  stimulus measures will include approximately 11 billion yen as  subsidies for job-creating projects. The package will also  incorporate deregulation, steps to expand Japan's imports, and  the flexible management of monetary policy.    In the package, the government will include tax incentives  to  spur stalled land transactions and provide financial help to  small- and medium-sized enterprises, but the focal point of  contention is income tax reduction. A proposal is presently  surfacing for cutting both income tax and residential tax by 6-7  trillion yen. In a bid to secure necessary financial resources,  the Finance Ministry is asking that income tax and consumption  tax be respectively cut and raised. Coordination will be  completed after the political reform bills are settled.    The third supplementary budget is supposed to ensure the  continuity of government-financed projects from 1993 to 1994 in  light of the present situation where the government has to rely  on a provisional budget because of a delay in the parliamentary  deliberations for the budget bill for fiscal 1994. The  government intends to back up the economy with this budgetary  arrangement and put the Japanese economy on-track with annual  three-percent growth in the latter half of 1994 when cuts in  income tax begin to spur the economy.</p>

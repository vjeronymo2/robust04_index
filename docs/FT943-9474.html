			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Fimbra to fine managers Pounds 25,000 Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, is to announce today that it is fining Bankhall Investment Management Pounds 25,000 over a dispute with Clerical Medical International involving the transfer of Pounds 20m to a bank in Cyprus, Alison Smith writes. The fine is among the largest Fimbra has imposed, and the company will also have to pay substantial costs, thought to amount to Pounds 40,000. Two directors of the company were suspended but have now been reinstated. Bankhall, one of the UK's largest broker fund managers, said the charges had related to 'an isolated incident'.</p>

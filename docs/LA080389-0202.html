			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JESSE JACKSON SETS UP D.C. BASE  </P> <P> Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson switched his voting registration from  Chicago to Washington today but was coy about whether he will run for mayor of  the nation's capital against incumbent Marion Barry.  </P> <P> Asked if registration was a step toward running for mayor next year, the  47-year-old minister joked, "This is just a few feet away from the White  House."  </P> <P> Jackson, who has never held public office but finished second to Michael S.  Dukakis in a crowded field seeking the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination,  moved his legal residence here over the weekend from his longtime Chicago base,  which would make him eligible if he decides to seek office here in 1990.  </P></p>

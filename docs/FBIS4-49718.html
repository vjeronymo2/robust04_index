			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, May 9 (CNS) -- Shenzhen is seeing an  annual increase in spending on its water supply system, put at  RMB [Renminbi] 480 million for this year for a water resources  project, water supply work and a water treatment plant. The  amount of capital involved is over 100 percent up over last  year, an historical record for the input of capital into the  water supply system.    Shenzhen and its adjacent city of Hong Kong suffer from a  water shortage while China as a whole is a country short of  water. Shenzhen has in recent years seen rapid economic  development. A sharp rise in its population has resulted in an  unbalance of supply and demand of water. According to the water  supply programme for the municipality, the year-round general  demand for water by the year 2000 will be 1.62 billion cubic  metres. The water for the present annual demand is about one  billion cubic metres while the supply of water is much less than  the demand, making Shenzhen one of the seven cities suffering  the most serious water shortage across the country.    The municipality established a water bureau responsible for  planning for the water supply. According to the plan, Shenzhen  will carry out work on three networks for the water supply in a  bid to develop a unified water supply system across the  municipality. The entire project needs a total input of between  RMB 4 billion and RMB 5 billion.    Shenzhen has spent a sum of money on the building up of its  water supply system in the past three years. The input of  capital into water resources was put at RMB 100 million in 1992  and RMB 200 million in 1993. The water resources project this  year will cost RMB 140 million while the water supply work and  the water treatment plant will see a gross input of RMB 340  million.    A number of water conservancy projects either newly set up  or  expanded have been carried out in the last three years. They  include expansion ofthe Meilin Reservoir, a water diversion  project and work on the Meilin water plant.    Shenzhen has so far made the Shenzhen Reservoir as its main  source of water supply supported by the Tiegang Reservoir and  the Xiuli Reservoir. The Meilin Reservoir will play a role in  balancing the water supply network across the municipality.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / China's golden era 'to last well into next century': But while industrial progress is rapid, the way ahead is fraught with problems Prof Li Jingwen's splendid vision of China for the next two decades is for a 'golden era of industrial revolution' which began 15 years ago and is likely to last well into the next century. But the 50,000-character study, prepared by China's prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under Prof Li's direction, makes it clear that, while the country is industrialising rapidly, the path ahead is also fraught with difficulties. China's main problem in achieving an enormously complex transition to a modern industrialised state is managing its vast, unwieldy population which is literally 'on the move'. A huge displacement of surplus rural labour poses perhaps the greatest threat to public order. Beijing is also under enormous pressure to find jobs for a sea of unemployed peasants and urban youth. 'At present China has more than 100m surplus farm labourers, and every year another 15m are added,' said Prof Li. If China was to absorb its unemployed there was no choice but to maintain high rates of growth. Prof Li, who is director of the Institute of Qualitative and Technical Economics, said his team had focused not so much on statistics in its study, but on discerning trends in society in the next two decades. Among the academy's conclusions are: China would remain a developing a country, but an increasing number of Chinese would become middle-income earners like their counterparts in South Korea and Taiwan; Chinese savings rates at a forecast 34 per cent would remain high to the year 2010; Expenditure on 'non-food' items such as consumer durables would continue to grow, relative to spending on staple commodities; A wave of small towns and county centres would be established in the Chinese countryside by the end of this century; China would be obliged to grapple with increasing problems of an 'ageing' population from the year 2000; The trend towards smaller families would continue and divorce rates would rise; China's rapid economic development, averaging 8.25 per cent annually to 2010, would be fuelled by continuing high rates of consumption and investment; Heavy industry, including petrochemicals, would grow faster than light industry and after that, service industries, including finance, would show the swiftest growth; Foreign investment would continue to pour into China, with a trend towards larger projects involving 'multinationals', as the benefits of the country's huge domestic market became more apparent; China's exports would reach Dollars 435.7bn (Pounds 290bn) in 2010, a quadrupling of the figure expected this year. In urging strong measures to ensure orderly and sustained economic growth, the study called for a strengthening of reforms of the taxation system to increase revenues; an increase in interest rates to re-direct funds to more productive sectors; further rationalisation of faltering state-owned enterprises, and measures to prevent the outflow of capital. The study, pointedly, devotes a chapter to environmental pressures, which are looming as perhaps the most worrying consequence of China's continuing 'double digit' economic growth of 13 per cent in the past two years. Prof Li said China was 'backward' in protecting its environment and huge investment was required. 'Although the central government is doing a great deal to improve environmental consciousness, it has met a lot of resistance at the grass roots.' The study forecast that for a 'relatively long period' the gap between coastal and inland regions would 'grow larger'. But it also predicted that six distinct economic regions would emerge in China. These were: A south China economic sphere, with Guangzhou at its centre, and linked with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao; A Yangtze economic sphere focused on Shanghai; A Bohai rim centred on Beijing and Tianjin; A north-east sphere based on Harbin; North-west China bordering Central Asia; A south-west region with Kunming at it focus and linked with south-east Asia. Prof Li said the academy was particularly concerned about the widening gap between rich and poor. 'We have urged the government to take drastic measures to resist this trend which is threatening to destroy the stability of society,' he added. 1991-2010: Policy Choices of China's Economic Development - Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 1994</p>

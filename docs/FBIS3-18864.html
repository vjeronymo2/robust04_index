			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "Government and `No' Side in </F> Agreement"]    [Text] The referendum on EU [European Union] membership  could be held as early as Sunday, 19 June. This is the most  likely date at present. The alternative would be to wait until  March 1995, but this would jeopardize the whole process of  accession to the EU.    This emerged after Saturday's [5 March] meeting between  Prime  Minister Bildt and the leaders of the No to the EU campaigns.  Boths sides were very satisfied with the atmosphere at the  meeting and the exchange of views.    No to the EU would prefer a short campaign with a vote in  June.    "We do not believe that the Swedish people have the same  burning interest as we do. It is also an issue of democracy, if  people do not have the energy to involve themselves in the  debate," Eva-Britt Svensson from No to the EU said, disagreeing  with those who want to wait until later.    Sten Johansson from Social Democrats against the EU prefers  19 June or March 1995 to the party line of 27 November. A June  vote would also halt the planned Social Democratic congress on  the EU on 18-19 June that he calls a "propaganda stunt."    Up to this time, the Moderate Coalition Party's position has  been 18 September -- the same day as the general election -- in  order to make the referendum binding after changes to the  Constitution. But as long ago as last fall the prime minister's  aides were talking about a vote in June, and Carl Bildt is  seeking a solution that all the parties and campaign leaderships  "can live with." At present most things point to 19 June.    The prime minister who met the party leaders last Friday  will  discuss the matter with them again on Thursday but does not  think that it will be possible to reach agreement. He was  cautious in his comments on Saturday, but it was clear that he  is not happy about Ingvar Carlsson's proposal of 27 November.    "You meet very very few people who think that November is a  good time. I have really only met one."    Carl Bildt and European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel  stressed that they have long been the only people who assumed  that there would be a full agreement with the EU on 1 March.  The Social Democrats did not expect an agreement before this  summer at the earliest or until after the election this fall.  In the new situation they and the other parties must have time  for "dialogue and reflection," at most up to the beginning of  April.    If it proves impossible to agree on 19 June as the date for  a  referendum, March 1995 appears to be the main alternative for a  number of domestic political reasons -- the election campaign,  the formation of a government, and the work on the budget. But  this would make the agreed date for EU entry -- 1 January 1995  -- impossible and would therefore require renegotiation with the  EU and this could wreck and halt the entry of all four countries.    The government and the no side have agreed on two voting  slips.    "Our demand was that there be a democratic and fair vote  involving two lines: yes or no to membership of the EU," said  Hans Lindqvist from No to the EU.    "The one alternative is yes to membership as it is defined  in  the agreement, the other is no," Carl Bildt said. If the  Swedish people say no he does not think that there will be a new  referendum on a new agreement, as in Denmark after Maastricht:    "That possibility does not exist; the agreement is between  us  and 12 other countries. Regardless what sort of somersaults  Swedish politicians might be willing to do, 12 other governments  would never agree. If there is a no to this agreement, this  will mean no to membership for the foreseeable future," Carl  Bildt said.    The government will make information available to the public  and each side could receive around 25 million kronor for its  campaign.</p>

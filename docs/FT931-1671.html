			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Allianz Finance equity-linked paper raises DM950m ALLIANZ Finance, part of the Allianz insurance group of Germany, yesterday raised DM950m through one of the last equity-linked warrant Eurobonds likely to emerge from the German corporate sector for some time. Allianz was one of the few remaining German companies which still had authorisation from its shareholders to raise equity-linked financing without offering shareholders pre-emptive rights. In recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further authorisations at annual meetings due to growing shareholder opposition. Veba, the large German utility, had been in a similar situation earlier this month. It raised Dollars 300m through a seven-year Eurobond issue with equity warrants Allianz's authorised but unissued capital used to back its five-year issue was due to expire later this year. Linde, the German fork-lift truck manufacturer, is believed to be the last German company which still has authorised but unissued capital at its disposal. An official at lead-manager Dresdner Bank said demand for Allianz's bonds was such that they rose as high as 125 bid at one stage from an issue price of 124, in spite of the uncertainty weighing on the German equity and bond markets. The bonds later came back slightly to trade just above their issue price, while the warrants were quoted at DM44 bid and the ex-bonds were quoted at 99.80 bid. The dilution on Allianz's earnings when the warrants are converted into shares is a marginal 3 per cent, and the funds raised from the issue are for Allianz's general financing purposes. Elsewhere, borrowers continued to tap the Canadian dollar market to take advantage of the attractive arbitrage opportunities on offer in the five-year area of the yield curve. The Kingdom of Norway raised CDollars 500m through a 5 1/2 -year Eurobond issue. The bonds were priced to yield 52 basis points above the 6 1/4 per cent Canadian government bond due February 1998, at the higher end of the indicated range of 50-52 basis points. Some syndicate managers said the pricing on Norway's bonds was on the tight side but an official at the joint lead manager, IBJ, said that the pricing was fair and reflected the fact that the borrower was a sovereign which only launched large issues once in a while. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was little changed. Eurofima, the European rolling stock financing company based in Basle, launched a CDollars 125m five-year Eurobond issue priced to yield 42 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds. The pricing took into account Eurofima's triple-A rating and its popularity with retail investors on the continent, an official at the lead manager Goldman Sachs said. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly. The spreads on Norway's and Eurofima's issues were well inside the 73 basis points offered on Ontario Hydro's CDollars 1.5bn five-year global bond issue which was launched on Monday. The tighter pricing reflected the smaller amounts being raised, the borrowers' superior credit ratings and the fact that they do not tap the international bond market as frequently as Ontario Hydro. Yesterday's issues were said to be have been swapped into other currencies. Syndicate managers are advising borrowers wanting to raise Canadian dollars to hold off until the supply has been absorbed by the market. They added that the arbitrage opportunities might be too hard for them to resist.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt am Main (DDP/ADN) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expecting written confirmation  today of North Korea's withdrawal from the organization, IAEA  spokesman David Kyd said on Hessischer Rundfunk radio today. At  the same time, Kyd contradicted reports over the past few days  that North Korea had threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. "North Korea has not done that," Kyd  stressed.    North Korea has been in a grey area after it announced in  1993 that it would leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but  then withdrew this application at the last minute. "They are  neither a member nor a nonmember of the treaty, but the  community of nations considers North Korea still to be a  member." Now we are concerned only with how the country will  react in the future, he said.    As things stand, it does not appear that North Korea wants  to  sell material suitable for the production of nuclear weapons,  Kyd said, but they had to continue to follow developments.  Despite reports from the secret services, it is still not clear  whether North Korea has nuclear bombs. The only thing they are  certain of is that the country has more plutonium in its  possession than it officially admitted to, Kyd said.</p>

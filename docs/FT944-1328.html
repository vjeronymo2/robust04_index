			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / ANC members back leaders and policy South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, his first deputy Mr Thabo Mbeki, and African National Congress secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa were yesterday elected unopposed to the ANC's top three offices on the second-last day of its triennial conference. Delegates affirmed support for the government, especially in economic policy. In elections for the party's six top offices, Mr Mandela was re-elected party president. Mr Mbeki's position as heir-apparent was confirmed when he became deputy president. Mr Ramaphosa kept his post; his former deputy, Mr Jacob Zuma, took over from Mr Mbeki as national chairperson. Ms Cheryl Carolus, ANC policy head, became deputy secretary-general and the Rev. Arnold Stofile, the party's parliamentary chief whip, was elected treasurer-general. The election of Mr Zuma, the party leader in KwaZulu-Natal Province and highest-ranking Zulu in the mainly Xhosa leadership, and Ms Carolus, who is a 'Coloured', both by wide margins, marked a victory for Mr Mandela, who was anxious the party affirm its non-racial and non-sexist credentials by electing a more broadly representative leadership. The conference rejected a plan by the president that this process be artificially extended to the 60 party members due to be elected to the party's national executive today, by allocating nominations according to ethnic origin, gender and region. Many delegates acknowledged widespread grassroots frustration over the slow delivery on the ANC's election promises, but official reports to the conference by 11 policy commissions broadly endorsed the government's performance to date. To the surprise of some senior party members, the government's conservative economic policies won strong support. Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, said government officials in the commission examining the economy were taken aback by the acceptance at all levels of the need for fiscal discipline and sound economic management. 'I was amazed at the degree of consensus. I had anticipated extensive debate, but it wasn't nearly as sharp as I expected,' Mr Manuel said. The principle of privatising unproductive state assets was generally accepted. The commission resolved that any proceeds from such sales should be used only for retiring state debt, not current expenditure. The commission recommended tighter government spending curbs, a campaign to encourage tax evaders to start paying, and the formation of a permanent ANC Economic Commission to monitor progress. Resolutions were adopted urging an investigation into the viability of a national health insurance scheme, and the introduction of incentive schemes for foreign investors provided they did not interfere with workers' rights.</p>

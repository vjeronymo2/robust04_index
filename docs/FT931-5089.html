			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Maxwell pensioners deserve security without further delay Sir, Your report on the Serious Fraud Office's effectively stopping the select committee's investigation into the Maxwell pensions scandal ('Maxwell pensioners suffer setback', February 27) highlights the frustration and mental anguish the pensioners have been suffering for more than a year. The slow process of criminal justice for the few is hampering moral justice for 20,000. The select committee chairman, Frank Field, says his inquiries will continue after relevant criminal proceedings have been completed. Best estimates are that the Maxwell trials will not even begin before the end of next year. The Maxwell pensioners have claimed that the cause of their dilemma is inadequate protection of pension investment under the Finance Services Act and lack of proper delegation of regulatory powers by the Department of Trade and Industry to the lnvestment Management Regulatory Organisation. The report on lMRO's actions in relation to Maxwell pension funds was promised by the Securities and Investments Board to Maxwell pensioners early last year. Fortuitously for some, it was not produced until after the arrest of the Maxwells in June. The report immediately became sub judice, destroying at a stroke the pensioners opportunity to prove quickly their case for compensation. When the report finally surfaces for Mr Field's committee to resume its investigations it will be useless to many pensioners. By then several hundred will have died. The human dimension of the misery of the Maxwell pensioners makes this a City and political scandal that will not go away. With regulation as it now stands, it could be argued that anyone investing in a pension scheme should insure it against fraud, as they would insure their home against fire. The government should act now to first give long-term security to the Maxwell victims and then quickly to implement change in an effort to give pensions back the image of security they once enjoyed.

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financial sector depresses Nordic bourses THE FIRST anniversary of the putsch in the former Soviet Union saw bourses in relatively quiet mood, writes Our Markets Staff, perhaps awaiting the German M3 figures which are expected to follow today's Bundesbank meeting. On that day a year ago, the FT-SE Eurotrack index dropped 7.3 per cent. Yesterday, it closed slightly lower than it did then. Nordic markets were depressed by the slow erosion of the Scandinavian financial sector. The suspension of payments by the insurer, Hafnia, left COPENHAGEN's CSE index 3.24 lower at 292.85, and within that Den Danske Bank DKr10 lower at DKr324. STOCKHOLM dropped 1.3 per cent, the Affarsvarlden general index ending 10.9 down at 797.4, led by the financial and banking sector which registered a 3.2 per cent fall. There were rumours, later denied, that S-E-Banken might be the next in line for government handouts. S-E-Banken dropped SKr1 or 5.1 per cent to SKr18.50, a 12-month low. OSLO fell 2.6 per cent as Den norske Bank and Uni Storebrand ended NKr1.1 down at NKr3.2, and NKr2.1 lower at NKr15.9 respectively, both at new lows, and the all-share index tumbled 9.06 to 336.63. HELSINKI's bank and finance house index lost another 3.5 per cent as the Hex index closed just 1.8 lower at 648.7. FRANKFURT was dominated by derivatives trading ahead of Friday's close of August calls and puts on the DTB. After Tuesday's disturbing Mannesmann interim report, there was also some serious questioning of companies whose results could be disappointing. Turnover rose from DM3.9bn to DM4.5bn as the DAX index fell 8.50 to 1,524.72, another low for the year. Within that, carmakers were generally weak with Volkswagen down DM7.50 to DM325.50; Metallgesellschaft dropped DM11 to DM314; MAN, and Mannesmann shed another DM7.40 to DM286.20, and DM4 to DM234.20 respectively; and Viag fell DM9.30 to DM338.50. July German car registration figures, and progress reports from Daimler and Volkswagen are expected next week. MAN has been dropping on both fundamental and technical considerations, said Mr Matthias Welticke at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, with worries about its truck and printing machine divisions and a previous 'bottom' of DM310 for the stock well and truly breached. While Metallgesellschaft is viewed as a failed recovery stock, Mr Welticke thinks that Viag's results today will reflect that company's solid, energy utility base more than the problems in its aluminium, and chemicals offshoots. Lufthansa, meanwhile, stayed among the winners with a rise of DM3 to DM101. PARIS closed above the day's low but trading remained nervous ahead of the September referendum on Maastricht. The CAC 40 finished 2.51 lower at 1,734.21, but off its worst level of 1,722.40, in low turnover of FFr1.28bn. Euro Disney was the day's most prominent faller as sell orders from US investors, prompted by a sell note from Morgan Stanley, knocked the share price as low as FFr75 before a close FFr6.40, or 7.7 per cent lower at FFr76.60 in volume of 1m shares. L'Oreal rose FFr16 or 1.8 per cent to FFr929 on buying by a UK broker. AMSTERDAM closed firmer, on buying of index constituents from the European options exchange. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.2 to 111.90. Hunter Douglas remained weak following its poor interims on Tuesday, dropping Fl 8.80 or 15 per cent to Fl 47.20, a new 1992 low. ZURICH featured a 15 per cent drop in Adia bearers, down SFr33 at SFr182 on a newspaper report predicting that the employment agency group would make a loss in 1992. The SMI index, meanwhile, fell 12.9 to 1,775.7. MADRID saw a Pta35 fall to Pta2,475 in Repsol as the general index eased 0.39 to 208.27. The state-owned oil group said that it plans to go ahead with an international share placing, probably in the last quarter of this year, in spite of the present weakness in stock markets. VIENNA rose slightly but traders said the move was not convincing enough to shake the market out of its downtrend. The ATX index of 18 leading shares edged up 4.8 to 732.18 and the all-share Vienna bourse index rose 1.4 to 354.05. ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell for the third day, ending down 16.13 at 4,035.93.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 19  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1034.31  1035.34  1034.88  1033.01  1033.11  1033.57  1033.05  1033.91                 Day's High  1035.55    Day's Low  1032.36           Aug 18     Aug 17     Aug 14     Aug 13     Aug 12          1035.74     1045.00   1042.13   1 035.59    1037.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

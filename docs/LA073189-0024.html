			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said President  Bush has offered no substance to back up his professed commitment to civil  rights. He faulted Bush for supporting recent Supreme Court rulings opposed by  civil rights leaders, for failing to strengthen the Civil Rights Commission and  for lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs. Jackson assailed Bush's  nomination of black lawyer William Lucas to serve as the Justice Department's  chief civil rights advocate, saying Lucas lacked trial experience.  </P></p>

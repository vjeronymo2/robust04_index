			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Royal catalyst for social change: The Prince of Wales The Prince of Wales seemed until recently to have become rather quiet. Perhaps it was just the grey winter season when all that disturbed the flat landscape around Sandringham was the sound of royal guns and the dull thud of falling pheasants. But it would be unwise to think that because His Royal Highness is not always in the public eye nothing is happening. Now the spotlight of publicity is on the Prince of Wales again with the announcement at a reception at St James's Palace on Thursday of his own new Institute of Architecture. And there is a full programme of tours and speeches to come in 1992. Next week he will speak to heads of government at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Later this month, he and the Princess of Wales will travel to India on an official visit. The Prince will also continue his programme of exploratory visits to European cities during the year, including a special one to Expo '92 in Seville. No-one can accuse the Prince of Wales of being afraid to speak his mind. His speech on Thursday was a remarkable and heartfelt sermon. In fact, it was really a manifesto of his personal philosophy. It takes a brave man to discuss the state of the soul of the western world over champagne and canapes. What he has been accused of is overly-romantic attachments to the past. Others see him as a crank who is reputed to indulge in such unwholesome practices as dendrological conversation, not to mention the anatomically inexact science of contemplating one's own navel. There is some truth in these charges. He believes an important part of his role is to represent history. He has also held on to some 'alternative' or 'hippy' values which many of his generation experienced and have grown out of. But on Thursday he delivered a ruminative soul searching that very few public figures could get away with easily. The Prince's sincerity is not in doubt, but he and his staff take the risk that such personal pronouncements could be misinterpreted. It is often said that a constitutional monarchy should be a silent presence in the face of a complex political world. The Prince of Wales may share that view when he ascends the throne, but, in what will be a long interim period, he feels that there are useful areas where a royal word can help to further public debate. The fact that royal interventions in public affairs are comparatively rare does not deter him. The discreet silence of many of his forbears does not persuade him that he should necessarily follow their example. He sees his role clearly now as an informed catalyst, bringing people of all parties together for comprehensive discussion and shared learning. His Institute of Architecture inaugural speech reveals a great deal about his philosophy and his concerns for the future of the world. As he has grown older, it is clear that the Prince worries about the condition of men's souls. He is unhappy about how, historically, 'we were persuaded to see the cosmos as a gigantic machine which could be examined, experimented with, and manipulated by Man for his own exclusive use. Everything was explainable by science and anything that couldn't be explained simply didn't exist. 'In this scenario, Man himself becomes a mere mechanical object and any notion of a metaphysical reality disappears altogether. The sense of humanity's uniqueness as a microcosm of the whole Universe is thrown out of the window, to be replaced by an egocentric world view which denies that all-encompas-sing sense of the sacred and stresses the purely rational'. This is thoughtful and difficult stuff. But behind it lies more than just contemplative hours on the Scottish hills. There are solid and serious events that take place that often do not reach the pages of the newspapers. A recent Sandringham seminar on agriculture and the environment was not headline news. During the seminar, the European Commissioners for agriculture and the environment spent 24 hours in Norfolk with their officials. The European teams were matched by the presence of the UK secretaries of state for the environment and agriculture and their permanent secretaries. The Prince is an interventionist host who makes sure that discussions are positive and useful. He sees the danger of political megaphone diplomacy and feels that a shirtsleeve picnic around the log cabin on the Sandringham estate can initiate and reinforce personal contacts. Europe is an important area of concern for the future monarch and the Prince of Wales has made it clear that he recognises that the future of the UK lies firmly in Europe, despite the possible decline of UK sovereignty that that implies. On two recent visits to Hungary and Czechoslovakia, he celebrated the death of communism with speeches that showed that he feels Britain has a central role in reinforcing the common cultural ties that unite eastern and western Europe. Behind the scenes, the Prince has helped with scholarships for Polish doctors to visit Britain for study and research. The Prince and his advisers have been increasingly active in Europe. And the royal 'away days' now include as many European as British cities. In Paris, Madrid, Brussels and several German towns, groups of officials, businessmen and local authority officers have taken part in brief brainstorming sessions over meals. The pattern is for the Prince to take groups with him to indulge in what he calls his 'seeing is believing' tours. Besides architecture, subjects close to his heart include town planning, inner cities, waste management and environmental problems. There are few public figures able to charter the Royal Yacht and take it half way up the Amazon as a floating base for a conference of world business leaders on environmental and development problems. Last year's trip there was but a preparatory journey for some of the participants in the UN world conference on environment and development to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June. Although the Prince will not attend that gathering, he will be the keynote speaker at a meeting of the Brundtland Commission (the World Commission on Environment and Development named after the Norwegian prime minister, who inspired it) to be held in London in April. The Prince is in for a busy year. But his energies and programme are now focused on a few, specific, areas. He is learning how to define his role. After all, he could just play polo . . .</p>

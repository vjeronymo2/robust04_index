The increase, if decided, would be the first since fiscal  1986.    The government is also to consider raising the liquor tax,  the sources said.    They said the government's revenue shortfall is expected to  widen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as the consumption tax  on automobile purchases are expected to be lowered to 3.0  percent from the present 4.5 percent from April.    The tobacco tax now stands at 6.252 yen per cigarette.    A 1 yen increase in the tax would raise the government's  revenue by about 320 billion yen per year while the reduction in  the consumption tax on automobiles will decrease the revenue by  about 100 billion yen, the sources said.</p>

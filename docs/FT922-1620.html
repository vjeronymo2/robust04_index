			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (19): Urban danger signals - Trouble brews in the high-rise jungles WHEN riots broke out in Los Angeles this spring, President Mitterrand immediately laid the blame on America's lack of social legislation; such a thing could not happen in France, he implied in a French radio interview. Some people felt his remarks were tempting fate. Five years ago, the word 'ghetto' was used in France to describe an Anglo-Saxon problem; now it is everyday currency in the discussion of France's own problem, in deprived dormitory suburbs which combine poverty, crime and intense concentrations of ethnic minorities. The past two years have seen sporadic violent outbursts in big estates in the Lyon and Ile de France regions. Many more incidents have occurred than are generally reported, from Amiens in the north to Avignon in the south. Gangs of youngsters, who steal from cars and supermarkets, have been growing younger, with an increasing number aged under 13, when they cannot in law be charged. Crime figures for 1991 show an overall increase of 7 per cent, with the highest jump in the ill-favoured suburbs. Seine-Saint-Denis, for instance, suffered a rise of over 18 per cent. In the March regional elections, it was high-crime communes, where a sense of insecurity is most acute, that gave the National Front most votes. These developments are not new. But economic and social exclusion has become more acute with renewed high unemployment - nationally now 10 per cent, far higher in the poorer suburbs. Political attention was first focused on the social consequences of mass urbanisation in the early 1980s, when violent incidents erupted in the outskirts of Lyon. Since then, governments have made repeated attempts to get to grips with the urban problem, notably through the Developpement Social des Quartiers (DSQ), with its emphasis on multi-agency co-operation, backed by public funds. At first, it appeared that these social policies might be winning - until the riots which broke out in 1990, again in a suburb of Lyon. Events since 1990 have generated an accelerating sense of urgency, and pushed urban issues nearer the top of the government agenda. One result of so much attention has been a proliferation of policy initiative, each offering state assistance to encourage local communities or urban agglomerations to solve their own problems; a Minister of Urban Development was appointed to give these policies coherence, as well as to demonstrate political commitment. The first Urban Minister, Michel Delebarre, mayor of Dunkirk, secured a 33 per cent increase in Treasury funds devoted to urban renewal. But he suffered a serious setback in March, when he lost his power-base as president of the Pas-de-Calais region and he was moved sideways to another ministry. Even more damaging politically was the forced resignation in May of his successor, Mr Bernard Tapie, the Marseille industrialist and football chairman, because of imminent charges for embezzlement. Only days before, Mr Tapie had announced a sweeping new programme, to demolish and replace some of the most desolate concrete architecture, mobilise large private enterprises in the development of the troubled suburbs, and persuade local residents to help supervise and support the young. Not all commentators were convinced that such measures would meet the long-term needs of the most disadvantaged - for education, training, jobs, affordable housing and adequate public transport. The new Minister for Towns is Mr Francois Loncle, a former journalist and close political associate of the prime minister, Pierre Beregovoy. Mr Tapie's programme was the centre-piece in a wide government offensive, timed to precede the long summer school vacation. But other measures will go ahead, including programmes to provide sports and other activities for young people who cannot go away on holiday, as well as workshops and local building projects. This wider government initiative is centred on urban security. More police are being allocated to the priority estates, many of which have a population the size of a middling town, but no local police-station. Critics point out that law and order are being given higher priority, in view of the national assembly elections next spring. Opinion surveys suggest people in the worst-off estates are fed up with the constant threat of crime. Thirty years ago, France had to build cheap housing fast. The result was a proliferation of vast concrete estates which are now widely recognised as intolerable to live in. In the past decade, demolition and renovation of these estates has cost FFr60bn. This year's over-all budget devoted to urban renewal and security is more than FFr6.2bn. These are France's ghettos, and today France is picking up the tab.</p>

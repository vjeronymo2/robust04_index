			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Where there's a wheel there's a way - The latest move to resuscitate the Norton motorcycle business The production line at Norton, one of Britain's most famous motorcycle manufacturers, is silent. Beside it, a wrecked Norton Commander awaits repair - the victim of a Volvo which smashed through the fairing and severed the front wheel. Held upright by an overhead chain, the motorcycle resembles a half-eaten carcass with its mechanical organs exposed. Like the motorcycle, Norton itself has been crashed, almost written off and left in need of urgent repair. Ms Rozanda Skalbania, a director of Norton Motors (1993) - the new Canada-based owner - admits it will be an uphill struggle to revive the company. The workforce at the Shenstone plant near Lichfield has been cut from 270 in the early 1990s to just 22. Motorcycle production has ceased and the company is relying on service and repair contracts to pay the wages. 'We're going to have to expand,' says Ms Skalbania. 'It's taken a lot of goodwill by the workforce to keep it going this far.' The first stage in that expansion was announced this week when Wildrose, the Canadian investment vehicle which last October paid about CDollars 1m (Pounds 500,000) for Norton's name and assets, unveiled plans for a reverse takeover in the US. The takeover, giving Norton a listing on the US bulletin board in pink securities, is designed to help the company raise finance to restart production at Shenstone, launch a race team in North America and develop its rotary engine technology for new uses. The vision, however, is somewhat removed from reality. Although the Norton race team has enjoyed recent success, notably in the Isle of Man TT, Wildrose faces considerable obstacles in attracting investors. Those obstacles date back to the mid-1980s, when Mr Philippe Le Roux began a reign as chief executive which saw Norton embark on a disastrous expansion strategy. Mr Le Roux tried to sustain lossmaking motorcycle production by acquiring allegedly profitable companies. In 1988 Norton acquired Pro-Fit, a US piping business, for Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m), but it failed to produce the income expected. Then in 1990 it launched a bungled rights issue to acquire FUS, the German fasteners business, for Pounds 8.2m. The City turned its back on Norton when it emerged that the Pro-Fit acquisition was completed only when the company resorted to high cost loans. More controversially, inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry were called in when it was discovered that a company controlled by Mr Jimmy Tildesley, then Norton chairman, profited from the FUS transaction. Only 11.2 per cent of the shareholders took up the rights offer, leaving Mr Le Roux and his private company, Manstorm, with a Pounds 1.75m underwriting commitment which it could not meet. Mr Le Roux, who resigned after the DTI announced its inquiry, told the inspectors: 'I approached a Canadian firm called Ponderosa Investments run by Mr Nelson Skalbania, both on the amount we required and when I had difficulty covering my own obligation on that amount as well.' Mr Skalbania, Rozanda's father, did not oblige but his interest was aroused in Norton. Following Mr Le Roux's departure, he began to court the company in earnest. First he brokered Norton's 1992 disposal of FUS to Westgroup Corporation of Canada. The company, which cost Pounds 8.2m, was sold for Pounds 50,000 cash with DM17m (Pounds 6.6m) in liabilities. Then in January 1993 - shortly before the Serious Fraud Office began an ongoing investigation into Mr Le Roux's management - Mr Skalbania approached his successor, Mr David MacDonald, with an offer from Wildrose to buy the company. Mr MacDonald, who was appointed in 1991 at the insistence of disgruntled creditors, agreed to consider a transaction if Wildrose could demonstrate it had CDollars 4m in reserves and that no single shareholder would control more than 10 per cent of the company. This, he says, it failed to do. Concern mounted over Mr Skalbania's role when it emerged he was facing fraud, theft and forgery charges in Canada relating to a collapsed property deal. Hopes that Wildrose could offer Norton refinancing opportunities through the Alberta Stock Exchange were then dashed when the company was suspended for failing to provide documents on its proposed takeover. The affair culminated last September when Mr MacDonald resigned after accusing Wildrose of trying to buy Norton at a knock-down price without assuming any of its liabilities. He told creditors owed more than Pounds 7m, led by Midland Bank, that he could no longer protect the company. Having earlier disposed of Pro-Fit and FUS, the old Norton Group was wound up in October after Wildrose purchased the motorcycling interests. Concern that the CDollars 1m price paid for Norton was too low has been heightened by a Wildrose business plan which values the assets and ongoing business at Pounds 3.7m. Documents filed at Companies House, however, show that the takeover was not funded by Wildrose but by loans from two Dutch finance companies: Verfin and Waog of Amsterdam. Both these companies are thought to be linked to Mr Roberto Aquilini, a Skalbania business associate who controls 10 per cent of Norton and is listed as a director. Industry analysts fear that the loans and suspension of Wildrose on the Alberta exchange reflect a lack of working capital behind the company. Rozanda Skalbania, who is running Norton, is undaunted. Standing on the shop floor at Shenstone, she says: 'Working capital is coming. It arrives when we need it. It involves a lot of individuals who don't want their names mentioned.' The listing, she insists, will give the famous company the financial muscle to expand. Analysts are not so sure. One said yesterday: 'They are not in a position to build anything. The factory is in a terrible state. They couldn't produce a motorcycle even if they wanted to.'</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT FINDS QUAKE DANGERS AT FIRE STATIONS  </P> <P> More than one-third of Orange County's fire stations face the potential of  total or partial collapse in a severe earthquake, a disaster that could destroy  the capacity of many stations to function and endanger the lives of  firefighters, according to a consultant's study.  </P> <P> The survey has been under review this week by county officials. Some of its  findings, according to a county spokeswoman, will be included in a written  report detailing the status of Orange County earthquake preparedness, which is  to be sent to the Board of Supervisors on Monday.  </P> <P> Orange County Fire Chief Lawrence J. Holms said he was aware a study was under  way but did not know that it had been completed and was unaware of the  findings.  </P> <P> "As soon as we get the report, then we will evaluate the report and make  recommendations to ensure that our critical facilities are capable of  withstanding that type of emergency," Holms said. "We will do our best to make  sure we meet the needs of the public."  </P> <P> The survey, done by EQE Engineering in Costa Mesa, was presented to the  county's General Services Agency two months ago. The report does not state in  terms of magnitude how severe a quake would have to be to damage fire stations.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of nor have I seen the study," Orange County Board Chairman  Thomas F. Riley said. "This is very serious. Earthquakes are foremost in  everyone's minds. . . .  </P> <P> "I'm not going to comment. I think we've been asking people to report back to  us. I don't know what I can add to this."  </P> <P> The study of 42 fire stations in the county rated 15 as in "very high-risk" or  "high-risk" categories. These stations would suffer severe damage in an  earthquake, "possibly leading to partial or total collapse," according to the  report.  </P> <P> The fire stations in this group would be "very unlikely" to survive an  earthquake well enough to provide assistance in county rescue efforts, the  report says. Damage to the facilities would also present "possible life  hazards" to any firefighters in the stations when a serious earthquake struck.  </P> <P> Five of the most hazardous stations in this category were identified in another  study made public last week. That study, ordered under state law, required the  identification of those unreinforced masonry structures built before 1934. The  study done in August reviewed all 42 of the county's fire stations, regardless  of when they were built.  </P> <P> Another 20 fire stations would be at "moderate risk" in a serious earthquake,  according to the study, facing "substantial" damage that would hamper their  rescue efforts by their crews.  </P> <P> The most ominous warnings in the report did not focus on the structural hazards  of county fire stations, but instead on damage from equipment and other loose  objects that might topple in an earthquake. The review found Orange County fire  stations "typically at high risk" in this area.  </P> <P> "Non-structural damage can make it difficult or impossible to carry out the  functions normally performed by a facility and/or cause serious casualties,"  the report states. "For critical facilities such as fire stations, loss of  functionality may result in consequential loss of citizen lives."  </P> <P> Among the nonstructural dangers cited:  </P> <P> The garage doors on 16 fire stations were inadequately braced to withstand an  earthquake, and might jam shut under severe shaking.  </P> <P> Radio and dispatch equipment at "virtually all of the stations reviewed" was  insufficiently anchored and "vulnerable to even a moderate earthquake."  </P> <P> Compressed gas containers at 14 stations were not adequately secured to the  walls to ensure that they would not become "dangerous missiles" driven by  escaping gases, according to the report.  </P> <P> Martin W. Johnson, the EQE Engineering consultant who prepared the report, said  his firm had conducted a similar survey of San Francisco fire stations about a  year ago. San Francisco has moved aggressively to address the problems, he  said.  </P> <P> Johnson, who submitted his report to Orange County on Aug. 11, said he has not  kept track of the county's response.  </P> <P> "We weren't asked to recommend a timetable. . . ," Johnson said. He also noted  that Orange County's problems could be worse.  </P> <P> "The older (a city is) the more you find that it's vulnerable. In that regard,  compared to an older city like San Francisco, Orange County is probably  somewhat better off."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COUNTY FIRE STATIONS AT EARTHQUAKE RISK  </P> <P> Projected damage to Orange County Fire Department stations from a severe  earthquake:  </P> <P> Stations identified as very high risk  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 3, 16861 12th St., Sunset Beach  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 12, 8953 S. Walker St., Cypress  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 18 (Apparatus Room Building), 31242 Trabuco Canyon Road,  Trabuco  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 20., 8663 Orange-Olive Road, Olive  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 40, 23411 Via Pajaro, Coto de Caza  </P> <P> Stations identified as high risk:  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 15, 3202 Santiago Canyon Road, Orange  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 18 (Engine 318 Building), 31242 Trabuco Canyon Road, Trabuco  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 19 (Apparatus Room Building), 23033 El Toro Road, El Toro  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 19 (Dozer Storage Building), 23033 El Toro Road, El Toro  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 23, 5020 Santiago Blvd., Orange  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 29, 26111 Victoria Blvd., Capistrano Beach  </P> <P> Fire Station No. 34, 1530 N.

Critical equipment may be damaged beyond use. Response capability very  unlikely. Possible life hazards.  </P> <P> High risk -- Severe structural damage, possibly leading to partial collapse.  Critical equipment may be damaged. Response capability unlikely. Possible life  hazards.  </P> <P>  Source: EQE Engineering of Costa Mesa  </P></p>

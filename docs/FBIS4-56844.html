			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- A former officer  of the defunct Panama Defense Forces (FDP) said here today that  Panamanian military officers exiled in Guatemala could return to  Panama following the election victory of opposition presidential  candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares.    "We will return when the victory of Perez Balladares in the  general elections held this Sunday is confirmed," former FDP  Lieutenant Carlos Alberto Rumbo told NOTIMEX.    The military officer said the young officers of the defunct  Panamanian Army "will return to give back to Panama its dignity,  which General Manuel Noriega, President Guillermo Endara, and  the Americans trampled on."    At least 10 Panamanian military officers sought exile in  various Latin American countries following the U.S. invasion in  December 1989, which overthrew Noriega. Noriega was later  sentenced to 40-years of incarcaration in the United States for  drug trafficking activities.    Rumbo said he fled Panama after participating in a  post-invasion, uprising by National Police members against  President Endara; an uprising which Endara described as a "coup  attempt."    Perez Balladares, from the United People coalition headed by  the Democratic Revolutionary Party, became the virtual winner of  the Panamanian presidential elections.    Perez Balladares, popularly known as "El Toro", has remained  in first place with approximately 33 percent of the vote since  the Electoral Tribunal (TE) started providing election results  yesterday.    After 89 percent of the votes were counted, the TE placed  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber from the ruling Arnulfist Party in  second place with 28 percent of the votes. She was followed by  Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement, who gained 17 percent  of the vote.    Regarding these figures, Guatemalan analyst Walter Robles  said "Toro's" victory was the result of his ability to renew  Panamanians' affinity for the policies of the PRD founder, the  late General Omar Torrijos.    During the election campaign, PRD leaders were able to  remove  the party from the shadow of deposed General Manuel Noriega, who  became Panama's "strongman" following the death of Torrijos in  1981, according to Robles.    Panamanian writer Rafael Ruiloba said the new government  must  find the best way to lead the country down a nationalist path  and the best way to recover the dignity lost following the  humiliating U.S. invasion.    In San Salvador, the country's media reported on the virtual  victory of the PRD candidate in Sunday's elections, in which  deputies and mayors were also elected.    Conservative newspaper LA PRENSA GRAFICA printed on its  front  page: "Perez Balladares Virtual Winner of Elections in Panama,"  and right-wing newspaper EL DIARIO DE HOY published: "Balladares  Wins Elections in Panama."</p>

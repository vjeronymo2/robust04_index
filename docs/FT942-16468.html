			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Books: Ancient nobility and modern prejudice - A 'monstrously unfair' study of the aristocracy ASPECTS OF ARISTOCRACY: GRANDEUR AND DECLINE IN MODERN BRITAIN by David Cannadine Yale University Press Pounds 19.95, 320 pages The author of this uneven book has published another on the same theme, The Pleasures of the Past, which he subtitled 'The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy'. In his new book the aristocracy is still on its way out, but not yet fallen. The difference is significant. David Cannadine cannot deny that the aristocracy has shown a remarkable capacity for survival, not so much in power or esteem as in economic resilience. A great part of the book is about money, its acquisition, investment and profligate expenditure by titled families. It is a mopping-up of material left over from the earlier book. He calls it a 'rather random accumulation' of essays, and the effect is that of a thick mattress of compacted facts. It is lively, deeply researched and thoroughly disagreeable. He finds little to admire in what these families have achieved, except, strangely enough, the Curzons' gift for staging stupendous shows like the Delhi Durbar. He thinks the cult of the country house snobbish and nostalgic, as 'if the owners of these houses were or are persons of greater merit than the rest of us'. He is not a man to appreciate the audacity, beauty and irreplaceability of these houses, nor of the works of art that they contain. In fact he is not a man to find much joy in anything. The delight that members of the aristocracy took, and still take, in improving their estates, in their recreations, marriages and friendships are to him all different forms of self-indulgence. He faces a problem with the 19th century parvenus, whether to applaud their breach of the aristocratic circle or to deplore their imitation of it. But on the whole the class is depicted as contemptible and their survival, it is strongly implied, is much to be regretted. Cannadine illustrates his theme by examining the case-histories of a few families and individuals. One of them is irrelevant, the Cozens-Hardy family of Norfolk, brewers and solicitors, who gained a peerage, but in no other sense claimed to be aristocrats. The others are Curzon, Lord Strickland of Malta, Winston Churchill, the Dukes of Devonshire and my own parents, Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West. The purpose of these pen-portraits is to show that on the whole the aristocrats were a pretty poor lot. Cannadine may preface a chapter with the caveat that so-and-so was remarkable, but then devotes the next 40 pages to proving how unremarkable he was. His chapter on Churchill is a good example. He is bound to acknowledge that his performance in three years of his life, 1940-43, redeemed the rest of it, but basically Churchill was selfish, snobbish, disreputable and, more often than not, drunk. His progenitors and children (all except Mary) were appalling examples of aristocratic decadence. His extravagance threw him into the debt of questionable men like Sir Ernest Cassel and Henry Strakosch. He cared little for social reform, and his belief in democracy was largely humbug. He saw himself as a British Mussolini. Much of this portrait is undoubtedly true of Churchill, just as the Graham Sutherland portrait of him was partly true. But both leave out the elements of magnificence, daring, iconoclasm and the common touch which Cannadine surprisingly concedes to Curzon. The other figures in this gallery escape less lightly. Lord Strickland was a failure, 'ridiculous in his self-importance'. The Devonshires, whose finances are examined in detail, are credited with making a killing with the development of Barrow-in-Furness, and then ridiculed for losing it. The eighth Duke emerges as one of the few men for whom Cannadine feels any respect, because he restored the family's fortunes to the extent that the present Duke is probably the richest of his line that there has ever been. He cannot suppress a certain admiration for the aristocratic millionaire, much as we might admire the Great Train Robbers. I cannot be impartial in judging his long chapter about my parents. I think it monstrously unfair that they should be taken as representative of all that he finds most despicable in the combination of arrogance and flaccidity in our aristocracy. He has picked the wrong couple for this demonstration. He confuses elitism with snobbishness. Vita and Harold came from the aristocracy, but were not part of it. They despised and avoided The Tatler set. They inherited little, but created much that was new, in literature politics, horticulture and their concept of marriage. The evidence, which is vast, is used selectively by Cannadine to sustain a prejudice endemic to his whole approach.</p>

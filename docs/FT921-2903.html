			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / EETPU leaders seek to isolate Hammond THE NEW leadership of the EETPU electricians' union sought to distance itself yesterday from the actions of Mr Eric Hammond, former general secretary, in a move which signals an attempt to improve its relations with other unions. Without directly attacking Mr Hammond, the executive issued a statement implying strong criticism of his role in the move by News International, the newspaper publisher, to Wapping in the mid 1980s and the subsequent loss of more than 5,000 print jobs. Last week Mr Hammond admitted he held secret talks with News International for more than a year before the Wapping move. Previously he told the TUC that any talks had been at local level. The EETPU executive said after an emergency meeting it had believed the submissions to the TUC had been 'accurate in every respect . . . the executive places great store in dealing in good faith with other trade unions, employers and our members. We look forward to developing constructive working relationships with other unions'. The statement will encourage unions that the EETPU is planning a constructive attitude in forthcoming talks over its possible re-admission to the TUC as part of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALERO PRAISES NORTH AS CONTRA 'SAVIOR'  </P> <P> Contra leader Adolfo Calero told a federal court jury Thursday that Oliver L.  North was the financial "savior" of the resistance movement at the time  official U.S. aid was banned and that a monument may one day be erected in  Nicaragua to the retired Marine lieutenant colonel.  </P> <P> Calero, although called as the second witness for the prosecution, sought also  to defend North against charges that he had misused $4,300 in Contra funds,  declaring that he would trust North with his life.  </P> <P> The former manager of a Coca-Cola bottling plant who became the non-military  president of the Contra movement in 1983, Calero praised North for funneling  millions of dollars in privately raised funds to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985  and 1986, when Congress had prohibited U.S. military aid.  </P> <P> The most serious of 12 felony counts against North are that he misled Congress  and obstructed congressional inquiries by lying about his relationship with the  Contras.  </P> <P> "For us he became sort of a savior . . . when we felt abandoned and were in a  desperate situation," Calero said. "They are going to erect a monument to him  once we are in power."  </P> <P> Calero said that North, while a top staff official of the National Security  Council, directed the flow of at least $32 million in private funds to a Contra  bank account in Miami. Evidence has shown that North and other U.S. officials,  including former President Ronald Reagan, solicited the donations from other  foreign governments and from private U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> Calero said that on numerous occasions he gave North a total of about $90,000  from this bank account, in the form of travelers checks, when North told him he  was short of funds to carry out another secret project, freeing U.S. hostages  overseas. North said that he also needed money to cover other costs associated  with funding the Contras, Calero testified.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have charged that North used at least $4,300 of this money as his  "personal piggy bank."  </P> <P> Associate independent counsel John W. Keker, the prosecutor, asked Calero: "Did  you ever give him any money for his personal use?"  </P> <P> "No sir, that was not one of the purposes," Calero replied.  </P> <P> Later, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney, said to Calero: "The  prosecutor says Col. North stole $4,000 in Contra funds. Do you think that is  conceivable?"  </P> <P> "No," said Calero, adding that he saw North write down figures on a sheet of  paper whenever he gave him money. North never gave him a formal accounting of  how the funds were spent, "but I didn't demand an accounting -- I trusted him  absolutely," Calero declared.  </P> <P> Sullivan said that North "would often reimburse himself in connection with  expenses. You'd have no problem with any of that, would you?"  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," Calero replied.  </P> <P> Keker asked Calero if he knew that North had used $1,000 of the money as a  wedding present for Robert W. Owen, a private citizen who often acted as  North's go-between with the Contras.  </P> <P> Calero said that Owen once had mentioned the gift to him "and I thought the  wedding present was compensation for his services."  </P> <P> "Col. North was the representative of U.S. government authority. I never  questioned the legality of our arrangement," Calero testified.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell leaned forward to ask Calero: "Who did  Col. North say he was representing?"  </P> <P> Calero replied that North was not specific "but he brought us in to see the  President (Ronald Reagan) two or three times."  </P> <P> "Was any business ever transacted?" Gesell wanted to know.  </P> <P> "We talked mostly in generalities," Calero replied. "We told him (Reagan) we  had gotten help from other countries -- he seemed happy to hear it -- and help  from the private sector."  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), former chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee, concluded testimony he began Wednesday by declaring, in  response to questioning by Sullivan, that he was not told in 1985 and 1986 that  former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and former National Security Adviser  Robert C. McFarlane were soliciting aid for the Contras from some U.S. allies.  </P></p>

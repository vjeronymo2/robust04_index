			<p>BFN     [Text] The Saeima presidium accepted Foreign Minister  Georgs Andrejevs' resignation as Saeima deputy. The presidium  instructed the Central Electoral Commission to determine which  of the candidate deputies from the Way of Latvia union will take  Andrejevs' place. According to unofficial information, Saeima  Deputy Georgs Andrejevs will be replaced by Maris Zvaigzne, head  of the Foreign Ministry's department of archives and chancellery.    On 4 June Andrejevs submitted a letter to Prime Minister  Valdis Birkavs asking him to accept his resignation as foreign  minister, and today Andrejevs submitted a letter to the  presidium of the Saeima on giving up his mandate.    Georgs Andrejevs has also distributed a statement sayimg  that  the Supreme Council's electoral law, which he believes was  formulated erroneously, has been preserved by the law adopted in  the Saeima on 19 May. The statement also says that the events  in recent days after the publication of the open letter in the  press on 28 May prevent him from continuing work not only as a  Saeima deputy, but also as foreign minister.    In accordance with international standards in legislation,  each person's guilt is determined by his specific activities and  not by where he belonged. This also applies to collaboration,  because the need for more exact definitions is dismissed in  advance. By disregarding this, we are moving further away from  the Western world into which we want to become integrated.    Only a proven fact may serve as an argument for restricting  the activity of an individual and for punishment of a different  kind, considers Georgs Andrejevs, expressing the hope that his  resignation will assist the public and the legislators in  realizing the need for changes in the legislation of the  Republic of Latvia.    Information: The electoral law of the Fifth Saeima provides  that any citizen of the Republic of Latvia can be nominated as a  candidate deputy if he has signed a statement that he has not  been nor is now a staff or nonstaff employee of the USSR or  Latvian SSR state security committees; of the USSR Ministry of  Defense; of Russian security services, army intelligence  services, or counterintelligence services; an inheritor of the  rights of the USSR and of other countries; or an agent,  resident, or keeper of a safe house belonging to these bodies.</p>

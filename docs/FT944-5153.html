			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Short-dated dollar paper in demand - International Just when it seemed safe to wind down for Christmas, the eurobond market - and especially its dollar sector - last week saw a burst of primary activity. What's more, many expect issuance to continue flowing in the next few weeks, buoyed by retail demand for high coupons on short-dated dollar paper, investors increasing their dollar exposure, borrowers seeking to complete funding programmes before the year-end and underwriters keen on boosting their standing in the industry's league tables. 'There has been a strong trend all this year, a strong bid for short-dated dollar paper, and this is likely to last for the remainder of 1994 and into next year,' said Mr Stephen West, a managing director at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'A lot of money in Europe is held in dollars on a long-term structural basis and this year that has been directed towards the short-end of the yield curve.' Most of last week's rush of dollar deals - 26 issues totalling Dollars 6.1bn  -was driven by demand from retail investors attracted by the coupons on short-dated US paper which, at close to 8 per cent, are high by historical standards. Following the Federal Reserve's rise in official US interest rates on November 15, and in anticipation of further tightening, US short-term rates have increased sharply. 'Short dollar rates have risen dramatically in recent weeks and eurobond coupons between 7 1/2 and 8 per cent for two and three-year paper look very attractive,' says Mr Denis Kelleher, head of debt syndication at Daiwa Europe, who has seen especially strong demand for short-dated dollar paper from Switzerland. Given the dramatic yield-curve flattening that has taken place in recent weeks, 'there is now not a lot of value in the 10-year sector, and many investors have been moving shorter along the curve, with demand concentrated between two and five years', he says. However, some investors have ventured further out along the yield curve amid growing confidence that US inflation will remain under control and that the dollar will strengthen. Much of the retail demand this year has been driven by redemptions and interest payments, which have released a large pool of dollars to be reinvested. November saw some Dollars 8bn in global bond and eurobond redemptions and a further Dollars 2.6bn in coupon payments; in December another Dollars 9bn in redemptions and interest payments falls due. Moreover, some investors have started reducing their cash positions and are cautiously returning to the bond markets. Currency considerations are also boosting investors' appetite for dollar bonds. There is a growing belief that the US currency will appreciate next year after its disappointing performance in 1994. 'A number of investors have been underweight in the dollar this year, but they are beginning to adjust their weightings in favour of the dollar,' says Mr Roger Bates, director of bond syndicate at Deutsche Bank London. Favourable swap opportunities have also lured borrowers to the short-end of the yield curve. These have arisen due to strong demand for fixed-rate assets inspired by a view among many borrowers that US interest rates are set to rise further. This has enabled many borrowers to raise fixed-rate funds and swap them for floating-rate liabilities at a rate significantly below Libor. Another factor behind the recent issuance boom lies in the fierce competition among bond underwriting houses to secure a top position in the industry's league tables as the year-end approaches. 'The league-table scramble risks overwhelming the market with supply,' warns Mr Kelleher. Despite the heavy supply, many of last week's offerings continued to find firm demand. Walt Disney and PepsiCo - probably the two most significant deals of last week's slew of offerings - were among several rare US corporate names to tap into European retail demand at funding levels significantly lower than in the US domestic market. Furthermore, the pace of new eurobond issuance does not appear to be slowing. Spain is expected to come to the market this week with a minimum DM2.5bn offering of five-year bonds, led by Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank, in a deal that could mark the revival of the D-Mark sector. South Africa and Pakistan are both preparing for an entry into the euromarkets, although they may have to wait until the new year to make their appearance.</p>

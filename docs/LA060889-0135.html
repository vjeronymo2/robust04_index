			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALTRY TURNOUT SENDS ANALYSTS SEARCHING FOR CAUSES AND CURES  </P> <P> Los Angeles voters avoided, if barely, setting a record for low turnout in  Tuesday's election, but the dismal showing has set minds to work on the causes  and potential solutions of the problem.  </P> <P> Some officials say voters were turned off by ethics controversies. Political  scientists say we have too many elections for too many minor offices.  </P> <P> And a small group of political observers ventured that maybe it is all right  after all that most of us ignore minor races such as the one on Tuesday's  ballot for the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> "I feel hard pressed to vote for community college board," said Raymond E.  Wolfinger, professor of political science at UC Berkeley, and he suggested that  most Californians are no different.  </P> <P> According to the city clerk's office, turnout in the community college  districts was 9% and in the city proper 10.9% -- largely thanks to a  comparatively strong 20% turnout in the 7th Council District. The record low,  set in 1983, is 8.6%.  </P> <P> Tuesday's poor showing follows on the heels of a record low turnout April 11  for the mayoral primary election. In that contest -- in which nearly half of  the City Council was elected in addition to the mayor -- only 24.33% of  registered voters went to the polls.  </P> <P> Some of the reasons for poor turnout -- such as apathy, poor education and the  increasingly mobile and rootless nature of society -- seem insurmountable.  </P> <P> But potential solutions, such as eliminating some elections and elected  positions, are just as provocative.  </P> <P> Politicians themselves say the reasons for low voter participation -- and the  solutions to the problem -- are political in nature.  </P> <P> They say voters perceive their problems as so large that no candidate appears  capable of providing solutions. "If no one has an answer (to society's  problems), how do you make a choice?" said Bob Naylor, former state Republican  Party chairman.  </P> <P> Some politicians say low voter turnout is the result of a homogenization of  ideology, a blurring of the distinctions between candidates, and that makes  choices more difficult. Naylor, paraphrasing former President Ronald Reagan,  said candidates for public office need to abandon the "politics of pastels" and  "stand for something clear." Only then will voters respond, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern Over Turnout  </P> <P> Many in the political process are concerned about slipping voter turnout.  </P> <P> One strategy City Councilman Richard Alatorre is exploring is consolidation of  municipal elections with county and state elections. That would not only  combine high-visibility contests and the lesser offices on the same ballot but  would reduce the number of times voters go to the polls.  </P> <P> Wolfinger points out that city residents have been asked to go to the polls  three times in the past seven months. "Let's face it," he said, "when you keep  doing it, people lose interest."  </P> <P> Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at Caltech, said other partial  solutions are to adopt more accessible vote-by-mail programs and make voter  registration easier by making it part of automobile registration. Only about  70% of eligible voters actually register, according to several studies.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez said the idea of consolidating elections  "always comes up, but never seriously."  </P> <P> And he is not convinced that it would really make that much difference.  Martinez said there is a large "drop-off" on long ballots. Although many voters  will cast a ballot for President or governor at the top of a ballot, they will  pass over lesser offices such as judges at the bottom of the ballot, he said.  </P> <P> But Martinez said new technology is making other alternatives, such as voting  by telephone or post card, possible, even if they will take a while to be  accepted. Even though many Americans do not take advantage of voting, "people  want confidence in the system," Martinez said.  </P> <P> VOTER TURNOUT  </P> <P> Turnout in Tuesday's Los Angeles general municipal election was the second  lowest in at least 20 years, the city clerk's office records showed:  </P> <P> 1969: 62%  </P> <P> 1971: 45%  </P> <P> 1973: 64%  </P> <P> 1975: 43%  </P> <P> 1977: 29%  </P> <P> 1979: 24%  </P> <P> 1981: 30%  </P> <P> 1983: 8.6%  </P> <P> 1985: 22%  </P> <P> 1987: 16%  </P> <P> 1989: 10.9%  </P> <P> Compiled by researcher Cecilia Rasmussen  </P></p>

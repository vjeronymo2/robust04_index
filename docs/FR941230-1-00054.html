			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) The earlier issue will not be redeemed within 90 days of the issue date of the later issue in connection with the refunding of the earlier issue by the later issue; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) More than 5 percent of the sale proceeds of the earlier issue financed an output facility that is part of the same project as the output facility that is financed by more than 5 percent of the sale proceeds of the later issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Benefits and burdens test applicable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In applying the $15 million output limitation, the benefits and burdens test of &sect;1.141&hyph;7 applies, except that ``$15 million'' is substituted for ``10 percent''. For this purpose, the amount of private business use with respect to an output facility financed by an issue is determined by multiplying the percentage of private business use over the contract term of the issue by the issue price of the issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Earlier issues for the project.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an earlier issue is outstanding that must be taken into account under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount of private business use and private security or payments for that issue (as determined under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section) is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the greater of the outstanding principal amount or present value of the outstanding bonds of the earlier issue as of the issue date of the later issue, and the denominator of which is the issue price of the earlier issue as of the issue date of that issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has the meaning provided in this paragraph. Facilities having different purposes or serving different customer bases are not ordinarily part of the same project. For example, the following are generally not part of the same project: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) generation and transmission facilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) separate facilities designed to serve wholesale customers and retail customers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) a peaking unit and a baseload unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separate ownership. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Facilities that are not owned by the same person are not part of the same project. All participants in a joint powers authority that issues bonds to finance a project are treated as related parties for purposes of applying the $15 million limitation to bonds financing the same project. In the case of undivided ownership interests in a single output facility, property that is not owned by the same person is treated as separate projects only if the separate interests are not financed_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) With bonds of a single issuer; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With a principal purpose of avoiding the limitation in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Generating property <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Property on same site. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of property for the generation of output and related facilities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> generating property <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means property located at the same site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule for generating units. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Separate generating units (and related facilities) are not a part of the same project if one is placed in service (determined under &sect;1.150&hyph;2(c)) more than 3 years before the other. Common facilities or property that will be functionally related to more than one generating unit must be allocated on a reasonable basis. If a generating unit already is constructed or is under construction (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> first unit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and bonds are to be issued to finance an additional generating unit (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> second unit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), all costs for any common facilities paid or incurred before the earlier of the issue date of bonds to finance the second unit or the commencement of construction of the second unit are allocated to the first unit. At the time that bonds are issued to finance the second unit (or, if earlier, upon commencement of construction of that unit), any remaining costs of the common facilities may be allocated among the first and second units so that in the aggregate the allocation is reasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of property for the transmission of output and related facilities,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means functionally related or contiguous property used for transmission of output but only to the extent that the property is placed in service during a single 2-year period. Separate property is not part of a single project, however, unless it is intended to provide transmission between two significant output facilities (for example, a line to connect two substations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subsequent improvements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An improvement to generating or transmission property that is not part of the original design of that property (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> initial project <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is not part of the same project as the initial project if the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of that improvement commences more than three years after the initial project is placed in service and the bonds issued to finance that improvement are issued more than three years after the initial project is placed in service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Wall Street welcomes Fed cut THE US Federal Reserve's decision to respond to a dismal employment report, with a  1/4 -point cut in the federal funds rate to 3 per cent, was welcomed on Wall Street yesterday as striking a sensible balance between the domestic and international needs of the economy. But for the chronic weakness of the dollar and the imminence of the presidential election in November, the Fed might have been tempted to announce another cut in the discount rate which, at 3 per cent, now sets a floor for the federal funds rate. Nudging down the federal funds rate (the cost of overnight funds in the interbank market) was a way to appear responsive to domestic economic needs without further destabilising currency markets. The plunge in payroll employment last month was sharp enough to raise worries that the US economy is heading for a triple-dip recession. Non-farm employment fell by 83,000 to 108.5m, despite the Bush administration's attempts to massage the figures with a generous federal summer jobs programme. Excluding the effects of federal intervention, employment fell by 183,000 - the kind of figure expected at the depths of a recession. Wall Street analysts had expected employment to rise by about 150,000. The weakness was pervasive. Manufacturing and retailing shed 97,000 and 71,000 jobs respectively, showing the softness of both production and consumer demand. Overall, private sector employment was not significantly higher last month than in April last year, the month many economists believe was the trough of the recession. Analysts discounted the few positive elements in the figures yesterday. The unemployment rate (based on household rather than payroll data) fell slightly - to 7.6 per cent against 7.7 per cent in July. But the decline was entirely accounted for by lower teenage joblessness via the summer jobs programme. Recent indicators have been consistently weaker than expected. Consumer confidence slipped further in August, having fallen sharply in July. Orders for durable goods fell in July, as did housing starts and new home sales. 'This is a very dismal report,' said Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. The employment figures pointed to economic growth of little more than 1 per cent at an annual rate, a dismal showing by US standards. Alan Friedman reports from New York: General Motors shut down two more car plants yesterday and laid off 10,500 workers because of a continuing strike by members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) at an Ohio metal-stamping plant. The latest shut-downs, of car assembly plants in Delaware and Michigan, brought to nearly 43,000 the number of assembly workers affected by the Ohio strike, where just 2,300 employees have walked out.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- [passage omitted] NATO  declared the heavy guns withdrawal a success last Monday, the  day strikes against artillery were to begin. But [UNPROFOR  spokesman] Aikman presented reporters Wednesday with a long list  of weapons sites still being investigated. He also said a  reported mortar attack in Sarajevo Tuesday was under  investigation.    Aikman said there was a "surprising" amount of Serb heavy  weapons still left in "every location imaginable" around  Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of these positions are in  deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he said. He said some  artillery was literally "frozen in position" and could not be  pulled out until there was a thaw.    But he said this did not mean Serb troops besieging Sarajevo  were not complying with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no  longer being shelled.    Air reconnaissance, including helicopters, had over the past  48 hours found 66 sites. Twelve of these were non-weapons, 42  turned out to be either abandoned or non-weapons sites, at one  there was an inoperable weapon, one was still to be verified and  10 of the sites were taken over by UN troops.    UN ground patrols were dealing with 55 sites, of which 23  were abandoned or non-weapons, two had inoperable weapons, four  had weapons which patrols would have to neutralize, nine were  taken over by UNPROFOR, eight were large collection centers and  nine were yet to be verified. This left a total of 12 sites  where weapons were still to be checked, Aikman said.    He also said Serb soldiers had come to two of the weapons  collection sites asking to retrieve the artillery they had  surrendered in order to take it out of the 20-kilometres  (12-mile) exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital.    He said they came in vehicles to load up the guns but were  turned back by UN soldiers. There was no violence. He  identified one site as at Krivoglavci, just northwest of  Sarajevo, but did not name the second site.    Aikman also said UNPROFOR was investigating a reported  mortar  shelling of Sarajevo. The Bosnian Army said an 82-mm mortar  shell hit the Brekin Potok neighborhood in northeast Sarajevo at  about 9 PM (0800 GMT) [times as received] Tuesday. Aikman said  that if confirmed this attack on the front-line that runs in and  around the city "would cause some action (by UNPROFOR or NATO)  but what action it would be I don't know."    Meanwhile, there was fighting in another Bosnian hotspot,  Tuzla. Aikman said nine shells fell there, two very close to the  airfield that NATO has said is to be opened to humanitarian  flights on March 7. Serb forces and Serbia oppose reopening  this airport.    In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said a French UN unit was to be deployed  Wednesday around a bridge on the border between Croatia and  Bosnia blocked by about 100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week.    Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and  Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting  tension at the site.    About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over  the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned  by Nepalese troops on Friday. [passage omitted]</p>

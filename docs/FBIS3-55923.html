Commenting on the results of the Monday meeting with Latvian  energy officials, Stasiukynas said the Latvian side expected to  agree on the joint construction of a huge oil terminal in  Liepaja, but all hopes failed when it became clear that the  relief of the sea bottom near the Latvian port is unsuitable for  the project.    The minister said the future terminal in Liepaja would be  quite small and would handle around 3 million tons of oil  products each year. But the Latvian terminal could greatly  contribute to regulating oil prices in Latvia and Lithuania,  Stasiukynas said.    Latvia intends to start building its terminal in spring and  hopes to complete it by the end of the year. Separate talks will  be held to discuss Lithuania's possible participation in the  project. The earlier Lithuanian-Latvian protocol on oil  terminal construction is void, the minister said.    The official confirmed that the main designer of the  Lithuanian terminal should be known in late January.    Stasiukynas said Lithuania suggests Latvians to invest in  the  Butinge terminal and the step would mean that a joint project is  carried out. International financial organizations previously  pressured Lithuania to build a joint oil terminal, however the  minister doubts whether Latvia would be willing to invest in  Butinge.</p>

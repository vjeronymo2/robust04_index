			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider rises to Pounds 11m - Invasion of low-priced brands hits share of take-home market Taunton Cider, reporting an adjusted 11 per cent increase in first half profits to Pounds 11m, said yesterday that the take-home cider market had been invaded by an unprecedented number of low-priced brands. Volume sales of economy products - which were undercutting private label brands - surged 62 per cent in the six months to end-September to account for most of the market growth. Private label volumes had declined 13 per cent under intense competition from the economy brands supplied by Belgian producers and smaller UK cider makers, said Mr Peter Adams, Taunton's chief executive. Though Taunton's premium packaged brands, such as Diamond White, Red Rock and Brody, almost matched sector growth of 8 per cent, the reduction in its private label sales left overall volumes slightly lower. Mr Adams said that the company intended to protect its brands and strengthen its position in the market. Brand promotion would be increased and, in partnership with retail customers, reductions were planned in private label prices. 'We believe we can maintain margins by cutting costs,' Mr Adams said. Taunton's pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 11m, against a reported Pounds 8m or an adjusted Pounds 9.9m after taking out borrowings of Pounds 1.9m which were repaid after flotation in July last year. Earnings per share, also adjusted for the effect of flotation, grew 13 per cent to 6.9p (6.1p) - last year's actual earnings were 6.3p. The interim dividend is raised 10 per cent to 2.65p (2.4p). Operating profit was 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.8m on marginally higher turnover of Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 65m). Increased distribution in the pub trade lifted sales of Dry Blackthorn and Autumn Gold, the mainstream draught brands. Draught volumes rose 6 per cent, well ahead of the sector's overall 2 per cent growth, and gained market share. Packaged cider sales through pubs, however, were 1 per cent lower. Recently launched products, including Fres, a light cider, and Drum perry, showed 'encouraging early signs,' said Mr Adams. Discussions had begun with potential partners on developing overseas opportunities and on adding premium beers to the company's drinks portfolio, he added. Capital spending on extending packaging facilities and technological improvements amounted to Pounds 4.4m in the first half. The full year's programme, aimed at reducing costs, is expected to total Pounds 10m. COMMENT Taunton has met some concerns by regaining share in the mainstream draught cider market only to find a more serious problem developing in the take-home sector. The growth of tertiary brands may prove more difficult to combat - and scepticism about Taunton's ability to do so without further loss of volume or damage to its margins is reflected in the downgrading of full year profit forecasts from Pounds 22m to Pounds 20.7m. However, the cider market remains buoyant, though growth is slowing to about 6 per cent; second half sales are ahead; and a prospective p/e of 13 gives few hostages to fortune.</p>

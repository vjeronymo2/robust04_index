			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Treatment boost for herpes sufferers A Californian pharmaceutical company has developed a controlled-release formulation of acyclovir, the herpes drug, which would make it easier to administer to patients. Acyclovir is the generic name for Zovirax, the top-selling drug developed by Wellcome. Currently, the drug is taken five times daily to treat herpes outbreaks. However, Genta, a US pharmaceutical company and Jagotec, its joint venture partner, have conducted a pilot study, which suggests the dosage could be cut to twice daily. The trial used the joint venture's Geomatrix controlled-release formulation which is designed to maintain nearly uniform blood levels of a drug through the steady release of the active substance from a tablet that swells as it passes through the digestive tract. Genta Incorporated: US, tel 619 455 2700; fax 455 2712.</p>

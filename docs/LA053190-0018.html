			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEVERAL BRIGHT SPOTS NOTED AT RECENT WINE INDUSTRY EVENTS  </P> <P> The other gatherings of wine people in Northern California recently all had  doom and gloom behind them. They were:  </P> <P>  -- A daylong financial symposium staged by the San Francisco investment  banking house Hambrecht &amp; Quist addressed, among other issues, the  profitability of wineries based on volume and case prices. In one report,  financial analysts said California wine prices had risen too high, and the  experts predicted that prices may soon have to be cut or discounts offered  because consumers are weary of paying high prices.  </P> <P>  -- At the initial meeting of the newly formed Society of Blancs, focusing on  the travails of white Sauvignon, participants heard various industry leaders  offer schemes to sell more Sauvignon Blanc. One suggestion: junk the name Fume  Blanc (which means the same thing as Sauvignon Blanc) because it is confusing  to the public, who thinks the wines are different.  </P> <P>  -- An impressive array of Italian wine producers unveiled the glories of  Italian wines in a promotion that may have been aimed, in part, at justifying  escalating prices. In the April issue of Decanter, a British wine magazine,  Master of Wine Nicolas Belfrage wrote, "The main problem for the future of  Italian wines on international markets is the price-quality ratio." He noted  that recent price increases for Italian wine "are not realistic and may prove  suicidal. Just as the Italians are getting a reputation for really good value,  short-term greed steps in."  </P> <P>  -- Physicians and lawyers looked at the issues surrounding warning labels and  the proposed increased taxation of wine at a meeting of the energetic American  Wine Alliance for Research and Education. In one presentation, a heart  specialist, Dr. Arthur Klatsky, gave a presentation showing scientific studies  that showed that moderate wine consumption (two glasses a day) can help reduce  the risk of heart attack.  </P> <P>  -- The annual national convention of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers Assn.  looked at how to sell more alcoholic beverages in the face of escalating  neo-Prohibitionism. The trade event attracted hundreds of alcoholic beverage  wholesalers and retailers from around the country. DAN BERGER  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MANHATTAN BEACH TO LET PUBLIC DECIDE WHAT ART TO KEEP  </P> <P> With a $20,500 budget, Manhattan Beach is confronting an age-old dilemma:  sponsoring public art that the public actually likes.  </P> <P> The city is on the verge of installing pieces by five artists under its  15-month-old public arts program. Officials describe it as their most ambitious  project. Up until now, the public art program has stuck mainly to tours and  lectures and showcasing local artists, once even sponsoring a sand castle  contest.  </P> <P> But this project, which will loan art to the city, involves seven artists and  curators, some with up-and-coming reputations in the international art scene.  One artist, a sculptor, has sold in the $100,000 range. Officials are proud  that the city will be able to run the project on a modest budget.  </P> <P> "This project is without precedent in Manhattan Beach," said Cultural Arts  Commission Chairperson Paula Benard. " . . . We feel art is important and we  want to educate the public."  </P> <P> At the same time, the artists and city officials recognize the inherent risk in  public art: it generates controversy because you cannot predict the public's  reaction to art. "But we think we have ways to deal with that, if it arises,"  said Benard.  </P> <P> Their method is to let the public decide which pieces the city buys. Unless  residents express approval for the works, they will go back to the artists  after an 18- to 24-month loan period. Benard's panel is deciding how that  referendum would be run.  </P> <P> Supporters of the public art program have tried to ensure that the artists  would create pieces that are compatible with Manhattan Beach and with the sites  where the works will be installed.  </P> <P> Co-curator Peter Frank said: "The city made it very clear that they wanted the  pieces to be an honest reflection of the community. The pieces are subtle and  witty and fit into their situations very well. They truly reflect that  (Manhattan Beach) has a small-town family environment with a youthful spirit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Display Will Be Late  </P> <P> Despite the good intentions and the planning, there are glitches. The most  obvious one is that the pieces will go on display late. There is disagreement  about who is to blame.  </P> <P> Installation was to begin two weeks ago, but that was the week Public Art  Administrator Katya Williamson abruptly quit. The target date for the opening  is now in early September.  </P> <P> Officials say the delay was caused by several artists not having their pieces  ready, and not by Williamson's resignation.  </P> <P> The artists, who have been promised that they will receive $2,000 each for the  loan of their works, say they had problems with the city and still have not  signed contracts.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest surprise to residents may be in artist Kenneth Capps'  attitude toward Manhattan Beach. It is not very favorable, he said, and that is  reflected in his work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Visual Puzzle  </P> <P> The works and their artists are:  </P> <P> "Rebus" by Michael Davis and Susan Groetsch.  </P> <P> A rebus is a puzzle that uses pictures and phrases to create a longer word or  sentence. This one, which will be placed along Manhattan Beach Boulevard, has  three parts. In the residential section at Aviation Boulevard: a silhouette of  a man. In the business section at Sepulveda: a silhouette of a hat. In the  stretch where the street meets the Pacific: the word TAN.  </P> <P> MAN . . . HAT . . . TAN.  </P> <P> The city commissioned Davis to do the piece. Davis, along with his wife, a  graphic artist, came up with the idea during a brainstorming session in their  kitchen. "This one presented itself like an apple falling out of a tree," Davis  said.  </P> <P> Groetsch agreed. "They told us to try to think of something that reflects  Manhattan Beach and this does. Literally."  </P> <P> Capp's work, which is untitled, is four posts that will be set in Polliwog  Park.  </P> <P> The steel poles, which are topped by something that could be a lighting  fixture, will be placed in different areas of the park.  </P> <P> "Basically, they are poles ranging from 12 feet to 15 feet. The tops have  various forms, but really they have no practical function," he said.  </P> <P> "The point to a lot of my work is to force people to think about the absurdity  of symbols they cherish. I think a few people (in Manhattan Beach) could use  that lesson."  </P> <P> Capps said the "negative energy" he picked up in Manhattan Beach and from its  residents is reflected in his art.  </P> <P> "That park is very awkward. It's got too much in there. It's like some one  said, 'Oh, we need this and we need that and now we need art.' And the poles,  their shapes, can emit this false sense of power and importance. But if you  think about it, people don't need all that stuff in there."  </P> <P> Jim Isermann's work will decorate the children's section of the county library  on Highland Avenue.  </P> <P> Isermann will bring bright colors, flowers and bean bags to the 25-foot-square  space. The centerpiece is a steel mobile, 15 feet in diameter, with 20 dangling  flower shapes. There will also be five kaleidoscope-like designs on wood  panels. The final touch will be 15 bean bags, regular size. Yellow, orange,  turquoise and red are the dominant colors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope and Innocence  </P> <P> "I think my works were chosen because they wanted a  love-and-hope-and-innocence-type aura there," Isermann said. "That relates to  children very well."  </P> <P> "Serpent" and "Dumbbells" by Ann Preston, will be placed at the 20th Street  Alcove.  </P> <P> Preston's cast-bronze serpent head will jut from a wall along a staircase that  leads to the beach. The pair of dumbbells will be secured to a nearby bench.  The pieces are small. The dumbbells, the larger of the pieces, are 15 inches in  length.  </P> <P> Art critics have noted that Preston's smooth and softly curved sculptures have  sexual allusions. Preston, who is vacationing in the South Pacific, was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> But former Public Arts Administrator Katya Williamson said that the pieces in  the context of the Manhattan Beach site create a "whimsical effect," not a  sexual one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Gentle Surprise  </P> <P> In an interview before her resignation, Williamson said the pieces will give  people a "gentle surprise. Hopefully, they will decide it enhances the  environment," she said.  </P> <P> Enhancing the environment is what the public art program is all about, those  involved in the project say.  </P> <P> "All of us feel that art is truly an essential of life . . . that Manhattan  Beach will be a better place to live if we can educate the public about art."  said Williamson.  </P> <P> She said the program's biggest accomplishment so far has been the revamping of  the city's annual Festival of the Arts so it includes student art work and a  juried contest for South Bay artists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They've Been Exhibited  </P> <P> The upcoming art-on-loan project is clearly on a different level. The artists  involved have had their works exhibited in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago,  Japan and Europe. Only Davis is based in South Bay, living and working in San  Pedro. Isermann and Preston are based in Santa Monica and Capps in Carlsbad.  Davis has sold work in the $100,000-price range.  </P> <P> The two curators hired by the city, Bonnie Clearwater and Peter Frank, have  worked on dozens of shows and for major art foundations. The curators, whose  job was to select the artists and the sites, were paid about $600 each.  </P> <P> With $8,000 set to go to the artists, the remainder of the $20,500 approved by  the City Council was budgeted for appraisals, insurance, administrative and  installation costs. Should the residents decide to buy any of the work, the  city will negotiate a price with the artist.  </P> <P> Said co-curator Clearwater: "I know very little of their other events, but  clearly one of the signals this project sends out is that Manhattan Beach is an  up-and-coming community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Plopped Down'  </P> <P> Frank agreed. "Both Bonnie and I tend to avoid public art programs. In fact,  this is my first, because so much of it is what I call plop art. It's just  plopped down with no consideration of the environment."  </P> <P> Adds Clearwater: "They had a very modest budget for this, but what makes this a  good program was that it is well thought out and focused."  </P> <P> But clearly there were mistakes. Officials and the artists said they  underestimated the red tape involved in the project and set an unrealistic  starting date.  </P> <P> Commission members said that Williamson clashed with her supervisor, Ed Montan,  assistant director of parks and recreation, over the administration of the  program, and that eventually led to her resignation. Montan and Williamson last  week declined to comment on the dispute.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interim Administrator  </P> <P> Montan, meanwhile, is the interim administrator of the public arts program  while the city searches for a new one.  </P> <P> Three of the artists -- Davis, Isermann and Capps -- complained they were kept  in the dark. After visiting the city early in the year to see the sites where  their work would be installed, they had very little contact with the city.  </P> <P> "At times, I wondered if the project was still on," Isermann said, noting that  he has received fewer than five phone calls since January to discuss the  contract, the work, the appraisal or its results. Isermann and Capps  acknowledge that they did not make a point of calling the city to get answers  to their questions.  </P> <P> And then there is Kenneth Capps. In a project where officials took measures to  avoid public outcry, Capps is an unexpected wild card.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raise Eyebrows  </P> <P> He expects his work and words to raise eyebrows, he said. "If there isn't  controversy I would consider it a failure. My job is to get as many people to  question and think as possible. And some people in Manhattan Beach should wake  up to this false identity they're getting.  </P> <P> "I used to live in Inglewood for a while in the '60s and Manhattan was a funky  beach town with a lot of interesting characters. When I went back to Manhattan  Beach to look at the park, I was appalled. Now all I see is white sharks in  tennis shoes with nothing to do but sip coffee in cafes and go shopping in  quaint little tourist shops. What kind of life is that?"  </P> <P> Counters Mayor Patricia Collins: "We've gotten knocks of becoming 'yuppified'  before. All I can tell you is the people who move into town are no different  from us old-timers." Collins has lived in Manhattan Beach for 17 years.  </P> <P> "They are active in civic and church organizations and they care about their  families," she said. "They just have more money."  </P></p>

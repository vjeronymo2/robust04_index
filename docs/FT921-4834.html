			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Congress may rule on sale of defence metals THE BUSH Administration may be ordered by Congress to sell off as much as Dollars 1bn (Pounds .50bn) in fiscal 1993 in surplus metals and materials stored in the US National Defence Stockpile. The Pentagon said last week that, with the end of the Cold War, it could drastically pare the stockpile, now worth about Dollars 9bn. Its never-attained 'goals' would be cut from Dollars 19.1bn in supplies to Dollars 3.3bn. Congressman Charles Bennett, the 81-year-old chairman of the defence subcommittee overseeing the stockpile, said that the Pentagon has never even sold off the Dollars 1bn in 'excess and outdated' materials that it was authorised to sell during each of the last five years. A departmental inspector general's report found that stockpile managers sold only Dollars 231m in excess materials from fiscal years 1988-91. 'Bureaucratic incompetence,' Mr Bennett grumbled. Now he will introduce legislation to force the Pentagon to sell Dollars 1bn in materials in the next fiscal year. For years the Reagan and Bush Administration either ignored the stockpile or tried to sell off its more marketable metals in order to raise money for the budget. Silver auctions, conducted in the 1980's, produced an explosive reaction from the mining industry and they were discontinued. Silver is now being sold off slowly in the form of commemorative coins. Proceeds are supposed to go into a stockpile transaction fund for the purchase of new materials. Mr Bennett agrees with the Pentagon that what is now needed is 'a lean stockpile attuned to the needs of modern military technology and combat.' However, he has not yet decided if he will agree to a Pentagon request for a moratorium on acquisitions while the department makes further studies. The Pentagon has already decided that goals should be based on the supposition of a three month war with a one-year mobilisation period, rather than a three year conventional global war. Unless Congress agrees to the ban on purchases, the Pentagon has said that this year it will buy jewel bearings, columbium group metals, indium, rubber and tantalum metal, at a total cost of Dollars 31.7m. In fiscal 1992, it has asked for new legislative authority to sell: 3m pounds of cobalt worth Dollars 45m; bauxite worth Dollars 17.2m; 5,000 short tonnes of nickel worth Dollars 31.3m; and 50,000 short tonnes of zinc worth 50,000. It will continue to sell off its tin (12,000 tonnes) and silver (9.4m troy ounces in the form of commemorative coins) slowly, to avoid disrupting the markets. In this fiscal year, it wants also to sell asbestos, bismuth, fluorspar, graphite, industrial diamonds, iodine, manganese, mercury, mica, quartz crystal, silicon carbide, thorium nitrate, and talc. Ultimately, the Pentagon plans to sell off all its aluminium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, rayon, silver, and zinc. It hopes to dispose of much of its bauxite, cobalt, chromite, and platinum group metals. The Pentagon says it plans research and development in new materials, initially involving light metals and alloys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  was given a full display of military ceremony and precision on  arriving at Parliament on Tuesday to address the first historic  sitting of the all-race National Assembly. The president's  cavalcade was led by 20 military motorcyclists as it cruised  past a guard of honour comprising all three combative arms of  the National Defence Force.    Over 100 neatly-ranked infantrymen presented arms to order  as  Mr Mandela and his daughter Princess Zenani Dlamini took the  national salute from the red-carpeted steps of the great hall of  Parliament.    The crash of their boots had scarcely died away when a navy  band broke into the strains of "Die Stem", followed by "Nkosi  Sikele Iafrika" [God Bless Africa].    A ramrod stiff, stern-faced Mr Mandela -- the former  commander of the military wing of the once-outlawed African  National Congress -- crooked his right arm across his chest as  he took the national salute.    The troops stood unflinchingly, their white ceremonial  gloves, gaiters, red cravats and epaulettes adding colour to  camouflage fatigues and the grey cobbles of Stalplein.    Six Impala trainers then roared in low from the north,  trailing plumes of red, white, green, yellow and grey smoke,  wheeling away towards Kloof Nek.    The national anthems over, Mr Mandela and Princess Zenani  were accompanied into the building past an air force guard of  honour by army Colonel Tom Marx and navy Captain Steve Stead,  both officers in ceremonial regalia.    First to arrive at Parliament were Second Deputy President  Mr  F W de Klerk, followed by First Deputy President Mr Thabo Mbeki.    Meanwhile, as security men kept watch from nearby rooftops  with binoculars and mingled with onlookers, a crowd had gathered  at the Parliament street gate, singing freedom songs and  blocking the road.    An army captain at the scene appeared unruffled by the  unexpected obstacle across his troops' line of advance, instead  ordering them to retreat towards Stalplein whence they had come.    And as Mr Mandela stood up inside to make history, a  sergeant-major abruptly started mustering his troops who marched  off the scene to time marked by bellows that echoed off the  offices of power.</p>

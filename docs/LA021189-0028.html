			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The first weapon that anti-war activist Jerry Rubin wielded against a Venice  store was a petition.  </P> <P> When that didn't work, he resorted to a spray gun Friday.  </P> <P> Rubin and a handful of activists painted a "No" (slash) symbol across a  12-foot-tall store sign on Ocean Front Walk that depicts a hooded man firing a  handgun -- hand-cannon might be more accurate -- in the direction of  sunbathers.  </P> <P> Rubin, director of the Alliance for Survival, believes the sign imparts a  "violent message" in a community already plagued by violence, noting that it  has since inspired others to pock the wall with real bullet holes.  </P> <P> The owners of the clothing store, Local Heroes, initially said the ad would be  "toned down." When it wasn't, Rubin's brigade showed up, writing on the  storefront, "Wanted -- Venice Artists for ideas on how to make (this( sign less  violent." Store personnel blotted out the message Friday but declined comment  to The Times.  </P> <P> Rubin, who admitted that tampering with someone else's private property is  "risky," said he still hopes that the sign will be modified, perhaps so that  the figure is aiming a dove and an American Flag, instead of a gun.  </P> <P> Degradable garbage bags seem like a great concept. That's why City Councilman  Zev Yaroslavsky had the city's General Services Department look into the claims  by some companies that they had invented plastic bags that would (a) begin to  disintegrate when exposed to sunlight and (b) finish the process when buried in  landfills.  </P> <P> Alas, the agency's tests found that the bags stopped degrading when buried. And  if left above ground, they required 90 days of sunlight to disintegrate.  </P> <P> As one General Services agent noted, there could be a problem finding somewhere  to set thousands of bags of garbage outdoors for 90 days.  </P> <P> So, for now, degradable bags rank down there with such other failed  technological experiments at City Hall as a talking trash can (1983), which  contained a hidden speaker urging people not to litter, and battery-powered  toilets (1987-1988), whose pop-out plastic covers scared people.  </P> <P> It was speculated that one reason that Osco decided to resume the Sav-on name  at its Southland drug stores is that its moniker sounds like the Spanish word  asco, which means sickening.  </P> <P> That might come as a surprise to some Anglos, as would a few other translations  for melodious local names.  </P> <P> For instance, Restaurant Row is on ritzy Swamp Boulevard (La Cienega). Pacific  Palisades is the home of the fashionable Street of Fleas (Las Pulgas). And La  Canada Flintridge has its very own Vagrant Street (El Vago).  </P> <P> In honor of, or perhaps in spite of, Valentine's Day, Family Planning Centers  of Greater Los Angeles plan to distribute free condoms today at a booth on the  Venice boardwalk. The fashion-conscious will be pleased to know that designer  condoms are also available for a small charge.  </P></p>

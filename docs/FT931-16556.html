			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Putting a lid on Chile's chimneys - The slow process of cleaning up the world's biggest copper mine Seen from the air, the Atacama desert is like an ancient parchment, creased by mining trails and sun-bleached into faded hues of browns and greys. Miles before reaching Chuquicamata's huge crater, you can spot the world's biggest copper mine by tracing the pall of sulphurous smog across the cloudless sky. Chuquicamata's 14 furnaces smelt between 4,500 and 5,000 tonnes of copper concentrates around the clock. Their chimneys belch more than 750 tonnes of sulphur a day, as well as an undisclosed amount of arsenic and particulate matter. When the desert winds blow away from this vast complex, Chuquicamata's 10,000 workers and their families breathe more easily. When the winds turn, it can be suffocating. Eyes sting, bronchitis cases soar and children must be kept indoors. It used to be worse. Ruben Pedreros, Chuquicamata's environmental officer, says investment in two new furnaces has reduced sulphur dioxide emissions to half the levels of the mid-1980s. Five electrostatic precipitators, each the size of a four-storey building, have also decreased the arsenic and dust escaping into the air. However, he admits emissions are still way above internationally accepted health standards. Chuquicamata is about to embark on a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) clean-up programme, the costliest ever in Chile, to comply with new environmental regulations. The new law, which came into effect on January 1, imposes stringent controls on sulphur dioxide and dust emissions, but it also gives the worst offenders a 'reasonable' timescale to clean up their act. In Chuquicamata's case, this is expected to take until at least 1998. The time lag is dictated not by the scale of Chuquicamata's problems, but by the fact that it is owned by the state copper corporation, Codelco, whose budget is set by the Finance Ministry. Codelco has been ordered to stagger its environmental programme because the government is concerned about checking the levels of expenditure in the economy. As the biggest company and exporter in Chile, Codelco has an enormous impact on the country's overall economic activity: it produces 13 per cent of the world's copper, generates about one-fifth of the government's yearly income, and close to one-third of Chile's total exports. 'If we had the resources, we could solve Chuquicamata's pollution problems in two years,' says Pedreros. Instead, Chuquicamata's decontamination plan will be stretched out until the end of the decade, with a two-year hold-up after 1994 to allow Codelco to tackle Caletones, the copper smelter and refinery it owns south of Santiago. Jorge Bande, Codelco's research and development vice-president, says the corporation will be spending between 15 and 20 per cent of its investment budget - about Dollars 90m a year - on environmental control. The greatest expense at Chuquicamata will involve replacing the old furnaces with new blast ovens, which are more efficient at trapping gases. More vats will have to be built to store sulphuric acid - a by-product of treating the sulphur dioxide emissions - which is now being used to leach copper from Chuquicamata's discarded waste material. The new furnaces will be attached to electrostatic precipitators which collect the arsenic and dust particles released by the smelting process. The delays at implementing this programme, however, are potentially embarrassing for the government as it tries to act as regulator of the mining industry while owning the worst polluters. In addition to Codelco's three copper refineries, two other mining smelters are run by the state-owned Enami. In environmental terms, they are all in poor shape.</p>

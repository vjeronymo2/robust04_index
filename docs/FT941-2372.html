			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Hostage to US interest rates - The Emerging Investor In 1993, the flood of US money into overseas financial assets was one of the driving forces behind the bull market in the debt and equity of developing countries. Such was investors' appetite for foreign securities, that last year more US money poured into stock and bond markets in Asia and Latin America than in any previous 12-month period. Yet the past few months have not been so kind to emerging markets. In February, rising US long-term interest rates - which quickly pushed up rates in Europe - unnerved investors in emerging markets, leading to heavy selling of stocks and bonds. Since then, prices on most emerging markets have fallen, in many cases far enough to wipe out the gains earned from a strong start in January. How are US investors reacting to this unexpected setback? It is a crucial question, because if the recent declines prompt US investors to withdraw the money that has been keeping stock and bond prices in Latin America and Asia buoyant this past year, many emerging markets would be in danger of collapse. So far, however, there seem to be few signs of panic. According to traders and analysts in New York, most investment institutions, pension funds and insurance companies have reacted relatively calmly to the February and early March declines. Yet, the immediate outlook for emerging debt markets is not bright. The selling began when interest rates in the US and Europe began to rise sharply in early February. When bond prices in Latin America and other emerging markets began to tumble, US dealing houses were caught with sizeable long positions. With US funds, Japanese, European and US banks, and hedge funds also selling into a declining market, liquidity rapidly deteriorated, and 'the Street' (the US dealers) was left sitting on a mountain of emerging market debt which they could not shift. As one trader at a big US securities house explains: 'I have estimated - and the numbers check out with people around here - that there is between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 5bn of emerging market bonds on the Street that need to be moved along to clear up the inventory accumulation. This will not happen in days: it will take weeks, probably months.' Yet, there are buyers out there, says Mr Peter Frey, head of emerging markets institutional sales at JP Morgan in New York. 'The only consistent source of demand for bonds (recently) has come from US institutions, predominantly mutual funds and insurance companies.' Mr Frey says some US funds are buying because they believe that prices are heading in the right direction over the longer term. Also, he points out that US institutions have plenty of resources committed to tracking those markets. Mr Mark Siegel, head of emerging markets at Putnam, the US mutual fund group, agrees, and his funds have been buying recently because they lightened their positions at the end of 1993 and had cash to spare. 'If you kept your powder dry, based on the assumption that the shape of the price curve was ridiculous at the end of the year, you've been able to buy at bargain prices.' Yet, Mr Siegel admits, 'no matter how intellectually well briefed you might be, when you get into one of these downdrafts, it can be very uncomfortable'. While some US investors have been hunting bargains, there has still been a great deal of selling. Investors in some funds which specialise in emerging markets have seen money flowing out recently. The New Markets Income Fund run by Fidelity, the biggest US fund group, has shrunk in size from a peak of Dollars 358m at the end of January, to just Dollars 200m. Mr Robert Citrone, who runs the Fidelity fund, admits that there have been plenty of redemptions recently, but points out that the fund is only Dollars 38m smaller than it was at the start of 1994. 'The very short-term and trading-oriented investors felt they had to get out during the correction,' says Mr Citrone. Yet, he says, some of that money is beginning to trickle back, and the total amount that the entire Fidelity group has invested in emerging markets is up Dollars 1bn from the start of the year to Dollars 8.5bn. Mr Citrone says the big funds, which hold only pieces of emerging markets, viewed the recent losses as a good opportunity to buy cheaply. The situation is a little different in emerging equities markets, where the recent declines were not as worrying as they were in bonds. While there is evidence that some US investors have lightened their positions lately, Mr Juan Mesa, head of Latin American research at JP Morgan, points out that most of the damage in emerging stock markets was caused by domestic investors selling stocks. 'As we have seen with the Nafta situation in Mexico, the people who are the most frightened (by uncertainty) are always the locals.' Mr Mesa points out that if US investors had been big sellers of emerging markets in Latin America, trading volumes would have been very high. Yet, he says, volume has been low, most notably in Mexico, where average daily trading volume dropped from 190,000 shares a day in January to 130,000 in February and March. One US fund manager who has been selling emerging markets is Ms Kelly McDermott, who runs two global equity funds for the Dreyfus fund group in New York. Last year she had more than 35 per cent of her funds invested in emerging markets. That figure is now down to about 18 per cent, because, she says, 'the downside is bigger than the upside over the next few months.' Ultimately, the performance of emerging markets depends greatly on what happens to US interest rates. As Ms McDermott says: 'The bigger question is what happens to the overall flow of funds, and that will be dictated by what happens to interest rates. If you see money coming out of mutual funds generally, that will be a problem for emerging markets.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday Week on week change Stock                         Country        close   dollars        %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)         Brazil        0.0248    0.0045    22.41 Sadia Concordia Ind.

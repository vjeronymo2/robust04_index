			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (9): A buzzword chasing a trend - Client-server computing BUZZWORDS plague the computer industry. They come, they go, they confuse. 'Client-server' is no exception. It means many things to many people and trips off the tongues of suppliers with ease. However, at least in this case it seems to be a buzzword chasing a trend, rather than the other way around. That in itself suggests it is probably being driven by users. The concept is simple. A client computer sends a request over a network to a server computer which then carries out the task. Typically, the client will be a desktop personal computer and the server will be a mainframe or minicomputer, although it might just as easily be another workstation. The end-users at the client machines should not need to trouble themselves over the location of the server. The server might be on the next desk, it might be on a different continent. Basic client-server computing has been around for years but its potential has grown rapidly with the arrival of more robust networks, more sophisticated user interfaces and the ever greater quantities of power available on the desktop. An early and obvious example of client-server computing is the print server which enables a network of PCs to share one or more printers, rather than each PC having a dedicated printer of its own. A message is sent from the PC to the server and it prints the document. Benefit: fewer printers, less cost. Client-server computing allows the processing to be done where it is most suited and is similar in aim to the closely related distributed database and co-operative processing (holding data and running an application respectively across different platforms). 'To get client-server computing to work, you need good front-end software (typically a windows user interface), connectivity software such as LANmanager, and good back-end server applications,' says Mr Phil Buggins, networking division manager at Microsoft. The main thing that users really want to know about client-server computing is, of course: 'Why bother?' It is a valid question because adapting a client-server strategy can mean a fair bit of bother. Clearly, things become more complex. What could be more simple (or more secure) than having application, data and user interface on the same machine? As soon as you take one or more of these elements off the one computer, then complications arise. Take the simple printer/PC example. If each PC has its own printer, then there is no need to worry about print calls, queueing or about local or wide area networks. If not thought-out properly, then even this basic set-up can bring problems. If there are too few printers, then users can find themselves having to wait ages for their print-out. If the printer is some distance away, then regular users might find they spend a lot of time going to and fro. If the client and server run under different operating systems, then users are likely to experience the age-old problems of standards and inter-operability. In addition, as hardware and software applications multiply, then so too do selection and support headaches. As client-server computing evolves, it is not going to become any less complicated. There is, for instance, the potential for clients to also act as servers and vice versa. There will also be a growing role for object-oriented programming (which, as OOPs, is surely vying only with IBM's Statement Of Direction for the title of silliest acronym in the computer industry). OOPs will have a role to play as client-server computing moves more towards true reusable software. Application will be split into standard processes (objects), residing in different locations and called as, and when, required. So far, there are few off-the-shelf products which take advantage of client-server computing. Lotus Notes is an early example of an application which incorporates elements of client-server computing. Dubbed 'groupware,' it sits on top of the desktop operating system and allows users to share and jointly work on information across a network, as well as providing a development environment to enable users to built application based on the reusable services within Notes. Lotus has teamed up with IBM to incorporate Notes within the latter's office automation environment, Officevision. Tools for building client-server based applications are also thin on the ground. Those that are around tend to stem from small, niche suppliers or database and fourth generation language suppliers. Computer Power's Today client-server application development environment is one example. There is also something called 'middleware' (those buzzwords again) which seeks to tie together user interfaces, operating systems, applications and databases. Techgnosis's Sequelink is an example of this, supporting a range of client and server environments, network protocols and databases. Do the benefits of client-server computing outweigh the hassles? In a lot of cases the answer is yes, and many larger companies in particular are among the converts. Mr Buggins believes that as many as 70 per cent of corporations have started to implement elements of client-server computing. A big benefit is the cost-saving associated with doing processing on smaller machines. The performance of top-end workstations can match that of low-end mainframes today for a fraction of the cost, and there is no sign of the huge leaps in desktop performance ending. It is also potentially easier and cheaper to change the separate elements of a distributed environment. The systems are much more scalable: if you need power, add another server. But more than this, client-server computing provides users with greater flexibility to gather and make use of the mass of data within any organisation. At the same time, there is still the ability to control the environment centrally. Client-server computing really does seem to be driven by end-users sitting at their PCs and desiring seamless access to applications and data. To satisfy these rapidly growing end-user expectations, companies may well find themselves adopting elements of client-server computing, perhaps without really realising it. In doing so, they are seeking a solution, not chasing an industry fad. Quite rightly, this is the way of things in today's customer-driven computer industry.</p>

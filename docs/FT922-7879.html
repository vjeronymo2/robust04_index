			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Councils face delay over budget targets THE COUNCIL tax looks likely to run into trouble in its first year because the announcement of next year's overall local-government spending will probably be delayed. Meanwhile, ministers faced criticism when Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced that the government intended to 'cap' 10 councils' spending this year. Each July the government usually announces the maximum amount it believes local government should spend in the following financial year (total standard spending) and the total amount of external support through government grant and the business rate. This year, though, The Department of the Environment believes the statement may be delayed until October. The likelihood of a hold-up is being interpreted as a sign of how tight the coming public spending round will be. Environment ministers consider it vital to secure a reasonable revenue support grant for next year so that the first year of the council tax does not produce the sharp rises in bills that bedevilled the first year of the poll tax. One difficulty is that ministers still lack detailed information about the tax base for the council tax, under which bills will be based largely on the value of property in one of eight bands. The valuation exercise is not expected to be completed until the end of next month at the earliest. Until its results are available, ministers will have difficulty in knowing the scale of the transitional relief scheme they will want to put in place. A further complication is that the extra money to go to local authorities to take account of their new duties in providing community care has yet to be decided. The government is still considering whether to prohibit councils from spending the grant on other services. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, said that the Department of the Environment and the Treasury were 'locked in a battle which will leave local government the loser'. In the Commons, Tory and opposition MPs alike criticised the environment secretary's decision to cap the 10 councils' spending. Mr Howard said the move would mean reductions in the average poll tax in the 10 areas from Pounds 58 a payer in Basildon to Pounds 3 a payer in Gloucester, benefiting 1.8m payers. The councils have 28 days to challenge the decision. Tory backbenchers were among those who warned that the limits on spending would mean cuts in services. The Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities condemned the capping arrangements. When provisional capping criteria were set, the association said, that led almost all the other authorities to cut their budgets to avoid being capped. Mr Alan Howarth and Mr James Pawsey, Tory MPs for Stratford-on-Avon and for Rugby and Kenilworth respectively, joined Labour colleagues for Warwickshire in urging Mr Howard to relax the cap on Warwickshire. Mr Pawsey warned of the risk of 'a strongly adverse effect on the services being offered'. Mr Howard said he would look carefully at any representations made to him about the impact of standard spending assessments on capping, and that they were continually kept under review.  ---------------------------------- CAPPED COUNCILS  ---------------------------------- Authority           Control  ---------------------------------- Basildon            Con Hillingdon          Con Warwickshire        Con Greenwich           Lab Lambeth             Lab Middlesbrough       Lab Cheltenham          Lib Dem Gloucester          No overall Gloucestershire     No overall Langbaurgh          No overall  ----------------------------------</p>

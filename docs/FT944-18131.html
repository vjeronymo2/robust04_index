			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Delegate cheers conceal unease on future policy Mr Tony Blair's standing ovation from conference delegates concealed an undercurrent of unease about the future of the party's constitutional commitment to public ownership. Few went as far as Mr Arthur Scargill, the mineworkers' leader, who described the speech as 'an outright declaration of war' on Clause 4 of the constitution. But Mr Dennis Skinner, the MP for Bolsover, spoke for many on the left when he dismissed Mr Blair's proposal for a new statement of objectives as 'a totally unnecessary diversion'. Mr Skinner, a veteran leftwinger, said he would lead opposition to the review on the party's national executive committee, to which he was re-elected on Monday. Like other leftwingers he recalled the unsuccessful 1959 attempt to drop the public ownership clause by Hugh Gaitskell, the former Labour leader, who claimed that it alienated voters. 'We managed to save Clause 4 of the constitution, and Harold Wilson won four elections. It is not true that Clause 4 is a hindrance in winning power,' he said. Many of the delegates who cheered Mr Blair's speech appeared not to have realised the implications of his promise to bring forward a new statement of values. As one shadow minister put it, the loudest noise in the conference hall 10 minutes after Mr Blair sat down was the noise of pennies dropping. The word spread quickly. Less than an hour after Mr Blair sat down, the Socialist Campaign Group Supporters Network began calling for a fight to defend Clause 4. But most delegates were willing to trust Mr Blair. 'Clause 4 is all very well, but you can reach the same objectives by other means,' said Ms Angela McCallum, from Central Fife. Top union leaders were generally supportive. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said the speech had 'all the ingredients for a man who wants to be prime minister'. Mr Edmonds said he was reassured by the language of social justice and public control used by Mr Blair. If Clause 4 was replaced 'by a statement about the need for control over the most important industries in the terms that he used, then I don't think there will be any problem'. Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said Mr Blair had delivered 'the message that the public want to hear'. Labour had to 'break with the past, and that means tackling the sacred cows,' he said.</p>

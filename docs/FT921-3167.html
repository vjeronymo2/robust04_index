			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Opposition'Budget' to offer tax cuts LABOUR will today try to 'trump' the Budget by offering an alternative tax-cutting scheme under which personal allowances would more than double and the National Insurance contributions (NICs) structure would be altered. Party officials said its tax and benefits plan, due to be announced by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will make almost nine out of 10 families better off through changes targeted at the very poor and families on average incomes. They also hinted that the proposed 50p top rate of income tax would affect only those earning more than Pounds 40,000 a year. Yesterday, Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a BBC radio interview to accuse the Liberal Democrats and Labour of having a 'a fetish' for tax rises with very damaging implications for individuals and business. His claim was firmly denied by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader. While his party was ready to raise standard-rate tax by 1p to pay for better education programmes, Mr Ashdown insisted: 'We want taxes to be as low as they possibly can.' Mr Smith's scheme is intended to counter repeated accusations by senior Conservatives that his pledge to scrap the new 20p tax band amounts to increased taxes for the low-paid. It would raise allowances by more than double the 4.5 per cent annual inflation rate taking 750,000 people out of tax at a cost to the Treasury expected to be more than Pounds 800m. A central element in the scheme is the proposed abolition of the first band of NICs which imposes a 2 per cent levy on the first tranche of income of all those earning more than Pounds 52 a week. It is also understood that Mr Smith is reconsidering his plan to apply a 9 per cent National Insurance Contribution levy on unearned income above Pounds 3,000 to allow a more generous tax-free threshold. But Labour has abandoned a proposal to phase in the removal of the ceiling above which taxpayers stop paying NICs, currently about Pounds 21,000 of taxable income - the ceiling would be removed in Labour's first Budget. A Labour party official said the 'unprecedented' plan was an election-winning Budget that would kill the claim that Labour was the party of high taxation. 'The average family is going to be better off than they are under what Lamont offered last week,' he said. Yesterday, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, insisted: 'No Labour party that I ever lead will disadvantage people who are on medium or on lower incomes.' But his claims in a TV-am interview that Britain would have been better off had Labour won the 1983 election provoked derision from Tory cabinet ministers. 'You simply cannot trust him when he says he really has abandoned all the cranky notions that Labour argued so passionately for in their 1983 programme,' Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, said. Tory campaigners were taking heart from the warm reception given to Mr Major at a weekend party rally in Torquay. Addressing a Conservative central council meeting, he ruled out devolution for Scotland and dismissed the Liberal Democrats' insistence on electoral reform. Gloomy economic news is expected this week as a string of monthly indicators is released in the first full week of the election campaign. Markets await grim week, Page 20</p>

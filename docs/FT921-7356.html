			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Hidden costs of life assurance policies revealed THE COST of selling a life assurance policy in the UK can be up to 2 1/2 times the premiums paid by the policyholder in the first year, according to industry data supplied to the DTI. The data, never before publicly disclosed, also show that the cost of selling a new policy varies widely among life companies. According to the industry's own figures, nearly half of Britain's top companies need at least a full year's premium merely to cover the cost of making a sale. This means that a company selling a conventional 25-year mortgage-related endowment policy with premiums of Pounds 50 per month could need to retain about Pounds 600 of initial premiums merely to cover costs. The bulk of these charges is borne in the first years of the policy, so those who cash in their policies early receive negligible returns. Several companies with the highest cost ratios, including some of Britain's biggest, say some sales costs are borne by shareholders or paid from reserves. The detailed figures of 61 life companies are culled from the insurers' own reports on their 'with profits' business in 1989 and 1990. They were filed with the DTI. In 1991 the life assurance industry sold policies totalling Pounds 14.12bn in the UK. About half of those were with-profits policies. Insurance companies do not dispute the figures, though they describe them as 'crude'. They say that the wide variation in reported costs reflects many factors including the mix of business, the way costs are calculated by each company and the method by which policyholders are charged. However, Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body, said: 'On policies, the consumer eventually pays the acquisition cost, sometimes indirectly.' The 'price tag' of life assurance policies in the UK varies from 251 per cent of the first year's premiums, which Provident Life reported as the average cost of each new sale in 1990, to the 24 per cent recorded by Equitable Life in the same year. Current legislation does not require the life industry to make full disclosure of costs, in cash terms, to potential customers. The expense ratios revealed in DTI returns offer the first glimpse of the full costs of selling new policies. Ms Jean Eaglesham of the Consumers' Association was strongly critical of the combination of high initial expenses and high early lapse rates on policies. Consumers do not know the extent of their charges, she said. 'It allows companies to do what they like and hide behind an industry-wide figure which is not in cash terms and which consumers do not understand anyway.' Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance industry analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'The lower the ratio, the better the value for the customers, the shareholders and future generations of policy holders.' The Association of British Insurers, a trade group, is fighting proposals by regulators which would require each company to disclose more about its own expenses to prospective customers. 'To allow company-specific expenses in illustrations could give a potentially misleading advantage to companies with low current expenses,' the ABI said in a paper submitted to the Securities and Investments Board. The revelations follow a report by the SIB last year showing that a quarter to a third of all policies are cancelled within the first two years. Mr Jebens said the front-ended nature of sales expenses meant that it would take seven to 10 years on average before the holder of a 20-year policy even earned back premiums paid. The data are bound to fuel the debate among regulators about how life assurance sales agents should disclose costs to consumers. The SIB and Lautro are engaged in a debate with the insurance industry over the format of a new disclosure regime set to be proposed next month. Actuaries caution that the data from the DTI reports are only a rough guide to charges and should be treated with caution. 'There is a correlation between expenses and charges, but it is not a perfect one,' said Mr Chris Hairs, actuary at Legal and General and chairman of the disclosure working party of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Mr Hairs said the data reflect costs across all categories of business. Different types of policies may have different costs than implied by the data, he said. Some high expense ratios may reflect one-off investments in technology or reorganisation that will reduce costs in later years. Some companies are writing large volume group business with low overheads, which lowers the average shown in the DTI data. Individual sales, however, may carry higher costs.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Double blow for postal sell-off Government plans to privatise the Post Office have received a double blow from Ulster Unionist MPs and Conservative constituency associations. With the cabinet set to decide soon whether to proceed with the sale of 51 per cent of Royal Mail, the nine Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster have sent a formal submission to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, saying they oppose the move. Meanwhile, a poll of the people who chair Conservative constituency associations has indicated that even these party ultra-loyalists favour keeping the Post Office in the public sector - but with greater commercial freedom. The government's proposals have met with a succession of critical responses in recent weeks, culminating on Friday when they were roundly condemned by the industry's leading user group. Leading supporters of privatisation within the cabinet such as Mr Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have recently appeared confident that formal approval for the sell-off would be granted. But Mr John Major has not yet made up his mind. The prime minister is wary about the potential political cost of a decision which Labour says will signal a significant rundown in rural post services and the closure of many village Post Offices. Unionist opposition would significantly increase the risk of embarrassing Commons defeats for the government. Dissident Tory backbenchers have been calling for a minority sale of Royal Mail, with the government retaining 51 per cent of the shares. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said that Unionists did not 'like the idea of the Royal Mail ceasing to operate' in Ulster. 'I have had more letters on this subject in the last four weeks than on any subject for the last 10 years,' he said. The MORI survey of more than 100 of the people who chair Tory constituency associations was commissioned by Post Office unions. It found that 57 per cent of those questioned favoured keeping all the Post Office in the public sector. Mr Heseltine's favoured option is to privatise Royal Mail and Parcelforce while hiving off the Post Office's Counters division, which is responsible for high-street and village Post Offices, into a separate organisation in the public sector.</p>

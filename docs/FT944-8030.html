			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / People: Purslow doffs his hat Most fathers would be pleased if their sons got a job in investment banking  -especially if the post was a directorship at CS First Boston and the son was only 30. Most fathers would be pleased; but not Christian Purslow's. 'He was disappointed,' says Purslow junior. For the Purslows own Grenson Shoes and royal hatters Herbert Johnson. Christian Purslow sits as a non-exec-utive director on the family board, where he will remain, but his father Terry had wanted him to take on an executive role. Christian Purslow did once work for Grenson Shoes, but not as an executive. In his holidays from university he worked in the Northampton shoe factory. One eight-week job was to empty a shed of wooden lasts, the blocks from which Grenson artisans stitch the shoes. Christian Purslow did the work 'for love' and about Pounds 1 an hour. From then on, Christian Purslow's career has gone up and up. He left Cambridge in 1986; he worked first for the Lek Partnership and then for Sir Ralph Halpern of the Burton Group, where he advised on corporate strategy. That is where he met Stephen Hester of CS First Boston. Hester tried to entice him into banking then but Purslow went to Reuters Holdings to head global new business for the financial information group. It is only now that he has been tempted away. 'I have been trying to get Christian Purslow to join us for the past five years and he finally accepted on Friday night,' Hester said last week.</p>

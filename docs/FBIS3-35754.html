The Russian president's press service says the decree was  signed in view of the fact that tensions persist in some areas  of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic because  of the unsatisfactory implementation of the Russian president's  decree of 13 December 1993 "On the procedure for a return to the  places of permanent residence of refugees and displaced persons  on the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush  Republic," in view of the continuing sabotage and exchanges of  fire, and also with the aim of ensuring state and public  security -- in accordance with the RSFSR law "On state of  emergency" and the Russian Federation law "On security."</p>

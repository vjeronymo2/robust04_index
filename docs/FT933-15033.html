			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A string of problems YOUR REPLY to the letter 'Wife can't be used as a tax puppet' (May 29/30) caused us concern. Like many married couples, we have endeavoured to take advantage of the legislation on separate taxation of women by equalising our resources. I gave my wife my tax-free lump sum on retirement, and wrote a simple letter to her confirming this gift. She invested it in the Britannia Capital Trust postal account in her sole name. Although I am an authorised signatory (in the event of her demise), I have never used this power. It is necessary that the income from this investment, together with my pensions, are used for our living expenses. These are paid into a joint account for this purpose. Any capital that is available is paid into her Capital account. Our anxiety is that, during these past three years, my wife has purchased from her Capital account three general personal equity plans (in her name and mine), three single-company Peps (in each name), and two Tessas. We each select the shares in our own Peps. Where does the dividing line occur? Are we transgressing Inland Revenue rules? It is impossible to say where the dividing line falls - or, to be precise, only the courts can say where it falls in any particular case, having regard to all the evidence. As we have explained in replies over the past four years or so, the anti-avoidance provisions of (inter alia) section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are widely drawn. On the other hand, the Revenue makes it clear - in, for example, the free booklet IR83 (Independent taxation: a guide for tax practitioners)  - that, in practice, it does not always follow the rules laid down by parliament in 1989 to stop married couples entering into tax-avoidance arrangements. If you have not yet seen a copy, we suggest that you ask your tax office for the free booklet IR83. After reading it, you and your wife must either each make up your mind on whether you consider you are covered by the extra-statutory concessions outlined in the booklet (bearing in mind the general warning: 'A concession will not be given in any case where an attempt is made to use it for tax avoidance'); or talk decide if you should seek professional guidance through the tax minefield from a local accountant or solicitor. A third course of action would be for each of you to make a complete disclosure of the facts to your respective tax inspectors - and then wait to see if retrospective assessments are made (carrying interest and penalties for late disclosure of liabilities under section 674A etc.). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

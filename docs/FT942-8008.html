			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel: No survival kit necessary - Visiting many east European cities is a pleasant surprise after Russia I set off recently for eastern Europe with the pugnacious attitude and survival kit - cigarettes, US dollars in small, unmarked bills, and snack food - that would be necessary for travelling in the former Soviet Union. In the old, communist days, eastern Europe was only a slightly kinder, gentler version of the Soviet Union, and in Russia these days travel has, in some respects, become more difficult. But my painstaking preparations proved unnecessary. The eastern European heartland of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary has successfully emerged from the Warsaw Pact, and now have some of the highest rates of economic growth on the continent. The first pleasant surprise was the new Warsaw airport. It is clean, well-lit and easy to pass through. Most Europeans and US citizens can enter the country without a visa, but even the Greeks, Turks and Canadians who do require visas can purchase them from friendly border guards for Pounds 30. Visas, like almost everything else in Poland, are sold for zloty, the national currency, which, after its flirtation with hyper-inflation, is on its way to stability. Changing money straightaway at the airport is a better idea than expecting to pay in dollars. The average fare for the half-hour ride from the airport to the city is about Dollars 15 and Polish cabbies are polite, likely to speak at least rudimentary English, and charge according to the meter. It is worthwhile chatting to your driver, because Warsaw's cityscape - the legacy of Poland's fierce resistance to Nazi Germany - is unfailingly bleak. The communist-era eyesores, however, do offer one benefit: unlike better-preserved east European cities, Warsaw is relatively free of tourists, making hotel and restaurant reservations easier. The best place to stay is the gleaming Marriot Hotel, whose shiny towers in the center of the city are striking evidence of the arrival of capitalism in Poland. For a more authentically Polish experience, have lunch or supper at the Belvedere Restaurant, perched on the corner of a park - 20 minutes from the centre - where, legend has it, Polish kings used to retire for trysts with their mistresses. From Warsaw, it is an hour's flight to Prague, where the airport, border controls and taxi service are likewise hassle-free. The similarities end upon arrival in the city itself. Czech pragmatism preserved Prague from devastation during the second world war, and communism protected it from the excesses of the capitalist developers. Prague remains one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. The Czech capital has become a popular destination for a nomadic tribe of American college graduates, who spend a year soaking up the atmosphere of older civilizations and hanging out, before joining the real world of suits and CVs. Czech officials claim Prague was one of the most visited capitals in the continent last year. For business people, this is a drawback. Finding a hotel room in the city, especially after the summer tourist season begins, can be a nightmare. Avoid it by booking rooms well in advance, especially if you want to stay at the magnificient art deco Hotel Europa, which is already receiving reservations for July. As a last resort, hotel booking services at the airport can usually be adequate. I fled the tour groups, easily identified by the brightly coloured umbrellas held aloft by their guides, and took to the hills in a car rented from one of the half dozen western agencies with offices in the centre of the city. The gently rolling Bohemian countryside, dotted with medieval fortresses, is a Euro Disney fantasy but without the crowds. Less than 150km south of Prague, on narrow but quiet, well-maintained roads, the walled town of Cesky Krumlov, dominated by a castle on hills overlooking the twisting Vltava river, makes a particularly pretty day trip. From southern Bohemia, Budapest is a bucolic four-hour drive (most car-rental agencies permit drop-offs in other cities). Travel via Austria: the roads are better and the borders are civilised. Best of all, the contrast, or lack of it, between the Czech, Austrian and Hungarian border towns is heartening evidence of how quickly eastern Europe is catching up with the rest of the continent in terms of living standards. The Hungarian capital itself combines Prague's architectural charm with Warsaw's grittier economic dynamism. Do not be put off by the airport, which is slightly drabber than those of the other eastern capitals, or the language, which is impenetrable to travellers with no knowledge of Finnish or Estonian. Just three hours by train from Vienna, Budapest is arguably the most cosmopolitan city in eastern Europe, with fine, comfortable hotels - try the Kempinski on the Pest side of the city - and dozens of lively restaurants and night-clubs.</p>

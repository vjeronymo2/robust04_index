			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / S African sackings likely to fuel militancy TWO LARGE-SCALE sackings of striking workers in South Africa are expected to fuel shopfloor militancy and bolster the mass action campaign of the African National Congress and its trade union ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu). The dismissal this week of 6,000 workers at the Toyota assembly plant in Durban follows the sacking of 7,400 state health workers by the Transvaal Provincial Administration (TPA). Although both strikes preceded the start of the mass action campaign, they have assisted Cosatu's efforts to raise the level of industrial activity culminating in a general strike next month. A Cosatu official said the dismissals were 'adding fuel to the fire' of already high levels of industrial action. Andrew Levy and Associates, a labour research group, estimates that 650,000 working days were lost in the first half of 1992 compared to 375,000 in the same period in 1991. There is already evidence that the large-scale dismissals will provoke widespread solidarity action from other unions. Meanwhile Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday held talks with business leaders about the political impasse in the country. The business group held similar talks last week with President F W de Klerk and with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader. Mr Mandela said he was 'very encouraged' by the talks which had 'narrowed the gaps between us'. The business delegation conveyed its disapproval of mass action saying 'a groundswell of opinion is rising that we cannot support actions which will further damage or destroy the economy or bring more violence or disruption in its wake.' Toyota claims that strike activity this year has cost it 45 days of production or R675m (Pounds 128m) in lost turnover. Last month the Reserve Bank reported that the economy had contracted at an annualised rate of 2 per cent during the first quarter. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday offered to send Mr Cyrus Vance, the US diplomat, on a mission to South Africa and the Security Council scheduled a debate for next week on the political crisis, Reuter reports from the UN. Diplomats said the plan for a goodwill mission had not yet received agreement from Pretoria or the ANC.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the news): Wagoner rides ever higher at General Motors To say that Richard Wagoner's rise to the top of General Motors has been meteoric is to risk understatement, writes Martin Dickson. Two years ago, at the age of 39, he was plucked from Brazil, where he was head of GM's operations, to become the group's chief financial officer. Last week he was promoted again, to run GM's North American vehicle operations (NAO) - the troubled heart of the world's largest industrial company. And he is still only 41. Little wonder, then, that he has emerged as the front-runner eventually to succeed Jack Smith, GM's 56-year-old chief executive, who gained the position after a boardroom coup in 1992 and has been running NAO himself until now. Smith displayed his confidence in Wagoner last year when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the volatile Spaniard who had been running GM's worldwide parts purchasing operation, suddenly quit this key position - and an offer to head NAO - to join Volkswagen. Smith added the Lopez job to Wagoner's finance portfolio. Wagoner is a tall, extremely articulate man with self-deprecating sense of humour and a maturity of manner beyond his years. He oozes leadership and as finance chief won over Wall Street with his clear, frank briefings on GM's problems. After gaining a Harvard MBA in 1977 he joined GM's New York treasury department - also Mr Smith's training ground - and then saw widespread experience abroad, with two spells in Brazil, one in Canada and two years in Europe in charge of finance. Wagoner faces a huge challenge at NAO, which will return to the black this year but is a long way from producing a decent financial return. It employs too many workers and bureaucrats, with lower productivity than rival manufacturers, making too many vehicles which lack design flair and are poorly marketed. Wagoner's firm but friendly style, methodical approach to problems and desire to build consensus should help him in slimming GM in co-operation with the group's union leadership. He has gone some way to smoothing relations with GM's part suppliers, who were angered by Lopez's confrontational approach. 'He listens well and has a desire to bring people together more,' says one supplier. As head of Brazilian operations in 1991-92, he is reputed to have brought in the kind of cultural change and lean production systems now required at NAO. A potential weakness is that he comes - like Mr Smith - from the financial side of GM, rather than motor manufacturing. He may thus find it hard to produce the kind of engineering excitement and design flair that many GM vehicles badly need. Still, he may be able to make GM vehicles more attractive to a segment of the market where it is badly lagging - young Americans. He's almost one himself.</p>

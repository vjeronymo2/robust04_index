			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sharp improvement at Bangkok Bank BANGKOK Bank, Asia's largest regional bank outside Japan, reported a jump in first-quarter net profits to Bt3.7bn (Dollars 148m) from Bt2.4bn in 1992. Analysts in Bangkok said that although the figures included extraordinary gains, notably from the Bt100m sale of land on the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok, the bank's forecast of a 20 per cent profits growth this year looks easily achievable. Net profits in 1992 rose to Bt10.54bn from Bt7.3bn in 1991. In spite of increased competition and an economic slowdown the Bangkok Bank continues to benefit from a wide spread between deposit and lending interest rates and its dominance in corporate lending. The bank accounts for around a quarter of total deposits in Thailand. The spread between what it charges prime borrowers and its six-month savings rate is now 3.75 per cent. First-quarter outstanding loans totalled Bt599bn in the quarter, up from Bt520bn last year. The bank is trying to reduce its reliance on corporate lending by emphasising high margin retail lending and investment banking. Non-interest revenue rose to Bt2.3bn from Bt1.7bn.</p>

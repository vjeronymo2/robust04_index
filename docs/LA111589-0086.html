The union leader was severely beaten during a demonstration  against then-Vice President George Bush during a campaign stop in San Francisco  last year. The deputy chief had been accused of authorizing the removal of a  document from the personnel file of an officer accused of beating Huerta. With  his retirement, Jack Jordan will no longer face administrative charges before  the city's Police Commission.  </P></p>

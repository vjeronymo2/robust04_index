			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chi Yen-ling (4764 1693 7117): "This Hundred </F> Year Old Shop is Still Selling Moldy Ancient Relics"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    The university law is a "not very political" or even a "non  political" law, but today when Taiwan society has long since  entered the "post-martial law" period, the Kuomintang [KMT]  continues to regard universities with a kind of political  martial law point of view. The role of political indoctrinators  and political parties on campuses not only has not been  eliminated or reduced as the result of "post-martial law"  structural changes; instead it has acquired greater legal  standing and greater support than during the martial law era.  Looked at with a "post-martial law" view, the product of martial  law is old goods in old garb that are more martial than martial  law. How can it be regarded as other than an ancient relic? Of  course, the things that hundred year old shops sell are rich in  "historical value."    At each election time, the KMT pulls out all stops to win  over the public. It breaks its neck repaying the debts it owes;  it goes all out to resolve grievances; and it writes all the  checks that it has to write. From the chairman of the party to  the candidates for office, everyone says nice things and thinks  of all possible ways to coax and humbug the electorate into  going to polling places to vote. But once the voting is over,  the KMT reverts to its old ways. It will not budge on areas it  must guard, and it will not relent on time it wants to control.  Old debts are repaid only to incur new ones, and old grievances  are resolved only to be replaced by new ones. The wider gap  today between the KMT and the intellectuals on amendment of the  university law is a classic example.    The fact is that for several years prior to amendment of the  university law, the percentage of "non-KMT" or "anti-KMT" people  on college campuses, from professors to students, has gradually  increased. In recent years, in particular, in the aftermath of  several large and small student demonstrations, the political  position of many college students has tilted more and more  toward the opposition party. Following graduation, college  students who played the role of student movement leaders, either  go into jobs helping opposition party candidates run for  election, or become assistants to opposition party legislators.  An even larger number rush off to opposition party candidate  headquarters to volunteer whenever an election occurs. In  addition, each time those in charge of student groups have been  re-elected in recent years, most have been elected from among  opposition party students. This also makes clear the political  atmosphere on college campuses today.    Of course, college campuses still have very many professors  and students who are strongly loyal to the KMT, but with each  student campaign, the number who are strongly loyal to the KMT  declines somewhat. This is a plain fact. During the past several  years, the KMT has "fostered" and "created" quite a few  opposition party elite in colleges. The "March Student Campaign"  of more than three years ago was such a case; the "100 Actions  League" of two years ago was such a case; and the present  campaign to "rescue the university law" is naturally no  exception.    During the martial law period, whether political  indoctrinators and political parties should leave college  campuses may have been a substantive issue, but today the issue  of whether political indoctrinators and political parties should  leave simply cannot generate any real effect on college students  whose independence is increasing daily. No matter how ferocious  political indoctrinators may be, the students can simply ignore  them; and no matter how pervasive political parties, the  students can make their own choice. Nevertheless, today the  matter of political indoctrinators and political parties leaving  or not leaving has become a symbolic issue. Leaving denotes an  open frame of mind; not leaving denotes a conservative frame of  mind. This is the main reason for the linking of hands by  students and professors in opposition to amendment of the  university law.    Superficially, the KMT has won in the university law  amendment process, but ill will between the intellectuals and  the KMT has deepened. This is the grievous price that the KMT  must pay. The percentage of this generation of college students  to go over to the opposition party camp will consequently  increase. This is the second price the KMT must pay. The  university law amendment process also makes the public realize  once again the true face of the hundred year old KMT shop. It  attests once again that the KMT speaks nothing but pretty lies,  that it is an old political party with a thoroughly conservative  frame of mind, and that Li Teng-hui's "changing into new garb,"  and "selling new goods" is nothing more than a deceptive slogan.  This is an even greater price that the KMT must pay. The KMT  obtained a university law, but it lost confidence and an image.  Whether the KMT has gained or lost is clear.</p>

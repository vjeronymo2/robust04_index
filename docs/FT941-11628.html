			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Siebe calls end to 'dinosaur war' Peace has broken out in the 'dinosaur war' - a bitter and abusive struggle for market share between two of the world's leading suppliers of advanced process control systems. A settlement has been agreed between Honeywell, the US giant which dominates the world market, and Foxboro, the Massachusetts-based subsidiary of Siebe, the UK engineering group. Under the agreement, Foxboro will tell its sales force to stop a 'dinosaur advertising campaign' and related promotional activities, which - without naming Honeywell - claimed that competitive products were obsolete. Honeywell will tell its sales force not to distribute to customers sales training material directed at Foxboro and not to make statements which criticise its competitor. An agreed statement said: 'Both parties intend to vigorously compete in future by concentrating on promoting the advantages of their own companies and products.' If hostilities have indeed ceased, it will be a novel working situation for sales staff and executives in both groups. When the UK group bought Foxboro for Dollars 656m (Pounds 437m) in 1990, the then chairman and chief executive of the US company was quoted as saying Siebe intended to 'bury' Honeywell. Mr Barrie Stephens, the chairman and forceful founder of the modern Siebe, once startled a meeting of analysts by saying: 'I see the chairman of Honeywell mentioned us twice in his last statement. We must be getting the son of a bitch worried.' Mr Allen Yurko, who took over as chief executive from Mr Stephens at the beginning of the year, said he was very pleased with the settlement of the legal action, which was launched by Foxboro. 'It resolves the issue and gets us all back to the promotion of our own products.' Competition is fiercest at the top end of the process control market, where automation systems are used to control everything from oil refineries to food processing plants. Foxboro yesterday said it had won a batch of international contracts worth more than Pounds 36m in recent months. Four of the largest contracts - each worth more than Pounds 5m - are for the group's Intelligent/Automation (I/A) Series, which Mr Yurko said was a technological leader. One of the largest orders is from the Chiyoda Corporation of Japan, for a liquefied natural gas plant in the Gulf state of Qatar. Another is the modernisation of the Kuwait National Petroleum Company's Mina Al Ahmadi refinery, the first major modernisation project undertaken by KNPC since the Gulf War. Mr Yurko said this confirmed there was a vibrant market for process control updates in the Middle East. Other large orders were in Thailand and Argentina.</p>

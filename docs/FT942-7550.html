			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Sweeney looking to raise BBA's profile Being the public face of British banks might be thought an unattractive task, given the degree of opprobrium the industry now attracts. Yet Tim Sweeney says he was keen to become director general of the British Bankers' Association. Sweeney, a 49-year-old career Bank of England man, will take over from Lord Inchyra, the current director general, who retires at the end of September after six years. He says that he has yet to decide how to develop the association. Providing a stronger public lobbying voice for banks will be an important part of his task, since some BBA member banks have looked enviously at the comparatively high public profile achieved by the Building Societies Association. The BBA was formed in 1919 as a forum for the banks in the august forum of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers to talk to their provincial counterparts; it became the main UK banking body when the CLSB disappeared in 1991. Lord Inchyra oversaw that reform, and the abolition of two-tier membership two years ago to allow foreign banks parity with the UK ones. 'The interest and loyalty of some of the foreign banks was starting to wear a bit thin,' says Inchyra. Running the BBA involves an assortment of duties, from carrying out research and lobbying for its 320 members, to providing a voice for British banks. The latter role has grown in importance as criticism of banks has intensified. Sweeney, who is currently responsible for deploying and developing the Bank's graduate staff after spells in banking supervision and in money markets, says he feels 'the voice of banking deserves to be heard'.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways The postponement of Qantas's flotation highlights the clouds of uncertainty swirling around British Airways' strategy of buying minority shareholdings in foreign airlines. Given the highly politicised nature of the industry, BA may always struggle to exert control over such investments, which raises doubts about whether they will ever generate adequate returns. The Australian government's reshuffle of its privatisation priorities has ensured Qantas will not now be floated until late next year. This creates further confusion. It also delays the day BA will receive a dividend income from its 25 per cent stake, bought at a cost of Pounds 304m. Much attention has focused on BA's controversial Pounds 198m investment in USAir. Doubts have been raised about whether BA can forge sufficiently close links to justify the price paid. But at least USAir's preference shares yield a fixed income. Besides, BA is already showing a fair paper profit on its holding. It may take far longer for Qantas to show its worth. The carrier should eventually derive benefits from integrating Australian Airlines. It should also see good profits uplift once the lousy airline market improves. BA's shareholders who stumped up Pounds 442m to bankroll BA's global ambitions must certainly hope as much.</p>

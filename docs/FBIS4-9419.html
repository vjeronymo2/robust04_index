			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Janusz Goscinski of the Warsaw </F> University Administration Faculty by correspondent Ryszarda  Socha; place and date not given]    [Text] [Socha] Professor Dariusz Rosati [candidate for  the vacant posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister]  maintains that, during the past three months of the left-wing  government, its policy line has been reoriented toward the goal  of economic growth. Can we really discern such a change?    [Goscinski] Claims of having entered the path of economic  growth were made even earlier that that, by Hanna Suchocka. I  believe that talk about economic growth is an exaggeration, but  it is fairly certain that we are no longer facing the threat of  a recession, and there also are some signs of economic revival.  Industrial output in February of this year was more than 10  percent higher than in February of last year. Nevertheless, it  was still lower than in February 1989.    [Socha] Even so, we can presumably take it for granted that  recession has been overcome, can we not?    [Goscinski] We have had so many months of successive growth  that it can be regarded as a definite tendency. However, in my  opinion, for the time being this trend is based on weak  foundations because there is an absence of significant  investment. Present outlays on investment, in both the state and  the private sector, do not even ensure simple reproduction.  Consequently, the technical condition of enterprises  deteriorates steadily and that does not bode well in the long  run. We can expect an economic boost when outlays on investment  begin to grow faster than production.    [Socha] Prof. Rosati presented the tenets of his  socioeconomic policy in the national press. How do you view his  concepts? Is their author the person who can provide the answer  our economy currently needs?    [Goscinski] Let me tell you what I think in perfectly  unequivocal terms: Of all the economists I know, Rosati is to  all intents and purposes the only one who has recently presented  a sensible proposal that will give a realistic chance for our  economy. It is hard for me to ascertain whether his  administrative talents would make him a good prime minister or  minister. He has not yet had a chance to prove himself in such  a way. In this, we are reminded of Leszek Balcerowicz before  him: After all, Balcerowicz, who was also a practising  academic, later demonstrated that he was also a good  administrator. Rosati seems to resemble him in this aspect.  This is not to say that I believe that Marek Borowski [recently  dismissed finance minister] was a worse proposition, but I am  still personally inclined to value Rosati more.    [Socha] What do you believe to be the strongest point of his  blueprint?    [Goscinski] First of all, his emphasis on the need to  invest. Second, the absence of a fiscal angle, which was,  unhappily, demonstrated by all of the earlier deputy prime  ministers responsible for the economy. Rosati is the fist one  who says that there is no need to increase taxation. On the  contrary, he says the opposite. This year nothing more can be  done in this matter anyway. The budget is as it is. And, if  the president fails to sign the budget, I believe the Sejm will  find the strength to reject the president's veto by a majority  of two-thirds of all votes. The state cannot function without a  budget, and it is pointless to go on using interim solutions.  However, if Rosati is able to put his plan into practice next  year, a decrease in tax liabilities would be quite realistic.  This would, in any case, be closely connected with tax  concessions for investment projects. You cannot strangle the  economy with the taxation noose and then expect people to be  willing to invest.    [Socha] GAZETA WYBORCZA promotes the view, articulated in  its columns by Janusz Jankowiak, that Rosati is opposed to  Balcerowicz's ideas.    [Goscinski] I do not share this opinion. I believe that  Rosati's program would reinforce the functioning of free market  principles in the economy, counteract inflation, and, at the  same time, promote economic growth. After all, Rosati would not  start from the same point of departure as Balcerowicz: He would  begin at a point long after the one where Balcerowicz stopped.    [Socha] It seems rather obvious that the new finance  minister must take into account both the positive and the  negative results of the decisions made by his predecessors.    [Goscinski] Precisely. After all, a crisis of the public  finance system had already begun toward the end of Bielecki's  administration and was manifested with full strength during the  Suchocka government; after all, a budget deficit usually grows  with the speed of an avalanche. Please compare the balance of  the 1992, 1993, and 1994 budgets. You will see that the sum  doubles each time, while the inflation rate is no more than  30-odd percent. This means that the state's share in both public  income and public expenditure keeps growing all the time. This  is precisely the anti-Balcerowicz situation. However, it is not  Dariusz Rosati or Marek Borowski that Mr. Balcerowicz should  congratulate for this state of affairs: It is Suchocka and  Osiatynski because it was they who created it.    [Socha] On the one hand, the average citizen keeps hearing  about the new economic growth, so he naturally expects to see  its effects influence the contents of his wallet, and, on the  other, he keeps hearing about a "budgetary gap." He is made to  pay ever higher taxes, while, at the same time, he is informed  that there is not enough money in the kitty for hospitals,  social welfare provisions, the upgrading of old age and  disability pensions, the police, the Army, and virtually  everything else. Consequently, many people ask themselves where  their money really goes....    [Goscinski] Here, as it happens, I would be inclined to  agree with Janusz Korwin-Mikke [Union for Real Politics  chairman]. The more the state takes from and redistributes  among its citizens, the worse the consequences for the public.  Public officials are really not best qualified to decide what  our money should be spent on. Of course, we cannot count on the  assumption that the public sector expenditure will increase in  the coming years. On the contrary, it is inevitable that the  public will be burdened with the requirement to pay for an  increasing number of public services. The problem lies in the  fact that, at the same time, we are forced to launch new schemes  and ventures, which we cannot afford and which could perfectly  well have been put on the back burner to await better times,  such as the unfortunate brainchild of Suchocka's  administration--that is, the creation of new districts. Just  think how much money was sunk in that project. And what about  each successive election campaign we have had? We know very  well that trillions of zlotys [Z] were spent on them! And all  in order to ensure that relations between individual power  agencies were shaped in this or that way, according to the  manipulators' intentions. The public has not benefited from any  of that in any way. On the contrary, you could say that it is  forced to meet the costs of the state's upkeep because the state  does not know how to manage its resources....    [Socha] The economy is nowadays regarded increasingly as a  field for political maneuvering or even political skirmishes.  To begin with, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski became a casualty  of this state of affairs. Now, the president seems to have  eliminated Rosati from the competition even before the start of  the game....    [Goscinski] It is not only the economy that is receiving  such treatment--it is also the entire political system. A  friend of mine from Canada asked me recently whether I saw even  one true politician among all of the people involved in the  discharge of power nowadays. I told him I did not--and he  replied that he was fully in agreement with me. As he watched  the situation from his distant position in Canada, for a short  while after the 19 September [1993] election he pinned some  hopes on Kwasniewski, who at that time was dubbed a likely  "super prime minister." Unfortunately, Kwasniewski has shown  himself to be a less than mediocre politician. After all, the  Borowski affair began when Kwasniewski was absent on a visit to  Davos. And immediately afterward, if I remember correctly, he  went to Brussels, where he was as much use as a goat in a field  of cabbage: just another deputy leading a group of delegates  from his party's parliamentary caucus. Even as Borowski was  offering to resign his post, he was convinced, in his political  naivete, much as Clemenceau was in 1912, that his resignation  would not be accepted and that he was actually holding everyone  in check. The moves in these two political games were virtually  identical. Kwasniewski returned from his trips abroad; he then  assured reporters, who swarmed around him as he was leaving  Pawlak's office, that everything was in order; then, in the  evening, toward the end of the TV news program, Pawlak announced  that he accepted Borowski's resignation. This was tantamount to  a government crisis. However, at the same time, the Lillehammer  Olympic games were starting--and, of course, Mr. Kwasniewski's  attendance was absolutely indispensable there. So he left the  whole mess behind and went to spend almost a week at  Lillehammer. Surely this demonstrates complete political  irresponsibility! Just imagine a situation where, in the face  of the eruption of a major fire, the chief fire-fighting officer  says: "I will attend to putting it out when I come back from my  vacation." At that moment, Kwasniewski forever condemned  himself in my eyes as a politician. If he had been president,  the situation would have been just as bad as it is now with  Walesa in that office. Neither one nor the other has the  political imagination to visualize the consequences of his  various political actions a week, a month, six months, or a year  later. They just do not have what it takes to be a statesman.    [Socha] In view of the president's position, it would seem  that there is not much point for the government coalition to go  on insisting on Prof. Rosati's candidacy for the post of finance  minister.    [Goscinski] Unless someone intends to provoke a deliberate  conflict with the Belweder and use Rosati as a pretext.    [Socha] Even so, we should still regret if not the man, then  his concept, which, if your prognoses were to come true, could  bring us clear economic advantages.    [Goscinski] I believe that the president is actually  interested in keeping the government as weak as possible. The  stronger the government's social, economic, and political  position, the more difficult it will be for Walesa to play his  games with it. Whenever I hear anyone claim that what is at  stake is Poland's interests or reasons of state, I cringe  because it usually turns out that it is only someone's  particular interests that are at stake.    [Socha] As I observe the number of sensible people who  remain on the margins of political life and see that the  supposed democratic mechanisms offer them no discernible  support, I begin to fear more and more that we will either  continue drifting in this way indefinitely or some compulsory  shock therapy will have to be applied.    [Goscinski] THis is precisely what Lech Walesa is hoping  for. In his eyes, such drifting--that is, indefinitely  preventing a cohesive power apparatus from functioning  properly--means that the only solution possible is an  enlightened absolutism.    [Socha] But how many people would be inclined to see the  embodiment of such "enlightened absolutism" in the person of  Lech Walesa?    [Goscinski] I do not believe he realizes this. Politicians  who are aware of their intellectual limitations are not  particularly dangerous. The real danger is posed by those who  are in love with themselves--and, which is worse, who  reciprocate the sentiment!    [Socha] Professor, I keep returning stubbornly to economic  issues. What happens to the economy when it is, as at present,  left, so to speak, to its own devices?    [Goscinski] If it were left to its own devices, it would  most probably not suffer too much damage, if I may say so. When  that happens, the economy usually continues functioning, powered  by the momentum of its own mechanisms. The problem is that, in  our case, it is not left to its own devices. The other  ministers in office keep up their activities, and each of them  pulls in his own direction. You cannot say that there is no  governmental intervention at all. But there is the absence of a  conceptual center that would watch over the whole. And Prime  Minister Pawlak does not have sufficient economic knowledge,  which he would need to have if he were to discharge the role of  the head of such a center, or that of a coordinator of our  economic policy.    [Socha] Who, apart from Rosati, could possibly fill the  existing vacancy to good effect?    [Goscinski] In my opinion, the vacancy will not be filled  now. We will have to wait until the presidential election.  And, if Walesa is reelected then, we will be justified in  commiserating with one another.    [Socha] So it does not really matter at all who holds the  posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister until then?    [Goscinski] The president is not interested in a strong  government. He is interested in a good political arrangement  with Pawlak because you just cannot fight everyone all the time.  In his turn, Pawlak is not at all interested in having the  economy run on behalf of the government by a good economist from  the ranks of the the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], or found by  the SLD.    [Socha] Is it because a good economist would make it  difficult for him to fulfill the promises he made to his peasant  electorate?    [Goscinski] Of course. There are rumors reaching us from  Grzybowska Street--that is, the headquarters of the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL]--that peasants are increasingly displeased  with Pawlak. They come to the Food Industry Bank and say that  they had been promised 8-percent-interest loans--that is, the  cheapest possible--for the purchase of fertilizers. They had  been promised Z1 million per hectare for this purpose, but  apparently the loans fund has money for only one-fourth that  amount. In any case, someone will have to pay even for that.    One of the worst parliamentary acts the Sejm has approved  is the one on compensatory supplements for the agricultural  sector. It was manifestly put together in a hurry. But the  president refuses to use his right of veto to reject that act  because, by doing so, he would let the prime minister know that  he does not approve of such a policy toward agriculture. This  kind of interplay really has nothing to do with Poland's  interests. It is just a cynical struggle for power.    [Socha] In the long run, the prospect of a collapse of the  government coalition seems to be an increasingly likely  possibility, does it not?    [Goscinski] Pawlak keeps "drawing the bowstring" in an  attempt to try the SLD and see how much more it is able to  swallow. If the SLD is pushed too far, it could, in an act of  despair, leave the coalition. Or, if the SLD puts up too much  resistance, Pawlak could break up the coalition. A government  without the PSL but with only the SLD, the Democratic Union, and  other political groups is not really likely to even be  considered. It is more probable that, if he has support from the  president, the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], and a  proportion of the Democratic Union, Pawlak may form a minority  government. Then, on the occasion of a major ballot, he might  be forced to ask for a vote of confidence. It is not clear how  the Sejm would behave in such a situation and whether the  president would dissolve it then and announce a new  parliamentary election. That possibility is still seen as a  very powerful argument. People will find that they have burned  their fingers on left-wing administration just as they burned  them on Solidarity governments. Two years ago, I proposed the  thesis that we would not really have a true parliamentary  reflection of the existing configuration of forces in our  society until the next Sejm. It may be that this existing  configuration of forces is not ideal, but neither is it the  worst one we could have.    [Socha] Do you believe in society's collective wisdom--that  is, that we learn things faster than our elected leaders?    [Goscinski] Our society already showed us quite a few times  that it is capable of greater political discipline than we would  credit it with. Once we finally have a Sejm in which left,  right, and center are equally represented, Poland will cease to  be a country classified among hopeless incompetents. And, of  course, someone else will be president then. It will have to be  someone who will have the approval of both the left and the  right side of the political spectrum, perhaps someone from the  central orientation or even from outside the group of active,  committed politicians--someone who will have enough common sense  and be free from all pathological political ambitions.</p>

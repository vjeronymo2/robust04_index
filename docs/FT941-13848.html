			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Deadline set for aluminium accord The European Union has set a January 28 deadline for the world's leading aluminium producing nations to reach agreement on a memorandum to reduce oversupply, a spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The decision follows four days of talks among trade representatives from Russia, Australia, Canada, the 12-nation EU as one body, Norway and the US. The industry had noted at a conference last December oversupply of 1.5m-2m tonnes, an EU statement said. The memorandum would put in place 'an adjustment process by way of market forces that would reduce the imbalance'. A sharp increase in exports to the west by Russia following a collapse in its domestic demand is widely blamed for the current surplus, pushing prices to record lows. The talks in Brussels have focused on how cuts of up to 2m tonnes a year of annual output could be shared among Russia and the world's other key producers. The US is expected to make anti-dumping charges against the Russian industry if no agreement is reached.</p>

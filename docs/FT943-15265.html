			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Reformer hopeful in Belarus Youthful populist Mr Alexander Lukashenko, who promises 'simple answers to complicated questions' in the former Soviet republic of Belarus, appeared close to becoming its first president after yesterday's elections, Reuter reports from Minsk. Victory could pit him against parliament, sympathetic to his rival, conservative premier Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, and a bureaucracy he considers corrupt. Provisional results are expected today. Mr Lukashenko, favourite after the first round, had won popularity with promises to halt inflation and clean up the state apparatus which he says is corrupt from top to bottom. 'My first move will be to fight corruption, first of all at the top. My list of corrupt government officials is growing and only two members of the government leadership will be able to stay in their posts,' he said after casting his vote in the town of Shklov, 200km northeast of the capital, Minsk. 'In all probability Lukashenko has won,' said Mr Alexander Feduta, a member of Mr his campaign team. 'Kebich has lost in any case because parliament has introduced the post of the president having him in mind and it is now clear he will not be the president.' He has yet to announce a coherent economic programme or to name his candidate for prime minister but says: 'It's no problem to find a prime minister, it's easier than finding a milkman.'</p>

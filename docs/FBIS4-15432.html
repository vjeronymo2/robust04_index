			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The decision of President  Boris Yeltsin to set up military bases in the Commonwealth of  Independent States countries and Latvia does not evidence of  fundamentally new policies, Alexander Kirsteins, the head of the  Latvian parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters  Thursday [7 April].    Kirsteins said he was surprised by the "theatrical  performance the Latvian government staged" to protest Yeltsin's  decision.    In Kirsteins' words, Russia has never regarded its radar  station at Skrunda in Latvia as a military institution but it  always considered it as a military base. In this context,  Yeltsin's statement is not surprising.    On the other hand, it is characteristic of the Russian  government to issue inadequate statements to see reaction of  other countries to them, Kirsteins said. Such statements are  retracted afterwards, he said.</p>

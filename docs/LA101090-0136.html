			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NELSON RESIGNS AS SEAL BEACH CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> City Manager Robert Nelson, caught in the middle of this coastal community's  battles over new development, has resigned for personal reasons, officials said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Residents said that Nelson's resignation had been rumored for several weeks  because of differences with council members elected in May who have opposed  Mola Development Corp.'s controversial Hellman Ranch housing project, as well  as other projects.  </P> <P> Nelson, 51, who lives in Del Mar, was not available for comment. He said in a  prepared statement that he will miss working for Seal Beach but wants to devote  more time to his children, ages 27, 24, 6, and 2.  </P> <P> His resignation takes effect Oct. 31.  </P> <P> "In my own opinion and in that of some of the other residents, he had trouble  making the adjustment that the Mola project was not wanted by most of the  city," said Galen Ambrose, president of the Wetlands Restoration Society, which  opposes the Hellman Ranch project. "We feel this now will give the council  confidence in hiring somebody they feel will carry out their directives."  </P> <P> Seal Beach is beset with problems, including a recent Orange County Grand Jury  report that sharply criticized the Police Department and lawsuits against  Mola's proposal to build houses on the Hellman Ranch.  </P> <P> The previous council approved Mola's plans, but the new council rescinded that  approval.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, a member of the new council majority, said she did  not want to comment on residents' speculation.  </P> <P> "In my short term on the City Council, Mr. Nelson has provided me with the  information necessary to make important decisions for the city of the Seal  Beach. He will be missed," she said. "I understand that it is a personal  decision to spend more time with his young children."  </P> <P> Nelson worked as city manager in Del Mar before coming to Seal Beach four years  ago, Councilwoman Edna Wilson said.  </P> <P> "We've been through an awful lot of things with him," said Wilson, the only  council member remaining from the time Nelson was hired. "We've had an awful  lot of problems, and he's been very good. I'm just very sorry to see him go."  </P> <P> Wilson said she was notified last week of his resignation while she was in the  San Francisco Bay Area visiting her ill sister. She said she was uncertain why  city officials waited until late Tuesday to announce the resignation, which was  discussed by the council in closed session following its regular meeting Monday  night.  </P> <P> "There were some final points that had to be decided on," Wilson said. "I'm not  sure why it wasn't announced last night. I don't know whose decision it was."  </P> <P> Wilson said she was not certain what Nelson plans to do next or who will act as  city manager after he leaves.  </P></p>

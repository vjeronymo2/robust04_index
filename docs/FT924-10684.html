			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome chief's strategy to assure continued growth MR JOHN ROBB, Wellcome's chief executive, yesterday outlined his strategy to assure his group's continued profits growth. He warned that underlying results might be affected in the long term by political change, and in particular world-wide pressure on prices. The pricing situation was not getting any easier, he said. In Japan and parts of Europe it was draconian and he expected further price changes in European markets. In the US, Mr Robb said he had no doubt that pricing pressure would become more difficult, no matter which party won the coming presidential elections. Payments to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor families, were Pounds 8m in the year to August 29 1992 and would rise to Pounds 40m this financial year. Wellcome's future depended upon its ability to generate volume growth, said Mr Robb. The main driving force last year was Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes, chicken pox and shingles drug. Sales increased 24 per cent to Pounds 586m, twice the figure achieved three years ago and nearly a third of overall sales. Mr Robb said Zovirax's potential was by no means exhausted. The group had gained approval to sell the drug over the counter without a prescription in New Zealand and Germany, where its patents expire next year. Meanwhile, Wellcome is in a race with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, to develop a second generation anti-herpes compound. Wellcome has two molecules, called 256U and 882C, nearing the completion of their development. These are due for launch in 1995 and 1996, while SmithKline Beecham expects to bring Famciclovir, its new treatment, to market in 1995. Sales of Retrovir, the HIV-treatment also known as AZT, increased 22 per cent to Pounds 213m, following a disappointing previous year, said Mr Robb. He warned, however, that Retrovir was now in a competitive environment, battling against DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, and DDC which is marketed by Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche. Mr Robb said sales would continue to grow as Retrovir was used increasingly in combination with such drugs. Sales of newer drugs, such as Tracrium, Wellbutrin, Wellferon, Exosurf and Lamictil, generated Pounds 200m. Further growth is expected to come from Wellcome's over the counter operations (OTC), which increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m. Mr Robb said Wellcome was seeking ways to expand its OTC business. The company wanted to gain critical mass in the US and the Continent, but he did not want to make an acquisition that would dilute earnings, even in the first year. Mr Robb said the UK business had been hit by poor penetration of Zovirax and a high incidence of parallel imports. The organisation had been shaken up, he said. US sales rose 16 per cent to Pounds 737m, thanks to a strong performance from the anti-viral and OTC businesses. European sales increased 20 per cent to Pounds 590m. Japanese revenues were up 18 per cent to Pounds 128m, following the introduction of Zovirax as a treatment for shingles. Other international sales increased 17 per cent to Pounds 188m.</p>

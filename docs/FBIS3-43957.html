Last Friday Mr.  Dhlakama met the UN special envoy to Mozambique, Mr. Aldo  Ajello, about raising funds to help Renamo to transform itself  into a political party. Mr. Ajello said although he had  appealed to the international community for support there had  been little response beyond the 6 million dollars pledged by  Italy early last year. Mr. Dhlakama said the international  community promised him millions of dollars before he signed the  Mozambican Peace Accord and that continued peace depended on  having sufficient funds.</p>

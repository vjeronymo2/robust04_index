Sandino, in Managua, in  February 1994 -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] To all Sandinists, to all Nicaraguans: Never before  has Nicaragua experienced such a tragic situation of poverty,  social exclusion, unemployment, lack of opportunity, the  plundering of our natural resources, a crisis in moral values,  corruption, abuse, hopelessness, and lack of a future for young  people. This crisis, which affects all of society, has created a  feeling of distrust of the government, public institutions, the  political parties, and many of their leaders. The Sandinist  National Liberation Front [FSLN] is by no means exempt from this  crisis, and we need to recognize this problem if we want to be  part of its solution.    I. The FSLN, as a matter of historic necessity, was born as  an armed organization to overthrow the Somozist dictatorship.  After lengthy years of heroic action, dedication, and  deprivation, it managed to unleash a triumphant insurrectional  movement that won the support and sympathy of the immense  majority of the population. Through that heroism, the consensus  of the majority of the people, the justice of their demands, and  a broad policy of alliances, we came into power in 1979.    II. Since its origin, Sandinism's raison d'etre  has been the creation of a new society formed of new men and  women, with new ideals and values, capable of forging, with  everyone working together, a nation of solidarity, a nation  without oppression, without egotism, without discrimination or  exclusionary policies, and in control of its own independence  and sovereignty. Thousands of Nicaragua's best sons and  daughters gave their lives for those ideals and values of  Sandino and Fonseca.    III. To carry out its program of deep social  transformations,  and given the historic need to promote for the first time the  interests of the dispossessed masses of the people--the party,  the state, mass organizations, the armed forces, and the  security forces were integrated into a single organization of  power. This system of power also has its ideological foundation  based on concepts that were new at that time; the FSLN believed  in its historic destiny as a single vanguard party.    IV. Guided by that concept, and in circumstances shaped by  the war, a style of vertical behavior was created in the party,  and in the party's behavior in relation to society. That is how  we acquired the style of an exclusive political group with  closed membership ranks.    V. The sense of social solidarity, of popular mobilizations  for just causes, the defense of our sovereignty, are values that  Sandinism nurtured in society. In this way, we brought about  transformations in Nicaragua's social and economic structures  despite the aggression sponsored by the Reagan administration,  which left our economy in ruins.    But we also made some grave mistakes in political concepts  and action that we did not recognize in time. These errors  reduced the people's support and approval, divided society, led  to armed clashes, and finally caused us to lose power.    VI. The 1990's election defeat left Sandinism without any  defined sense of direction because its transforming program,  based upon total power, was no longer possible. Today we are  still faced with an identity crisis and the lack of a persuasive  political program with coherent leadership.    VII. We should take pride in the fact that our most  important  historic legacy is economic and social democracy, whose  foundation is the transformation of agrarian land ownership, and  at the same time, representative and participatory democracy. We  were able to fully and convincingly demonstrate our respect for  the popular vote when we turned over the government after free  and honest elections were held. Denying that heritage would mean  denying our very selves.    Based upon the foregoing considerations, it is now becoming  necessary for the FSLN to accept a new vision of the history of  Nicaragua and of the contemporary world, so that it will be  capable of facing the nation's grave social and economic  problems with lucidity and of taking effective action to defend  the interests of the vast majority of the people.    We Sandinists must dismiss from our minds and hearts all  those forms of erroneous behavior in which we engaged while we  held power, and which the people rejected, so that we will not  repeat them. And we must propose to our party and to society a  new program, with new options, new democratic forms of  organization and new forms of popular civic struggle, without  fear of changes, transformations, and renewal.    Therefore, while looking ahead to the FSLN Extraordinary  Congress, we now offer to the Sandinists and to the people of  Nicaragua the following proposals for the new Statutes and  Program:    1. Our party must be open, participatory, and creative, with  flexible structures capable of bringing people together and  uniting them, and not excluding or dividing. We need to return  once more to being the party through which the majority of the  Nicaraguan people, no matter what their economic and social  status, will feel that they are represented. All closed,  sectarian, exclusive, and discriminatory attitudes need to be  rooted out forever from Sandinism, for such attitudes separate  us from the masses of the people.    The requirements for party membership must not be used to  close doors, but rather to open them, and there must be a single  class of membership in the FSLN.    2. Many Sandinists and sympathizers with Sandinism have  moved  away from the party. If we want to win the masses back to us  once again, we must first learn to motivate all Sandinists so  they will come back to our ranks. This includes the unemployed,  who are the most numerous group, and all the others who in rural  areas and in cities are creating their own way of living both  through their own initiative and hard work, no matter what their  occupation, area of interest, profession, or economic and social  status.    3. We must have a party that is truly democratic at all  levels, with broad areas available for participation, debate,  and discussion. A party in which elected leaders answer for  their actions to the people who elected them; a party with a new  leadership capable of handling the challenges of transformation  that Sandinism wants. A leadership with new styles, without  one-man rule systems of any type, that respects the decisions  made in local organs, and is constantly in touch with the grass  roots.    4. No one wants another war in our country, nor do they want  violence. Today we Sandinists cannot promote, tolerate, justify,  or excuse any sort of methods of armed or violent struggle in  Nicaragua, nor can we be lukewarm in condemning those methods.  There are many forms of civic struggle and popular mobilization  that can be used to defend the interests of the majority of the  people within the framework of our political Constitution and of  the laws.    5. Our political behavior must be based on strict  consistency  between what we say and what we do. We cannot go around saying  one thing and then, behind the scenes, doing something else. Nor  can we hope to win back the trust of the masses by simply  changing what we say. Our political speech must always be  accompanied by consistent political behavior.    6. We cannot put off working to find national solutions that  will lay the groundwork for finding a way to overcome the  economic and social crisis, which is the common aspiration  shared by all the Nicaraguan people. In dealing with the  economic crisis, our critical positions and our alternative  proposals must be serious, well articulated, and viable.    7. The FSLN has legitimate spheres of influence which it  must  learn to use to defend the interests of the majority of the  people: the media, parliament, public opinion forums, municipal  and regional governments, business associations, unions,  producers' organizations, and community and social groups.    Sandinism must be prepared to work with everybody in the  fields, in communities, in neighborhoods, in the regions, and in  cities, in promoting and defending our mutual interests, even  with those whom in the past we fought during the war.    8. A political party's legitimate and necessary aspiration  is  to obtain power, and our most important task is to expand and  recover the consensus of the majority of the people so that we  can be elected to office. We must remember clearly that we can  only carry out our political, economic, and social program from  inside the government.    It would be absurd to condemn ourselves to the role of a  party destined to fight eternally to change things while  remaining outside in the opposition. In that way a party remains  locked in frustration and demagoguery.    9. The only Sandinism possible is democratic Sandinism. We  cannot be true to our ideals of economic transformation and  profound social change without a deep and irreversible  commitment to democracy.    10. Sandinism should carry with pride the banner of honesty  demonstrated during our exercise of government, honesty which  promotes nothing but the consequence of the ethical concepts we  have always championed and defended. We need to reject as  immoral and contrary to our principles any form of illicit  enrichment, or any shady deals and acts of corruption, both  inside and outside our ranks.    11. We Sandinists need to keep alive our revolutionary ideal  of a just and democratic society, a society of solidarity, in  which no one is humiliated or discriminated against. We need to  stand firm against all forms of economic and social oppression.  We need to keep ourselves on the side of a participatory and  open economic system, in which the poorest and most dispossessed  are given extra help, and the campesinos are given legal and  economic guarantees ensuring their rights to land. There will  never be a Sandinism that defends monopolies, oligarchies (old  or new), powerful economic groups, whether the old ones or new  improvised versions, or any form of return to the past of  economic oppression, no matter who its proponents may be.    12. We should proclaim single-mindedly our respect for  private property and all other legitimate forms of property:  communal, associative, and cooperative. And we need to state  clearly our rejection, both now and in the future, of any form  of confiscation. Economic initiative, whether individual or  collective, is vital for our national development.    13. Neoliberalism is contrary to the social rights and  interests of the vast majority of the people, who are asked by  neoliberalism to sacrifice for the benefit of a few of the more  privileged. We must be forthright in rejecting the dogma of  neoliberalism, which people have been trying to impose on us  from outside. The present government has been unable to defend  Nicaragua's interests from these external impositions by  international financial organizations.    Financial and economic adjustments must fit our real  situation and should promote production and jobs instead of  causing stagnation. And just as the dogma that everything should  be in the hands of the state did not work, a dogma which says  that everything should be privatized, including public services,  cannot work.    14. We Sandinists should foster the ability of every social  group, every business association, every union, every community  organization, every youth and women's group to encourage and  defend their own common interests, with full independence and  freedom. This is what participatory democracy means. Democracy  can only be truly effective when it expands the arenas available  for popular participation. It is Sandinism's duty to promote the  role and participation of women in transforming society, while  respecting the ideas and autonomy of their organizations.    15. We need to continue to extend the Atlantic Coast  Autonomy  process within the spirit of national unity, and to seek the  immediate implementation of the autonomy law and the inclusion  of the functions of autonomous governments as an integral part  of the constitutional reforms that will have to be debated and  passed in the National Assembly.    16. Today, there is a world of new international relations  after the end of the Cold War, a world marked by great abysses  between rich and poor countries, with Nicaragua being one of the  poor nations. It is our place to work to achieve a just  international economic order.    17. Sandinism, whether in the opposition or in the  government, cannot harbor undying hostility toward any country.  Our relations with the United States must be relations of mutual  respect, but without ever forgetting our tradition as a nation  that has placed its dignity and sovereignty above all else.    This is our message of hope and life. We want to share with  everyone our aspiration for a prosperous and just Nicaragua,  without more wars, without poverty, without exclusion, in which  all Nicaraguans, on a footing of equality no matter what their  political or religious beliefs or their economic and social  status, will have the right to live free from fear and to work  in peace, sure of their lives, of the lives of their families,  and of their property.    We Sandinists, without excluding anyone, must help to create  an awareness of the future, in a country that really does have a  future. Our spiritual and material potential, now and in the  future, is immense. We must turn to the task of helping millions  of Nicaraguans, especially young people, to recover faith and  hope in the future.    To achieve these desires, which are just and necessary, and  to take on the challenge of winning the 1996 elections, we must  at all cost preserve the unity of Sandinism, which is our most  valued treasure.

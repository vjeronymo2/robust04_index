			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATIN-TONED '50S CROONERS FIND A HOME;  </P> <P> DOO-WOP: THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOCIETY WILL HAVE A SHINDIG SUNDAY IN  LAKEWOOD.  </P> <P> Where do old doo-wop singers go?  </P> <P> That's not the set-up line to a joke, but the mission of Steve Propes. And  Propes, founder and director of the Southern California Doo-Wop Society,  believes there is no single answer.  </P> <P> Dewey Terry, who had regional hits with the Pasadena-based Squires in the age  of Eisenhower, made Little Richard-style rock in the '50s and worked with the  English punk group Tupelo Chain Sex in the '80s.  </P> <P> The story is quite different for Leon Peels, lead singer of Los Angeles' Blue  Jays, who has spent the last 25 years in such jobs as fry cook at a Holiday  Inn.  </P> <P> But now their paths have crossed again, thanks to the Doo-Wop Society.  </P> <P> "Leon got disheartened and left music in the '60s," said Propes, 47, who  describes himself as a professional "free-lance record fan" with more than  20,000 singles in his collection. "But with the help of the Doo-Wop Society  he's performing regularly. He's getting the recognition he's deserved for  20-plus years."  </P> <P> How the society helped is a pretty simple matter. Propes mentioned Peels on the  rock 'n' roll radio show he hosted on KLON-FM from 1980 through 1989. (He now  does a version of the show on Simmons Cable television in Long Beach, Sundays  from 9 a.m. to noon.) Soon he got a call from someone who put him in touch with  the singer.  </P> <P> An informal group of doo-wop lovers had already formed -- mainly students from  a rock 'n' roll history class Propes taught at Cal State Long Beach in the  mid-'80s. In early 1989 the group formally became the Doo-Wop Society in order  to facilitate the rediscovery of old singers and provide a setting for them to  perform.  </P> <P> "We just put out the word and see what comes back," Propes said. "Then we  actively try to re-create the groups as much as possible and get the original  sound and feel."  </P> <P> Both Peels and Dewey will be among the performers at the Doo-Wop Society's  quarterly meeting/concert Sunday at the Hop in Lakewood. The event will also  include the first performance in 30 years by Shirley Gunter &amp; the Queens  (the first female doo-wop group) and Richard Berry, who will be awarded a  special gold record for writing the rock classic "Louie Louie." Berry will  re-create the music of his original doo-wop group, the Flairs.  </P> <P> "They found me," Dewey Terry said. "It's good for people like Shirley Gunter  and others who have not had a chance to get back on stage. After you've been  out of it so long, people tend to forget you."  </P> <P> Another group on the bill is the Storytellers, which Propes takes credit for  reuniting after more than 30 years.  </P> <P> "They were four Chicanos from the San Gabriel Valley area who got together in  the late '50s and had a deal with a small record company," he said.  </P> <P> "They had one record under their name which is now a major-league collector's  item, but at the time they had no luck with the record and stopped. I played  the record on my radio show and got a call from one of them. As a result, they  got back together. Now they've released a record on Classic Artists Records, a  new doo-wop label -- believe it or not, there are some. . . . That was the  power of doo-wop on the air."  </P> <P> Both Propes and Terry say that the Doo-Wop Society is not just an exercise in  nostalgia. "We do something new with our music," said Terry of his act with  longtime partner Don (Sugarcane) Harris. "Music is a process of evolution."  </P> <P> And Propes noted that several groups performing Sunday are new acts that have  added their own touches to the art form. Both Propes and Terry also pointed out  cultural ties between doo-wop and rap music.  </P> <P> "There's always been a relationship," Terry said. "It's an old church thing --  you say something and there's a response. Rappers just put electronic drums on  it. Those were old things that came out of black neighborhoods, which evolved  into what rap is today."  </P> <P> Propes even sees a possibility of the two forms being combined into a new  hybrid, though he thinks it would take some work and imagination.  </P> <P> "If we could have anything to do with combining the two cultures, we'd jump on  it," he said. "But it would take someone more creative than the board members.  I know my limits."  </P></p>

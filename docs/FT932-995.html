			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel may need to seek a further Pounds 1bn EUROTUNNEL may need to raise additional funds 'of under or around Pounds 1bn' to pay for the Channel tunnel with an equity issue a possibility in the first half of next year, shareholders were told yesterday. It had not been expected that the company would consider making a share issue so close to opening of the tunnel. The figure of Pounds 1bn was also marginally higher than some analysts had expected, although the group insisted that its funding expectations had not changed and that any numbers at this stage were only an estimate. The group has previously raised Pounds 8.9bn, of which Pounds 1.6bn is equity. Mr Gerald Corbett, chief financial officer, told the annual meeting in London that Eurotunnel's current facilities were likely to last 'to around the middle of 1994 plus or minus a couple of months.' He said that banks in discussions with Eurotunnel had agreed that the opportunity should be seized if conditions in the first half of next year were 'suitable for an early equity raising by way of a rights issue or similar route.' It had been accepted that it would be preferable if future funding involved a '50:50 split between equity or equity type funding and additional debt.' Any equity issue would be timed to be at or near the opening of the tunnel for services. Contractors building in the tunnel have told Eurotunnel that the project was unlikely to open before next summer unless an agreement could be reached over their claims for additional payments. Eurotunnel's bankers, which so far have agreed to lend the project Pounds 7.3bn, however, are working on the basis that a phased opening would take place with the first services for heavy goods vehicles starting in February and services for cars and coaches starting in April next year. Mr Corbett said that the loss of potential revenue caused by delays, rather than any further increase in construction costs, was causing the strain on future funding needs. The cost of building the project, including lost revenue since 1987, has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to approaching Pounds 10bn. He estimated that additional finance required by the group 'should be under or around Pounds 1bn of which more or less Pounds 600m will be needed during 1994 and 1995 with the balance to be in place by the beginning of 1996.' Up to Pounds 200m of this might come from a free issue of warrants, on the basis of one warrant for every share held. These would allow shareholders to buy one new share for FFr28.25 or 335p for every ten warrants acquired. These could be exercised in October 1995 or in June next year if funds were required earlier. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, told shareholders that it would cost the group 15 times more if it accepted the contractors demands than the revenue it would lose through late opening.</p>

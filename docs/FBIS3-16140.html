This was  stated by Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian  Federation Government, at a conference of heads of  administration of the components of the Federation at the  collective farm named for Kuybyshev in Gorodetskiy Rayon,  Nizhniy Novgorod oblast. Before the conference the prime  minister, who had arrived in Nizhniy Novgorod for a one-day  visit, had taken part in a land auction at the collective farm  named for the 60th anniversary October.    With the aid of experts from an international financial  corporation who in conjunction with Russian specialists have  developed an auction model for handing over public property into  private hands, the collective farm members divided it among  themselves into eight partnerships. Nizhniy Novgorod Governor  Boris Nemtsov called this auction the third attempt in Russian  history, after Aleksandr II and Petr Stolypin, to turn the  peasants into strong private farmers. There is already  experience of the similar disbandment of two farms on Nizhniy  Novgorod land -- the "Pravdinskoye" and "Niva" farms in which  auctions were held earlier.    The participants who spoke at the conference stressed that  without the comprehensive solution of problems of the  countryside the reform could be suspended because under the  present conditions of poor roads, lack of money, and obsolete  equipment it is simply senseless to count on a swift and  effective return from the agro-industrial complex.</p>

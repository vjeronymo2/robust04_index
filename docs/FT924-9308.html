			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Rawlings heads for surprise poll victory FLIGHT Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings, Ghana's military leader, was last night headed for a surprise victory in the country's first democratic presidential elections in 13 years. The outcome was challenged by opposition leaders, but government supporters hailed it as a triumph for the 45-year-old former air force pilot over four other candidates. Semi-official figures announced on state-run radio from 198 of the 200 constituencies gave Flt Lt Rawlings 58.6 per cent of the vote. If his lead is maintained in the last remaining constituencies, the charismatic Flt Lt Rawlings will be elected president in a single round of polling. Opposition candidates said the voting should be annulled because of widespread vote rigging. In the central Ghanaian city of Kumasi, an opposition stronghold, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed after riots broke out when results were released showing Flt Lt Rawlings in the lead. An interim report by a 15-member Commonwealth observer group said the elections were free and fair. But the process had 'not been without incident', the report continued, citing 'admitted imperfections in the voters' roll and the organisation and conduct of some polling stations'. 'Most of what we are hearing so far are problems of organisation and training rather than deliberate mischief,' said Mr Richard Joseph, head of an observer team sent by the Carter Centre of former US President Jimmy Carter. 'The real instances of malfeasance are really just a handful.' Flt Lt Rawlings' closest rival, Prof Albert Adu Boahen, had 30.2 per cent of the poll and the three other candidates were trailing further behind. Flt Lt Rawlings will have achieved a remarkable victory if he has succeeded in converting an unpopular austerity reform programme, implemented under his heavy- handed 11-year rule, into a winning electoral programme. His supporters said that he had received widespread support from rural peasants, who make up more than 75 per cent of the population and who have benefited from the reforms through much increased producer prices for agriculture and cocoa and mass programmes of rural electrification. Parliamentary elections are due to take place on December 8.</p>

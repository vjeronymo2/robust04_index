			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Successful rebound in modest trading THE LONDON stock market rebounded successfully yesterday after being initially driven down to its nearest support levels by uncertain performances from Wall Street and Tokyo and new warnings of the depth of the economic recession in the UK. Buyers came in fairly readily at mid-morning when the FT-SE Index had fallen to 2,506, and by the close the market was 21.2 ahead on the Footsie scale. Some optimism was triggered by the London money markets, where the Bank of England's operations were regarded as encouraging hopes for an early cut in UK base rates. However, such optimism was damped down as sterling remained subdued. Overall, trading volume in equities was not particularly impressive and strategists remained cautious. UK stocks were helped by a firmer opening to the new session on Wall Street, which was 9 Dow points ahead when London closed. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,538.4, a net gain of 21.2 on the first day of the new equity trading account. The session opened in depressed mood in the wake of the 30-point setback in the Dow on Friday's worrying US employment statistics, which had been followed by a fall in the Nikkei average to below the important 22,000 mark. Bad news from closer to home included reports that a Confederation of British Industry survey had suggested that small businesses in the UK were seeing no sign of an economic recovery. Selling from Europe focused on Eurotunnel after the disclosure that it will not meet its June 1993 completion deadline. Among brewing stocks, Bass suffered further selling in response to its law suit in the US. However, there was not a great deal of selling pressure and trading volume remained low until the market bounced as it approached the Footsie 2,500 area. Traders regard FT-SE 2,480-2,500 as a 'safe level at which to buy', as one leading dealer phrased it. The stock index futures contract anticipated the arrival of the buyers who did indeed come into the market to pick up selected blue chip issues. The underlying stock market quickly followed suit, with RTZ and Glaxo among those to attract buyers from across the Atlantic. The stock market swung into positive territory and gains were sharply extended when Wall Street opened in firmer vein. The advance carried through to the close, when share prices were only a shade below the day's best levels. Seaq trading volume fell to 426.4m shares from the 596.2m of the previous session. Retail volume on Friday was worth Pounds 1.02bn, according to Stock Exchange statistics, indicating a significant sell-off at the end of the trading account. In spite of yesterday's rally, which more than replaced Friday's losses, equity strategists sounded uncertain of the market's prospects. Clouds still hang over the progress of the economic recession, both in the US and the UK. Oil shares, heavily weighted components of the Footsie, did well as worries over dividend policies at British Petroleum lifted a little. Firmer oil prices, which would benefit sterling, are believed possible following this week's Opec meeting, but the longer term prospect for world crude prices remains suspect in view of the prolonged recession in the leading industrialised countries.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Japanese rate cut expected JAPANESE official interest rates are expected to be cut within the next few days after mounting pressure over the past few weeks on the Bank of Japan to stimulate the flagging economy. The Bank is expected to cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to either 2.75 or 2.5 per cent within days. Financial analysts believe the Bank decided on Friday to cut the official discount rate interest rate, despite official denials over the weekend. The likely cut follows a period of intense political and business pressure upon Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, to relax monetary policy. The last cut, a 0.5 per cent reduction to 3.25 per cent, was six months ago. Since then the economy has fallen to the verge of outright recession, with consumer spending deeply depressed. Over the last month the Bank has publicly acknowledged the economy's deterioration, tacitly accepting the case for a further cut. A cut, which would be the sixth since September 1991, would take the Japanese official discount rate to around the lows it reached during 1987 and 1988, the height of the speculative bubble economy. It is thought that the Bank will resist pushing the official discount rate below 2.5 per cent for fear that such a move would signal a return to the cheap credit policies of the bubble era. A further cut may have a limited impact upon the fragile Tokyo stock market because it has been predicted for so long many analysts have already discounted it. However, it will help to reduce funding costs for Japan's banks which are struggling against a rising tide of bad debts created by the bubble's collapse. Some analysts believe a cut may prompt a surge in retail consumer spending because consumers have been delaying making big purchases until a the long expected cut in borrowing costs was delivered. However Japanese households as a whole are net recipients of interest income as a result of their prodigious savings. So for elderly people in particular an interest rate cut may reduce disposable income. The cut will help the ruling Liberal Democratic Party respond to pressure from Japan's trading partners, who are calling for a more expansionary policy to help reduce Japan's trade surplus.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Court hears of Hatton 'backhanders' MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, lobbied Labour councillors in Liverpool to influence land deals in return for illegal 'backhanders', Mold Crown Court, Clwyd was told yesterday. Mr Hatton, with Mr John Nelson and Mrs Hannah Folan, also former Labour councillors, and businessmen Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, deny charges of conspiracy to defraud the council. Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said three pieces of city-owned land had been disposed of - two to Mr Monk and one to Mr Stewart - without being advertised for tender. He said Mr Hatton prevailed on Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan to make sure the businessmen got the land. 'Mr Hatton was rewarded handsomely for his efforts both by Mr Monk and Mr Stewart, and some of the rewards flowed onwards to Mr Nelson and Mrs Folan,' he said. Mr Rawley described how Mr Stewart and Mr Monk became clients of Settleside, a public relations company set up by Mr Hatton shortly before he ceased to be a councillor in March 1987. Mr Rawley said Mr Nelson had called for a council report on one site, but officers sent the document to a sub-committee, of which he was not a member, which voted correctly for the car park site to be put out to tender. Mr Nelson ordered officers to telephone Mr Monk, who offered Pounds 10,000 a year for a car park licence for the site. This was accepted by a sub-committee. Mr Rawley said Settleside had an interest in the second car park site. He said entries in Mr Hatton's diary, one of which read '1,000-H', related to Pounds 1,000 in cash which Mrs Folan received after overriding a council official's recommendation that the car park should go to tender. The money was later shown to have been paid into the joint mortgage account of Mrs Folan and a man with whom she was living. A document found when Mr Hatton's premises were searched had figures which he suggested showed Mr Hatton and Mr Monk sharing Pounds 500 a week from the takings of one car park and Pounds 150 a week each from the other. The case continues today.</p>

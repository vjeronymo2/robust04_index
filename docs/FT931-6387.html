			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Birt-type deals said to be common TAX CONSULTANTS say arrangements similar to Mr John Birt's employment contract with the BBC are common among entertainers, computer consultants, North Sea divers, fishermen and non-executive directors of large companies. Ms Moira Elms, senior manager at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Financial Planning, says Mr Birt's position as sole employee of a limited company in which he is the sole shareholder was 'a valid arrangement and the Inland Revenue have a difficult time overturning it'. In 1897 the House of Lords ruled that an employee of a company is legally distinct from the company itself, even if he or she is the only shareholder. To prove otherwise, the Revenue would have to 'pierce the corporate veil,' tax consultants say. Mr Lochlan Hickey, partner at KPMG Tax Partners, identifies two main advantages of the arrangement: cashflow benefits as tax is not deducted at source and the freedom enjoyed by limited companies in deducting legitimate business expenses for tax purposes. The disadvantages are that the limited company must comply with all Companies Act rules, including filing annual accounts at Companies House and holding an annual general meeting - even if attended by only one person. It must also pay national insurance contributions and VAT and corporation taxes which, at 25 per cent to 35 per cent of profits, are preferable to the 40 per cent income tax on top-rate salaries. Mr Hickey says the Inland Revenue has intervened where an employer has used a one-person limited company to fill a position likely to be ongoing. Employers and executive recruitment specialists expressed surprise that the Revenue would grant freelance consultancy status to executives earning their living predominantly from one source. Mr Peter Brown, chairman of Top Pay Research Group, which advises non-executive directors, says it is 'virtually inconceivable' that a permanent chief executive would be employed on a freelance basis. Mr John Courtis of Courtis &amp; McManus, the headhunters, warns that companies employing executives as freelances could be held liable for outstanding tax liabilities.</p>

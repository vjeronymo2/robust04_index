			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Federal Implementation and Delegation to Local Agencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below in section III.J of this preamble, if EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassifies the ozone nonattainment areas of the Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley Air Basin as ``severe'', the applicable portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California SIP must be revised to meet the CAA requirements for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe ozone nonattainment area and submitted to EPA on or before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date of final promulgation of this FIP. Until such time as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA approves the revisions for the NSR portions of the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP, the NSR requirements of this FIP shall apply. When the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions are approved into the SIP, EPA will withdraw this NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will encourage delegation of the final version of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSR rule to the local Districts prior to SIP approvability, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating the need for sources to apply for permits from both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA and the local permitting agency. To do so, Districts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must revise their existing NSR rule to meet the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this federal rule, or adopt EPA's final NSR rule, through their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing notice and comment rulemaking procedures. The revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule must then be submitted to EPA, which will evaluate the NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for consistency with the requirements of the NSR portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Implementation Plan. EPA will then delegate to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District, by letter, the authority to implement and enforce those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the FIP that are consistent with District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. When the revisions are ultimately approved in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP, EPA will withdraw the NSR portion of the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision of the District regulations is necessary to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the local agencies to use their own requirements, such as fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions and enforcement procedures, to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this NSR rule. While both SIP revisions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation will require revision of the District regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation is a much more expedient process than EPA approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions as part of the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. TCMs to offset VMT increases. If bumped up to a severe nonattainment classification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento would also need to consider the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(d)(1)(A). This section requires States containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe ozone nonattainment areas to submit a SIP that identifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and adopts specific, enforceable transportation control measures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as necessary, to offset growth in vehicle emissions due to growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in vehicle miles traveled. Beyond demonstrating that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures offset growth in emissions, they must be sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow total regional emission levels to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable further progress and attainment requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the General Preamble to Title I of the CAAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), the TCM offset SIPs required from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas already designated severe or extreme must: (1) Identify and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt specific and enforceable transportation control strategies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and TCMs to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of vehicle trips; (2) identify and adopt specific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable transportation control strategies and TCMs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with RFP milestones; and (3) identify and adopt specific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable transportation control strategies and TCMs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the General Preamble, EPA has interpreted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provision to offset any growth in VOC from VMT increases to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``require that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle VOC emissions will never be higher during the ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season in one year than during the ozone season in the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before.'' Further, the attainment year is the last year for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this test applies. The calculation of VOC emissions from on road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile sources may ``include the effects of Federal measures such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as new motor vehicle standards, Phase II RVP controls, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline, as well as Clean Air Act-mandated SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements such as enhanced I/M, the fleet clean-fuel vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, and the employer trip reduction program.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Sacramento, as can be seen in the Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, on-road mobile source emissions through 2005 are never  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to be greater in one year than the year before once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP control strategies are implemented. Therefore, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for TCMs in Sacramento to offset emissions increases from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth in VMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for requirements (2) and (3) pertaining to TCMs for RFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and attainment demonstration, the FIP has addressed TCMs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento in the discussion of Employee Commute Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (III.F.2) and the discussion pertaining to fees on light duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles (III.D.2.f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Reformulated fuel. a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provision satisfied in FIP/SIP actions above.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reclassification of the Sacramento area to ``Severe'' would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate sale of reformulated gasoline in the area, effective one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year after reclassification. There may be no emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits from applying the federal reformulated fuel requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Sacramento, however, since the California reformulated fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program already applies throughout the State. If the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated fuel program achieves greater reductions than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California program, EPA will impose the federal requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento. If the California program is more stringent, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would consider modifications to its enforcement program to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duplication with California's program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G.

Introduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After application of the FIP's stationary, area, and mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source rule requirements, the ozone attainment requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast demand further reductions from the same source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories in order to achieve cumulative reductions from 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseyear emissions of approximately 90 percent VOC and 70 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

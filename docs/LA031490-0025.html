			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIFICATION OF GERMANY  </P> <P> In response to "Kohl: Dancing Around the Border," editorial, March 3:  </P> <P> There's another way to look at it. A united Germany will soon dominate Europe.  </P> <P> We should counsel Poland to negotiate with Germany and open that border so as  to lessen its importance.  </P> <P> After Poland and Germany have made peace, they can go after the Soviets to  negotiate for the vast strip of land that is Polish that the Soviets took after  World War II (a strip approximately 200-300 miles wide stretching from  Lithuania to Romania. Not satisfied with helping themselves to Poland, the  Soviets even took East Prussia after World War II). It was power politics then,  it will be again. Surely it is better to negotiate these difficulties while the  U.S. and Soviets have a presence there rather than later.  </P> <P> The point is that power is now shifting to those who were beaten and punished.  Before the shift is completed, it would pay to anticipate problems where  possible. Certainly the Soviets caused these problems and should now make  Poland whole. The West ought to be able to get Poland and Germany together.  West Germany has already done a great deal to help Poland economically;  political amity should be the goal so that border questions become unimportant.  </P> <P> RONALD BENKERT  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (8): Prepare to dance in the morning - Kieran Cooke evokes the indomitable spirit of a city with style Seven o'clock on a sunny, spring morning and couples dance on the Bund, the majestic waterfront of Shanghai. A waltz crackles from an old wireless. People glide serenely, smilingly, back and forth. A crowd looks critically on, like judges at some closely fought dancing contest. It is hard not to be carried away with Shanghai. I had not visited China since 1976. Mao had just died, the Gang of Four, based in Shanghai, were threatening to unleash another bloody cultural revolution. The streets were drab, filled with dour looking citizens. To talk of change in China is an almost laughable understatement. Shanghai has been revitalised. It has thrown off its Maoist cloak and put on its make-up and smart clothes. It's stepping out into the world again. The busiest people in the city these days are the shop signboard writers. The old stores are opening up, crammed full of goods. There, on the corner, is the 'Cha Cha Bakery'. Somewhere, if only I could find it, is 'The Golden Duck Marriage Advisory Bureau'. Shanghai has always had a reputation for style. The Chinese say that for the Cantonese further south, life revolves round food. In Beijing, it's politics. In Shanghai, it's clothes. In the evenings Shanghai's fashion - conscious strut and stroll up and down Nanking Road - always renowned as the best shopping street in China. A few years ago any show of beauty was hidden for fear of being accused of displaying bourgeois individualistic tendencies. Now the hair shirt of communism has been stripped well and truly off. Life is still a serious struggle for many. In 1934 there were 3.3m people in Shanghai. Now there are more than 15m. Accommodation is a chronic problem. Getting about is another. Much of the city's infrastructure has not been touched since the 1930s. Traffic policemen wave a white glove and blow an occasional whistle. But they fight a futile battle. At the last count there were 7m bicycles in Shanghai. Add the cars swarming on to the streets, the jammed packed trolley buses, the motorbikes and hand carts, and there is a sure recipe for chaos. Yet somehow, Shanghai gets by. The people of the city have always been known as a cunning lot. When the wind blew out of Shanghai's commercial sails in the 1930s the city's Chinese tycoons moved south and built up Hong Kong. They spread themselves to Taiwan, Japan, the US and Europe. Now those entrepreneurs and their descendants, many of them men of considerable wealth, are returning. The old days in Shanghai were glorious for some, terrible for the majority. In the 1920s and 1930s the city was home to the world's merchant adventurers, fortune hunters, gigolos and whores. British spies went to tea dances with glamorous White Russians. Jewish merchants from Baghdad fought triad gang leaders for control of the drugs trade. American fellow travellers consorted with the emerging communist party of China. Many German Jews found a rare haven there from Nazi persecution. A few yards away from the Bund, bodies were piled on the streets. 'If God lets Shanghai endure,' said the missionaries, 'He owes an apology to Sodom and Gomorrah.' The foreigners did leave behind some remarkably handsome buildings and gracious plane tree-lined avenues. Parisian style mansions are still visible in the old French quarter. The noble facade of what was once the British Club is now adorned with a fast food sign. The club's famous long bar, where Reginald, Felicity and Roger drank pink gins and became a trifle squiffy, is now serving breaded chicken legs. Further down the Bund the grandiose Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank building has been changed into the local Communist Party headquarters, guarded by two young and cold-looking soldiers in the oversize uniforms favoured by the Chinese military. The ballroom of the old Astor Hotel, where US diplomats and Shanghai actresses did the shimmy, is now the home of the stock exchange. The index, most inappropriately in this share-mad city, is named Jingan, or tranquility. Plenty of other monuments of the past remain, though their function has changed. The Great World, which in the 1930s offered six floors of multitudinous and highly imaginative vice, is now the Shanghai Youth Centre. The golf course has become the zoo. The old country club has been turned into a school. The Chinese Communist Party came into being in Shanghai in 1921. The meeting hall in the old French quarter used to be crowded with visitors. Today there is a belligerent silence about the place. At a nearby market, pedlars sell off Maoist memorabilia. Attitudes have changed in Shanghai. The look of the city is also changing. The bulldozers are at work on the old Chinese tenements, raising dust in the name of development. The 'Have a nice day' crowd are moving in with their uniformly sleek hotels. See Shanghai quickly. Stay at the old Peace hotel on the Bund, all Art Deco, squeaking floors and fusty rooms. Dine at the candlelight restaurant on the eighth floor. Listen to the jazz band (average age 72) in the bar. Lie in bed and hear the ferry boats hoot on the Huangpu river outside. And get ready for dancing in the morning.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Russian reforms facing biggest test A WORLD Bank report on Russian economic reform, under discussion by the bank's board, stresses the need for tight monetary policy - to which the Russian government has again committed itself. The report pays tribute to the government's ambitious programme of macro-economic stabilisation and to the remarkable patience of the population in tolerating the harsh consequences of reform, but says the commitment to reform will now be severely tested as the scope for relatively painless adjustments has been exhausted. The report notes: Inflation for 1992 is expected to be 2,200 per cent. Oil production has declined by 1m barrels a day each day for the past two years and may fall even more rapidly. Investment of Dollars 25bn may be required over the next decade to arrest the decline. The government has inherited a vast, loss-making industrial structure. The financial structure is wholly inadequate for the tasks of reform, with much lending neither competitive nor market-based. The central bank has neither the staff nor the authority to force the (commercial) banks to comply with its mandates. There are great difficulties in implementing policy, exacerbated by a lack of trust within the civil service between reform-minded officials and those who have seen their power and prestige diminish as a result of the reforms. The report estimates the government's external financing requirements for 1992 at about Dollars 22bn (Pounds 12.8bn), and says that two-thirds of this must come from export credit agencies and from international financial institutions. However, it warns that failure to set clear priorities in the allocation of scarce financing may ultimately jeopardise the success of the reform programme. The drop in production - estimated by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, to have fallen by 27 per cent in the year to last month  - has not so far resulted in substantial growth in unemployment, the report says. 'Economic decline has rather been reflected in declining labour productivity rather than growing unemployment. . . the next phase of economic reforms, if they are to be effective, will have to address the problem of labour force restructuring.' The report also says that it will be extremely difficult to bring inflation down to the 10 per cent a month target agreed with the IMF, and says the programme would still be successful if it took longer - up to two years - to reduce inflation to single-digit levels on a monthly basis. The rouble slipped to an all-time low on the Moscow interbank currency exchange yesterday, trading at 248 to the dollar compared to 241 on Tuesday, Reuter adds. Meanwhile the Russian cabinet yesterday agreed to big wage increases for 15m public sector workers, notably poorly paid doctors and teachers.</p>

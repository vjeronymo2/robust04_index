			<p>BFN     [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis has sent a letter to Saeima  Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs, in which he revokes his request to  convene an extraordinary plenary session [of the parliament] on  15 April. According to a letter circulated by the presidential  office, it is being done because Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's order on military bases has not been repealed at a  level requested by Latvia.    Ulmanis points out in the letter that because of this, his  meeting with the Russian president is impossible in the nearest  future. At the moment the signing of the initialled agreements  in their present form is not possible either. The Latvian  president considers that discussions with the governing  coalition are evidence that there is no unanimity among the  deputies on the issue of the initialled agreements.    I consider that the above-mentioned circumstances are  substantial for the Saeima presidium to satisfy my request, the  end of the letter reads. In connection with the fact that the  state president has revoked, and the prime minister cancelled  the request to convene the Saeima extraordinary session on 15  April this year, the Saeima presidium has stated that there is  no longer a legal basis for the convention of such an  extraordinary session.</p>

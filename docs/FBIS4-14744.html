			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Jobless Cyclotron"] </F>   [Text] The Kiev Nuclear Research Institute at the  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is experiencing difficult times,  as with all science. Our country's only cyclotron, which cost  us 15 billion karbovantsi, has remained idle for six months.  There is not enough money for the energy and heating that it  requires. Just as there is no money at the Academy of Sciences,  the government is also in no hurry to help the scientists. The  Institute's financing from the budget is only 40 percent....    As a result, there is not enough money to conduct basic  studies. It is as though they have become unnecessary.  Specialists, who even now are not so numerous, are looking for  other jobs. For example, in Russia, where salaries are higher  and where there are possibilities for advancement. However,  perhaps the worst thing about this is that young people are  leaving the Institute -- commercial structures lure them away.  In the course of time, Ukraine may find itself without nuclear  specialists. At the same time, we have 15 nuclear power  stations, and, by the year 2000, it is envisaged to have at  least another five units commissioned.</p>

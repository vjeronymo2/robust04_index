			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F> (2621 3447) and XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking today at the  Central Party School's commencement ceremonies, Hu Jintao,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing  Committee, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, and  president of the Central Party School, pointed out: In  accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market  economic structure, we should, on the one hand, promote the  spirit of advancing despite difficulties and working  unflaggingly in order to firmly push forward reform. On the  other hand, we should adopt a rigorous, realistic, and  scientific attitude, proceed from reality, and promptly uncover  and solve salient problems as we move forward.    Attending the commencement ceremonies were 1,964 students  from the Central Party School's 21st advanced studies class for  cadres at the prefectural and departmental levels, the school's  theoretical department, and its branches at the CPC Central  Committee's Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central  Committee's Work Committee for Government Organs, and military  units.    After fully affirming the students' academic achievements,  Hu  Jintao pointed out: The year 1994 is very crucial to our  country's future process of reform and development. This year's  tasks are heavy and arduous. We must strengthen leadership,  consider the overall situation, and mobilize all positive  factors to ensure the implementation of various major central  policy decisions. He pointed out: A major issue to which the  entire party, especially leading cadres at all levels, must  attach importance, and which it must endeavor to solve, is how  to maintain rapid and good development of the national economy  and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform measures  while safeguarding political stability.    In his speech, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should  strengthen ideological and political work in the course of  reform to provide a spiritual driving force and an ideological  guarantee of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure. He said: Leading cadres  at all levels must carry forward the party's fine tradition and  work style, go deep among the masses, carry out mass propaganda,  and address and solve thorny and intensely discussed problems of  common concern to the people. Along with the introduction of  major reform measures, we should concentrate on carrying out  propaganda and explanatory work and on guiding public opinion in  order to dispel people's misgivings, defuse contradictions, and  mobilize the broad masses of people to support and participate  in reform. We should integrate ideological and political work  with the solution of people's practical problems, foster close  ties with the masses, listen to their views, understand popular  sentiment, show concern for people's sufferings, base our  actions on the masses, and strive to tailor our policy decisions  and measures to the wishes of the broad masses of the people.  Furthermore, we should foster correct ideals, beliefs, and  values, and vigorously promote the arduous pioneering spirit of  the new period, in all segments of society, especially among the  younger generation.    Hu Jintao also expressed his views on the questions of  thoroughly studying and mastering Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; correctly  handling the relationship between reform, development, and  stability; and earnestly strengthening and improving party  building. In closing, he expressed the hope that the students  would take their group studies in the Central Party School as a  new starting point from which to improve their on-the-job  studies, form the good habit of studying hard and thinking  deeply, apply constantly what they have learned to the practice  of reform and modernization, conduct investigations and studies,  sum up their experiences and improve their work, and enhance  their capacity for studying new circumstances and solving new  problems.    Wang Jialiu, executive vice president of the Central Party  School, chaired the commencement ceremonies. Attending the  ceremonies were Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, and responsible  individuals from relevant departments such as Zhao Zongnai, Liu  Yunshan, Zheng Keyang, Chen Fujin, Lu Shiche, Wang Yiping, Su  Xing, Xing Bensi, and Liu Shengyu.</p>

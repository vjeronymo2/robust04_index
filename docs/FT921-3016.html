			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Lib-Lab, or nothing at all THE Liberal Democrats, who will not form the next government, serve a useful purpose. Their party is a fruitful source of ideas, some of which are bright and some of which are incomprehensible. It is also a potential junior partner in a Labour-led coalition. The senior partner would have to be Labour, since the Conservatives could not in good faith ally themselves with Mr Paddy Ashdown's followers on the basis of their manifesto, 'Changing Britain for good', published yesterday. The prime minister refused to contemplate a change to proportional representation in his speech in Torquay on Saturday. Mr Ashdown is as unequivocally committed to the opposite policy. 'Liberal Democrats will neither support nor participate in a government which turns its back on reform,' states the manifesto. Labour, on the other hand, is proposing to keep talking about PR, even for elections to the House of Commons. The Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, remarked the other day that it was 'very highly unlikely' that first-past-the-post would be abandoned for national elections. He could hardly be more equivocal than that. Yet Labour policies on other items of constitutional reform are so close to those of the Liberal Democrats as to be indistinguishable. Both favour Scottish, Welsh and English regional self-government; both offer a freedom of information act and bills of rights (the Liberal Democrats would incorporate the European Convention into UK law), and both promise the reconstitution of the House of Lords as an elected senate. Party similarities Much of this is constructive; Britain needs a debate about governance. The Liberal Democrats' central argument, which is that constitutional reform is a necessary prerequisite for other reforms in the management of the British polity, has much to commend it. But there are other, more questionable, similarities between the two parties of the centre-left. Labour would sign the social charter proposed at the Maastricht meeting of European Community heads of state; so would the Liberal Democrats. The latter are more welcoming than the former to full economic and monetary union, but it is a distinction without a difference. Regrettably, both parties would retract the Conservatives' structural reforms of the social services. In the case of health this would be to abandon one of the government's more promising attempts to modernise the welfare state. Both appear to regard public expenditure as an absolute good, with tax increases guaranteed. The Liberal Democrats take this belief seriously: they alone hypothesise a public sector borrowing requirement Pounds 2bn higher than either Labour of the Conservatives dare to propose, and that after taking into account general increases in taxation. Attractive menu As most continental Europeans are aware, coalitions are not constructed on the basis of minority party manifestoes. Just a few choice items, or compromises, cement many political alliances. The Liberal Democrats' manifesto contains an enormous a la carte menu of attractive items. The Bank of England would become 'operationally independent'. Monopolies like British Telecom and British Gas would be broken up. Coal would become crown property, with licences to mine issued to British Coal and assorted competitors. The proposed EC energy tax would be supported, with offsetting reductions in VAT. Yet there are also propositions that simply do not make sense, such as the table indicating that a Pounds 4425m increase in state benefits, offset by tax 'reforms' (ie: increases) of Pounds 4,380m, could be implemented in year one of a new administration - and still give a net yield of Pounds 355m, after 'administrative savings' of Pounds 400m. Others are merely fantastical, such as the 'gradual integration of Community members' armed forces under a joint military command'. So long as the Liberal Democrats are not a prospective government such excesses need not be taken too seriously. Should it succeed in breaking the electoral system, the party would have to leave behind such cheerful confusion.</p>

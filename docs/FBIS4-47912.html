			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] For several weeks now, the Liberian peace process  has been threatened by factional fighting within the ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  organization. Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo faction has been  battling with Roosevelt Johnson's Krahns. They have been  fighting each other at the headquarters town of Tubmanburg, at  the Po River Bridge, and most recently at Clay Junction, just  outside Monrovia. The international peacekeeping force has been  powerless to stop the conflict, and it has been unclear who was  in control of Tubmanburg. Our correspondent, Nii Nartey  Allison, has just been there and sent this report.    Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo fighters are well in control of  Tubmanburg. Koromah's field commander, Mohamed Dumbuya, said  today in Tubmanburg that his forces are back in control of the  highway town of Clay and were poised to seize the Po River  Bridge getaway to ULIMO-controlled Bomi County. He said forces  loyal to Alhaji Koromah were today tightening their grip on the  villages of Sastown, Amadu Town, and Combat Camp, all of which  around the Clay to Po River highway. Mr. Dumbuya said: We will  fight until there is victory, even if we have to fight for the  next 100 years.    Meanwhile, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] chief of staff, General Femi  Williams, urged the warring tribes in ULIMO to allow the free  movement of peacekeeping troops in their areas as they had  agreed to earlier. He said the roads are to be kept open without  conditions and warned that ECOMOG will not entertain any further  move by ULIMO that endangers the life and property of innocent  people. The ECOMOG chief of staff also said: We will not relent  in our efforts until a peaceful resolution of the ULIMO crisis  is achieved.</p>

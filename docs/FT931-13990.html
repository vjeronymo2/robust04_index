			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Recall of Danish parliament urged MR UFFE Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister and leader of the Liberal party, launched a last-ditch attempt yesterday to prevent power slipping from the hands of the non-Socialist parties into the hands of the Social Democratic party. He demanded an immediate recall of the Folketing, or parliament, to debate last week's report of a judicial inquiry into the Tamilgate scandal and called on the Social Democratic leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, to drop his current attempts to form an SDP government until the debate is held. But the Liberal leader's manoeuvre, designed to force members of the Folketing to vote on whether they would accept a change to an SDP administration after 10 years of Conservative-Liberal government without an election appeared last night to be doomed. Mr Ellemann-Jensen needs signatures of 72 of the 179 members of the Folketing to force a debate, but it became apparent last night that he would not receive sufficient support. The Danish political crisis began last Thursday when Mr Poul Schluter, leader of the Conservative party and prime minister since 1982, resigned after being criticised for misleading parliament in the Tamilgate scandal by the report of a judicial inquiry. After Mr Schluter's resignation, Mr Rasmussen was called upon by Queen Margrethe to head negotiations for the formation of a new government.</p>

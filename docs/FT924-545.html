			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses continue their year-end rally CONTINENTAL bourses continued their Christmas rally yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT remained positive as some disappointing economic news was largely ignored. Remarks by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, forecasting a fall in long-term interest rates caused bonds and futures to rally but had little effect on equities, as he reaffirmed that there would be no change in short-term rates. The DAX index closed up 7.99 at 1,523.57, but off the day's high of 1,529.83. Turnover was barely changed at DM4bn after DM3.9bn. Volkswagen declined DM7.10 to DM237.20, partly as investors continued to sell following recent gloomy forecasts from the company but also because the German Automobile Association reported stagnating domestic demand and reduced orders from overseas. Retailers continued to be firm on a report that Christmas period turnover could beat expectations. Asko firmed DM20 to DM665, Karstadt was up DM4 to DM488 and Kaufhof improved DM5 to DM400. Utilities rose on news that a legal dispute between east German municipalities and power groups had been settled. RWE gained DM4.30 to DM399.80 and Viag rose DM7 to DM329.50. PARIS was lifted by a strong bond market and signs that pressure on the franc was easing, but some dealers feared that the stock market had risen too far, too fast. The CAC-40 index ended 38.08 higher at 1,824.37 in heavy turnover of FFr3.6bn. Most blue chips participated in the rally, with Alcatel rising FFr12 to FFr679 and BSN up FFr24 to FFr938. Drinks stocks also found favour, as LVMH put on FFr145 or 4.2 per cent to FFr3,600 and Pernod-Ricard added FFr16.50 or 4.8 per cent to FFr360. Hopes of lower interest rates again buoyed up financial stocks, as Suez gained FFr9.80 to FFr254.80 and Societe Generale added FFr16 to FFr597. MILAN was lifted right at the end of a dull session by news that the Bank of Italy had lowered its official discount rate by one point to 12 per cent. The Comit index ended 0.09 higher at 428.96 in turnover estimated at close to Monday's L134.5bn. Insurers and telecoms featured for a second day as Ras added L1,030 to L19,530 and Generali rose L160 to L27,610. Stet and Sip were traded heavily on continued hopes that the government was willing to sell a controlling stake in Stet. Stet was fixed L19 down at L1,760 but jumped to L1,842 after hours. Sip rose L101 to L1,486. Credito Italiano gained L38 to L2,850. The prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, said yesterday that the state-owned Banca Commerciale Italiana (up L175 at L4,600) would be put up for sale once the government had dealt with the sale of Credito Italiano. BRUSSELS built on Monday's gains with a 14.32 rise in the Bel-20 index to 1,141.56. Bekaert, which said after Monday's close that it was to pay a BFr100 1992 dividend rose BFr550 to BFr13,525. AMSTERDAM rose in thin trading with the CBS Tendency index gaining 1.2 to 105.6. Ahold advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 88.60 on news that it was to help set up the first food distribution system in Moscow. STOCKHOLM turned lower as profit-taking emerged after a three-day rally and the Affarsvarlden general index eased 6.8 to 914.6. Astra again dominated trading, accounting for roughly SKr190m of total turnover of SKr910m. Its A shares fell SKr2 to SKr748. HELSINKI rallied as the approaching year-end pushed up share prices and volumes. News that parliament had passed legislation dismantling restrictions on foreign ownership of shares from the start of 1993 also lifted sentiment. The Hex index rose 13.9 to 823.9. VIENNA's ATX index gained 16.53 or 2.3 per cent to 739.43. ISTANBUL closed at a three-month high, as cement and textile stocks featured. The 75-share index gained 44.84 or 1.1 per cent to 4,075.60 in turnover estimated at TL370bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices December 22                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1068.86   1068.85    1068.78    1069.19 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1154.63   1153.02    1151.67    1154.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Dec 21     Dec 18     Dec 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100            1059.21    1050.25    1034.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200            1145.44    1136.56    1119.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00     14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1071.20   1072.30    1073.44    1072.92 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1156.12   1155.77    1157.18    1157.60  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Dec 16         Dec 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1036.62        1038.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1117.67        1115.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1074.73 ; 200 -  1157.97 Low/day: 100 -  1068.38  200 -  1151.67  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

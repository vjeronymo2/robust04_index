			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> RECOGNIZING DIVERSITY;  </P> <P> A RESOURCE FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS TO FIGHT PREJUDICE, BUILD PRIDE, RESPECT  DIVERSITY  </P> <P> According to research, children first learn prejudice from their parents. This  happens around age 5.  </P> <P> By age 7, children begin to mimic their parents' racial attitudes and behavior.  And by age 9, most of their racial attitudes and behavior are fully developed.  </P> <P> How children feel and act toward racial, ethnic and religious minority groups  is a direct result of what they learn from their parents, child-care providers,  teachers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, peers and the media.  </P> <P> We have developed this resource, which includes quizzes, activities and ideas,  to help parents and teachers do something about reducing prejudice and its  effects.  </P> <P> As a result of working through this guide, we hope parents and teachers will  gain a greater awareness so that discrimination and prejudice are not taught to  children in homes and in schools.  </P> <P> We hope that parents of racial and ethnic children will be better able to teach  their children coping skills they can use when confronted with prejudice and  discrimination.  </P> <P> We hope that teachers will have better skills and more resources to use as they  work toward bringing equality to the classroom.  </P> <P> Finally, we hope that all people will have a greater appreciation and respect  for the diverse cultures that are woven into the fabric of our Southern  California community.  </P> <P> DID YOU KNOW?  </P> <P> Roger Wilkins, a senior research fellow at the Washington-based Institute for  Policy Studies, says, "One of the central issues of American racism is denial  -- denial that it exists, denial that it is as bad as it is, denial that ...  people are injured by it." The following questions, which are based on news  reports, are aimed at making parents and teachers more aware that prejudice and  discrimination are real and growing problems.  </P> <P> 1. According to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, in 1985 the  number of racially and religiously motivated acts of vandalism and violence in  the county:  </P> <P> A. Fell by 10%.  </P> <P> B. Were unchanged.  </P> <P> C. Climbed by 82%.  </P> <P> The correct answer is C. Incidents included the firebombing of an interracial  couple's automobile, an ethnically motivated assault against an Arab at his  place of work and numerous instances of swastikas painted on Jewish property  and KKK slogans on property owned by blacks. As a result, Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley called for closer police reporting and monitoring by LAPD of such hate  crimes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2. The Glendale Police Department's first black officer testified in 1987 that  he was greeted with the following at a party for rookies who had passed  probation:  </P> <P> A. A cross-burning.  </P> <P> B. Racial epithets.  </P> <P> C. A warm welcome.  </P> <P> The correct answer is A. Ronald E. Jenkins testified before the state Workers'  Compensation Board that the cross-buring and other incidents of discrimination  forced him to take disability leave from the force.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3. In Huntington Park in 1984, Latino employees at the Municipal Court were  required to speak Spanish to the public when necessary. In their dealings with  co-workers, they:  </P> <P> A. Were encouraged to speak Spanish or English.  </P> <P> B. Were prohibited from speaking Spanish.  </P> <P> C. Were required to teach Spanish on their breaks.  </P> <P> The correct answer is B. The English-only rule, imposed after passage of a  statewide English-only initiative, was barred by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals, which said it contributed to a workplace atmosphere that discriminates  against Latinos and heightens racial animosity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4. In many universities -- both large and small, liberal and conservative --  throughout the United States, incidents of racism on campus over the last two  years have:  </P> <P> A. Increased.  </P> <P> B. Stayed the same.  </P> <P> C. Decreased.  </P> <P> The correct answer is A. College campuses have not proven to be havens from  bigotry -- from cross-burnings to hate-stained graffiti and even to physical  assaults. Even more widespread are subtle forms of racism -- such as  condescension and standoffishness from Anglo professors -- that minority  students confront daily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5. More than 90% of all senior management posts in corporate America and public  school administration positions nationwide are held by:  </P> <P> A. Anglo men and women.  </P> <P> B. Anglo and minority men.  </P> <P> C. Anglo men.  </P> <P> The correct answer is C. Anglo men hold 97% of all senior management jobs.  Studies have foundthat women managers often get less prestigious assignments  and supervise fewer workers than do men. Minority managers often get positions  that don't lead to senior management. In public education, 95% of school  principals and district superintendents are Anglo men, according to a study by  the National Center for Education Information.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6. Los Angeles County has the largest urban population nationwide of American  Indians. Why are they called the silent minority of Los Angeles County?  </P> <P> A. They do not form tight urban communities, making it difficult to voice  concerns.  </P> <P> B. They are too small in number and too scattered to effectively fight  discrimination.  </P> <P> C. They are often mistaken for another race.  </P> <P> D. All of the above  </P> <P> The correct answer is D. While California has the largest number of Indian  residents of any state, they rank among the smallest minority in Los Angeles  county, accounting for only 1% of its population. Bell Gardens, Cudahy and  South Gate are home to 3% of the county's American Indians. The overall state  population is expected to increase significantly by 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8. For the past 112 years in statewide elected offices in California, Latinos:  </P> <P> A. Have been under-represented.  </P> <P> B. Have been well represented.  </P> <P> C. Have not won a single post.  </P> <P> The correct answer is C. Although Latinos serve in the state Legislature and in  other electedpositions, they have never held statewide offices, such as  governor, U.S. senator and superintendent of public instruction. In a survey of  California registered voters by the Los Angeles Times Poll, more bias was found  to exist against Latino candidates on a statewide ballot than against blacks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9. In an April, 1987, interview on the TV show "Nightline," Ted Koppel asked  then-Dodger Vice President Al Campanis why there were no black managers in  baseball. What was the response?  </P> <P> A. Blacks did not actively seek management positions.  </P> <P> B. Blacks did not have the ability.  </P> <P> C. Playing baseball was more lucrative than managing it.  </P> <P> The correct answer is B. Despite several chances to explain his answer,  Campanis continued to make bold statements reflecting stereotypes and  misinformation about blacks. Campanis later left the Dodgers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with reporters, Vice Foreign  Minister Isabel Allende gave her very personal impressions  regarding the harassment that Magda Montiel, participant in the  Nation and the Emigre Community conference, is suffering in  Miami. Journalist Roberto Cavada recorded part of the interview  with Allende.    [Begin Allende recording] In the first place, I was very  surprised that Magda Montiel was being harassed simply for  having come to Cuba for the Nation and the Emigre Community  conference, a meeting that had clear and specific goals: to find  formulas to normalize relations, find paths, and listen to the  emigre community.    Those emigres came from all over the world. They came to  express ideas which have been considered by the Cuban  Government. As a result of her participation -- at least from  what I heard on Cuban radio during the interview with Magda --  she is now in a very difficult situation. Magda sounded very  upset and I believe I even heard a child crying in the  background.    I believe this is incredible and I believe any honorable  human being would feel the same way. It is a behavior that only  right-wing extremists could have, people who are obviously very  far from being faithful to principles that they claim to defend  around the world: principles such as pluralism, freedom of  speech, and freedom to be faithful to one's principles.    I believe Magda Montiel has been faithful to her principles.  She has principles and ideas, and she came here to express those  ideas, not to agree with ours. Let us assume that one of our  ideas were involved -- and I am not saying that is the case --  but let us assume that Magda were to agree with one of our  ideas. Is that a crime? Is that a felony? Is that sufficient  reason to harass her as people were harassed during fascist  times or during the most reactionary periods? I am truly  appalled by this.    I believe that what is happening in Miami, far from  benefiting the far right, in the long run -- and I am saying in  the long run, which is my personal opinion -- will make many  people ask questions, not only in the United States, but outside  of the United States. It should make thousands of Cubans in  Miami, and in all parts of the world, who did not attend the  meeting or were not interested in the meeting ask why people  behave this way. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday [9 June] that the  United States remains committed to backing China's efforts for  re-entry into GATT and membership of the World Trade  Organization.    In a meeting here with Long Yongtu, China's assistant  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, Kantor  mentioned what he called "a courageous decision" President  Clinton announced two weeks ago to extend China's  most-favored-nation trade status without conditions. He  described it as an extremely important step for promoting  U.S.-China relations.    He said that the two great countries of the United States  and  China should establish a relationship of cooperation with mutual  confidence between them. While giving assurance of Washington's  continued support for China's effort to resume its seat as a  founding member of GATT and become a member of the World Trade  Organization, Kantor indicated that China should, like all other  countries, assume the responsibilities as the multilateral trade  system requires.    The Chinese assistant minister said that basing itself on  the  principle of balance between rights and duties, China has shown  and will continue to show the greatest possible flexibility in  the talks on its re-entry into GATT. But he made it clear that  there is a limit to such flexibility, i.e., the obligations  China is expected to undertake have to be suited to the present  level of China's economic development and full consideration  must be given to the fact that China's economic reform and the  establishment of a market economy are a process of gradual  advance.    Long Yongtu led a 24-member Chinese delegation to the ninth  round of Sino-U.S. bilateral consultations on China's re-entry  into GATT, which were held here on June 5-8. The U.S.  delegation in the 4-day talks was composed of 45 people from  various government departments. A Chinese official said that  both sides regarded this round of talks as frank and sincere,  which resulted in positive progress.    According to the Chinese official, considerable differences  still exist between China and the United States on a number of  issues, especially on the issue as regards the U.S. demand for  China to open its market in the service sector. The two sides  agreed to continue their consultations in Geneva at the end of  this month.</p>

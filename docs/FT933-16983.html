			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Eight years' jail for Nissan UK chief MR MICHAEL HUNT, the managing director of Nissan UK, the former West Sussex-based car importers, was yesterday jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court for his part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud. This followed his conviction last Saturday for conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight charges for Nissan cars imported to the UK from Japan. When interest is added, the total loss to the public purse from the fraud is estimated to be more than Pounds 87m. His co-defendant, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the company, was sentenced to three years after admitting, before the trial began, to one offence of cheating the revenue. Sentencing Mr Hunt, the trial judge, Mr Justice Gatehouse, said the offence was 'in a category of its own'. 'You realise that this is an offence which is so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate. An immediate custodial sentence which is bound to be a long one,' he told Mr Hunt. Sentencing Mr Shannon, the judge said his offence - helping to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 17m over a one-year period between November 1985 and October 1986 - was a less serious crime. He also gave him credit for his guilty plea and for his co-operation with the Inland Revenue. During the two-month trial the prosecution said the fraud was by far the largest ever perpetrated on the Revenue. The 'prime mover' behind the fraud, it alleged, was Mr Octav Botnar, the company's chairman who is in Switzerland, beyond the reach of UK justice. The Inland Revenue will now start civil proceedings to recover some of the Pounds 87m from Mr Hunt. Mr Shannon has already reached a settlement with the Revenue, having agreed to repay Pounds 10m. Both men were also barred from being company directors.</p>

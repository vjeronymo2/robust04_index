			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie falls further on US data The FT-SE 100 index moved a step closer to the 3,000 level yesterday as the London equity market reacted to economic news from the US. At the end of another session of low volumes but high anxiety, the Footsie suffered a further 22.3 decline to close at 3,017.3, a two-day fall of 64.1. The latest bout of weakness left the index down 16.2 in a week that included what was perceived by most equity market strategists as a broadly neutral Budget.

To complement this overall consolidation and simplification effort, CPD has designed this NOFA to increase access for technical assistance to CPD grantees, potential grantees and program participants in the CDBG, HOME, Supportive Housing and CHDO assistance programs. This NOFA places heavy emphasis upon coordination of technical assistance activities to provide greater flexibility and responsiveness in meeting the community development and housing needs, including the housing needs of homeless populations in local jurisdictions, while providing greater flexibility to TA providers in the delivery of assistance services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new application procedures presented in this NOFA will simplify the TA process, promote cost savings, eliminate duplication, improve the system for potential grantees in need of assistance, and allow interested applicants to seek to deliver a wider, more integrated array of TA services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

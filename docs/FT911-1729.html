			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Cheaper rates encourage three Canadian issues THREE Canadian dollar Eurobonds were launched in the international capital markets yesterday as European investors returned after Wednesday's May Day holiday. The Eurobond market is now offering cheaper rates than the domestic market, even for Canadian borrowers which have historically found the domestic market a cheaper source of funds. The domestic market suffered a setback this week when the Province of Ontario's triple-A rated debt was placed under review for possible downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, following a disappointing budget. Ontario's debt provides a pricing benchmark for much of the domestic market, so spreads over the government bond market widened 6 or 7 basis points. Eurobond spreads also widened, but soon recovered. The largest deal of the day was a CDollars 250m three-year deal for the Province of Saskatchewan, considered attractively priced at a 75 basis point margin above the comparable Canadian government bond. Placement was split between institutional and retail investors in Europe, according to lead manager Wood Gundy. While other Canadian provinces have been frequent visitors to the Eurobond market this year, reflecting both increased borrowing needs and improved European demand, single-A rated Saskatchewan had until now found the domestic market a cheaper source of funds. The Canadian municipality of Hamilton tapped the market with a CDollars 75m issue of retractable notes, a structure usually reserved for the domestic market. The 15-year deal, puttable after five and 10-years, is targetted at institutional investors. Also in the Canadian dollar sector, Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, launched a CDollars 100m issue, which met firm demand among yield-hungry investors in Benelux. Petrofina is Belgium's largest company, but its lack of credit rating tends to deter investors elsewhere. The company is currently seeking a rating. In Germany, Nichii, the Japanese department store chain, launched the largest ever D-mark equity-linked deal for a Japanese borrower. The DM500m four-year deal was quoted below its par issue price at 99 1/2 offered. Japanese equity warrant deals are normally expected to trade above their issue price in the primary market. A Pounds 100m four-year deal for the Nationwide Anglia Building Society via Baring Brothers was considered aggressively priced, at a yield spread of 81 basis points above the 10 1/4 per cent gilt due 1995. However, lead manager Baring Brothers pointed out that other paper at that area of the yield curve was trading substantially over par, which deters many investors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary signed LZ: "Government Policy Not Disavowed"] </F>   [Text] In yesterday's elections to replace the Luxembourg  Chamber of Deputies there was no landslide in the distribution  of seats but only minor shifts. Just as the election campaign  was a quiet affair, the results were equally unspectacular.    The first conclusion to be drawn is that the Luxembourgers  are generally unwilling to engage in uncertain or even risky  experiments. As before, they are playing safe, giving  preference to the proven grouping of the large, traditional  parties.    Second, the government's policy was widely sanctioned since  none of the two parties who have governed together for 10 years  was greatly discredited. The CSV [Christian Social People's  Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg]  suffered only minor losses.    A third characteristic of these elections is the role played  by the four minor parties in splitting the vote, despite the  fact that the three major parties maintained their position. As  a result, seats were lost by the parties capable of forming a  government. It may be doubted whether this situation is of any  advantage to the democratic power game in the state.    Since the electorate largely confirmed the government's  policy, it did not expressly desire any political change,  logically enough. So the gains of the DP [Democratic Party],  which is still the third strongest party, can by no means be  taken automatically as a plebiscite for taking over government  business. Nevertheless, the DP's gains are clear enough to make  this party the real, albeit modest, winner of yesterday's  elections.    After the weak opposition and in view of the vague election  program, however, the question was raised as to how the DP  managed to make these gains and whether they are due more to  protest votes rather than convinced supporters. It should also  be borne in mind that this party reached a rare low point in  1989 with only 11 seats.    The minor losses suffered by the governing parties are due  first to the natural signs of wear and tear after 10 years of  coalition politics. This government, which has borne the  responsibility for such a long time and which has had to make  many unpopular decisions during that period, came out of this  remarkably well yesterday. The CSV in particular, as the  leading party in government, is likely to feel that its policy  and role have been vindicated, the respected figure of Prime  Minister Jacques Santer having undoubtedly made an important  contribution to this recognition.    The LSAP has profited less from this government bonus. Just  like the CSV, it lost many votes to the splinter parties.  Moreover, it has had responsibility for certain departments  which have recently provoked extensive discussions and disputes,  e.g., the health reforms, which have made many citizens feel  unsettled. Moreover, the Socialist Party derived no benefit  from pushing the ideological claims of its rabble-rousers to the  center of the election campaign, thus jeopardizing the nation's  internal peace.    The most annoying result for the major parties was  undoubtedly that of the ADR [Action Committee for Democracy and  Pension Fairness]. Nevertheless, the scandal that this party  incurred, with the lies and smear campaigns concerning alleged  party donations, was sanctioned retrospectively yesterday by so  many voters via the polls that these people have been given five  seats as a reward, believe it or not, and hence the status of a  parliamentary group. What were these Luxembourgers thinking  about when they made that decision yesterday in the polling  booth? Were the shabby, nationalistic, anti-European slogans  and the pensions policy used as a bait worth more to them than  basic political honesty?    The fact that the Greens did not achieve the breakthrough  many people thought they would is all the more surprising  because many young people have become eligible to vote in the  five years since the last election, and it is widely assumed  that the Greens receive the greatest response and acceptance  from this group. Although with five seats the GLEI-GAP [Green  Ecologist Initiative List/The Green Alternative] will now be  able to constitute a parliamentary group, this result cannot  hide the fact that they have lost their original impetus, and  the young voters have turned clearly to traditional parties, and  not necessarily to the left either. On the contrary, taken as a  whole, the left has not been strengthened by any means by  yesterday's election.    The Communists and the New Left in particular were cast into  oblivion. But they were not the only ones. The extreme right  of the National Movement were also put in their place, and this  against a background of an internationally increasing resentment  of foreigners which seems to stop at Luxembourg's borders  though, and after the second attempt to compete with the  Democrats for seats in the chamber.    The Luxembourger's rejection of the really extremist forces  may placate those who, after the relative success of the ADR  built on demagogy and lies, have yesterday evening lost their  faith in the good sense of some of the voters.</p>

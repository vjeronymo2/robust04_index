			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER MEETING DELAYED; INTERIM VACANCY AT TOP SEEN  </P> <P> A meeting scheduled Wednesday between George Steinbrenner and his 18 limited  partners has been postponed until next week due to an emergency family matter  involving one of the partners. They are expected to approve his son, Hank  Steinbrenner, as general partner at the meeting.  </P> <P> The delay all but assures that the New York Yankees will operate without a  full-time general partner for an interim period after George Steinbrenner  resigns by Aug. 20. Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of  baseball's Ownership Committee, said his group will not begin to examine Hank  Steinbrenner's suitability as general partner until after the Yankees partners  vote.  </P> <P> Leonard Kleinman, chief operating officer of the Yankees, said the club has not  addressed how it will be run if Hank Steinbrenner is not approved by the time  George Steinbrenner must step down.  </P> <P> "That's a good question," Kleinman said. "Nobody has discussed it at this time.  There have been a number of things that have been addressed, but that is not  one of them."  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent has said he will not postpone George Steinbrenner's  sanctions. He has said he assumes the Yankees' "senior officers" will run the  club on an interim basis.  </P></p>

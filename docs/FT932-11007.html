			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan enters the world of fantasy - Robert Thomson samples the delights of Tokyo Disneyland A Japanese cowboy politely cleared the way for Mickey Mouse and Scottish dancers in their clan tartan practised steps for a 10th anniversary parade around the meticulously clean, yen-paved streets of Tokyo Disneyland. Euro Disneyland may be struggling to establish its identity, but Tokyo Disneyland's success has prompted the Japanese managing company, Oriental Land, to plan a marine-theme Disney park adjacent to the original. The marketing of Disney in Japan was aimed at what Toshio Kagami, Oriental Land's senior managing director, describes as a 'deep feeling for fantasy' among Japanese, who were not culturally intimidated by the US-manufactured icons and wanted undiluted Disney. 'Japanese have a good feeling for fantasy. When they come to Disneyland it is like the Japanese tea ceremony. There are rules, roles and symbolism. Japanese know that when they come here, they are in the US and they play that role, that fantasy,' Kagami said. Video game makers have tapped a similar desire for role-playing leisure. Hayao Nakayama, the president of Sega, said that US and European software buyers prefer quick-thrill competition scenarios, while games allowing players to take on a new role are more popular in Japan. 'These games require more thought, more attention to detail. There are some game maniacs in the US who like the role-playing type, but it's the common thing in Japan,' Nakayama said. For a culture stressing awareness of duties and in which the company name comes before the family one, the desire to 'escape' from these roles into a new identity or fantasy setting is understandable. But it is often important that the fantasy role be as carefully signposted as that of the job description. Another theme park, the Huis Ten Bosch, is a recreation of what, in the popular imagination, is a Dutch village, not far from Nagasaki. Instead of Adventureland and Tomorrowland, the Dutch park has Utrecht, a restaurant district, Kinderdijk, a pastoral setting with mandatory windmills, and Spakenburg, a port town. Holland Dutch Village Corporation, which runs the park, eventually hopes 10,000 people will submerge themselves in a new personality by living permanently in the village. In the first year of operation to March, it attracted 3.86m visitors and expects to profit from the government's aim to increase leisure time and make Japan a 'lifestyle superpower'. The Dutch village in Nagasaki will struggle to match the success of Tokyo Disneyland. Expected to attract 10m visitors a year, the park had just over 16m in 1991, about 90 per cent of them repeat visitors. Oriental Land says attendance was slightly lower last year for the first time since its opening, a decline blamed on the souring of the economy. 'If you look at the falling profitability in other sectors, our 2 per cent decline was pretty good. In some ways, it is a good thing, as we were over our capacity and that affects the quality of people's fantasy experience,' Kagami said. There's a two-hour wait at the weekends for the most popular roller-coaster, Splash Mountain, and queues of 40 minutes or more for the other 'white-knuckle' rides. And there's still a crush at the souvenir counters for the Mickey ears and for plates embossed with the 'Sharing Disney Dreams since 1983' slogan. In the mid-1970s, when negotiations began between the Walt Disney Company and Oriental Land, run by Mitsui Real Estate and Keisei Electric Railway, both sides debated whether the park should be somehow made more Japanese than the American original. But Oriental Land says the Tokyo version is profitable precisely because it did not attempt to link Goofy or Donald Duck to traditional Japanese culture. One employee who experienced Euro Disney found it 'too European' and another suggested the Japanese would be uneasy seeing traditional screens on Cinderella's castle. Disneyland's continuing success has encouraged non-entertainment companies to diversify into theme parks. Nippon Steel has built Space World on the southern island of Kyushu and there's a year-round indoor beach on another old steel company site near Tokyo. Sanrio, a gift and greeting card company, which built Puroland, about 40 minutes from Tokyo, is striving to create an instant, Disney-like tradition and ethos around a cloyingly cute cat called Hello Kitty. Sanrio claims that, at Puroland, customers 'learn to love' , 'exchange their hearts' and are 'spiritually uplifted', none of which offers a Disney-like escape. Perhaps that is why attendance fell 16 per cent to 1.5m last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> REP'S 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' RINGS WITH HOLIDAY JOY  </P> <P> The San Diego Repertory Theatre has produced a bold, challenging, beautifully  wrought version of "A Christmas Carol" on its Lyceum Stage that will not be to  everyone's taste.  </P> <P> To bring home Dickens' message about the poor of his day in the show's 15th  annual year here, directors Walter Schoen and Tavis Ross have contemporized the  setting so that we can see Charles Dickens' story as it might be discovered by  the poor of our day.  </P> <P> Dickens himself, a passionate advocate for the overworked and underfed, would  probably love it. But post-show complaints mixed with praise from an audience  that seemed divided about having their old-fashioned "Christmas Carol" tampered  with.  </P> <P> Without changing the words in the faithful adaptation by Douglas Jacobs, the  company's artistic director, the story begins in a contemporary urban setting,  not unlike the streets surrounding the theater itself. The actors are dressed  like our own homeless, crowding around barrels of burning paper for warmth. And  their varying ethnic backgrounds -- African-American, Anglo, Latino -- hold up  a mirror to our own multicultural society.  </P> <P> Into this mix, a little boy, played by the adorably precocious 10-year-old Kory  Abosada, brings a copy of "A Christmas Carol" home to read to his mother. Just  as he gets started, the police sirens start shrieking and the people run to  hide. The little boy returns with his book before the others do and encounters  an old man (Leon Singer) checking the place out. The boy approaches the man,  and the man slaps him -- hard. The other homeless return and surround the old  man menacingly.  </P> <P> The old man's punishment as mimed by the company? He has to act out "A  Christmas Carol" with them, playing the part of Ebenezer Scrooge. The boy plays  the parts of both Tiny Tim and the youngest of the Ebenezers that Scrooge meets  in his subsequent journey with the Ghost of Christmas Past.  </P> <P> By the time the story ends, with the cast pulling props from their environment  and singing haunting Christmas melodies that come out of their variety of  heritages, the old man who plays Scrooge has had a change of heart. This time  when the sirens come, he puts his arm around the little boy protectively. Like  Scrooge, he has learned a lesson about keeping Christmas in his heart.  </P> <P> This year's production is an extension of the contemporary setting explored by  Schoen as solo director last year. But while the idea seemed unfinished a year  ago, this time the added pantomimed prologue brings the message home.  </P> <P> One certainly cannot imagine any improvement on the performances.  </P> <P> Singer, an actor who hails originally from Mexico, is a memorable Scrooge -- so  crusty and cynical that it is all the more moving when he melts. Lance E.  Nichols is stalwart as Scrooge's good clerk, Bob Cratchit, Richard Ortega  utterly charming as Scrooge's good-hearted nephew, Fred. Tavis Ross suggests  pain even as he inspires fear as the ghost of Scrooge's old partner in  parsimony, Jacob Marley. Osayande Baruti brings charismatic life to the  high-stepping Fezziwig, the good master Scrooge had as a young apprentice. And  Cristina Soria lends fine support in her double role as Fezziwig's and  Cratchit's wives.  </P> <P> Narrators Dana Pere and Alyce Smith-Cooper keep the story flowing as they pass  the story from hand to hand.  </P> <P> Bruce Nelson, who plays the oldest of the young Ebenezers, provides the  spirited choreography that is such a delight in the Fezziwig scene. Musical  director Linda Vickerman does such a fine job with the arrangements and  compositions sung by this terrific array of voices, that one wishes more music  could have been included.  </P> <P> Tom Buderwitz's sets, nicely lit by John B. Forbes, are as they were last year  -- intelligently evocative of a modern street scene, with props designed to  look as if they came naturally from such a place. The costumes by Mary Larson  also seem reminiscent of those from last year, but again cleverly so. The best  of the pleasing bunch has got to be the Ghost of Christmas Present costume  which makes the big, hearty-voiced Richard Allen look like a human Christmas  tree, with tinsel and name brand packaging hanging from his arms and legs.  </P> <P> But the true completion of the contemporizing concept here is the San Diego  Rep's Magic Christmas program. Each patron is requested to bring an unwrapped  present for disadvantaged children and/or their families from the Hillcrest  Receiving Home, St. Vincent de Paul, Casa de Amaro, Hidden Valley House,  Southeast Emergency Quarters, Project Safehouse and Casa de Paz. The presents  will be placed under a tree in the Lyceum lobby and on Dec. 19, the actor  playing Scrooge will give out the presents after a benefit performance for  children and families from these shelters.  </P> <P> For that audience, this setting should certainly bring the Dickens' story home.  </P> <P> "A CHRISTMAS CAROL"  </P> <P> By Charles Dickens.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Testifying before the Legislative Yuan yesterday,  National Defense Minister Sun Chen said that the nation's armed  forces have completed the drafting of a manpower plan for the  next 10 years which will be implemented beginning next July.  According to the plan, seven army brigadier command  headquarters and 17 battalions will be dismantled within a year.  In addition, the army's ordnance and transport schools will be  merged into the logistics school. Troop strength will be  reduced by more than 20,000 via the streamlining.    Sun Chen said: If our internal and external environments  continue to develop in the right direction, we may also consider  accelerating the implementation of the plan or reducing our  total manpower. He pointed: Internal environments refer to the  improvement of our fighting capability following the replacement  of our weapons with newer ones, which will reduce the  requirements for manpower. Objective environments refer to  relations across the strait and the international situation,  both may affect the implementation of the manpower plan.    In response to questions by legislators on the emphasis  placed on strengthening the defense posture in the national  defense white paper, Vice Minister Ku Cong-lien made a special  point to explain that the change of the national defense  strategy from offensive to defensive does not mean a change from  active defense to passive; rather, it is an active strategy  adopted to coordinate with the country's economic and foreign  policies. He said that some people are worried about gaps in  the national armed forces' fighting capability, but the Ministry  of Defense actually has long had a plan to prevent the  development of such a situation; there will never be the  so-called "gaps" in defense preparations.</p>

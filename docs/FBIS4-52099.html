			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Ruling and opposition  lawmakers alike bashed Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano  Friday and demanded an unequivocal diplomatic apology.    Nagano has justified Japan's aggression during World War II  by claiming his country wanted to liberate Asian colonies from  Europe.    He also dismissed the "Rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese  soldiers are believed to have killed some 300,000 Chinese  civilians, as "a hoax."    His comments immediately raised temperatures in South Korea,  a victim of over three decades of Japanese colonial rule before  liberation at the end of World War II.    Seoul and Tokyo had reached a political understanding last  summer to close the book on their unhappy history.    In addition to their own ire at Nagano's remarks, lawmakers  here are concerned that his comments were not a slip of the  tongue but representative of the new faction advocating Japan's  remilitarization.    After all, they cite Nagano's high status as justice  minister  and the fact that he is the first cabinet member since the war  who was a member of the Japanese self-defense forces.    Ruling Democratic Liberal Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called  Nagano's words "bombastic, against the world current."    "We cannot but express serious regrets that a cabinet member  of the Japanese Government that champions political reform has  such a skewed perspective of history," he said in a party  commentary.    "There has to be a clear explanation from the person  himself,  naturally, and from the Japanese Government."    Rep. Kwon Ik-hyon, former chairman and now adviser to the  Korea- Japan Parliamentarian Union, said he cannot understand  "such betrayal of common sense."    "I hope it was nothing more than a spur-of-the-moment  thing,"  he said.    Rep. No Chae-pong, a member of the National Assembly Foreign  Affairs-Unification Committee, wondered why Nagano made such  comments when Seoul and Tokyo were finally working on building a  future relationship.    Deputy Spokesman Son Hak-kyu was worried about a revival of  Japanese militarism. "But South Korea-Japan relations should not  be influenced by this incident, and we send our full support to  the majority of the Japanese people who want peace through  resolution of the past," he said.    Opposition Democratic Party spokesman Pak Chi-won wanted to  know if the Japanese Government has indeed changed its  perspective on the war.    "Our government must demand a clear-cut explanation and  prevent any repetition of this kind of incident," he said in a  commentary.    Rep. Kim Won-ki, saying it was not an accidental outburst,  insisted Nagano's comments reflect what Japan has believed all  along.    "The whole world is turning into regional blocs. Japan, too,  hasn't given up its hopes for hegemony," he said. "Nagano's talk  could turn into a real threat for us if we don't build up our  political role."    "It's nothing short of historical distortion proving the war  of colonialism has not yet ended," Rep. Yim Chae-Chong said.    Rep. Son Se-il blasted the new Japanese Government, accusing  it of being more backward than the Liberal Democratic Party on  historical issues.    "Our government is even considering military cooperation  with  Japan, but we have to review South Korea-Japan relations from  the basics," he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PROPERTY TAX BILLS TO BE MAILED OCT. 19  </P> <P> More than $428 million in property tax bills will be mailed Oct. 19, and  taxpayers have until Dec. 10 to pay at least the first installment.  </P> <P> The bill can be paid in two equal installments, the second of which is due  April 10, said John McKinney, assistant treasurer-tax collector.  </P> <P> Bills postmarked after the due dates will be assessed a 10% penalty, he said.  People who bought property after March 1 and do not receive a tax bill should  contact the tax collector's office. Failure to receive a tax statement does not  mean that delinquency penalties will be canceled, officials said.  </P> <P> Payments can be mailed or made in person. The tax collector's office will be  open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 8.  </P> <P> Property taxes represent 1% of the full value of the property. The $428-million  figure for the county is $53 million more than last year, a 14% increase, and  is mostly due to new construction, McKinney said. PROPERTY TAXES The total  assessed value of property in Ventura County has increased 59.5% in the last  six years. The schools are the recipients of the greatest chunck of the revenue  from property taxes.  </P></p>

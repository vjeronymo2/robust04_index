			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): TGWU leadership contender alleges 'gagging' SUPPORTERS of Mr Bill Morris, deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, yesterday claimed that his campaign for the leadership of the union was being hindered by local TGWU officials who did not want him elected. They said several campaign meetings and visits to companies had been cancelled after interventions by local officials. The claim is the latest development in the increasingly acrimonious contest between Mr Morris and Mr George Wright, the two rivals to succeed Mr Ron Todd. Mr Morris said that senior officials and lay members of his union were trying to 'gag' him to damage his campaign. 'I will not be gagged,' he declared. 'I have got a message and I am not going to be stopped from delivering it.' Supporters of Mr Wright, the Wales regional secretary, cast doubt on the significance of the incidents. They emphasised that Mr Wright had no involvement in restricting Mr Morris's campaign. Regional secretaries in nine of the TGWU's 11 regions have offered support to Mr Wright. Leaders of Mr Morris's campaign have been concerned that regional officials sympathetic to his rival might hinder the campaign in their areas. Mr Morris's supporters said that interventions by local officials had led to two company visits' being cancelled in the past two weeks. He had also been prevented from speaking in the Neath by-election in support of Mr Peter Hain, Labour's successful candidate in the recent Neath by-election. They said a visit to a Walker's Crisps factory in Leicester had been cancelled by a district official on the ground that he had a dispute with the company. Shop stewards at the company had told Mr Morris they knew of no such dispute. Backers of Mr Morris also said that a planned visit to Esso Chemicals refinery at Fawley, near Southampton, had been postponed by the company on the ground that no senior manager was available to meet him.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["na"-signed report: "In the European Monetary Union, the </F> Wage Sin Is Promptly Followed by Employment Policy Atonement"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 14-15 May -- In the European Monetary  Union (EMU), the employment policy responsibility of employers  and trade unions will increase. This is stated in a study of  the IW German Economic Research Institute, which was written on  behalf of, and subsidized by, the European Commission.    The IW argues that, since, in the framework of the  convergence process during the next few years, monetary policy  has been fixed at a strictly antiinflationary course and  financial policy has been oriented at structural consolidation,  wage policy errors can in the future no longer be covered up by  an expansive governmental demand management. In addition, it  will no longer be possible to devalue the currency to correct an  exaggerated wage policy.    In view of the recession, which has led to a drastic  increase  in unemployment throughout the European Union [EU], employers  and trade unions are particularly called upon in the nineties to  promote economic growth within the EU by pursuing a wage policy  that must be aimed at combating rising costs and improving  international competitiveness. They are also called upon to  make an active wage policy contribution to solve employment  problems.  <H5>  Competitive Disadvantage Through Higher Wage Unit Costs </H5>   The IW study criticizes the fact that, in the recent past,  the development of wages in many areas has been faster than the  productivity rate, so that wage unit costs have increased  steeply. With the changes in the international exchange rate  mechanism, the EU's competitiveness toward the United States and  Japan since 1985 has clearly deteriorated as far as wage costs  are concerned. As a result, EU industrial products in 1992  involved wage costs that were almost 14 percent higher than  comparable U.S. and Japanese products.    According to the IW study, regarding EMU requirements, the  undesirable wage policy developments in recent years cannot be  corrected in one year or over several years by means of lower  wage agreements. What is rather necessary is a lasting and  sustained change of attitude among employers and trade unions.  Employees should not primarily define their wage demands on a  distribution policy basis, according to the formula of  "productivity increase plus fully expected price increase plus  redistribution component."    Employers and trade unions should basically start operating  a  productivity-oriented wage policy. Such a policy confines the  wage increase to the rate of increase of labor productivity and  is thus aimed at a certain stability of wage unit costs. Then  no cost-induced price increase will take place. To that extent,  this form of wage policy is also stability-oriented and thus in  line with the EMU.    However, because the economy of the EU is currently in a  situation of structural underemployment, the IW is going a step  farther with its demands. According to the IW, an  employment-oriented wage policy in this situation requires wage  increases to be lower for a certain period of time than the  productivity increase. This will improve the companies' profits.  Since, in that case, capital profitability will increase, the  scope for investment will also increase. Without such a clear  stimulation of investment activities and the stimulation of  growth, no improvement in the labor market can be expected, it  says in the IW study.    As a possible way to reach the goal of a wage policy that  is less marked by distribution struggles, the IW recommends that  employees should not only take part in the national income in  the form of wages, but should also participate in the second  type of the national income -- gross earnings from  entrepreneurial activities and property. Trade unions and  employees would then not have to fear that they could be left  behind in distribution policy terms if they pursue a moderate  wage policy. For companies, such a change of system would also  pay. Labor and capital productivity would increase, as would  the profitability of the capital invested.  <H5>  Profit-Oriented Wage Component </H5>   According to the IW, a standardization of the wage creation  systems in the individual EU member states cannot be expected,  nor would it be appropriate. Nor does the IW see any  economically convincing reasons for a wage policy centralization  within the EU in the sense of supranational collective  negotiations. On the contrary -- EU-wide pay settlements could  not take the very different conditions and developments in the  individual member states adequately into account and would thus  rule out an increased orientation at productivity.    The example of the Federal Republic shows that the  introduction of the currency union does not entail any central,  generally valid collective negotiations. Separate negotiations  have been conducted for the old and new federal laender to make  it possible to take their different capacities into account in  pay settlements.    To solve the European employment problems, the required  moderate wage policy must be accompanied by structural reforms  of the labor market, stresses the IW. In many countries, the  current individual and collective legal regulations tend to  reduce the employment policy effectiveness of collective  bargaining policies.</p>

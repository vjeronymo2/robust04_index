The  attack is said to have left several victims, and the Guinean  Army was dispatched to the spot. From Conakry Ben Daouda Sylla  has more details:    [Begin Sylla recording] The incident on 5-6 January in the  town of Macenta, situated 820 km to the south, seems to be a  reprisal against the (Konyianke) ethnic group, which makes up  the majority of the ULIMO fighters. A week ago, ULIMO  mistakenly attacked and decimated a group of Tooma tribesmen  from Macenta, who had gathered for an initiation ceremony in a  sacred forest near a border village. Some eyewitnesses say that  this village was Niaguerazou, in the northwest of the  prefecture. Persons contacted by telephone Thursday night gave  contradictory figures concerning the dead ranging from two to a  dozen. The incident reportedly occurred in the center of the  town, with some houses being burnt down -- including that of the  mayor of Macenta.    Reinforcements sent from Conakry, Dikedoue, and Nzerekore  reportedly have brought the situation under control, and persons  from the border areas of Zimi, Taourou, and [words indistinct]  have been tracked down.

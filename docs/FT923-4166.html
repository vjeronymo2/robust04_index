			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / BT survey highlights 'wasted' travel time PROFESSIONAL and managerial workers spend more than three years of their working lives travelling - time estimated by British Telecommunications to be worth more than Pounds 7.5bn a year. According to a BT survey of 300 people, these executives admit to spending their travel time dozing, daydreaming or reading the sports page. Fewer than two in five said they worked while travelling. Yet those who did said they found the time productive. BT's survey of 300 businesspeople showed that productive travellers caught up on reading memos, reports and other company literature. It also showed that two out of three executives travelled on business at least twice a week while more than a third did so virtually every day. Only a third expected their business travel to increase. Most executives believed it was important to keep in touch with office and home while they were away on business, although most could not themselves be contacted while they were on the move. Most travellers preferred to make contact with other people rather than to be available for contact. Younger business travellers were most likely to object to being contacted. Dr Guy Fielding, a psychologist asked by BT to look at the findings, said many people could not see how they could do more on busy trains and crowded planes. He said anybody could learn to be a productive traveller if they put in some planning and were willing to be flexible.</p>

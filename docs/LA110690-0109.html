			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RIGHT COURSE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's support of uninterrupted play on  the three Sepulveda golf courses is applauded by members of the Sepulveda Men's  Golf Club.  </P> <P> Our 800-member club has for a long time urged the use of Tillman reclaimed  water to irrigate these courses in an effort to alleviate a four-year drought.  Tearing up the courses to lay water mains to carry Tillman water can be  self-defeating. Reduced fees for shortened courses could cost the city about as  much as routing those pipes around them.  </P> <P> Keep up the good fight.  </P> <P> SAM BENSUSSEN, Sherman Oaks. Bensussen is secretary of the Sepulveda Men's Golf  Club.  </P></p>

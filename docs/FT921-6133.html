			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum sales cut forecast RUSSIAN PLATINUM sales to the west are likely to fall by more than 40 per cent this year, from about 950,000 troy ounces in 1991 to about 650,000 ounces, suggests Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at the Williams de Broe financial services group. She points out in a special report on the platinum market that the level of Russian sales constitutes 'one of the most interesting and most sensitive areas of the whole picture this year'. Sales from the former Soviet Union - 90 per cent from the Norilsk smelters in Russia - last year are thought to have been between 900,000 and 1m ounces. This is separate from the estimated 700,000 ounces that found their way to Switzerland either on swap (where metal is sold with a promise to buy it back at an agreed future date and price) or on lease. Ms O'Connell suggests it is reasonable to assume that the swaps have been unwound and the metal returned to Russia. In that case, Russia will be able to supply relatively high contracted sales to Japan this year (about 500,000 ounces) and also sell spot metal 'more or less at will'. However, it is also reasonable to assume that Norilsk's platinum production will fall by at least 10 per cent in 1992. Consequently, 'it seems feasible that the Commonwealth of Independent States will be able to supply platinum into the west at a higher rate than the historical average, drawing if necessary on stocks taken back from the unwinding of swaps. However, it is questionable whether these higher swap levels can be continued into 1993. In her 'most likely case,' Ms O'Connell sees platinum mine production up from 3.292m ounces last year to 3.529m in 1992 while total supply is expected to fall slightly, because of lower Russian sales, from 4.467m to 4.449m ounces. Offtake is forecast to rise from 3.872m to 4.029m ounces, which, after changes in terminal market stocks, should leave 420,000 ounces (565,000 ounces) for investment. Ms O'Connell expects platinum's price in 1992 to range between Dollars 330 and Dollars 400 an ounce, with an average of Dollars 365.</p>

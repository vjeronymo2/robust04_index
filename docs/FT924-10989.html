			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: A tale of two states - Victoria Griffith describes how the environmental paths taken by Vermont and New Hampshire in the 1980s have affected the business climate there today This autumn, thousands of tourists from around the world will flock to see the changing leaves in the New England states of Vermont and New Hampshire. In Vermont they will be treated to bucolic scenes of cows grazing on mountainside pastures, small country towns and forest preserves. In New Hampshire they will see similar scenes, but they may have to drive through miles of land dotted with office developments and condominiums to get there. Twenty years ago, the New England states of Vermont and New Hampshire were so much alike that they were often referred to as 'twin states'. The twins were heavily agricultural, preserving a rural way of life despite their proximity to Boston. During the 1980s, though, these states followed such different environmental paths that they could be case studies for measuring the impact of environmental changes on business. New Hampshire thrived, thumbing its nose at its poorer neighbours. The state's low tax levels and non-interventionist policies served as a magnet for scores of high-technology businesses. With an unemployment rate well below the national average, it was the economic envy of the country. As the US moved into recession, though, it became clear that New Hampshire would have to pay a price for indiscriminate development. The computer industry ran into crisis and many companies closed their doors. Bank failure plagued the state, as speculative loans to cover the expansion of the computer industry and new housing developments were never paid back. Unemployment soared and thousands of jobs flowed out of the state. The scars of development proved more difficult to erase than the jobs, though. New condominium and industrial projects had eradicated many of the state's farmlands - the very scenery tourists came to New Hampshire to see. The economic picture in Vermont, while not exactly up-beat, is better than that of its eastern neighbour. At 6.5 per cent in August, unemployment is far lower than the national average. The state did not experience the heavy outflow of jobs that plagued the rest of the northeast, and it was the only New England state to escape a major banking crisis. Vermont residents attribute much of this economic success to the state's heavy-handed environmental policies. Vermont has some of the strictest environmental controls in the world, regulating not only air and water contamination, but visual pollution as well. Billboards, or even large signs outside stores, are strictly forbidden. Recognising the strong connection between the presence of agriculture and tourist levels, the state has instituted a complex system for the protection of farmlands. Milk prices are supported within the state to aid dairy farmers. And the state offers property tax subsidies to farm and timberland owners through what has been dubbed the 'current use' law, which has helped preserve forests and open space. Perhaps most important, Vermont's Regulation 250 allows the government to veto any large development scheme that may have a negative impact on traffic levels, pollution levels or quality of life. Although many believe the protective zeal is sometimes exaggerated, most Vermont businessmen support the state's environmental laws. 'The banking community in this state feels that (Regulation) 250 provided a moderating influence on excessive growth in the 1980s and was a major factor in preventing bank failures in Vermont,' said John Ewing, president of the Bank of Vermont. 'Without environmental controls, we might have had the same sort of banking crisis that hit the other New England states.' Many people in the business community feel that concern for the environment has also helped create a marketing image that has served the state well. 'Vermont still has an aura that helps us sell products,' said William Davis, president of Cabot Creamery, a cheese and dairy product manufacturer. 'Food products, especially, are enhanced by the Vermont image because people believe the ingredients will be free from contamination and made in an old-fashioned way,' said Maxine Brandenburg, head of the Vermont Business Roundtable, a government and business coalition which offers advice on environmental policies. Even companies which cannot benefit directly from Vermont's marketing image may be attracted to the state for its strong environmental reputation. A recent study by the Vermont Business Roundtable found that quality of life was cited most frequently by the business community as the main reason for locating their company in Vermont. 'Environmental regulations translate into quality of life, and that's one of the main reasons we moved here,' said Robert McKinney, vice president of KBA, a printing machine distributor. KBA just relocated to Vermont from Long Island, taking more than half its employees with it. 'We were surprised at how many of our employees decided to make the move. I guess we're all after a good quality of life,' says McKinney. Most important to its economic well-being, perhaps, has been Vermont's success in the tourism business. Vermont pulled in nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in tourist dollars in 1990, making tourism the second biggest money-earner in the state. According to US Travel Data, a non-profit research group based in Washington DC, Vermont now attracts nearly 50 per cent more in per capita tourist revenues than New Hampshire. That is despite the fact that New Hampshire has a coast line, higher mountains, and is closer to Boston. The Vermont/New Hampshire comparison is not a clear-cut study. New Hampshire is not an environmental pariah. For one thing, it boasts one of the best wetlands protection schemes in the country. And some Vermont residents feel the environmental zeal in the state at times takes things too far. Still, experiences in these states show that environmental decisions - not just clean air and water, but more subtle environmental controls on visual pollution - can have a profound impact on business. In the wake of the crisis, some members of the business community in New Hampshire admit that lack of attention to the environment may have exacerbated the state's problems. 'We have to be careful, because if we destroy our environmental beauty we can't get it back,' said Jerry Little, president of the New Hampshire Bankers Association. 'The environment is one of this state's biggest assets, and if we lose it, we will lose one of the main reasons businesses like to operate from here,' he says.</p>

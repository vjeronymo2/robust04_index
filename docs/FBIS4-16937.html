			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- CIS countries owe to Russia  altogether hundreds of billions of roubles for telephone and  postal services, Vladimir Bulgak, Russian minister of  communications, told ITAR-TASS. Meanwhile, Russia has fully  repaid these republics for similar services.    The reason for one-way traffic in the settlement of accounts  is that banks fail to settle the problem of so-called non-trade  operations. Roubles freely flow to CIS states toward the  payment for communications services, while the national  currencies of CIS countries do not cross the Russian border  without being exchanged for roubles at the appropriate rate.    In December last, communications ministers of CIS countries  met in Minsk and issued a joint statement urging heads of CIS  countries to influence their central banks to speed up mutual  settlement, Bulgak said. Certain progress is in the offing, but  the problem has not been solved in a cardinal way and the  banking mechanism has not been adjusted. Money from Uzbekistan,  Ukraine and other countries, even if they have it, cannot reach  Russia.    "I talked on the matter with Chairman of the Russian Central  Bank Viktor Gerashchenko four times. There is voluminous  correspondence with the bank on the matter", Bulgak said. "We  tried to cope with the situation by mutual settlement, clearing,  barter and other settlement, but all this does not amount to a  civilised way of dealing with the problem", Bulgak said.</p>

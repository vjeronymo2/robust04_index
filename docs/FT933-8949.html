			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Seoul still cautious towards foreign issuers - The slow pace of bond market liberalisation in South Korea IF South Korea ever allows foreigners to issue bonds in the domestic market, foreign brokers there suggest they should be called 'Turtle Bonds'. The turtle is a symbol of stability to Koreans, but the name was suggested for a very different reason. 'It represents the slow pace in opening up the bond market to outsiders,' explains one broker. The South Korean bond market is the second-biggest in Asia, with a total market capitalisation of Won95,100bn (Dollars 118bn), exceeding the size of the country's stock market. It could offer great potential to foreign investors since domestic interest rates are high, with guaranteed three-year corporate bonds offering a 13.4 per cent yield, but the government is committed to gradual liberalisation and refuses unlimited foreign access to the bond market, according to its recent five-year (1993 - 1997) financial reform plan. Activity in the bond market is brisk since Korean companies face restrictions in raising capital abroad. New corporate bond issues this year may exceed the 1991 peak of Won12,741bn. Bond issues during the first half of 1993 reached Won8,140bn, a 77 per cent increase from a year ago. The 10 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, account for 34 per cent of this year's issues. But foreigners wanting to acquire chaebol bonds will only be able to do so indirectly, by buying bond-type beneficiary certificates beginning in 1995. Instead, the government wants them to purchase bonds issued by small and medium businesses as part of its strategy to promote the restructuring of industry, now dominated by the chaebol. Foreigners will be allowed to buy convertible bonds issued by small and medium companies next year, although they may face restrictions on the amount purchased. In 1997, unguaranteed, long-term bonds issued by small companies will be open to direct foreign investment. From next year, foreigners will also be allowed to purchase some government and public bonds in the primary market. But these bonds will pay less interest than prevailing rates in the domestic market since they will be pegged to lower international rates. Government bonds account for 15.7 per cent of the market, with the state planning to issue Won11,000bn this year, against Won8,548bn in 1992. Corporate bonds represent 32.7 per cent, financial bonds 28 per cent, and monetary stabilisation bonds, used to soak up excess liquidity in the money markets, 15.6 per cent. International organisations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, will be the first foreign entities allowed to float Won-dominated bonds on the domestic market, beginning in 1995. The government claims the reforms represent progress in liberalising the market but foreign brokers are more sceptical, noting several problems. Government bonds with lower international yields may not attract much interest since they will deprive foreigners of the returns promised by higher domestic rates. The lack of credit analysis of small and medium companies may also discourage foreign investors, particularly in unguaranteed long-term bonds. That problem, however, may be partly resolved through bond portfolio funds, which could spread risk. The rationale for government caution is that a rapid opening of the market could lead to higher inflation and a rise in the value of the Won. 'The complete opening of the bond market to foreign investors will only occur when the government is willing to accept full liberalisation of foreign exchange controls,' said Mr Edward Kim of Korea Development Securities. Government anxiety about the effects of foreign capital inflows into South Korea have side-tracked promised attempts to deregulate the state-controlled financial system. However, there is optimism that the changes will be introduced on schedule this time because the government is implementing measures to prepare the bond market for foreign investors. It is seeking to improve the market's infrastructure by encouraging secondary trading on the Korea stock exchange rather than on the over-the-counter market, which accounted for 98.8 per cent of the Won915,771bn in bond trading volume in 1992. An initial step will be a prohibition on the trading of convertible bonds outside the KSE. In addition, the Korea Securities Dealers Association has recently established a computerised system to provide traders with information on bond prices and yields.</p>

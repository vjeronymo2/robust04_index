"Although the decree was signed almost a month ago, it has  not been implemented", Aushev stressed.    He also drew attention to the fact that his administration  had repeatedly voiced readiness to sit down at the negotiating  table with North Ossetian leaders to work out mutually  acceptable mechanisms of fulfilling the presidential decree to  guarantee the full safety of the two republics citizens.  "Regrettably, our appeals to the North Ossetian leadership have  evoked a negative response", Aushev said.    All of this, in his words, has been least conducive for  stability and has been discrediting the federal authorities and  the newly adopted constitution. "I believe that responsibility  for possible consequences rests with those who obstructs the  presidential decree", the statement says.    In cables to Russia's Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik  and  to the Central Electoral Commission's Chairman Nikolay Ryabov,  Aushev stressed that more than 60,000 deported Ingushes -  citizens of North Ossetia - cannot return to their homes and  are deprived of the constitutional right to take part in  presidential elections scheduled for January 16 in North  Ossetia. "If voting takes place without them, election results  cannot be recognized as valid", the messages say. A request is  made to send legal experts to North Ossetia to monitor the  election campaign and the course of presidential elections in  line with Russia's constitution.</p>

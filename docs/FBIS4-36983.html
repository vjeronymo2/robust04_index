			<p>BFN     [Text] The Iranian-German joint economic commission will  meet in Germany next fall. This was stated yesterday by Foreign  Minister Velayati who is in Germany. Velayati also described  his two-day talks with the German chancellor and other  high-ranking German officials as useful and constructive.  Velayati, who was speaking during an interview with the Central  News Unit correspondent in Bonn last night, referred to the  noteworthy developments in Tehran-Bonn relations during recent  years and said: These relations can be used as a good example  for other European countries concerning bilateral relations with  the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Velayati said that main points of his discussions with  German  officials during this visit included the formation of a joint  economic commission next fall, the continuation of cooperation  in international forums, Germany's more active participation in  Iran's Second [Five-Year] Economic Plan, the formation of the  two countries' cultural assembly, and parliamentary cooperation  between Tehran and Bonn.    The foreign minister said that the regular contacts between  the Iranian and German heads of state over the past two years  have constituted an important element in advancing the two  countries' relations.    Commenting on the impact of Iranian-German relations on  global and regional developments, Velayati said: [Begin  Velayati recording via telephone] Iranian-German cooperation has  gone beyond bilateral relations and has assumed regional and  international dimensions. As the current head of the ECO  [Economic Cooperation Organization], and as current head of  united Europe, Germany will hold talks in the future on  cooperation between these two regional bodies. Europe, with its  greater experience and vast dimensions of cooperation, and Iran  -- especially after the expansion of ECO, which is a young  organization -- can use Europe's experiences, and cooperation  between the two organizations will be extremely positive and  constructive.    We have agreed to hold a joint session next fall in New York  with the troika on the foreign ministerial level. The troika is  actually the presidency of the European Union and consists of  former, current, and future foreign ministers of countries  acting as EU presidents. They participate in meetings with  other countries and actually mold the European Community's  foreign relations. [end recording]</p>

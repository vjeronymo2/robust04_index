			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Delors in Danish plea for EC unity MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called for closer economic co-operation among EC member states, warning that recent turbulence in the European monetary system risked a relapse into the competitive devaluations of the late 1970s. Without closer co-operation, the EC's plans for economic and monetary union by the end of the decade were in jeopardy, Mr Delors said after talks in Copenhagen between the Commission and the newly installed Danish presidency of the EC. He called for frank exchanges between EC economic and finance ministers - suggesting that the current status quo was unsatisfactory. Mr Delors - occasionally viewed as a bit of a Napoleon figure in Denmark - was positively restrained yesterday. Asked whether he intended to help persuade Danish voters to approve the Maastricht treaty in a second referendum in the late spring, Mr Delors replied with a smile: 'The less interference the better.' Instead he launched an appeal for the growth package agreed at Edinburgh last month, calling it a crucial test of co-operation among member states. This week the Commission agreed plans to create a new European Investment Fund and to expand the borrowing powers of the European Investment Bank to fund road, telecommunications and other infrastructure projects. EC officials are also looking to member states to maximise the impact of the growth initiative through closer co-ordination, particularly on shifting from current to capital spending. Mr Delors set a target date of mid-February for agreement. Mr Poul Schluter, Danish prime minister, identified the main priorities in his country's six-month presidency as the start of enlargement talks with Sweden, Austria, Finland, and hopefully Norway next month; the introduction of more transparency in EC affairs; and more subsidiarity - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level. The Danes also plan to hold a special conference, in Copenhagen on April 13 and 14, with central and eastern European countries, including Poland, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Albania, Romania and Bulgaria, and the Baltic republics. The aim is to strengthen economic and political ties with these new democracies. Danish officials had earlier said the conference would be attended by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, but this was a clerical error.</p>

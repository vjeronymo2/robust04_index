			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE CALL FOR ATTACKS ON WESTERNERS  </P> <P> Prominent Palestinians on Saturday condemned a senior Iranian official's call  for the killing of five Westerners for every Palestinian slain in the uprising  in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Britain and France, meanwhile, joined the United States in condemning Iranian  Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani's call on Friday to kill American,  British and French citizens, hijack planes and blow up factories in retaliation  for the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli army.  </P> <P> "I have no idea why the Iranians would suddenly make statements about the  Palestinians," said Sari Nusseibeh, a prominent Palestinian philosophy  professor in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. "I believe they should really look  into their own business and allow us to look after ourselves."  </P> <P> Nusseibeh disassociated the Palestinian cause from Rafsanjani's statements.  "They reflect a total alienation from the entire Palestinian situation, not  only the Palestinian situation but also the political reality of the world."  </P> <P> In London, Palestine Liberation Organization official Faisal Aweidah said  Westerners aren't to blame for Israeli actions.  </P> <P> "Every man has the right to say what he wants, but we do not approve of that  policy, and we do not think it is conducive to the peace process that is going  on around the world despite what Israel is doing."  </P> <P> In Amman, Jordan, local PLO representative Abderrazak Yahia, who is a member of  the organization's Executive Committee, said: "The Palestinian revolution  embodied in the intifada is not based on terrorism but on a nonviolent  strategy. . . . Rafsanjani's statement is a clear expression of a sick,  terrorist mind."  </P></p>

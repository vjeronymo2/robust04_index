			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALL FANS ON DECK FOR TRIBUTE TO CITY'S NAMESAKE;  </P> <P> STAGE: A LANDLUBBER ACTOR TRODS THE BOARDS OF A BRIG TO BRING 'TWO YEARS BEFORE  THE MAST' ALIVE IN DANA POINT.  </P> <P> When actor Daniel Trent set out to adapt Richard Henry Dana's "Two Years Before  the Mast" for the stage, he thought that crewing a yacht up the Northern  California coast would give him a feel for Dana's life at sea.  </P> <P> But when the ship left San Francisco Bay, it hit "20-foot waves every six  seconds for the next four days." And the actor-writer became a confirmed  landlubber.  </P> <P> Lack of sea legs has not stopped Trent from taking California audiences on a  dramatized sailing adventure with his one-man show of Dana's classic.  </P> <P> "Two Years Before the Mast," which premiered in 1981 on Pilgrim -- the ship  moored in Dana Point Harbor that is a replica of the original brig on which  Dana worked -- opened again on the ship Saturday and will continue with two  performances each Friday and Saturday night through July. The show is a  presentation of the Orange County Marine Institute, also at Dana Point Harbor.  </P> <P> Ocean breezes set the mood, and the Pilgrim's deck becomes a stage as audiences  sit below the ship's 96-foot mainmast to hear Trent spin his tale.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you get lucky and the fog rolls in and you get to transport the  whole audience," Trent said. "Then it becomes magic."  </P> <P> Trent re-creates seven characters from Dana's true-life story, excerpting  directly from the book to recount the young sailor's two years in the service  of a tyrannical captain.  </P> <P> The story introduces Dana at 42 as he reminisces about his two-year journey  aboard a trading ship. Then the script travels back to 1834, when the  18-year-old Dana began his adventure from Boston Harbor around Cape Horn and up  the unsettled California coast, where Pilgrim traded fireworks and saddles for  animal hides.  </P> <P> The crew encountered pirate attacks and dangerous waters as well as the cruel  hand of their merciless captain. The young Dana, one of Boston's sheltered  elite, came of age during the trip that introduced him to injustice and death,  as well as the unfamiliar Spanish-Catholic culture of California.  </P> <P> Dana's account of the trip was first published in 1840 and is now in its 91st  edition. His frank depiction of the hardships faced by sailors helped to reform  maritime law, Trent said. And because the book provided rare information about  life on the California coast, the book became a bible for Gold Rush hopefuls.  </P> <P> During nine years performing the show for historical societies, student groups  and community organizations, Trent has approximated Dana's path up the  California coast with his portrayal.  </P> <P> But the play seems to belong most in the city that Dana called "the only  romantic spot in California." The town returned this compliment by officially  adopting Dana's name in 1884; a statue of the author now welcomes visitors to  Harbor Island, near Pilgrim's mooring at Dana Cove Park and overlooking the  harbor entrance.  </P> <P> Trent, who adapted the "Two Years Before the Mast" with partner Victor  Pinheiro, said he never tires of retelling Dana's tale of adventure.  </P> <P> "I think I will do Dana as long as someone wants me to do it," he said. "I just  love the show. It's a beautiful piece, and I'm real proud that I had a hand in  creating it. Heck, I'm the best one who's ever done the show -- I'm the only  one who's ever done it!"  </P> <P> And after nine years of re-creating Dana's history, Trent said: "I think I know  his inner life pretty well. I think he was a wonderful, noble being. But I feel  sad for him sometimes."  </P> <P> Dana returned to Boston and his father, also named Richard Henry Dana, and  became a lawyer, leaving behind his life of risk and romance. Trent believes  that Dana turned his back on his true destiny:  </P> <P> "At the end of the show Dana says, 'My thoughts wander back to my old sea life.  . . . I believe I was made for the sea and all my life on shore was a mistake.'  "  </P> <P>  "Two Years Before the Mast" continues Fridays and Saturdays at 6:30 and 9 p.m.  through July 28 on the Pilgrim at Dana Point Harbor, 24200 Dana Point Harbor  Drive, Dana Point. Tickets: $26. Information: (714) 496-2274.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rowan Dore, PRESS ASSOCIATION political staff] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten today urged China to get back to the  negotiating table and reach a solution on the future of the  colony.    After a 45 minute meeting at Downing Street of the Cabinet  subcommittee, which oversees Hong Kong, chaired by Prime  Minister John Major, both Mr Hurd and Mr Patten warned the  Chinese that time was running out.    Mr Hurd said "no decisions" had been taken on the "timing or  content" of the second part of the legislation -- which mostly  concerns the format for future elections in the run-up to the  hand over of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997.    "That legislation needs to be in place by July this year in  order that the preparations for the elections in 1994 and 1995  can be made in an orderly way. We are entirely ready to resume  discussions with the Chinese on the points which remain in  disagreement. Obviously there is limit to the time that can be  spent in discussion before legislation has to be tabled on the  second part."    Mr Patten said: "We would very much like to see a resumption  of talks. We are still prepared to negotiate and I very much  hope the Chinese are as well." He was speaking after China  attacked the Governor again at the weekend over the way he has  conducted negotiations, which have currently reached a stalemate.    Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, said: "The  series of performances by Patten recently show that he has a  `doomsday mentality.'"    Mr Patten was flying back to Hong Kong tonight to try to  bring the Chinese back to the negotiating table.    The first part of the legislation, which is largely  uncontroversial, is currently going through Hong Kong's ruling  legislative council. Mr Patten has revealed he was obliged to  go ahead on the first part without China's help.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TRUMP UNFAZED BY CASINO FLAP  </P> <P> Donald Trump may be having a cash crisis, but the high-profile developer has  nothing but bravura when it comes to talking about his finances.  </P> <P> Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., is facing a proposed  reorganization since he missed a $47.3-million interest payment on $675-million  worth of high-yield junk bonds used to finance the gaming house.  </P> <P> The bondholders had threatened to push Trump into bankruptcy proceedings and  seize control of the casino before a compromise was arranged.  </P> <P> Yet, none of this seems to trouble Trump.  </P> <P> "Mark my words," he said in an interview published in Thursday's Wall Street  Journal. "In 12 months," he said, "I will be worth more than I was two years  ago."  </P></p>

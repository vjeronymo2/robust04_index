			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Social Democratic Party leader </F> Aleksandr Rutskoy by Giulietto Chiesa in Moscow; date not given:  "The Return of Yeltsin's Rival"]    [Text] His party's 140 delegates listen as he makes his  proclamation: "Early presidential elections, there is no  alternative." Aleksandr Rutskoy will be running, of course.  His party, which was unable to fight in the December election,  has met for its second conference. Until yesterday, it was  called the "Free Russia People's Party," while, as of today,  they have added the adjective: "social democratic." The  election campaign has begun for the former Lefortovo detainee.  He sees me in a private reception room in an imposing building  on the Leninskiy Prospekt and asks me not to publish its  address. The conference is not clandestine, but the owners of  the building are shy of publicity.    [Chiesa] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, when you call for  presidential elections, do you have any particular date in mind?    [Rutskoy] It is not up to me. The president, the Duma, and  the Federal Council have to decide. I hope they will be  reasonable, otherwise we may plunge headfirst into another  tragedy. People's patience has its limits. In the days of  serfdom, there were no wages, but at least people had something  to eat. Now, millions of people in Russia have no wages and  nothing to eat. What sort of national concord is that! No form  of concord is possible in these conditions. Anyway, look how  the president's followers, the people from "Russia's Choice,"  are behaving toward Zhirinovskiy. They have signed the pact,  and he has signed it too, but they still go on calling him a  fascist. Do they want concord? I hardly think so. They have  even labeled me a communo-fascist as well. Tomorrow it will be  somebody else's turn. They have a saying in the East: "If the  prophet stumbles, the whole populace stumbles, too." As long as  Yeltsin is the prophet, they will go on stumbling. And in the  end we shall fall down and crack our skulls. This is why the  election must be brought forward.    [Chiesa] Do you think that the opposition parties can  submerge their differences and select you as their sole  candidate?    [Rutskoy] The opposition must unite if it wants to win. Time  is against those in power. I have asked my party to work on  promoting unity among the opposition, but we must keep at it.  Unless we unite, we shall remain patriotic leaders of the  parlor. Striking deals with those in government is not a viable  option, because there can be no consensus between the murderer  and the murdered.    [Chiesa] You will be aware that you are regarded with  considerable distrust in the West. How do you intend to  convince them that you pose no threat to democracy?    [Rutskoy] The democrats have slung mud at me, presenting me  as an antireformist. I have collected all my major speeches in  a book. They should read them in the West, and they will realize  that they have been misled by the propaganda put out by the  Russian democrats. I am a social democrat by deeply held  conviction, I stand for a just society where all are equal  before the law and all have the opportunity to improve their  status. My creed is reform and patriotism, and I think that  international relations must be based on mutual trust.    [Chiesa] But not all the patriotic forces in Russia are  democratic and reformist, as you know full well, and one of the  gravest suspicions regarding you derives from the fact that,  during those tragic days in October, you did not throw  Barkashov's fascists, who were giving the stiff-arm salute and  wearing swastikas on their arms, out of the White House.    [Rutskoy] And I ask you: Who has the moral right to call his  own compatriots fascists? Public opinion abroad is being  misinformed by having the black rag of the fascists in Russia  waved in its face. The primary task of true Russian reformers  now is to consolidate a large front with room for all shades of  reform, ranging from the evolutionary to the revolutionary.  Only then, when consolidation has been achieved, when the worst  rents have been patched up, will we decide what to do about the  unacceptable ideologies.    [Chiesa] What do you think of Chernomyrdin? And if you were  to win, who would be your prime minister?    [Rutskoy] Chernomyrdin is a nothing, a nonentity. He would  do better to see to the economy in a country that has seen a  42-percent drop in national income in the three years of  "reforms" in which he has been in operation. As a comparison,  just think that national income in the USSR, which had been  destroyed by the war against the Nazis, fell by only 17 percent.  These reformers have done Russia three times as much harm as  the Nazis. There are as many excellent prime ministers in  Russia as anyone could want. An example? Sergey Glazyev, who  left the Chernomyrdin government as a protest against the  October coup.    [Chiesa] Would you change the current Constitution or go  back  to the old one?    [Rutskoy] There is no question of going back. I would like  the Constitution to contain clear rights and clear duties for  all the citizens, the president included. This one merely  grants the president powers and absolute liberty with no  oversight and no institutional accountability.    [Chiesa] Would you prefer a parliamentary republic?    [Rutskoy] I am not saying that. What I have in mind is a  system of powers balanced by reciprocal restraints, as in the  whole of the civilized world. The parliament has no power here.  The government is formally accountable solely to the president,  although it does as it pleases. The president is answerable to  no one: He decides whatever he likes, even though no one obeys  his decisions. Do you think this is workable?    [Chiesa] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy? Do you regard  him as an opponent? Could he become an ally of yours?    [Rutskoy] His conduct is clearly unworthy of a true leader,  but no one can rule out the possibility of his winning. Indeed,  no one expected such a success in the December election. But I  believe the fact that he has signed the concord with the  cannoneers who have the parliament under fire, with the authors  of the present chaos, has irrevocably sealed his fate. People  have not forgiven Yeltsin for the dead, and they will not  forgive Zhirinovskiy for flirting with Yeltsin.    [Chiesa] And what about Zyuganov's communists? Could they  become allies of yours?    [Rutskoy] I think so, even though the communists behaved  very  ambiguously, both in the first coup, in August 1991, and in the  one that took place in October 1993. But the fault lies with  the leaders, not with the voters.    [Chiesa] In October, you were relying on the Army, but it  did  not come to your aid. What is the mood currently prevailing  among the Armed Forces?    [Rutskoy] I was not relying on the Army, but on the people.  I was not the one who wanted a confrontation. It was not the  Army that was responsible for the massacre. It was corrupt  generals, well-fed and arrogant, who dug in with the minister at  the Ministry of Defense. The crack divisions that opened fire  are by no means the whole Army, most of which is ill-treated,  poor, and lacking in social guarantees. The election confirmed  this, with 60 percent of the military vote going to  Zhirinovskiy. Had I not been in prison, I would have obtained  just as much.    [Chiesa] What do you think of Gorbachev?    [Rutskoy] As a politician, he is finished. Any attempt at a  comeback as the leader of Russia is bound to fail. No one will  believe him again. He was president of a great power, but he  lost it.    [Chiesa] What would you say to Bill Clinton if you met him?    [Rutskoy] That current relations between our two countries  are neither sincere nor honest. People think that the United  States set out to weaken the USSR and Russia so that we would  collapse, and to bring us to the disaster in which we now find  ourselves. The United States made a mistake in its dealings  with us, and the Western leaders who are continuing along the  same lines are making the same mistake. Every chemical reaction  has its effects. The United States lays claim to a hegemonic  role in the world, but the effects of this claim will have  repercussions on Europe, too. As far as Russia is concerned, I  do not doubt that she will be capable of getting back on her  feet and that, sooner or later, the peoples that made up the  USSR will join forces once more to form a new entity.    [Chiesa] Will you meet Solzhenitsyn when he returns to  Russia?    [Rutskoy] I have read his books, even when they were banned.  His return is only right and natural. I think it will exert an  influence on our society and politics. I concur with much,  though not all, of what he says in his famous essay, "How To  Organize Russia." He was a long way away, and I am here and see  things better. I hope that he will support the patriotic  movement, which is fighting to turn Russia back into a great,  respected nation.    [Chiesa] Do you not think that the fact that you have  accepted the amnesty is tantamount to acknowledging your guilt?    [Rutskoy] No. They were the ones who decided on the amnesty  in exchange for the suppression of the inquiry into the October  events. I broke neither the law nor the Constitution in force at  the time. I did not ask for an amnesty, and I demand full  rehabilitation. God exists, and He knows I did all I could to  avoid people being killed. The only weight on my conscience is a  moral one, because I failed to avoid it.    [Chiesa] What future do you see for Yeltsin?    [Rutskoy] I wish him no ill. The most sensible thing for him  to do would be to resign and spend more time with his  grandchildren.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Confidence firm, says IoD BUSINESS confidence is hold-ing up firmly, with the economy still showing tentative signs of recovery, according to the Institute of Directors. The institute's latest bi-monthly survey of business opinion, conducted among 325 senior company executives, shows the highest level of sustained optimism about the business outlook for nearly four years. Half of those questioned said they were more optimistic about prospects in the months ahead. The service sector is the most confident, although optimism among manufacturing and distribution companies has continued to fall. The survey also shows profits and sales at their highest level since June 1990. For the first time in two years a substantially larger number of directors report higher, rather than lower, profits. Employment was the biggest blackspot, with only a quarter of directors saying they expect to take on more staff. Cashflow, as opposed to weak demand, remained the principle concern. Ms Janice Buck, the institute's economic research executive, said: 'Despite difficult trading conditions, this survey shows that company performance and confidence about the economy are holding up well.' Companies in the west Midlands will see a 'steady but extremely slow' recovery later this year, according to the west Midlands regional group of chambers of commerce.</p>

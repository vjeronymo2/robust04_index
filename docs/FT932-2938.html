			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines in spite of good inflation news Wall Street ANOTHER batch of good news on inflation failed to lift stock market sentiment yesterday as blue chip issues fell and other stocks struggled to hold their ground, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.69 down at 3,492.00. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.44 to 446.27, while the Nasdaq composite was up a slight 0.93 at 697.34. New York SE volume was 234m shares. After last week's promising May producer prices report, which suggested that inflationary pressures in the economy were not as strong as originally feared, dealers and investors were hoping that yesterday's May consumer prices data would prove a similar source of comfort. In the event, the numbers were encouraging: the Labor Department announced that the consumer prices index rose by only 0.1 per cent last month, and that the 'core' measure of prices (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) was up by 0.2 per cent. The figures were slightly better than forecast, and probably rule out the likelihood of an interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. The good news, however, did not persuade investors to buy stocks. Concern about the weak state of the economy, the absence of a big upward move in bond prices, and a sharp decline in some leading stocks, meant the Dow performed poorly and other indices languished. IBM fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 in volume of 3m shares after Salomon Brothers warned that there might be further write-offs at the company, which could lead to IBM halving its dividend. Among other Dow constituents to suffer yesterday were Merck, down Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 38, and cyclical stocks International Paper, off Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 63 1/2 , and Aluminium Company of America, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 65 1/2 . Eastman Kodak, which rose sharply on Monday in anticipation of a big announcement from the company, receded Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after it revealed plans to spin off its Eastman Chemical subsidiary. HJ Heinz lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 after announcing a Dollars 192m pre-tax restructuring charge for the fiscal fourth quarter, which depressed after-tax earnings for the quarter to Dollars 69.7m, down from Dollars 145.7m a year ago. Reebok plunged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 in busy trading as investors reacted negatively to the company's warning that its second quarter earnings will come in well below market estimates. Tiffany jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 on the news that it will assume marketing and merchandising for 29 stores currently operated in Japan by Mitsukoshi. Canada TORONTO ended higher after fairly heavy trading, boosted by a sharp rise in gold shares. The TSE 300 index gained 15.6 at 3,887.8 and rises led falls by 387 to 339 after volume of 59.5m shares valued at CDollars 585.2m. Turnover included a block trade of about 5.4m Talisman Energy shares. The golds sector index jumped 4.16 per cent as the New York spot gold price rose USDollars 4.20 an ounce.</p>

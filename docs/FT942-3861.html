			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Vision of winged giants - Plans for 600-seater superjumbos The world's two biggest commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing of the US and the European Airbus consortium, are stepping up studies to develop a generation of superjumbos, capable of seating 600 or more passengers. Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, confirmed this month that the European group would soon start marketing a 600-seat aircraft - the A3XX - to a selected group of international airlines. This new project would challenge Boeing's dominance of the large aircraft market with its 747-400 jumbo, which can already seat 450 to 500. But Boeing is also at an advanced stage of studies to build an even larger jumbo: either a new aircraft or a bigger derivative of the 747. At the same time, Boeing and Airbus are jointly studying the development of an even larger aircraft seating more than 800, in the so-called Very Large Capacity Transport (VLCT) project. Although the airline industry has yet to recover its financial health, the manufacturers believe there will be demand for a large aircraft by the turn of the century. 'By around 2002, airlines will have to consider replacing their existing 747-400 fleets,' says Mr Pierson. More significantly, a big aircraft will also be necessary to cope with air traffic growth and increasing congestion at busy airports. 'Already only 33 airports account for 50 per cent of world air traffic,' explains Mr Claude Terrazzoni, the head of the commercial aircraft division of Aerospatiale, the French aerospace group with a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus. So far only two big airlines have expressed strong interest in acquiring superjumbos. 'We would be willing to go forward with an aircraft of 600 seats offering the same long range but also 20 per cent lower operating costs than the 747-400,' says Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman. A superjumbo would help BA tackle some of the growing runway congestion problems at its London base of Heathrow. But it would also give the UK carrier the opportunity to offer more facilities for both business and economy passengers. BA has already made its own design studies for the configuration of such an aircraft, including the introduction of inflight business offices equipped with faxes, telephones and personal computers, a cinema-style inflight entertainment room, and even a work-out section for fitness addicts. 'We see the use for such an aircraft on Far East routes, Australasia services and across the Atlantic,' Sir Colin explains. Singapore Airlines has also expressed strong interest. Mr J Y Pillay, the Singapore Airline Group chairman, recently said his carrier would initially buy five superjumbos to serve routes to the UK and continental Europe as well as trans-Pacific routes and - if it secured the necessary rights - across the Atlantic from London.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Pentium chip lifts Intel to eighth consecutive record Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, reported record revenue and earnings for the second quarter. It was the eighth consecutive quarter the company has achieved new revenue and earnings records. Rising sales of Pentium chips, Intel's latest generation of microprocessors for use in high performance personal computers, helped drive second-quarter growth, the company said. The chip maker's second-quarter revenue rose 30 per cent to Dollars 2.77bn from Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net income was up 12 per cent at Dollars 640m or Dollars 1.46 per share, compared with Dollars 569m or Dollars 1.30 in last year's second quarter. Earnings were in line with Wall Street projections. 'We had a solid quarter as growing sales of PCs increased demand for Intel microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive. 'We are particularly pleased with the rapid move of Pentium processor-based systems into the PC mainstream, as we continue to drive the most aggressive processor ramp in our history.' During the quarter, PCs using chips produced using Intel's latest process technology began to reach computer users. Microprocessors produced with this technology were rapidly becoming the base for the highest performing, volume-produced computers in each segment of the PC market, the company said. Revenue increased from first-quarter levels in all geographic markets, Intel said, with the Asia Pacific region and Japan showing the strongest growth rates. American revenues accounted for 51 per cent of sales, Europe 27 per cent, the Asia Pacific region 14 per cent, and Japan 8 per cent. For the first half of 1994, revenues were Dollars 5.43bn, up 31 per cent from Dollars 4.15bn in the first half of last year. Net income grew 13 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn or Dollars 2.86 per share from Dollars 1.12bn or Dollars 2.53.</p>

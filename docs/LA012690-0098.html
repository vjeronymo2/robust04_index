			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR L.A. AREA, DRUG AID MAY BE DROP IN BUCKET;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: LITTLE OF EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDS IS LIKELY TO REACH THE OFFICERS IN THE  STREETS. ADDICTS MAY RECEIVE MORE HELP.  </P> <P> For a year now, Los Angeles area officials have been lobbying for more federal  drug-fighting funds and designation as a "high-intensity" drug trafficking  center, using as ammunition everything from a record $100 million in cash  seizures to the astounding discovery of 21 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar  warehouse.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the officials finally got the designation they wanted, but the  reaction was mixed -- their enthusiasm tempered by lack of a specific list of  the help they will get and debate over whether a special $25-million fund to be  shared by five target areas nationwide is merely a "drop in the bucket."  </P> <P> And, hours after President Bush outlined his $10.6-billion anti-drug plan, a  group of police officers at one of Los Angeles' drug "supermarkets" wondered  whether any of it would filter down to them.  </P> <P> "Most of all, we need new radios," said Sgt. Dave Cullen, part of a Los Angeles  police narcotics crew making one of its periodic sweeps through MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> Although few details of the plan were released, it appeared that little if any  of the funds would go directly to local law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Instead, officials said 300 additional agents and support personnel would be  added to Los Angeles offices of federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement  Administration and Customs Service, and 694 positions would be added in the  vast "Border States region," which includes San Diego and Imperial counties in  California.  </P> <P> Officials predicted the creation of more task forces combining DEA agents with  officers from local agencies to tackle problems such as street gang drug  traffickers, clandestine desert landing strips used by smugglers and money  laundering.  </P> <P> In addition, California should get thousands more "treatment slots" for drug  addicts and "a substantial portion" of 75 new federal judgeships called for  under the Bush Administration's overall anti-drug plan, according to Chauncey  Veatch, chairman of the Governor's Policy Council on Drug and Alcohol Abuse.  </P> <P> "Whether $25 million appears to be a drop in the bucket or not, we are  grateful," Veatch said. "The announcement is something we have long awaited . .  . . This will be the area of America where the war is fought. Our opportunity  for more resources down the road will grow."  </P> <P> But Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) called the funding "woefully  inadequate," adding, "I really wish the Administration had done this a year  ago. We've lost a lot of ground while the 'drug czar' (William J. Bennett)  studied what was patently obvious."  </P> <P> Under the federal plan, Los Angeles and the four other target zones -- the  border area, New York, Miami and Houston -- would get increased funding in two  ways: first, through a yet-undetermined split of the $25 million along with up  to $21 million more from the federal asset forfeiture fund; and second, through  increases in the regular federal budget for law enforcement agencies, treatment  programs and the like.  </P> <P> In the second category, the Los Angeles area would receive $169 million in  fiscal 1991, 11% more than the current $151 million.  </P> <P> In citing Los Angeles as one of the target areas, the 142-page National Drug  Control Strategy called it "a major entry and transshipment point for cocaine,  Asian and Mexican heroin and marijuana" and the base of street gangs that sell  drugs around the nation.  </P> <P> The precise boundaries of the target areas are still to be determined, the  report said, "through consultation with local officials," and this area "could  include Los Angeles County and Orange County, and all the municipalities  therein."  </P> <P> "I'm ecstatic," said Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, who had pushed for  inclusion in such a zone and was in Washington to attend a White House briefing  on the President's plan.  </P> <P> Among the proposals mentioned in the report's discussion of the target zone  along the Mexican border was one to improve or redesign the Immigration and  Naturalization Service border checkpoint on the San Diego Freeway south of San  Clemente.  </P> <P> Officials from the Justice Department would be named to coordinate the  distribution of funds in each of the target areas except the border, where a  Treasury Department official would preside.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials have waged a sustained campaigned for more federal aid,  spotlighting the city's growing role as a drug-trafficking center and  complaining of an East Coast bias in allocation of drug-fighting funds. State  Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp belittled federal aid proposals by comparing  them to someone offering help with a garden hose while his neighbor's house is  burning down.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles campaign got a boost in August, when a report by U.S. Atty.  Gen. Dick Thornburgh described an alliance between the Colombian drug cartels  and Los Angeles street gangs.  </P> <P> On Dec. 29, the Department of Justice awarded California $39.7 million in  anti-drug funds, nearly four times the amount granted the previous year, with  64% going to cities and counties.  </P> <P> In MacArthur Park, there was little time to ponder what it all would mean after  a caravan of five police cars descended Thursday afternoon on a popular crack  dealing spot.  </P> <P> "You see this here," said Sgt. Raul Amescua, pulling a wad of bills -- $693 in  all -- from the pants pocket of a 22-year-old suspect.  </P> <P> A crowd of transients, some with shopping carts and garbage bags with their  belongings, watched as two rows of men and women stood with their hands behind  their heads.  </P> <P> Some waited anxiously for the policemen to leave so they could "tweek,"  scrounge the ground for rocks of cocaine dropped during the raid and overlooked  by the officers.  </P> <P> "A lot of these people here are down and out. They're addicted and they need a  place to go," Amescua said. Without major increases in treatment programs, he  predicted, "most of them will live their lives just the way they're living it  now."  </P> <P> But one onlooker, a 27-year-old transient originally from New York, said there  was nothing the government could do to change his addiction to "hitting the  pipe."  </P> <P> "Treatment centers just let your mind sleep," he said. Then you wake up one day  "and you have to have it."  </P> <P> As the officers pulled away, he joined two dozen others in a frenzied search  along the ground.  </P></p>

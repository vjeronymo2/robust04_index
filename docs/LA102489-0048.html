			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAB DRIVER ACCUSED OF SPENDING BANK ERROR  </P> <P> A cab driver from Hawthorne has been charged with taking advantage of an error  at a Bank of America branch to steal $10,000 and treated himself to a car and a  gambling spree in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> One count of grand theft was filed against Hormoz Mahmoudi, 40, in South Bay  Municipal Court. Police say the cab driver, who is free on his own  recognizance, told them that he thought his rich father-in-law in London had  deposited the money to his account at a Bank of America branch in Redondo  Beach.  </P> <P> In fact, police said, an East Coast bank had wired $10,000 to the Bank of  America branch and the money was mistakenly credited to Mahmoudi's account. The  bank discovered its error and mailed a letter to Mahmoudi informing him of the  mistake, but the cab driver told authorities he did not understand the letter.  </P> <P> Mahmoudi said he traveled with an aunt to Las Vegas, where he lost $4,000 at  the gaming tables, sent another $2,000 to his mother, paid $2,000 for a car,  $550 for lodging and $500 for a car stereo.  </P> <P> The cabbie has promised to repay the bank.  </P></p>

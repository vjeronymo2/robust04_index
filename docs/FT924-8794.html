			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Chile breaks out of the boom-bust cycle: Soaring investment is enabling the government to target the country's poverty CHILE is likely to become Latin America's top performing economy this year. The latest central bank forecast sees the economy expanding by at least 8 per cent in 1992, following nine years of uninterrupted growth. After three years of falling inflation, the country appears to have broken the cycle of inflationary booms followed by sharp recessions that has been the region's trademark for many decades. Newspapers have not carried a gloomy economic article in months. Instead, the headlines reflect the giddy feeling of success that permeates the country. Santiago's skyline is a jungle of construction cranes and shimmering new buildings. A recent survey of 900 export companies reported steady or expanding foreign orders. There are so many mining projects in the Atacama desert that engineering firms are recruiting professionals abroad, having emptied the engineering schools at home. Unemployment, at 5 per cent, is at a 20-year low. The strength of the Chilean economy is underpinned by growing and diversifying exports. These will nudge the Dollars 10bn mark this year, representing almost 30 per cent of GDP. Traditional exports, such a copper, fishmeal and fresh fruit still form the bulk of foreign earnings, but they are being joined by an eclectic list of new products and manufactured goods. Non-traditional exports - fresh salmon from southern Chile, wine from the central valley, furniture, biotechnology - are growing at an annual rate of 18 per cent and will earn almost Dollars 2bn in 1992. Chile recently overtook Germany as the third largest wine exporter to the US, behind France and Italy. About 10m cases will be shipped this year, worth Dollars 100m. The government's foreign policy is centred on opening new markets for Chilean exports. President Patricio Aylwin and a retinue of businessmen flew to the Far East this week for trade talks in Malaysia, China and Japan, which is now the biggest buyer of Chilean goods. The country is sprinting to break a whole batch of economic records this year. The central bank's international reserves, at Dollars 8.9bn, are enough to cover Chile's import bill for one year. In August, Chile became the first country in Latin America to regain international standards of creditworthiness with a Standard &amp; Poor's investment grade rating for the country's sovereign debt. Investment is growing at almost twice the rate of the economy. This year, the government is targetting Dollars 3bn on housing, irrigation and the country's congested roads and ports, while the private sector has invested a record Dollars 4.3bn in mining, forestry and other export industries. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, sees this as the biggest vote of confidence from a business community that initially fretted over economic policy in the hands of a centre-left government after Chile's return to democracy in 1990. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this investment boom is that it is being financed almost entirely out of Chile's domestic savings. Both Mr Foxley and Mr Roberto Zahler, the president of Chile's independent central bank, see this as an important departure from the country's historic reliance on foreign capital flows. National savings have climbed to 18 per cent of GDP, from a meagre 8 per cent 10 years ago. So while foreign investment remains important, Mr Zahler believes Chile is strengthening its ability to weather external shocks. Unlike central bankers elsewhere in Latin America, Mr Zahler is in the enviable position of having to manage the headaches of success. His main challenge this year has been to stem the flood of dollars entering the country, and control the steady appreciation of the peso without damaging the competitiveness of Chilean exports. The central bank has relaxed foreign exchange controls to allow the peso to appreciate by about 10 per cent against the dollar this year. Although the main reason for doing this was to stem the build up of foreign exchange reserves, cheaper imports have also helped bring down inflation by almost 6 points this year to an annual 13 per cent. The central bank has has forecast inflation of between 10 and 12 per cent for next year because of the widespread indexation of the economy. Success is also changing the nature of economic debate in Chile. The radical free-marketeers who held sway during Gen Augusto Pinochet's era have lost ground to a new generation of economic thinkers who believe the state has an important role to play in promoting health, education and technological change. Economists at Santiago's Catholic University, once the breeding ground for Gen Pinochet's finance ministers, are now focusing on fighting poverty, which still engulfs 40 per cent of the population. But Mr Foxley still believes it will take perhaps 20 years to raise Chile's per capita income, which is still low at Dollars 2,800, to those of southern Europe. A tax reform pushed through in the first year of President Aylwin's government allowed Mr Foxley to raise an extra Dollars 1bn for social projects, better pensions and higher wages for doctors, schoolteachers and civil servants. He has done this while generating fiscal surpluses in the past 2 1/2 years. He says the government will have saved over 3.2 per cent of GDP in 1992. Eventually, Chileans will feel bold enough to question the cost of their armed forces. They are paying a high price for the country's peaceful transition to democracy: the military consume more than 15 per cent of the government's income. In private, government officials admit that they are paying to keep the army happy and out of politics. The military burden will continue to drain public finances for many years to come, as Gen Pinochet's conscript army is unlikely to rethink its role in Chile's new democracy until the 74-year-old commander-in-chief retires in 1998.</p>

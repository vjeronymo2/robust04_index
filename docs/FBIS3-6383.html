On Wednesday President Bill Clinton advised congress that  the  moratorium would be extended a year until September 1995.    Foreign Minister Don McKinnon welcomed the decision, saying  it meant Clinton regarded worldwide restraint on testing as  important in making progress in nuclear non-proliferation.    "New Zealand agrees," he said in a statement. "I hope other  nuclear weapon states which have suspended testing programmes  will be reassured by the US decision. I think we can take it  that existing moratoria will be maintained.    "China still has to agree to a moratorium.    "It would be fitting for China to show restraint at a time  when the world has justified expectations of an end to the  development of these terrible weapons," McKinnon said.</p>

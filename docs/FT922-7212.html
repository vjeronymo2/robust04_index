			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Ex-Soviet republics to settle Start row THE former Soviet Union's four 'nuclear' republics - Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus - are expected to agree this weekend to jointly honour the long-delayed Start treaty reducing long-range nuclear arsenals, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said they would sign a protocol to be attached to the treaty. Russia had originally argued that, as heir to the Soviet Union's international obligations, it should ratify the treaty with the US on behalf of other republics in the process.</p>

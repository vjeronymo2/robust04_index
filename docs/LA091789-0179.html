			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GERMAN QUESTION: A GOING WEST, A WITHERING EAST AND A FAILING HEAD OF STATE  </P> <P> Images on the evening news are startling. East Germans by the thousands stream  into Austria with only perfunctory checks from amiable Hungarian border guards.  Mostly young, many with children, they speedily cross the neutral country and  are welcomed into West Germany as citizens come home. More wait in Hungary,  preparing to take advantage of Budapest's opening of what was an impenetrable  Iron Curtain. As the East German state hemorrhages, its seemingly leaderless  government impotently fulminates, Moscow half-heartedly protests and observers  wonder if the postwar European order is unraveling. What is going on?  </P> <P> Long the East Bloc's economic showcase, the German Democratic Republic has  joined the list of communist countries in turmoil, including China, the Soviet  Union, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. East German leader Erich Honecker, now  reportedly gravely ill, has proved unable to solve the worst crisis in his  country since the 1961 building of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> For three decades, the Communists have striven to forge an East German identity  and instill patriotism. Parades feature the flag and a martial anthem beginning  with "Risen from ruins and turned to the future." Since the early 1970s, the  country has broken out of its isolation and now maintains diplomatic relations  around the world. Its athletes are at the pinnacle of international sports. In  recent years, the government has stressed its German heritage, modifying its  own ideological spin on history to identify with nationalist sentiments.  </P> <P> Problems, however, have been building. Despite infusions of loans and favorable  trade terms extended by the Federal Republic of Germany, East Germany's economy  is stagnant. While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev extols glasnost and  perestroika, Poland elects a non-Communist government and Hungary embarks on a  multiparty system. Honecker and his rigid colleagues steadfastly reject  political or economic reform -- preferring instead to support the Chinese  government's massacre in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> As early as 10 years ago, citizens' groups began forming, championing a variety  of peace, ecological and human-rights causes. There may be 500 such groups in  East Germany today, most existing under the umbrella of the Evangelical  Lutheran Church. In general, these protesters are a "loyal socialist  opposition" seeking to improve an imperfect socialist system, not to jettison  it. The bulk of the East German people, however, seems to prefer the more  radical solution -- for example, many voters in May's local elections crossed  off the names of unopposed official candidates.  </P> <P> What drives so many East Germans to abandon a homeland that provides a standard  of living superior to that of other communist nations and equal to at least the  poorer members of the European Community? Why leave the security of a  guaranteed job for a competitive society with higher unemployment? For some, it  is the lure of greater material rewards that capitalism bestows on success.  East Berlin goods may outshine those in Bucharest or Warsaw, but they are no  match for those of Bremen or Munich.  </P> <P> Interviews with East German refugees reveal a deeper reason: the impossibility  of fulfilling individual potential amid dreary communist orthodoxy. Ideology  remains pervasive. Party rallies with compulsory attendance punctuate the  calendar. At work and school, commitment to the communist system is noted in  personnel records, and lack of enthusiasm often warrants a negative mark.  Preference for university places is given to good pupils also deemed  ideologically correct. Controls on artistic creativity have been loosened  somewhat, but these gestures have not satisfied the critical public.  </P> <P> Alienated East Germans have an alternative. Poles and Hungarians, with lower  living standards, may travel to the West, but most return because emigration  usually entails a change in nationality -- there is no "West Hungary" or "West  Poland." But there is a West Germany.  </P> <P> Although more than 85% of East Germans receive TV programs from West Germany,  first-hand knowledge was lacking until recently. Two years ago, as part of the  warming between the two Germanys, and perhaps as a steam vent, East Germany  began allowing thousands of working-age citizens to travel to the Federal  Republic -- as long as spouses and children stayed behind. They saw prosperity  of a different magnitude could be combined with democracy and a comprehensive  social safety net. Most returned -- but they spread the word. Meanwhile, the  East German government permitted increased emigration.  </P> <P> Mainstream West German politicians were jolted by elections earlier this year,  when right-wing parties rode sentiment against immigrants -- German and  non-German -- to significant gains. Debate erupted about policy toward East  Germany, with agreement only that nothing should be done to destabilize the  situation further. Several West German politicians urged Honecker to undertake  reforms so East Germans would not seek to leave.  </P> <P> Honecker refused, arguing logically that if East Germany abandoned its  socialist system it lost any reason for a separate existence. This was an  implicit admission of an illegitimacy that does not permit compromise.  </P> <P> So for the second time in 30 years, East Germany has been humiliated before the  entire world, and the Hungarians show no inclination to staunch the flow of  refugees, most of whom are skilled workers East Germany can ill afford to lose.  Can the ossified Communist regime survive?  </P> <P> In the short term -- undoubtedly. East Germany withstood graver challenges in  the 1950s -- an uprising in 1953 and the emigration of one-sixth of its  population. It could temporarily forbid travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary  and absorb the public outrage. An efficient security police can nip serious  opposition in the bud. The presence of several hundred-thousand Soviet troops  offers a further guarantee. Economically, the country is far better off than in  the '50s, even if the gap with West Germany has widened.  </P> <P> Yet the longer term outlook appears dimmer. Honecker's potential successors are  a provincial lot, not likely to enact necessary reforms. Contrasts with West  Germany would hardly be more stark. The Federal Republic is the dominant  economic force in a dynamic European Community now embarked on an ambitious  program of integration. East Germany remains the engine of a disintegrating  Comecon organization. The Federal Republic may have security-related disputes  with some of its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, but the political  underpinnings are solid. The Communist Bloc, on the other hand, is split  between liberalizing reformers and obdurate conservatives. Its principal power,  the Soviet Union, is rent by nationalities conflicts and unable to rouse its  lethargic economy.  </P> <P> All analyses of East and West German relations -- or even European politics --  ultimately return to "The German Question," otherwise known as reunification.  Conventional wisdom has it that no one wants reunification. Perhaps. But East  German refugees are forcing it back on the agenda. Moreover, some foreign  attitudes seem to be changing. Poles harbor deep distrust of Germans, but  Solidarity leaders acknowledge they cannot deny self-determination to Germans  when they have just won it themselves. French diplomats now speak of  reunification with equanimity. U.S. Ambassador to Bonn Vernon A. Walters  recently declared the division of Germany was abnormal and he expected  reunification soon.  </P> <P> Of course the key to the German Question lies with the Soviets. Other than  whispers at diplomatic parties, no evidence of the Soviet Union changing its  veto of reunification exists. Still, deterioration of the Soviet economy and  social fabric might induce the Kremlin to cut its huge obligations in Eastern  Europe -- if appropriate security arrangements could be made. Might a neutral,  drastically disarmed, reunified Germany provide such a security guaranty --  particularly if it pledged to rescue the Soviet economy? Farfetched? You bet.  But last year how many were predicting a non-Communist Polish government? Stay  tuned.  </P></p>

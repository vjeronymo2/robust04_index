			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Osaka to launch contract based on Nikkei 300 index A FUTURES and options contract based on the new Nikkei 300 share index is to be launched in January by the Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan's main futures market. The new index is likely to be less volatile than the existing Nikkei 225 index. It is capitalisation weighted, whereas the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted average. The aim is for Nikkei 300 contracts to eventually replace those on the Nikkei 225. The move by the OSE should help defuse the debate over futures trading in Japan. The financial authorities have long blamed OSE futures and options trading, based on a volatile index, for the weakness of Japanese share prices. Although the OSE will not immediately abolish Nikkei 225 contracts, the aim is for the new contracts to take over as the most widely traded index futures in Japan. The bulk of stock futures trading is on the OSE, although its index is based on Tokyo cash prices. Over the past two years, TSE officials have introduced restrictions to curb speculative trading on the futures and options markets. The restrictions have led to a shift in trading from the OSE to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, which also lists Nikkei 225 futures. Futures trading volume in Osaka has almost halved since last year. The ministry of finance and the Tokyo stock market authorities agreed in December that a capitalisation weighted average was needed as a benchmark for the futures market, rather than an average which gives a price weighting to all shares irrespective of differences in capitalisation. Nihon Keizai Shimbum, the business newspaper that produces the index, insists that the Nikkei 300 is an additional index, and wants the Nikkei 225 to remain as a benchmark for the Tokyo stock market. Traders pointed out yesterday that it was too early to say whether the new index would replace the Nikkei 225 as a new benchmark. However, Tokyo traders have begun shifting positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Nikkei 300, selling Nikkei 225 component stocks not included in the Nikkei 300. Japanese traders are now focusing on the reaction at Simex, where volume could suffer if Japanese stock futures trading shifts from the Nikkei 225 to Nikkei 300.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Disgruntled workers at a Guangdong state-owned  factory recently ended a protracted industrial dispute by  ousting their manager and appointing a shop-floor worker as  their new boss. Work started again at the Shaoguan Mineral  Refining Plant in northern Guangdong in late April, almost three  months after the factory's 500 workers went on strike  complaining that the factory manager, Zeng Wanhua, was an  incompetent brute. The strike took more than two months to  resolve. Zeng was replaced by a shop steward, Tang Zhenmao.    During this time the factory's losses piled up, forcing the  Guangzhou branch of the China Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation to  step in to pay salaries. "If you don't pay attention to the  interests of the workers, they have the right to try to bring  about changes," said the ebullient Tang, a worker in the  mineral-separating room before being chosen by workers to  replace the now retired Zeng.    Tang said the 200 renminbi (about HK$178) per month salaries  at the Shaoguan factory were "pitiable" and forced most workers  to moonlight to make ends meet. "[We] ousted Zeng to save  ourselves," he said.    While Chinese officials supply regular reports of labour  disputes in foreign-owned companies, little is heard on the  subject of state-run factory disputes. This may be because of  China's socialist roots, which assert that workers' interests  are the same as managers in the state sector. China's  constitution does not give workers the right to strike.    "As a socialist country, we believe the interests of workers  and the enterprise are the same. So we are not going to  advocate strikes," said Wang Chidong, the deputy director of the  grass-roots work department of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions (ACFTU) in Beijing. "We feel strikes make labour  relations too tense. It is the most extreme kind of behaviour,"  Wang said.    But with disputes rising, officials say a new "three-party  principle" (involving government, enterprises and unions) will  be adopted to replace the increasingly ineffective work of  Communist Party cells in smoothing labour frictions in state  enterprises.    An ACFTU document on the role of unions in China's move to  corporatise its state-owned sector was submitted to Beijing  leaders in April. It calls for the establishment of  German-style supervisory committees composed of management and  labour representatives.    Chinese labour ministry officials also say a better  arbitration system will be set up to deal with the growing  number of labour disputes which cannot be resolved internally.  Arbitration centres in China handled 11,400 disputes in 1993,  up 51 per cent on a year earlier, although no breakdown of the  number involving state sector workers was given.    The ACFTU admits that 7 million workers in state enterprises  suffer "inferior living conditions", and even poverty.  Nationwide, more than 40 per cent of state enterprises -- which  employ close to 200 million workers -- lost money in the first  quarter of this year.    Recent official reports from the state-sector-dominated  provinces of Liaoning, Sichuan and Hubei show a growing number  of state enterprise workers taking similar "self preservation"  measures as were adopted in Shaoguan. These mainly involve  dumping the factory's core business to go into more lucrative  trades. But increasingly, they also include ousting incompetent  managers and recouping months of unpaid salaries.</p>

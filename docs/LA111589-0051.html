			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IBM Unveils Advanced Disk Storage Unit: International Business Machines  introduced a top-end disk drive that it called the fastest, largest-capacity  mainframe disk storage device available. The 3390 Direct Access Storage Device  was to have been unveiled July 25, but its release was postponed after IBM  discovered some wear of the coating that covers its disks, which it said could  have eventually led to data loss. IBM said the disk drive, which can do three  times the work in one-third the space of previous units, will be available Dec.  1. The machine will cost $90,000 to $275,000, depending on the model, with a  typical configuration of three 3390 model 2 units priced at $759,000.  </P></p>

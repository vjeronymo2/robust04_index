			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: BAT to invest in Turkish venture BAT Industries and Turkey's state tobacco company, Tekel, are to form a joint venture managed by the UK group to make cigarettes in Turkey. BAT will invest a substantial sum to turn Tekel's plant at Akhisar into a modern facility capable of supplying a large share of the market, according to a memorandum of agreement signed by the two. The joint venture will make several Tekel brands and a range of BAT's international brands such as Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. In common with other international companies, BAT has been pushing into countries opening their markets to foreign investment. It has, for example, completed deals in five former Soviet bloc countries. When investment in the five countries is completed in five years, BAT's annual manufacturing capacity will rise by 100bn cigarettes from 540bn now. BAT Dollars 1bn takeover ruling, Page 36</p>

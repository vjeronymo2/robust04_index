			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Imports cut into Dutch flower power - One out of every eight roses sold in the European market is now grown in Africa, Latin America or Israel As Holland celebrates the 400th anniversary of the tulip this summer, the horticultural industry to which it gave birth is being forced to adjust to a most curious of commercial phenomenon - undercutting from a new crop of African producers. Cut flower growing has become a sunrise industry in the dark continent, with Kenya and Zimbabwe leading an expanding herd of commercial farmers eager to trade their dependance on cereals or tobacco for the greener fields of disposable floriculture. Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest of seven Dutch flower markets, reported a 82.5 per cent increase in rose imports last year, while at the BVH auction a flood of foreign stems knocked 40 per cent off rose prices during the recent winter season. Low wages, zero heating costs and lack of regulation of pesticide and fertiliser run-offs are all contributing to the movement abroad of this most typical of Dutch industries. But the trend is also market-led in that the selling peaks of Christmas and St Valentine's Day both occur when European production is low and unit costs correspondingly higher. 'What will happen,' predicts Ms Margarette Worsfold, editor of the Flower Trades Journal, 'is that the Dutch will suck in more flowers from Kenya, Colombia and other producers. They take up all the current oversupply and shove it through the auctions to make up for their own shortage.' One in eight roses sold in Europe is now grown in Africa, Latin America or Israel. Dutch wholesalers, with 59 per cent of the international flower trade, welcome the trend as an opportunity to expand their market with more competitive rates while preserving their margins. The auctions, which earn 6 per cent on every transaction, say imports pose no threat to Dutch hegemony, although this is perceived less in terms of the interests of domestic floriculture than the potential risk to the existing marketing and distribution chain of high volume, non-Dutch suppliers. But the 11,000 Dutch growers, who established the auctions as co-operatives, have become increasingly resigned to losing the rose and carnation trade altogether - the equivalent of 42 per cent by value of Aalsmeer's total turnover. Though disdained as indicators of a market's 'floral illiteracy', they remain the cornerstone of the wilting, but vitally important, 'occasions' sector of the retail trade. Selling the more sophisticated products at which Dutch planters excel on the growing 'impulse' market requires much greater strategic awareness. 'I think Dutch growers will always find varieties and niches in the markets to make the whole assortment complete,' says Mr Niek Van Rest, managing director of the Flower Council of Holland, the industry's promotional arm. 'You will see roses and carnations, in particular, largely taken over by other countries but new varieties will still be grown in Holland.' Nevertheless, there is much for the Dutch to celebrate in this anniversary year. Aalsmeer, 15km from Amsterdam, is the showcase of a Pounds 2.2bn business that ranks among the most competitive in the world. Some 20m stems pass beneath its digital auction clocks daily in homage to an industry that has successfully married the further shores of plant technology with a distribution system so smooth that it has virtually eliminated distance as an obstacle. Though the double-digit increases of the 1980s are long gone, Aalsmeer reported a healthy 4.8 per cent rise in earnings for the first third of the year, incorporating a 2.7 per cent increase in Germany, Holland's biggest customer, and hefty growth in eastern Europe and Japan. Full implementation of the Uruguay Round settlement in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would further prise open the Japanese market while giving greater access to the US. But the greatest growth potential lies in the transformation of moribund 'occasions' markets, like the UK with its Pounds 19 a head annual flower consumption, into nations of impulse-buyers, like the Germans who spend over Pounds 30 each on flowers each year. The two keys to this kingdom are an educated consumer and a larger number of retail outlets. Unlike Germany, regular flower buying has never been promoted in the UK, but that could be about to alter as supermarket chains, sensing the untapped demand, begin competing head-on with the traditional high street florists. While the multiples have the resources and sales points to grow markets like the UK, however, they could also pose a threat to the eminence of the Dutch auctions in international flower trading. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer store chain, for example, sources its larger orders directly from Spanish growers, by-passing the auctions and their commissions altogether. Aalsmeer's managing director, Mr Andre Mulder, is convinced there will always be a commercial need for an international clearing house for the flower trade but is concerned at the sheer scale of transactions taking place at his market. Ten thousand trucks a day rumble through its caverns and, on present growth, it will become unmanageable within a decade. In a bid to reduce congestion, Aalsmeer introduced a video-based selling system for pot plants in January, allowing growers to send only a sample to auction with the majority inspected electronically. Such a system is unlikely to be viable for cut flowers and for much the same reason roses and gerbera will always be traded on a spot and not a futures market, however great the volumes handled. 'Flowers are perishable products', says Mr Mulder, 'and it's not only a high-tech product, but a high-touch product. So if you really want to do business in the right way, you have to touch and see and smell the product.'</p>

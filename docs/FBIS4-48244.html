			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the ETHIOPIAN NEWS AGENCY, two  officials of the former regime, now in custody following  deportation from Djibouti, showed no repentance for the  atrocities they had committed during the reign of terror. In an  interview with the organ of the Amhara Nation's Democratic  Movement, Major Melaku Tefera and Maj. Begashaw Atalay said they  had nothing to speak with regret about as everything they had  done under the leadership of the revolution enjoyed the full  support of the populace.    Maj. Begashaw said on his part he was committed to fight to  the last drop of his blood for the success of the revolution  that provided full answers to what he described as the pertinent  questions of the day. He expressed satisfaction over what he  described as efforts of the private press to reflect the  objective realities in the country. He said journalists of the  private press have to keep on reflecting what he termed as  realities, despite pressures under which he said they perform  their journalistic duties.    Asked whether their rights were voiced by prison officials,  they said they had no complaints and thanked the authorities for  cooperation with their families who, they said, often came to  see them in detention.</p>

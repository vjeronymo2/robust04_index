			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Management: Such an elusive quality If a company tells you it has a Total Quality Management programme, it is trying to prove that it is a go-ahead organisation striving to do as well as possible all the time. Don't be fooled. It seems that all but a few quality programmes fail, usually because the management failed to set realistic goals or look for measurable benefits at the outset. According to a survey by A T Kearney, the international management consultants, and TQM magazine, 80 per cent of such programmes do not produce any tangible benefit. The findings are significant because TQM has become one of the main techniques being used in Britain to improve corporate performance. Earlier research by A T Kearney showed that the notion of TQM had become so fashionable that nine out of 10 chief executives said they planned to introduce it. However the latest study reveals that only 20 per cent of companies which have introduced a TQM programme report tangible results in the last 12 months. Among the findings are: Successful TQM programmes typically have a greater focus on the customer and aim to give employees more authority to make decisions. Companies which have successfully introduced TQM are twice as likely to have made an objective study of their competitors through 'benchmarking'. Where TQM has failed to generate tangible results the quality manager, rather than a director, was often responsible for the programme. Companies which practise TQM successfully share four common characteristics; an emphasis on tangible results, insistence on performance measurement, an integrated programme and a clear commitment from top management. In addition they ensure that they 'retain ownership of the programme' instead of relying upon outside consultants.</p>

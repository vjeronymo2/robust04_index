The monthly trade surplus in January fell 46 per cent to  R[rand]1,065-billion from R1,979-billion in December 1993 but  was up on the surplus in the same month last year of  R954-million.    Imports grew 9.5 per cent to R4,693-billion last month  against R4,286-billion in the previous month, while exports  dropped eight per cent to R5,757-billion from R6,265-billion.    However, analysts said the first month of the year was  traditionally quiet for exporters, pointing out January 1994's  total exports were higher than January 1993's exports of  R5,097-billion.    Imports increased largely due to a 35 per cent surge in the  import of machinery and mechanical appliances to R1,631-billion  in January compared to the same month last year.    Economists said this was mainly due to plant replacement and  the higher import propensity which accompanies economic  recovery, currently being experienced by the country.    Imports of base metals, and precious and semi-precious  stones  were also substantially higher, as were the imports of animal or  vegetable fats and oils.    Most export categories registered increases over the  equivalent month in 1993, but the export of precious and  semi-precious stones slid to R277-million last month compared to  R400.6-million in January last year.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Prestwick tumbles as operating costs bite PRESTWICK Holdings, the printed circuit board maker, tumbled Pounds 3.97m into the red in the year to July 31. There were profits of Pounds 91,000 last time. In July the company's shares fell 12p to 29p when it warned of the loss. Yesterday the shares shed 3p to close at 27p. Although turnover improved to Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 30.4m) operating costs, mainly in the group's smaller businesses, had risen dramatically, Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, said. The pre-tax result was after an exceptional Pounds 1.5m charge, being reorganisation costs and the loss on disposal of obsolete fixed assets. Net interest payable rose to Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 456,000). Mr Laughland said the group had been reorganised into three operating companies, the benefits of which were beginning to show through. The group had returned to profitability in September. Losses per share amounted to 19.8p (0.5p) and there is no final dividend, leaving the total for the year at 0.5p (1.5p).</p>

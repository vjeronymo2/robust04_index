			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Vets threaten protest over low EU training standards British vets warned yesterday that they were prepared to break European Union law by refusing to allow vets from certain member states to work in the UK unless training standards in those countries were raised. The warning comes after a series of outbreaks of disease on British farms linked to infected animals imported from the EU or eastern Europe. Vets expect these outbreaks to increase because the single market has led to a sharp rise in the movement of animals. Livestock must be accompanied by certificates saying it is free of disease. But British vets believe checks are not always carried out properly. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, to which all vets must belong to practice in the UK, said it was concerned about training standards in Italy, Spain and Greece. In some colleges veterinary students could graduate 'without laying a finger on a live animal throughout their five-year course'. Mr Barry Johnson, the college's president, said: 'We do not want to break the law. But we may be compelled to if we felt the standards were not high enough and all other passages were blocked to us.' The college, backed by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, is pressing the European Commission to drop plans to withdraw funding of Ecu60,000 (Pounds 45,000) a year for regular visits by independent experts to all veterinary schools in the EU. The aim of these visits is to ensure common standards are maintained. Mrs Judy MacArthur Clark, the college's vice-president, said: 'We are dismayed that the Commission is proposing to withdraw its funding to the European system of visitations and monitoring, which means we will have no means of quality control over vets . . . permitted to practice in the UK. 'We are also very concerned that this high standard of veterinary training is essential to prevent many animal diseases being introduced into Europe from elsewhere in the world.'</p>

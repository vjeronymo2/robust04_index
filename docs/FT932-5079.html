			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Dunhill A 12 per cent fall in Dunhill's share price in response to a 7 per cent slide in annual profits seems a rather extreme reaction. Then again, shareholders presumably take the view that it is hard to reinflate a burst bubble. Dunhill's bleak comments about trading prospects suggest luxury goods companies will find life tough for a long time to come. Deprived of their bonuses, Japanese salarymen are not buying fancy trinkets and the corporate gift market has all but dried up. Shareholders might expect some protection from sterling's depreciation given that 95 per cent of Dunhill's sales are made overseas. But the company's conservative hedging strategy complicates the sums. Dunhill will also see a declining return on its cash pile, which has shrunk by Pounds 60m to Pounds 120m, following an acquisition spree. At least a secure dividend limits the downside. More general worries about luxury brand values may also be overdone. After all, it is difficult to envisage an own label version of Dunhill's fast-selling Pounds 900 Lorenzo de Medici Montblanc pen. Yesterday's flotation of 4 per cent of Hermes, which was 33 times over-subscribed, also underscores the amazing faith some investors retain in luxury brands. Should Dunhill's shares fall too far out of fashion, Rothmans International, its 57 per cent shareholder, may simply snap up the rest.</p>

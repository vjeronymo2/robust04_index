			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: JOACHIM SPLICHAL BRINGS HIS SPECIAL TOUCH TO PATINA  </P> <P> One of the most eagerly awaited restaurants of the year has finally opened.  Joachim Splichal, who made Beverly Hills' Max au Triangle famous, has taken  over the former Le St. Germain and turned it into Patina. The address is 5955  Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. The number: (213) 467-1108.  </P> <P> This was worth waiting for. The restaurant's barely been open a week, but it is  already clear that Splichal's food is as exciting as it ever was, that the  small restaurant manages to be both modern and intimate and that the prices are  fair (entrees hover around the $20 mark).  </P> <P> After one visit I can recommend the appetizer of Santa Barbara shrimp with  mashed potatoes and truffle chips, the very peppered tuna with Asian accents  that is served atop a tangle of vegetables, and the spectacular peach galette  for dessert. And I can tell you that I am really looking forward to eating my  way through the rest of the menu. RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

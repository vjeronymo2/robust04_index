			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Derivative frailties exposed by volatility - Risk and reward The dramatic sell-off in leading government bond markets during the past two weeks has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the fast-moving world of derivatives. Perhaps the most serious breakdown during this period of intense volatility has been the failure of securities houses to ensure liquidity in products they had structured and sold when the going was good. Volatility is an important component in the pricing and trading of derivatives. It can be defined as a statistical measure of the tendency of a market price or yield to vary over time, or in the case of a government bond, until it matures. When a trader has to evaluate an option price, volatility is one of the most important and difficult elements to gauge because it is usually the only variable the trader does not know with certainty in advance. With respect to options on European government bond futures, the implied volatility on Italian and Spanish government bond options is relatively high at around 10 per cent. Traders say the high level of implied volatility in these instruments mainly reflects the uncertain outlook on interest rates in these countries. In view of the volatility associated with these markets, it was not much of a surprise when implied volatility shot up during the recent heavy falls in the futures and cash markets. By contrast, traders of fixed-income derivatives were panic-stricken when the implied volatility in options on German bunds more than doubled. Before the rout, options on bunds were seen as a model of price stability, boasting a low implied volatility of between 3 1/2 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent. According to Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest in Frankfurt, the implied volatility in bund options went as high as 10 per cent last Wednesday, when bund futures rose and fell by more than two points before closing virtually unchanged. The volatility has since fallen back to around 7 1/2 per cent though the surge has caused the historical volatility of the options to increase substantially. Although the rise in volatility made it much more expensive for investors or traders to buy options on Bunds, it also meant big paper profits for investors who held them. However, many have failed to realise these profits since liquidity in the market has virtually dried up. The large rise in volatility has made fair-weather market-makers reluctant to buy back options, causing bid-offer spreads to widen to more than six basis points from between three or four basis points during normal market conditions. Indeed, many market-makers, especially those who have participated in the recent spate of government bond auctions, are keen to sell options at current levels in order to hedge their positions. Some traders of fixed-income derivatives argue the over-the counter market in these products has never been particularly efficient. 'It has never been a liquid two-way market, it has always been negotiated,' says a head of department at a leading UK house. Observers believe it will be some time before liquidity improves and they fear that a long delay could bring on further, debilitating bouts of volatility. The big players, namely the hedge funds forced to liquidate positions when a series of bets went wrong, are licking their wounds and are unlikely to come back soon. Another brake on liquidity has been the sharp rise in margin requirements on several futures and options exchanges which have penalised those brave enough to keep trading. 'Less liquidity means a greater likelihood in price jumps,' says Mr Kerger.</p>

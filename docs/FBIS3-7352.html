The news analyst says:    By "strong retaliation," he meant to unleash a nuclear war  against the North in conspiracy with outside forces, and by  "making use of an event of contingency as an opportunity to  achieve unification," he meant to "unify the country by  prevailing over communism" through a war with the help of  outside forces.    This was an open provocation against the North and a  declaration of confrontation.    His provoking words against the North such as "strong  retaliation" came after the entire puppet Armed Forces were  placed in readiness for attack on the North at a time when the  U.S. imperialists' aggression forces including nuclear carriers  were moving close to the Korean peninsula. No one can dare act  and speak like that, but those who are anxious to ignite a war.    However, the puppets' attempt to undermine the socialism of  the North where the leader, the party and the masses are united  in one mind is as foolish as trying to break a rock with a  rotten egg.    If the puppets dare ignite a war to destroy our system like  a  puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, we will deal a heavy  retaliatory blow at them.</p>

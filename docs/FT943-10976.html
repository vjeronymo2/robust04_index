			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: China The Chinese authorities' package of measures to support the domestic stock market succeeded in spades. The 36 per cent rise yesterday in A-shares - which can only be bought by domestic investors - is remarkable even by the standards of a market which has fallen 80 per cent inside 18 months. While the ban on new listings until the year-end might have been expected to improve sentiment, the hint that foreign investors could be granted access generated most excitement. Yet international institutions are unlikely to rush to buy A-shares, even if practical difficulties such as the lack of currency convertibility can be overcome. The market's extraordinary volatility and the relatively small size of companies which issue A-shares are good reasons to be wary. International investors can already buy B-shares, which are traded domestically in US dollars, but most favour the shares of the very large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong - or Hong Kong companies which trade with China. Growth and inflation appear to be slowing from the break-neck speed of last year, while the long-term prospects remain bright. Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong - known confusingly as H-shares - were already rising, which would probably have lifted the domestic market sooner or later. Even if the investment story is attractive, though, yesterday's performance shows why most fund managers prefer the relative tranquility of Hong Kong.</p>

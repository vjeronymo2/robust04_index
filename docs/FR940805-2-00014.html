			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice supersedes the NOI for the Rocky Flats SWEIS published at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 56 FR 10548, March 13, 1991, and the NOI for the Plutonium Recovery Modification Project published at 55 FR 21919, May 22, 1990. As a result of the cancellation of nuclear weapons production at Rocky Flats, both the 1991 SWEIS NOI and the Plutonium Recovery Modification Project NOI no longer reflect Rocky Flats' current mission. Accordingly, both the 1991 SWEIS NOI and the Plutonium Recovery Modification Project NOI are withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Scoping Process: To ensure the SWEIS addresses the full range of issues and alternatives related to this proposal, DOE invites all interested parties, including the general public, to submit oral or written comments on the issues to be addressed and the alternatives to be analyzed in the SWEIS. Interested parties may submit written comments to Beth Brainard-Jordan at the address listed above, at facsimile number 1&hyph;303&hyph;966&hyph;6633, or at the public scoping meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE also invites all interested parties to present oral and/or written comments at the public scoping meeting scheduled for August 23, 1994. In addition, parties are invited to offer comments or suggestions concerning the SWEIS by calling the Rocky Flats SWEIS telephone hotline at 1&hyph;800&hyph;801&hyph;2026. All written and oral comments will be recorded and given equal weight in preparation of the Draft SWEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scoping process includes informal scoping workshops, which have begun and will continue until the close of the comment period. These workshops are designed to provide interested parties with an effective, informal mechanism for two-way communication with DOE. Dates, times, and locations of the workshops will be advertised locally in the Golden, CO, area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A public scoping meeting is being held to assist in defining the appropriate scope of the SWEIS and the significant environmental issues to be addressed. This meeting is scheduled for August 23, 1994, from 2:00 to 4:30 P.M. and from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M., at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities, 6901 Wadsworth Boulevard, Arvada, CO. This public scoping meeting will be conducted by a facilitator, and will not be a formal evidentiary hearing. The facilitator, DOE representatives, and members of the public present may ask for clarification of comments and statements. Requests to speak at the meeting and requests for additional information may be made by calling the toll-free telephone number 1&hyph;800&hyph;801&hyph;2026 or by facsimile at 1&hyph;303&hyph;832&hyph;9095. People may also register at the meeting to speak.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to speak, five minutes will be allotted for each speaker. Depending on the number of persons requesting to speak, the facilitator may allow people to speak more than once or allot additional time for elected officials, organizations, or speakers representing multiple parties. Persons speaking on behalf of organizations should identify the name of the organization in their request to speak. Persons who have not submitted a request to speak in advance of the public scoping meeting, but who have registered at the meeting, will be called upon to speak in turn after the pre-registered speakers. Written comments will also be accepted at the meeting, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE is committed to providing opportunities for the involvement of interested individuals and groups in this and other DOE planning activities. DOE will publish additional information on the date and location of the public scoping meeting in local newspapers well in advance of the scheduled meeting date. If it becomes necessary to change the date, time or location of the public scoping meeting, the changes will be announced in appropriate media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE will record and prepare transcripts of the public scoping meeting comments. Interested parties will be able to review the transcripts, written comments, reference material, related NEPA documents, and background information on Rocky Flats during normal business hours at the following reading rooms:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE Freedom of Information Room, Room 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, 1&hyph;202&hyph;586&hyph;6020  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Colorado Department of Health, 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Building B&hyph;2, Denver, CO 80222&hyph;1530, 1&hyph;303&hyph;692&hyph;2056  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

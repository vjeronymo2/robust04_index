			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 24 (AFP) -- Frauds cost the  European Union [EU] some ECU394.2 million (453.3 million  dollars) in 1993, up from ECU269 million in 1992, EU Budget  Commissioner Peter Schmidhuber said Thursday [24 March].    In agriculture spending, member states counted 1,298 cases  of  fraud, at a cost totalling ECU248.3 million.    In the rest of the budget, 1,001 cases of fraud were  uncovered costing ECU145.9 million. The European Union budget  for 1993 was ECU73.4 billion, half of which was devoted to  agricultural spending.    "The frauds are more and more sophsiticated and more and  more  refined with the help of new technology," Schmidhuber said.    The commissioner said international criminal organisations  had started operating against the Union and were escaping  serious punishments because of a lack of cooperation among the  member states.    The Union needs to improve its policing of the spending it  agrees to, Schmidhuber said.    "We depend too much on chance. We need to create links  between our data banks and concentrate our efforts on the  largest types of fraud," he said.    The Commission is going ask the Council of Ministers to  agree  to write community fraud into their countries' domestic  legislation, with tough punishments those found guilty of  committing the frauds.    Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen has already compiled  a  "blacklist" of firms found guilty of defrauding EU agricultural  spending.    Britain on Wednesday put forward a similar proposal to the  justice and interior ministers meeting in Brussels.    Legislation is going to be simplified to reduce the  possibilities for agricultural frauds, the EU comissioner said.    The Commission will also set up, for a trial period, a free  telephone number for people to call in with information relating  to frauds. Rewards would not be offered, Schmidhuber said.</p>

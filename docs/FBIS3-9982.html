			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 25 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen denied today that he is going to resign, condemned  rumors of a possible coup d'etat, and gave assurances that he  will continue in his post until his term ends in 1996.    "I have not thought of resigning; I shall continue ahead.  The people elected me for a four-year period," the Ecuadoran  president said in a news conference in the Government Palace.    On Wednesday various local media gave assurances that  Duran-Ballen would leave office and Vice President Alberto Dahik  would be appointed to replace him.    Duran-Ballen said that on that day he received numerous  calls  at his home from reporters, officials, and friends to learn the  truth. "The callers asked whether I had suffered a heart attack,  if it was true that the members of the military were in the  National Palace and that I had resigned. They all were rumors,"  the president assured.    The 72-year-old president had a back operation a year ago  and  today he said that his health is good. He denied being depressed  and affirmed that he is in good spirits to face the problems and  responsibilities inherent to his post.    Duran-Ballen, elected president in August 1992, said that  rumors about coups and the situation of unrest that exist were  created by "people interested in creating instability in the  country." He did not identify any of these people.    Regarding the plebiscite his government wants to convoke,  the  president said that the plebiscite, the date, and the issues it  will cover are still being discussed. He said it would be more  like "consulting the people."    The Ecuadoran Armed Forces publicly reiterated Thursday  their  support for President Duran-Ballen and guaranteed the permanence  of the democratic system and their support for constitutional  order.    According to the political opposition and experts, the  Ecuadoran president is burdened by the country's political and  economic problems. Right now the country is practically  ungovernable.    Vice President Alberto Dahik is constantly in conflict with  the opposition, to the degree that legislators have warned that  if Duran-Ballen were to resign, Congress would appoint a  successor who would not be the official the Constitution  envisages.</p>

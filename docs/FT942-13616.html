			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Sport: A World Cup of their own - Rugby Union In January, Sue Brodie telephoned her friends Ramsay Jones and Sandra Williamson to ask them out for a drink. That evening, at a pub in Leith, Brodie sprung her surprise. The Netherlands had just announced that it could not host the women's rugby union World Cup, scheduled for April. She suggested that Scotland host the cup and the three of them organise it. Brodie, Scotland's full back and the chair of the Scottish Women's Rugby Union, Jones, Scotland team manager, and Williamson, Scotland's scrum half, had just 90 days. The three, with Sandra's husband George, contacted the countries which had entered, rugby clubs around Scotland and potential sponsors. Twelve countries agreed to compete, although Spain eventually dropped out and was replaced by a hastily-assembled Scottish student team. Clubs offered to host matches and use their contacts with local media to promote the event. But sponsorship proved difficult to find. One company told Jones they were not interested in sponsoring 'just a bunch of girls' trying to play a man's sport. Many of the competing teams struggled to pay for the trip. The US, Japanese and Canadian players each had to find Pounds 1,000. The teams were divided into four pools of three, but it quickly became clear that they also divided into three classes, led by the US and England, who were seeded to meet in the final. The US started with a 111-0 win over Sweden and then beat Japan 121-0. England faced tougher opposition. They played Scotland in a match that drew a boisterous home crowd of more than 3,000 to Boroughmuir. Scotland produced some of their best rugby but still lost 26-0. The top teams have drawn surprised admiration from male spectators for their ball handling and kicking. The accuracy of Karen Almond, England's place kicker, against Scotland prompted flattering comparisons with male internationalists. All the teams have shown physical commitment in the tackle, even if not all of them have mastered the technique. At Boroughmuir, the ferocity of the tackling by the Scottish centres drew pained gasps from the largely male crowd. For Brodie, Jones and Williamson the direct involvement ended after Wales beat Scotland 8-0 in the quarter-finals last Sunday at Melrose. After the match both teams did what rugby players everywhere do, they went to the bar, exhausted. Unlike most of the games in the World Cup, this had been a tense, attritional, forwards' battle. Both sides had produced some moments of flair and imagination but also made some stupid mistakes and decisions on the field. While Brodie and Williamson nursed their pints and their bruises the disappointment of defeat as players was mixed with the satisfying knowledge that their bold plan to stage the World Cup had come off. On Wednesday, Wales lost their semi-final 56-15 to the US while England beat France 18-6. Tomorrow the US meet England in the final. Two weeks ago women's rugby was a game that women should not be playing. By Wednesday spectators were asking why men cannot produce such displays of running rugby.</p>

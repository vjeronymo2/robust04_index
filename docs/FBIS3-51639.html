On 19 January, these senators adopted a  resolution in that respect. Considering that it is a good  initiative, the senators of the Alliance For Parliamentary  Cohesion have decided to take charge of it. Let us listen to  one of the senators elected on 18 January, Amos Andre:    [Begin recording] [Senator Andre in Creole] Being one of the  three branches of state power, we cannot leave in the hands of  people who have no legitimacy or legal standing an activity  which is going to define the fate of the nation. It is within  this context that we voted a resolution on 19 January to have  the Haitian Parliament take charge of the conference.    [Reporter Edner Jean] Some people think that this step could  be a new blow that the senators of the Alliance, in fact the  legislators opposed to President Aristide, are staging, just  like the Villa D'Acceuil agreement, where you will take the  process in hand and propose your own solutions so that it can be  voted on in Parliament.    [Senator Andre] Far from that, far from that. As senators of  the Republic, we received a mandate which is defined by the  Constitution, and President Aristide also received a mandate  defined by the Constitution. Our role as senators is to search  with the Haitian people for any solutions that could solve the  crisis. Some legislators were absent for other reasons that they  deem more important than reasons to be in the Senate, but we  think that the country's situation is very difficult and we must  work on it seriously. That is what motivates our presence. We  have no idea or intention to stage a coup against the president.  What will be the use of it? That is not what our step means.  Our objective is to find a favorable solution for all the people  involved in the Haitian crisis, because we are at a phase where  even the people who provoked the crisis are now suffering, along  with everyone else, meaning that everyone is in crisis in the  country.    Even if you did not participate in a coup d'etat, you are  facing an embargo, you cannot function normally. As for me as a  senator, I cannot function normally. Even the president's  supporters cannot function normally. We are facing a situation  where the country can no longer resist under the conditions of  the embargo and the division within the country. We believe  that as state representatives we must act to see if we can  extract the country from the crisis.[Passage omitted].</p>

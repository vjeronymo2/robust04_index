			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, by publicly announcing the structure of  his cabinet during an event at the National Museum,  President-elect Jose Maria Figueres disclosed that his future  government will function based on a system of five operational  fields.    The ministries will operate under specific fields in  accordance with their respective disciplines in such a way that  they may be able to tackle the country's problems as a team.  Each of the ministries will be supervised by a general  coordinator.    Three of the fields will be institutional renovation, which  will be coordinated by Rodrigo Oreamuno, second vice  president-elect; the economic sector, which will be coordinated  by Carlos Manuel Castillo (who is also Central Bank executive  president); and the social sector, which will be coordinated by  Rebeca Grynspan, first vice president-elect. The other fields  will be sustainable growth, coordinated by Carlos Espinach; and  security, supervised by Elias Soley, who has also been selected  as minister of the presidency.    "These fields do not cover all government tasks, but we will  try to coordinate fundamental aspects of the country's reality  and take advantage of this plan to implement mechanisms that  will expedite government decisions despite current institutional  limitations," Figueres commented. The president-elect warned  that in selecting his ministers he tried to combine honesty, the  ability to work as a team, inclination for sacrifice,  professional excellence, public and private life qualifications,  equanimity, the ability to reach agreements, loyalty, and  commitment to the principles of government programs. "I am  convinced that each one of those who have accepted their  nomination as minister, will let their work account for the  decision to appoint them as government ministers," the president  pointed out.    In concluding his speech, Figueres took hold of the same  mallet which, 45 years earlier his father, Jose Figueres Ferrer,  had held to strike the walls of what was then the Army General  Headquarters and today houses the National Museum. Figueres,  overwhelmed by emotion and with broken sentences, stated amid  continuous rounds of applause: "Forty-five years ago in this  same spot and with this same mallet given to me this morning by  a friend... Don Pepe [Figueres Sr.] came to tear down some walls  so that instead of armies we would have schools, universities,  health, and welfare. Today with this same mallet in this same  spot with all humility and enthusiasm, we come to tear down the  walls of intolerance ... overtaken with fervor and eagerness to  work, let us tear down the walls of parochialism and  incomprehension in our country..."    He called on all Costa Ricans to exercise their right to  "healthy criticism and supervision of the government's  performance," since he acknowledges the importance of exchanging  opinions. "However, there is also a need for national unity so  that the Costa Rican family, despite its political affiliation,  can solve the [country's] problems and so that these next four  years may be truly productive," Figueres concluded.  <H5>  Appointments </H5> <H5>  Institutional Renovation Sphere </H5>   Planning: Leonardo Garnier    Culture: Arnoldo Mora    Foreign Relations: Fernando Naranjo  <H5>  Social Sphere </H5>   Health: German Weinstock    Education: Eduardo Doryan    Housing: Edgar Arroyo    Rural Development (solving peasant problems): Ruben  Solorzano  Costa Rican Social Security Fund: Ana Gabriela Ross  <H5>  Economic Sphere </H5>   Central Bank: Carlos Manuel Castillo    Finance: Fernando Herrero    Economy, Industry, Commerce: Marcos Vargas    Agriculture: Mario Carvajal  Foreign Trade: Jose Rossi  <H5>  Sustainable Growth Sphere </H5>   Natural Resources, Energy, and Mines: Rene Castro    Science and Technology: Roberto Dobles    Public Works and Transportation: Bernardo Arce (minister)  and Francisco Nicolas (vice-minister)  <H5>  Security Sphere </H5>   Presidency: Elias Soley    Information: Flory Rodriguez    Government: Mauren Clarke    Public Security: Juan Diego Castro    Justice: Enrique Castillo    Labor: Farid Ayales  <H5>  Ministers Without Portfolio </H5>   Tourism: Carlos Roesch    Special Projects (priority problems): Longino Soto  Regional Coordination (presidency - cantons relations): Sergio  Quiros  <H5>  Special Advisers </H5>   Economy and Business Sector: Calixto Chaves    Working Groups Coordination: Victor Ojeda    Presidential Assistant: Roberto Hidalgo    Trade Negotiator: Luis Diego Escalante    Autonomous, INS [National Insurance Institute]: Alejandro  Soto.</p>

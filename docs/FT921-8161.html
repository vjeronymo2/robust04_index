			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Lilley opens way for Redland's bid MR Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, yesterday opened the way for Redland to pursue its Pounds 629m contested bid for rival UK building materials group, Steetley. An opposing plan to merge the British brick, clay roof tile and concrete product businesses of Tarmac and Steetley was referred for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Lilley said an investigation into the Redland offer could still go ahead if the company was unable to provide satisfactory undertakings to dispose of brick and clay roof tile plants in markets where it would have a dominant position. Redland has offered to sell its brick works at Cranleigh in Surrey and Tilmanstone in Kent as well as the Steetley clay tile plants at Keele and Knutton in Staffordshire should its bid succeed. It is thought that the undertakings will be enough to persuade Mr Lilley to allow the offer to proceed. Redland and Steetley together control 46 per cent of the national clay roof tile market and 23 per cent of brick production in south east England. Some stock market analysts were surprised that Mr Lilley treated the two merger proposals differently, since both would affect the ownership of a large part of the UK brick and clay roof tile industry. Mr Andrew Melrose, construction analyst for Nomura, the Japanese securities house, said: 'This is a late Christmas present for Redland. Its bid will now be resolved before the MMC can complete its investigation of the Tarmac/Steetley joint venture.' Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said Tarmac and Steetley had discussed the possibility of giving similar undertakings on disposals but had been unable to reach agreement with the Office of Fair Trading. Tarmac and Steetley between them have 39 per cent of the clay tile market, almost 80 per cent of brick production capacity in north east England and approaching 50 per cent of brick capacity in south west England. The large combined turnovers of Steetley and Tarmac mean their joint venture should have been considered by the European Commission. Sir Leon Brittan the EC's competition commissioner last week, however, agreed to refer the merger back to British authorities because of the 'significant competition issues' raised in the UK. Mr Miles said last night that Steetley would continue to defend itself strenuously against Redland's offer of 85 Redland shares for every 100 Steetley shares. Following yesterday's announcements Redland's share price fell 5p to 473p, valuing Steetley at Pounds 629m or 402p a share. Tarmac's share price fell 2p to 122p. Tarmac said it would consider its position in the light of the MMC referral. Redland said it had always expected it might have to give undertakings on disposals. Sale of the four plants would have a minimal effect on the benefits it expected to gain from takeover. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Bohuslav Rychtarik, mayor of Straz pod </F> Ralskem, by hp; place and date not given: "There Is Hope for the  Ralsko Area"]    [Text] About 50 delegates from 16 countries  throughout the world participated in an international conference  on the conversion of the weapons industry and revitalization of  former military areas, which took place at Straz pod Ralskem on  29-31 March of this year. The conference was organized by the  Energy Efficiency Committee of the United Nations and  sponsorship over the conference was adopted by the Ministry of  Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic.    "Mr. Frederic Romig, the secretary of the UN Energy  Commission, assured me that the conference signifies hope for us  and that the model solution for saving energy in Ceska Lipa  Okres, a project which is designated as an energy-efficient  demonstration zone in the region of Ceska Lipa, and on which we  began working with Mr. Romig approximately 18 months ago,  continues to be alive. Mr. Romig already has in hand the final  signatures pertaining to the availability of financing and the  first operations could be initiated by the end of this year,"  said Bohuslav Rychtarik, the mayor of Straz pod Ralskem, about  the negotiations.    [hp] At the conference, you met with representatives of  entrepreneurial circles and government organizations. What are  their experiences in revitalizing former military regions?    [Rychtarik] They assured us that the basic condition for  revitalizing military areas is privatization--without  privatization, we cannot move from the spot. The Czech  Government has already created the fundamental conditions. A  budgetary organization has been established for the  privatization of former military areas at Ralsko and Mlada. The  organization is called PRIVUM and a part of the property owned  by the former military area has already been transferred to the  property holdings of Straz pod Ralskem. We have already  negotiated with representatives of PRIVUM and we were very  surprised about how much they were "in the picture" with regard  to the Ralsko area. They are extremely forthcoming and are  developing maximum efforts to see to it that the problems are  finally solved rapidly. We agreed on a precise schedule under  which the various individual facilities will be transferred to  PRIVUM, we know who must do what by when in order for matters to  move forward.    [hp] Did the negotiations with representatives of foreign  firms bring any concrete results?    [Rychtarik] In establishing personal contacts, we realized  that we are not the only ones who must deal with the  revitalization of former military areas. The U.S. Government is  releasing enormous financial resources toward the revitalization  of former military areas. It can afford to do so, much as it can  afford to finance retraining of individuals and provide some  advantages to those who are beginning to operate in former  military areas as entrepreneurs. The Czech Republic, as one of  the countries of the former Eastern bloc, has progressed the  furthest in the privatization of former military territories,  something which was confirmed to us by representatives from  Belarus as well as from Latvia, who are sincerely envious of us.    Revitalization of the Ralsko area was of great interest at  the conference to the Greeks, but, so far, they have not come up  with a specific offer. On the other hand, negotiations involving  Americans look quite promising. Rolls-Royce representatives were  not only representing the world renowned automobile factory at  the conference -- one of the divisions of the company is  oriented toward processing uranium and is focused on ecology.  The Americans were interested in the program for discontinuation  of the extraction of uranium ore. In the immediate future, a  working group from Rolls-Royce is to negotiate the topic with  Eng. J. Makovicka, the director of the DIAMO state enterprise at  Straz pod Ralskem.</p>

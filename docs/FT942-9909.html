			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / SIB orders remedial action on pension sales Life insurance companies should begin at once to identify customers in the categories most at risk of disadvantage from poor advice in the sale of personal pensions, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, said yesterday. In guidance on how to compensate investors who are likely to have lost out, SIB is telling companies to treat as high-priority cases those where the customer has died; has already retired; or was over 50 when the lump sum was transferred out of a former employer's pension into a private plan. The aim in all the categories is that there should be some immediate compensation where the ill effect of a decision to take out a personal pension is already being felt - for example in a lower pension available to someone who has retired, or in the lack of a pension for a dependant who would have been entitled to one under the occupational scheme that was left. Cases identified as where customers opted out of the pension scheme run by their current employers in order to take out a personal pension should also be treated as priorities, the regulator said. SIB's full report on the remedial action companies should take to deal with the effects of personal pension mis-selling is not due to be published until the end of July. It said yesterday, however, that where customers agreed and companies accepted liability, if investors could be returned to the pension schemes they had left this should be done as soon as possible. If there is any dispute about what compensation should be paid, the guidance said, then the question should be put on 'hold' until after the final guidance had been published. The final bill for the industry of compensating victims of poor advice is expected to run into hundreds of million pounds. Yesterday's guidance will be followed next week by publication of a 'checklist' from SIB, advising potential investors what issues they should raise with sales agents and advisers when considering a personal pension. But both publications are behind schedule, raising questions about whether SIB can meet its planned deadline of the end of July for publishing the final guidance. SIB also published yesterday further guidance to companies on how they should conduct future pension transfer business, expanding on earlier advice which, for example, warned of the risks of opt-outs.</p>

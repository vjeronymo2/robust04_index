I recall that throughout  the course of last year we had several "roundtables" and some  very important documents on agreement were signed, but they have  not been carried out and have had no substantive impact on the  political situation. Today there is little correlation between  the authorities and society's political forces. All the changes  to the power structures have no connection with the situation in  parliament, with the positions held by political parties, or  with the demands of the trade unions. That is why the  opposition undoubtedly has an interest in fundamentally  resolving the question of power -- that is, winning the 1996  elections. And, in this sense, a moderate and calm opposition  could have an interest in some kinds of consensual documents so  as to buy time and prevent radicals on both flanks from  destabilizing the situation in the country.</p>

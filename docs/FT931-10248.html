			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Falcon moving to Luxembourg FALCON MINES, the Zimbabwean gold mining group, is moving out of the UK so as not to become liable for UK corporation tax, in particular advance corporation tax on its dividends. The group, which has no operations in the UK, plans a reconstruction and a move to Luxembourg. Until the 1988 Finance Act, companies could be incorporated in the UK without being resident for tax purposes if their operations were overseas. However, that act said such companies would become resident for tax purposes after five years. That provision comes into effect on March 15 this year. Fewer than 20 per cent of Falcon's shares are held in the UK, and the shares are also listed in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Falcon's immediate problem, if it remained in the UK, would be that it would become liable for ACT on dividends paid to all its shareholders and would not be able to recover that tax. At present it has to obtain permission under Zimbabwean exchange controls to take money out of that country to pay dividends to non-Zimbabwean investors. Falcon felt it was unlikely to receive permission to take money out of Zimbabwe to pay UK taxes on dividends paid to shareholders in Zimbabwe. The group is proposing to move its entire assets and undertakings to a new company, Falcon Investments, which will be based in Luxembourg. Under the plan, which is to be put to shareholders at two special meetings, holders will receive one new Falcon Investments share for every 10 Falcon Mines shares held. Falcon Investments shares will be quoted in Luxembourg, as well as Zimbabwe and South Africa, with dealings commencing on March 15. UK investors will be able to trade in Falcon Investments shares in London under Stock Exchange Rule 535 (4) (A). If the proposals are approved, shares in Falcon Mines will cease to trade on March 12 and the company will be wound up.</p>

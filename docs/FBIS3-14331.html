			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Qassis, head of the </F> Palestinian experts' teams in the Palestinian Advisory Group to  the Arab-Israeli talks, in Jerusalem, with Fayiz al-Miliji in  Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar"  program--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Al-Miliji] Good morning Mr. Nabil and welcome  to Voice of the Arabs.    [Qassis] Good morning.    [Al-Miliji] The pressing question now is: Will the PLO  resume the negotiations with Israel before the resolution  providing for international protection in the occupied Arab  territories is implemented?    [Qassis] The Palestinian side has posed certain conditions  for the resumption of talks. They are more than just the  so-called international protection mentioned in the recent  resolution. There are other things that relate to the Israeli  practices at the hands of the occupation troops and the  settlers, as well as the presence of settlements in densely  populated areas. All these things need to be tackled before  negotiations can resume in a meaningful way.    [Al-Miliji] But efforts are now under way to bring the PLO  back to the negotiating table. How far have these efforts gone?    [Qassis] According to the information I have, indeed efforts  are under way, but the Palestinian man in the street wants to  see compliance with the Palestinian requirements before talks  resume. Negotiations for the sake of negotiations is not a  Palestinian demand. We want negotiations that can lead to  positive results in terms of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict and recognizing the rights of the Palestinian people.  There were problems at the talks even before the Hebron  massacre, and the massacre has exacerbated things further and  there is now more determination than ever regarding the need to  tackle the settlement issue properly.    [Al-Miliji] But a delay by the PLO in resuming the talks  could waste what the PLO has gained from its talks with Israel.    [Qassis] What has been gained so far from talks with Israel  is such that if we were to lose it, it would not really amount  to much. [passage omitted]    [Al-Miliji] How did the Palestinian masses receive the  recent  Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre?    [Qassis] With indifference. This is because the resolution  did not tackle the core of the problem.    [Al-Miliji] But it called for protection for the Palestinian  people?    [Qassis] This is not the first time the Security Council has  passed a resolution. What counts in the end is getting  significant protection, not monitoring. We do not want somebody  to monitor and write reports, we want people to prevent the  recurrence of such a massacre. This is what is needed. If the  implementation of the resolution meets this requirement, the  Palestinian people will receive it positively. But the people  cannot be enthusiastic about just the text of a resolution; we  want the resolution to be implemented in a meaningful way.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Miliji] There are reports about renewed clashes in  Hebron; could you tell us about them?    [Qassis] For more than 24 hours, the occupation troops  besieged a densely populated Palestinian area and it was  bombarded.    [Al-Miliji] What for?    [Qassis] Of course we are not in Hebron and do not know if  what the Israeli radio and press are saying is true or not.  However, homes were shelled with military weapons, such  antitank weapons, and I believe four young Palestinian men were  killed. In the meantime, the occupation troops broke into  hospitals and terrified children and old people. A pregnant  woman was martyred. Such Israeli practices leave no room for  optimism regarding the ongoing talks.    [Al-Miliji] Finally, has the Security Council resolution met  your aspirations?    [Qassis] The answer is no.    [Al-Miliji] The PLO is between a rock and a hard place:  either to resume the talks, which may anger the Palestinians in  the territories, or not to resume the talks and thus delay the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. What about  that?    [Qassis] The PLO is the leadership of and part of the  Palestinian people. The PLO does not handle the situation from  the standpoint of pressure from the Palestinian public, because  the PLO represents the Palestinian man in the street. It adopts  positions that suit the Palestinian interests. There is real  doubt about the worthiness of a peace process that does not  tackle the settlements problem. The Palestinian masses'  position on this issue does not differ from the PLO's. This is  a Palestinian position being expressed by the PLO, which  represents the Palestinian people.    [Al-Miliji] So could we say that the Palestinian decision is  not to resume the talks before the necessary protection is  secured for the Palestinians inside the territories?    [Qassis] This is up to the PLO leadership in Tunis to  announce. I am just telling you what the situation is as we see  it here among the Palestinian masses. We have requirements, and  we take these requirements seriously. They are not made just to  score points. It has been said that peace and the settlements  cannot exist side by side, and this has been proved to be  correct. We always said that, and now we see it clearly right  in front of us.    [Al-Miliji] Thank you Mr. Nabil Qassis.    [Qassis] You are welcome.</p>

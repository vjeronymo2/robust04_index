That day, the National Unification Board [NUB] revealed that  the volume of the government-approved North-South trade for 1993  indicates $190.49 million of import and $10.228 million of  export, thus amounting to a total of $206.647 million. This  figure shows six percent decrease from the amount of previous  year of $231.503 million.    The NUB observed that the reduction of North-South trade,  which showed the increase each year, is prompted by strained  North-South relations since North Korea withdrew from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The NUB, however, revealed that  the trade of last December amounted to $40.304 million in 64  cases, showing 8.9 percent increase from the previous month.    In particular, the actual trade amount approved by the  government on processing-for-wage deals was $4.338 million in 43  cases last year, showing an increase by a factor of 7.8 over the  $556,000 in 10 cases in the previous year. The NUB official  noted that this increase indicates a new possibility for  North-South trade.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Bird Hot Line -- A telephone hot line has been established for residents who  spot oil-injured birds. The number, (714) 536-0202, is staffed daily from 7  a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Some birds victimized by the oil spill may be found miles inland, blown there  by strong westerly winds.  </P> <P> Residents who find such birds are urged to call the hot line rather than pick  the bird up -- sick birds might be injured if picked up or transported by  untrained persons.  </P> <P> The state Department of Fish and Game is looking for volunteers to help clean  the birds. The agency is asking for a commitment of at least three days because  of the training involved. Information: (213) 831-4070.  </P> <P> New at the Zoo -- Two adult bald eagles have made their debut in a new exhibit  at the Santa Ana Zoo. The naturalistic space imitates a rocky stream bed  surrounded by forest.  </P> <P> Both eagles are from the Midwest and suffered wing damage in the wild. Zoo  officials say they plan to use the new exhibit to illustrate to visitors the  plight of birds of prey. Illegal hunting, pesticides and loss of habitat have  reduced bald eagle populations, except along the coasts of Alaska and British  Columbia.  </P> <P> More than 100 of the endangered birds died from the effects of the major oil  spill last year off Valdez, Alaska.  </P> <P> Coming Up -- The Wild Mushroom Fair, sponsored by the Los Angeles Mycological  Society, will return to the Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport  Beach on March 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2, with children 12 and  under admitted free. Information: (714) 640-7120.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Zoo celebrates its 38th birthday on March 10, beginning at 11  a.m. Several activities are planned for children and adults. Information: (714)  836-4000.  </P></p>

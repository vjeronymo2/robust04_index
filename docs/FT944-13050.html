			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / RJB to offer miners deal if bid succeeds Mr Richard Budge, the chief executive of RJB Mining, is expected to offer miners a new three-year contract if his Pounds 900m bid to take over British Coal's English mines is successful. Mr Budge says that such a deal would provide greater security for the 7,000 miners he is expected to inherit with the pits. However, another advantage of the offer is that it would supersede the European Union's acquired rights directive - known as Tupe - which covers the transfer. Tupe preserves most aspects of pay conditions - including pensions - and union recognition when a business is transferred to a new owner. It also means that any redundancies will attract the British Coal pay-off of up to Pounds 27,000. Mr Budge says that he is not worried by Tupe and that it has been taken into account in his bid price. Today he will seek to calm anxieties about the transfer before a group of Union of Democratic Mineworkers officials in Mansfield. He will say that he has few ambitions to change working practices. Yet he is known to want to end the incentive bonus scheme which pays a significant minority of miners up to Pounds 1,000 per week. Mr Neal Greatrex, leader of the UDM, which was involved in a rival bid, remains suspicious of Mr Budge: 'He's overstretched himself . . . our legal advice suggests he won't be able to compensate by reducing wages.' Other union leaders such as Mr Doug Bulmer, president of BACM, the colliery managers' unions, are more supportive. Fuel for thought, Page 7 Credibility gap, Page 8</p>

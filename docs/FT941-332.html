			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ciba ready to forge US alliances Ciba, the largest of the big three Swiss drugs companies, said yesterday it would soon sign alliances in the US in response to the changing healthcare environment there. Mr Pierre Douaze, head of Ciba's pharmaceuticals division, said deals could be done with other drugs companies or with organisations closer to the patient, such as drug distributors and health management organisations. The move would be partly in response to the Dollars 6bn acquisition last year by Merck, the biggest US drugs company, of Medco, a drug distributor. That deal was a response to efforts by government and employers to cut healthcare spending by insisting on discounts and buying from groups of companies. Mr Douaze said Ciba was looking at several options and that a decision would be made soon. 'We have to move before all the positions are taken,' he said. Mr Douaze was speaking at the company's annual results presentation, which revealed 1993 post-tax profits up 11.2 per cent to SFr1.78bn (Dollars 1.3bn), compared with figures for 1992 which were restated last summer to conform with international accounting standards. Sales rose to SFr22.65bn, a gain of 2 per cent in constant currency terms. Earnings per share rose to SFr63.8 from SFr56 and the dividend is to be lifted by SFr1 to SFr15 per share. The company has three divisions: healthcare, industry and agriculture. Last year saw healthcare overtake industry to become the companies biggest single division with sales of SFr9.22bn, a rise of 5 per cent on 1992. Much of the gain was the result of a 20 per cent sales increase at Ciba Vision thanks to the popularity of contact lenses. Sales at the industry division, which includes textile dyes, chemicals and plastics, fell 1 per cent to SFr8.61bn. The decline was mostly accounted for by a 21 per cent fall in sales of composite materials to the aerospace industry, hit by defence cuts. Agriculture sales rose 1 per cent to SFr4.8bn, in spite of pressure on the business in Europe, where the Community Agricultural Policy has cut the acreage of land under cultivation. Ciba said the European agricultural products market was unlikely to grow for the next two to three years, but growth would come from Asia and South America. Last year, Ciba switched to guidelines of the International Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc) and revised 1992 group net profit to SFr1.6bn from SFr1.52bn. Lex, Page 22</p>

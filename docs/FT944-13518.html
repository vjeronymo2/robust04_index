			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Local sense The Local Government Commission is to be congratulated for seeing sense at last and drawing back from a wholesale reconstruction of local authorities across England. Its recommendations for nine counties represent a broadly fair balance between the desire of a few towns and cities to break free of their county councils, and the antipathy of the electorate as a whole to further expensive musical chairs in local government. The commission should apply the same principles as it makes final recommendations for the rest of England's counties in the next two months. The duty will then be on Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to abandon hopes for introducing single-tier authorities where they are not strongly desired by the voters. Mr Gummer's decision this week to reject proposals from the commission to abolish North Yorkshire and Somerset county councils is a clear sign that he has already done so. He could go one better and reject any further commission proposals to abolish counties outright. On the basis of the public consultation, it is hard to justify abolishing any counties beyond the two - Avon and Humberside, both spawned by the last reorganisation in 1974 - which he agreed to scrap yesterday. Once the present review is completed, several lessons need to be learnt for the future. On the positive side, the effort made by the commission to gauge public opinion before publishing firm decisions was commendable, and appears to have been vital in avoiding a shambolic conclusion. The response to the postal referendums was for the most part derisory; but this itself reflected the absence of popular enthusiasm for reform. The wider use of local referendums is to be encouraged. There is, however, a debit side. No review process was established before the government sought to impose single-tier authorities in Wales and Scotland. What do people think there? And in England, the review has done little to revitalise local democracy. With resentment about government-by-quango growing, the malaise in local government will have to be addressed by the new commission on standards in public life.</p>

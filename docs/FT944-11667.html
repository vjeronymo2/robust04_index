			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand aims to set up futures exchange Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission wants to see a financial futures exchange established in Bangkok to complement the development of domestic equity and debt markets, a senior official said. Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary-general, said a report commissioned by the SEC from the US consultants Powers Research recommended the introduction of derivatives as a means of aiding capital formation, improving efficiency in the allocation of savings and strengthening the financial system. Legislation has been drafted and is being studied by US regulatory authorities and the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, he said. The hard task now was to convince the government against a backdrop of international concern over the use of derivatives and the losses incurred in this area by large companies such as Procter and Gamble. While brokers expect the exchange to be set up within a couple of years, they say an awkward precondition, which is flagged in the consultants' report, is the need for the government to legitimise short-selling of equities in the cash market. At present this is banned as part of official efforts to prevent artificial manipulation of prices. Unless the government goes ahead, however, derivative markets for Thai financial instruments will simply be established offshore. Indeed, brokers are already working on such products. The report said a stock index contract should be the first product developed, followed by a short-term interest rate contract and foreign exchange contracts for the D-Mark and yen against the baht. A long-term bond contract should only be introduced after the cash market is more fully established, it said. Mr Prasarn said that the futures market would enable institutions to hedge their positions, adding depth to the cash markets. The consultants' report called, however, for a strong self-regulatory approach, coupled with 'a broad and robust training and educational programme' for all participants. It would help the exchange if its products were declared eligible investments by regulators abroad, especially in the US and Europe, it said.</p>

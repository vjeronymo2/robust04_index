			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Airbus instrument linked to disaster A report into last year's crash of an Airbus A320 in eastern France, published yesterday, blamed a 'complex chain of causes' and made more than 30 recommendations. These included a modification to the design of one instrument, and measures to strengthen cross-checking of information by the flight crew. Airbus Industrie said it had already introduced a modification to the layout of the flight control unit in new A320s and had contacted airlines using the old layout about plans to update them. The report into the accident, in which 87 people died, said the aircraft was descending four times faster than usual as it prepared to land at Strasbourg. Several hypotheses were advanced to explain the rapid descent. These included human error, possibly because the pilot had made a mistake in setting the descent mode of the aircraft, or a technical fault in the controls which change descent modes. In each hypothesis, however, the report said 'an accident was possible because the crew were unaware of the anomaly in the descent path'. Airbus said the modifications to the flight deck design concerned the display of descent modes.</p>

[Begin recording] [Calderon] We have maintained the best  relations with President Endara's government. Our people have  always maintained good relations in the past and, undoubtably,  will continue to do so in the future with the new Costa Rican  president as of May and with whomever you elect to govern Panama  during the 8 May elections.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the status of bilateral  trade  between Panama and Costa Rica? Is there anything new?    [Calderon] There is nothing new. Very small differences have  appeared regarding certain products, but through dialogue, as we  have always done, Panama and Costa Rica have managed to reach an  agreement and resolve our differences.

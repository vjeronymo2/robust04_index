			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Bentsen seeks to dilute Gore attack on IMF role in Russia Senior US government officials have sought to dilute criticism of the International Monetary Fund over its policy on Russian economic reform following a scathing attack last week by Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president. Mr Gore, who left Moscow on Saturday night after an eight-day visit, had urged the IMF board to pay more attention to the hardship in Russia caused by reform. But in Washington yesterday, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said international financial institutions had to retain some conditions on assistance to Russia 'to keep the pressure on the reformers'. He insisted the blame for Russia's problems could not be placed on efforts to reform too fast. 'I don't believe that when you are having 10 to 20 per cent inflation a month that means that you are having excessive reform,' Mr Bentsen said. Another senior US official cautioned against making the IMF a scapegoat for the inability of the Russian government to implement reform. 'Russia's economic problems have much more to do with too little reform than too much,' he said. However, as Mr Gore returned to Washington, officials travelling with the vice-president renewed the attack, alleging the IMF's approach had been inadequate in the run-up to the Russian elections, in which anti-reform parties won a large vote. One official with the vice-president said: 'Setting extremely ambitious macro-economic targets and using the achievement of these targets as a yes/no, do or no-do switch for the release of western aid - and then watching vigorous efforts fall just short of the target set is insufficient.' On Saturday, Mr Gore won a sympathetic hearing during talks in Germany with chancellor Helmut Kohl, although Bonn did not join his call for a shift in the IMF's strategy. The IMF says there is no Russian budget for 1994 and the only statement on economic policy has come from Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. Mr Chernomyrdin said at the weekend that Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, as architect of President Yeltsin's radical market reforms, bore some blame for the election setback, Reuter reports from Moscow. He told Trud newspaper that Mr Gaidar and Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, 'should think it over hard'. Oil-rich infants vulnerable to Moscow bullying, Page 3</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME, BEATHARD WASN'T KIDDING WHEN HE SAID HE WAS DONE  </P> <P> At 52, Bobby Beathard and the Washington Redskins are the same age. This is  significant, because the unassuming genius suddenly calling it a career here  has had more impact on the Redskins than anyone since the fellow who brought  them here.  </P> <P> George Preston Marshall gave the Redskins life in Washington, 20 days after  Beathard was born. Sonny Jurgensen gave them style. Vince Lombardi gave them  credibility. Sammy Baugh gave them all-around excellence that never has been --  and may never be -- equaled.  </P> <P> George Allen in 1972 took the Redskins to a plateau, the National Football  League title game, unscaled in 27 years. Beathard in the 1980s got them there  three times -- and to the absolute peak twice.  </P> <P> Joe Gibbs was the coach of those two Super Bowl champs. Beathard hired Gibbs --  and provided the players Allen had not left behind after his own hasty  departure in 1978.  </P> <P> Although Jack Kent Cooke gave Beathard the thickest wad of money with which to  operate in the NFL, he did not hire him. Proving his own brilliance, Cooke  trusted Beathard's judgment on Gibbs and lesser matters.  </P> <P> Perhaps if Cooke or Gibbs or a chorus of Redskin fans had whispered that  lately, Beathard might have stayed. Confident to the point of being offensive  in his area of near-unique expertise, Beathard also seems to need ego-stroking  in a way the owner and coach either could not -- or would not -- do this time.  </P> <P> Lots of us snapped to attention when stories of Beathard's dissatisfaction and  possible departure started to surface a few weeks ago. Then we remembered  similar flurries when his contract was being negotiated other times during his  11 years with the Redskins.  </P> <P> Smugly, we chuckled: Bobby's crying wolf again. Or Chargers. Why would he jog  away from the most free spending and creative owner in the league? And a coach  second only to Beathard's previous boss, Don Shula, after Tom Landry was  blind-sided off the sidelines.  </P> <P> Most likely, the seesaw of power Beathard and Gibbs supposedly have balanced  since 1981 had tilted inexorably the coach's way. Even the strongest general  managers usually lose to successful and charismatic coaches.  </P> <P> Conflict between strong-willed general managers and coaches is almost  unavoidable. Loyalty is mainly why. Any coach who wins as grandly as Gibbs has  over a period of time develops knot-tight ties, to a style of play and to  players heroic in ways often obvious only to him.  </P> <P> The general manager must be more restless and daring, for he literally scouts  the future. Youth and promise excite him. And when a Beathard sees one of his  young and scar-free behemoths losing a roster battle to some graying and  stitched geezer, he frequently cries: "You've got to be kidding!"  </P> <P> Beathard very likely never had so much fun, in a pure-scouting sense, as during  the player strike two years ago. Seat-of-the-pants football is what it was.  Only teams with the smartest management, backed by lots of money, survived.  </P> <P> The replacement team Beathard assembled and Gibbs taught was unbeaten in three  games -- and helped vault the regular team into the playoffs and that Super  Bowl rout.  </P> <P> Maybe Beathard also needs some time to determine priorities, a football  sabbatical. After a naturally restless man has put teams together in about  every way possible, some recharging may be in order.  </P> <P> If Beathard does stay away a while, this will have been a whopper of a  leave-taking time in the NFL. The architects of five Super Bowl winners in the  1980s, Bill Walsh and Beathard, stepping aside; the founders and caretakers of  America's Team, Tom and Tex and Gil, cast aside by a grindstone Cowboy. For  Pete's sake, even Rozelle is gone.  </P> <P> The good work Beathard and his men do is done mostly alone and is always  tiring. They travel thousands of miles, eat dozens of lousy meals and overturn  hundreds of fool's-gold players to mine one genuine gem.  </P> <P> Beathard's stage has been a portable podium at Redskin Park on draft day, when  he tests his courage and wits and bedazzles lots of the league. Routinely, he  will trade a future No. 1 draft choice to select a Russ Grimm in the third  round (1981), or fare far better in later rounds than he does in the second.  </P> <P> When George Allen left the Redskins, Washingtonians assumed they would never  see such a trade-mad man again. Beathard succeeded him -- and proceeded to open  an even more bustling swap shop.  </P> <P> Also, Allen prided himself on struggling through a couple of miles after  practice on a track he had specially built inside Redskin Park. The much  younger Beathard clips off eight to 12 miles daily and competes in marathons.  </P> <P> Beathard won a power struggle with coach Jack Pardee in 1980, then was  responsible for building and overseeing a team second only to the 49ers for  Super Bowl success the next nine years.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Latest chapter in catalogue of revamps - The planned changes at US retailer Sears, Roebuck ED BRENNAN, chairman of Sears, Roebuck, was struggling to explain how the retailing and financial services giant could overhaul its lossmaking catalogue business. 'Trying to outline the catalogue strategy in three simple sentences is tough,' he admitted wearily. That was a year ago. This week, Sears' revised strategy could be summed up in three words: catalogue is axed. Over the next 12 months, the Chicago-based group will close down the division on which the company's fortunes were founded, and snuff out a product that for much of the 20th century has symbolised 'middle America'. Even today, the Sears catalogue - a 1,600-page tome produced twice a year - circulates to 14m households and produces annual sales of Dollars 3.3bn. The decision will cost 3,400 full-time and 16,500 part-time jobs, and lead to a Dollars 800m restructuring charge. It will be accompanied by the closure of 113 smaller Sears department stores; the disposal of 35 specialist fashion shops; and a host of detailed moves designed to streamline other parts of the retail business. In total, 52,000 jobs will go (16,000 full-time and 36,000 part-time); about 12 per cent of the group's revenue base will be shed; and a Dollars 1.7bn charge incurred to fund the overhaul. But, radical though these measures appear, a big question remains: can Sears really become a competitive force in today's US retail environment, or has the cost-base become so unwieldy, and its image so tired, that increasingly-aggressive competitors have an unassailable advantage? Sears' problems have been well-aired - not least by dissatisfied shareholders, who have pushed for measures ranging from the demerger of the financial services subsidiaries to annual election of all directors. The common perception is that Sears is a US behemoth, which allowed its number one position in the US retail sector to slip away in the 1980s. Instead of focusing on the retail interests, critics claim, Sears diversified into financial services. It added brokerage and mortgage operations to its Allstate insurance business. With management's attention diverted, core retail operations became bureaucratic and uncompetitive. No one could accuse Sears of ignoring these attacks. Over the past five years, it has announced numerous revamps and restructurings. Since the beginning of 1991, for example, around 48,000 jobs have been shed (although, prior to this week's announcement, Sears still employed 350,000). A 'power-format' strategy has been fed into many of the 850-plus department stores. This has involved dividing store space between seven distinct merchandise areas - appliances, home furnishings, women's fashions and so on  -and reorganising the group's unwieldy buyer system. Even on the catalogue front, there were strenuous efforts to streamline distribution and update sales techniques. But by mid-1992, few signs of improved performance from the merchandise division had emerged. Frustration resurfaced at the annual meeting in May, and since then the pace of change has accelerated. First, Sears added new board directors, including Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris. Then, in September, it announced it would divest much of its financial services empire, a move still scheduled for mid-1993. A month later, the company called in Mr Arthur Martinez, formerly finance director at Saks Fifth Avenue, to run its retail operations. (Previously, Mr Brennan had held this position, along with the roles of chairman and overall chief executive for the group.) There is no doubt that this week's announcement - the first major development under the Martinez regime - represents the most significant restructuring yet at Sears. Shutting down the catalogue operation is an emotional wrench, but it also staunches annual losses of around Dollars 135m to Dollars 175m. The stores which are closing are among the least profitable in the group. Overall, Sears claims these moves should add Dollars 300m annually to its bottom line. At least some shareholders are pleased. The powerful California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the most prominent critics in the past, said the latest cuts appeared to signal 'a more focused approach, and should give the group a more spritely image.' That said, the numbers still need to be seen in perspective. In 1991, Sears made a net profit of just Dollars 90m from its US merchandise operations, on sales of Dollars 24.8bn. (Credit operations then earned Dollars 394m, taking the merchandise group profit total to Dollars 486m.) Some analysts question whether all the latest cost-savings will fall directly to the bottom line; even if they do, the return on sales is scarcely going to be stellar. Moreover, given the emphasis in the US on 'value' shopping - led by the discount store operators and the ultra low-cost warehouse clubs - it is questionable whether Sears' cost base, albeit reduced, permits it to compete effectively. In 1991, for example, Sears' selling, general and administrative expenses per dollar of sales was around 29 cents. At Wal-Mart and K mart, the two biggest discount store operators, the figures were 15.2 cents and 21.2 cents respectively. Although Sears offers back-up services, which inflate its expenses base, and the mix of goods sold is different, even Mr Brennan concedes the discrepancy is too wide. Finally, analysts need convincing the 'new' Sears can post sustained sales growth. Domestic same-store sales gains did improve last autumn, and in December alone the company reported an 8.2 per cent advance. However, pundits point out this was partly due to heavy promotional activity, and the sale gains probably came at cost of some profits in the Brand Central (electronics) and home-furnishings departments. The gain, moreover, was merely in line with progress made by other big store chains. In short, Sears' latest restructuring is being interpreted as a necessary step, rather than one which spells a rebirth. 'It will help them to perform better, to a minimally acceptable standard,' says Ms Dorothy Lakner, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 'But whether it fundamentally improves their position longer-term remains to be seen'.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> SUSPECTED SKINHEADS SOUGHT IN STABBING  </P> <P> Police are looking for three people, believed to be members of a white  supremacist group, in connection with the stabbing of a local man, police said  Monday.  </P> <P> Timothy Wayne Mudd, 21, of San Clemente, underwent emergency surgery late  Saturday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo for a  knife wound to his abdomen, a hospital spokesperson said.  </P> <P> Mudd was stabbed during a confrontation between members of two alleged skinhead  gangs in the parking lot of a San Clemente restaurant, Police Sgt. Richard  Downing said.  </P> <P> "Right now, we believe this is gang-related," he said.  </P> <P> The stabbing occurred at about 10:30 p.m. as Mudd and Jay Brody, 18, also of  San Clemente, were walking to Sonny's Pizza in the 400 block of North El Camino  Real.  </P> <P> When somebody in a passing car yelled "O.C. Skins," the name of a skinhead  group in Orange, Downing said, Brody shouted back the name of another Orange  County-based skinhead group.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the driver of the car pulled into the parking lot of the Italian  restaurant, where three men jumped out and began attacking the San Clemente  residents. One of them stabbed Mudd, and the group fled before police arrived,  Downing said. Police have no suspects.  </P> <P> Mudd is in fair condition while Brody suffered minor cuts and bruises, Downing  said.FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

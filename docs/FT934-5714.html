			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / How news of contacts spread to other parties Knowledge of the British government's contacts with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, over the past three years appears to have extended to the Irish government, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), although not all became aware at the same time. Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein chief of staff, said in a BBC TV interview yesterday that the first meeting, in September 1990, lasted three hours with representatives of the Foreign Office, at the request of the British government. This led subsequently to 'fairly intense contact between the British government representatives and ourselves and culminated this year in intensive contacts', he said. He said that 'face-to-face' dialogue was halted in July this year at the time of the Maastricht vote, because of an agreement between the government and the UUP. That contact had since continued 'on a weekly basis and sometimes on a daily basis'. Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy leader of the UUP, said yesterday: 'It is my understanding that for some time the IRA has been talking about a ceasefire and has spelt out its price for that.' He said that the UUP knew these contacts had been taking place since last March, and that through 'ongoing liaison' with the government 'by June we suspected what was happening'. It was then that Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, 'made his feelings known to the prime minister,' he said, and contact with Mr McGuinness was broken before the Maastricht vote in July. Mr Maginnis said the UUP's position since then has been to offer a seat at the negotiating table to Sinn Fein in return for a verifiable cessation of violence. 'We didn't stick our necks out without knowing what we are dealing with,' he said. The Rev William McCrea DUP MP for Mid-Ulster, said yesterday that his party had had 'documentary evidence' of the British government-IRA contacts for the past four weeks. Sinn Fein sources say that it was due to the leaks of these talks by unionist politicians that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, decided to make the contacts public two weeks ago, and after Mr Major had said that it 'would turn his stomach' to talk to the IRA. The Irish government was yesterday playing down its own knowledge of the contacts. A government spokesman said only: 'It is up to the parties concerned to comment.' However, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted in the Dail earlier this month that his government had its own contacts with Sinn Fein. This was later confirmed by Mr Brian Lenihan, the chairman of the Dial's foreign affairs committee. A week ago Mr Lenihan was quoted in a Dublin weekly newspaper as saying that the Irish government had contacts with Sinn Fein 'through intermediaries' and that it had been aware for some time of similar contacts by the British government. 'Contact has been going on for months . . . The contact is not immediate but the government is aware that contacts are made. Messages are received and are passed on. If we are to achieve peace, these contacts are necessary,' he said. Mr Lenihan, who is a senior figure in the governing Fianna Fail party, said that 'We must realise the importance of contact between the two governments on the one hand and paramilitaries on the other. This does not put obstacles in the way of the constitutional parties. In fact, the two efforts complement each other . . . History is a record of coming to terms with terrorists and getting them to embrace the democratic process.'</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): World offers democracy a helping hand Never has an election in Africa, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, been so closely monitored and observed. When South Africa's 22.7m voters go to the polls this week they will do so under the scrutiny of thousands of foreigners in an exercise managed by more than 200,000 local officials and volunteers, and under the protective eye of at least 100,000 police, soldiers and reservists, erstwhile defenders of apartheid now helping play midwife to democracy. For some of the foreign participants, it is the culmination of months of involvement, working behind the scenes as technical advisers. And for some it has been a lonely, sometimes tricky, experience in the field; in northern Natal or eastern Transvaal as potential targets of Zulus, who once threatened a boycott but who are now enthusiastic participants, or resentful right wingers. Most of the publicity, however, focuses on democracy's day-trippers  - famous names jetting in for the final days, the culmination of a process that got under way more than four years ago when Mr Nelson Mandela was set free. The world's political has-beens, would-bes, wannabes and may-yet-bes  - from former US presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson to ex-British Labour party leader Neil Kinnock  - are here to pronounce. The luminaries include ex-Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda, staunch advocate of a one-party state during his disastrous 20-year reign, but now a reborn democrat preaching the merits of a justiciable bill of rights and multi-party democracy. The delegation from the Organisation of African Unity, whose member states' record on democracy is hardly more edifying that South Africa's National party, includes in its ranks two incongruous arbiters of fair play. One headed his country's electoral commission, his integrity apparently unimpaired by the fact that the ruling party, which went on to win an election riddled by malpractice, had written off his debts to a state-controlled bank. Another is named in an official report suggesting that he might be able to help with inquiries into the murder of leading members of the country's judiciary. But day-trippers aside, the bulk of the men and women in the field have been doing a valuable, sometimes dangerous job, their presence alone making potential trouble-makers think twice and reassuring voters who are nervous about intimidation. They form an army  - or at least a couple of battalions  - of overseers who have flown in from around the world. Leading the field is the 2,000-strong United Nations observer mission which is co-ordinating the exercise, and the 50-strong OAU team. Add to this a further 600 independent observers from UN member states, about 2,000 observers from assorted non-governmental organisations, and a couple of thousand reporters, camera crews and photographers, and South Africa's voters will be grateful to find sanctuary in the privacy of the polling booth. The exercise represents the largest single deployment of UN monitors, some 1,500 from more than 80 countries, equipped with blue vests, caps, the UNOMSA acronym and expressions of determined neutrality. Britain's Liberal Democrat MP, Sir David Steel, the Belgian Christian Democrat Wilfred Martens and French socialist Jean-Pierre Cot lead the team of 300 European parliamentarians. Most of these onlookers have remained silent during the process, accepting without public comment the imposition of a state of emergency in Natal, refusing to comment on detentions or cases of intimidation. As Prof Jacob Ruiter, spokesman for the European Union monitors, said last week in response to questions about detentions: 'I have no comment. We are here only as observers.' It would take a catastrophe, however, before the body at the heart of the election organisation would be prepared to declare that the election had not been 'substantially free and fair'. From its inception in December 1993 with a handful of staff, South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) now employs more than 200,000 South Africans to cater for the millions of voters, many casting ballots for the first time in 9,000 polling stations. Mr Johann Kriegler, chairman of the Commission, carries the responsibility for administering the election and ultimately determining whether polling has been acceptable. He seemed to have ruled out an adverse decision from an early stage. 'Should we come, heaven forbid, to the conclusion that we cannot so certify, our country will be plunged into disaster,' he said in February. 'Self-evidently,' he continued, 'that is a result which we will strain to avoid with all we can muster.' But to South Africa's and the world's overwhelming relief, the disaster that could have been brought about by political violence or sabotage looks to have been averted. As one foreign observer put it: 'So far, so miraculous.'</p>

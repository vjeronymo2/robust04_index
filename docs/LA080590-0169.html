			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY ARE LATINOS DESCRIBED AS MILITANTS? WOULD BLACKS HAVE BEEN LABELED THAT  WAY?  </P> <P> I was shocked by the use of the term "militant" in reference to Latinos in  Harry Bernstein's July 17 Labor column, "Illegal Alien Law Is Here to Stay."  </P> <P> What made these Latinos "militant?" Were they holding hostages? Were they  uncivil in pressing their legitimate concerns? Or is it the mere fact that  these Latinos pressed for agendas that might force the NAACP to consider issues  outside African-American concerns?  </P> <P> The Eastern media have always had problems reporting on issues affecting the  diverse Latino community. But how could The Times, in a city with a large  Latino community, be so insensitive that it would call mainstream politicians  "militant?" You can bet that the same insult would not be visited on  African-Americans.  </P> <P> RALPH M. CASILLAS  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fed concern holds Dow to narrow gain Wall Street US share prices ended flat to lower in thin trading yesterday as traders and investors nervously awaited the outcome of the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.83 at 3,652.48, well off a high for the day of 3,667.70. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.17 firmer at 446.37, while the American Stock Exchange composite lost 1.02 at 423.70 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 3.26 to 703.59. Trading volume on the New York SE was 195.4m shares. Share prices opened weaker across the board, with the Dow falling 10 points in early trading as investor concern surfaced that the FOMC, which was due to start its meeting in the afternoon, might vote to raise interest rates to protect the dollar. In recent days the US currency has fallen to new post-1945 lows against the Japanese yen. The initial equity market decline, however, was not sustained, and prices quickly moved into positive territory, aided by the stability of the dollar, which held its own against the yen. Stock market sentiment was also buoyed by a modest firming in bond prices, and by a growing feeling among economists that the FOMC would not push up interest rates just to protect the ailing dollar. Economists said that the Fed would be more likely to raise rates if there were fresh evidence of an overheating economy. The fact that this evidence may come on Friday, when the June employment report is published, ensured that yesterday's gains in stock prices were short-lived. In fact, demand was so spotty that secondary indices such as the Russell 2000 small-cap index, and the Amex and the Nasdaq composites, remained lower for most of the day. Among individual stocks, Texaco stood out, rising almost Dollars 2 before ending Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 60 7/8 in busy trading after the oil group announced a significant restructuring that will include the sale of more than half of its US oilfields and a reduction in its worldwide workforce of about 2,500 within a year. The strength in Texaco shares provided the rest of the oil sector with a lift. Mobil rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 , Phillips Petroleum Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 33, Amoco Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 and Chevron Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 7/8 . The exception was Exxon, which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 7/8 . Constituents of the Dow were mixed, with some struggling to hold on to early gains. IBM, which rose Dollars  5/8 at one point, ended Dollars 3/4 down at Dollars 56 1/4 , but General Electric finished Dollars  5/8 up at Dollars 47 and Philip Morris Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 52 3/8 , all in heavy trading. Sony climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 62 7/8 on news that because of strong demand the UK manufacturing arm of the Japanese electronics and entertainment group will be raising production of cathode ray tubes by 50 per cent later this year. On the Nasdaq market, news of a merger between two computer networking groups - WellFleet Communications and SynOptics Communications - did not go down well with investors. WellFleet fell Dollars 5 3/16 to Dollars 20 1/16 and SynOptics lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 5/8 . Canada The Toronto market ended with no clear trend after cautious trade as players awaited news on the direction of US interest rates. The Bank of Canada's bank rate fell a greater than expected 30 basis points to 6.62 per cent in its weekly setting, but the Canadian dollar closed only modestly lower at 72.10 US cents from Monday's 72.17 US cents. The TSE 300 composite index showed no change on the day at 4,053.6, while falls narrowly led rises by 393 to 333 after light volume of 45.1m shares valued at CDollars 505m. Eight of the 14 sub-groups were lower, led by golds, off 1.7 per cent as the bullion price slipped USDollars 1 an ounce to USDollars 385.95 in New York. The transportation sector showed a gain of 1.0 per cent. Financial services, mining and energy also finished higher.</p>

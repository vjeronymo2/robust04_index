			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Short Brothers to shed 429 jobs Short Brothers, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, announced yesterday it was shedding 429 jobs after a review of manpower, Our Belfast Correspondent writes. The company blames the redundancies on continuing financial problems in the industry and cuts in defence spending worldwide. Taken together, these trends have led to significant reductions in the aircraft, aircraft engine and defence programmes of many of Shorts' biggest customers. Shorts regretted the impact of the cuts on its workforce but was optimistic about job prospects for 1994. The company, which is part of the Canadian transportation group Bombardier, is Ulster's largest private employer, with just under 8,000 workers.</p>

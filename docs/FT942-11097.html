			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / CBI warns on pension reform The Confederation of British Industry has warned that employers may abandon salary schemes that link benefits to leaving salaries if the government insists on implementing some of the main safeguards for occupational pensions. Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI, yesterday told a pensions seminar that rules recommended by the Goode committee on occupational pension law reform would raise costs significantly for employers. He complained specifically of requirements for minimum member representation on boards of trustees, an industry-funded compensation scheme and most importantly, minimum solvency standards for schemes. However, Mr Gilbert conceded that only 20 per cent of chief executives surveyed by the CBI said they intended to switch to money purchase from final-salary schemes if they 'looked likely to fall foul of a minimum solvency standard'. In money purchase schemes employers and employees contribute a set amount by contractual arrangement and all funds are deemed to belong to the employee. About 33 per cent of executives surveyed would increase scheme funding while another 33 per cent said they would alter their investment strategy. Because UK pension schemes invest an average of 80 per cent of assets in equities,the introduction of a minimum solvency standard might prompt some schemes to shift investment into lower-yielding gilts, increasing funding costs.</p>

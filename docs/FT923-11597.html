			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Indonesia tries to reduce chaos on roads INDONESIA has passed a law implementing stringent traffic regulations. With apparent disregard for Indonesia's per capita income - about Rupiah1.2m (Dollars 600) a year - even the smallest traffic offence could cost motorists a year's salary or several months in jail. Jakarta abounds with anarchic driving: leave the smallest gap between two speeding cars and a third will nose its way in; motor cyclists, often without helmets, career down dual carriage ways in the wrong direction to beat the traffic. When the new regulations come into force in September not wearing a motorcycle helmet will carry a fine of up to Rp1m; jumping a red light, up to Rp2m; and an expired licence could send the driver to jail for six months or a lead to a fine of Rp6m. Motorists say the new regulations are unjustly harsh. Many cars, including most of Jakarta's taxis, lack seat belts but not wearing one could cost you Rp3m. The new decree has led to protests from university students and highlighted the weakness of Indonesia's law-making process. Mr Ismail Saleh, the minister of justice, has said the proposals, drawn up by civil servants, were not passed through his office, breaking usual procedure. Advocates of the bill point out that anything which reduces road deaths  - an estimated 10,000 people are killed in Indonesia each year in traffic accidents - should be welcomed.</p>

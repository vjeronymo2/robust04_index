			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Bardin, Konstantin Smirnov report: "Moscow Intends </F> To Take Control of Oil Export From the CIS"]    [Text] In relations between Russian and Kazakhstan, there  are no problems that could prevent the process of their  integration, primarily economic. This was announced yesterday  by Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev at a press  conference in Moscow. He also said the republic is ready to  consider the question of Russia's participation in developing  and transporting Kazakhstan oil.    In spite of the upbeat assessments made at the press  conference, Russian-Kazakhstan economic relations have two sore  points. These are Baykonur and the development of the Caspian  shelf. More broadly, this means the problem of oil deliveries  from the Caspian region.    In the Russian-Kazakhstan litigation around Baykonur, a new  party has emerged: the Lockheed Corporation. It is interested  in the program of Russian commercial space launches. First, the  corporation produces satellites that are launched. Second,  under a contract with NASA, it is one of the main contractors  for manufacturing the Alfa station, and this project is directly  related to launches from Baykonur. Therefore, in its struggle  for the cosmodrome, Russia can acquire a strong ally and,  judging by information from confidential sources in the Russian  Government, a joint team is being formed with Lockheed.    Whereas the situation around Baykonur has become rather  commonplace, Moscow has not raised the issue of the Caspian  until recently. On 2 June Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the  Foreign Affairs Ministry Press and Information Service, stated  that his department had presented the British embassy with an  official note. It says that Russia deems invalid any agreements  connected with developing mineral resources in the Caspian Sea  basin that have not been approved by Russia and other countries  of the basin. This rigid demand is substantiated by the sea's  inland ecological regime.    Thereby Russia confirms its intention directly to  participate  in projects that are being implemented in Kazakhstan and  Azerbaijan. The Kazakhstan projects are Tengiz and Kaspshelf,  and in Azerbaijan there is a similar project to produce oil on  the Azerbaijan shelf of the Caspian. The note was sent to Great  Britain because a leading role in all the projects belongs to  British Petroleum.    So far Russia, through Lukoil, directly participates in the  Azerbaijan project. Lukoil holds 10 percent of the stock;  Azerbaijan, 30 percent, and the rest is controlled by a  consortium of Western firms.    Russia, jointly with Kazakhstan and Oman, participates in  the  Caspian pipeline consortium on a parity basis.    The best possible option for Russia would be transportation  of Azerbaijan oil through the Caspian pipeline. On the other  hand, Russia is ready to render Azerbaijan assistance in  building oil pipelines through Turkey or Iran. In any event,  Russia's share in the Azerbaijan project should increase.  Russia's ultimate goal, diplomatically covered up by references  to ecology, is apparently to preserve control of the oil export  from this largest non-Russian oil producing region in the CIS.  In all probability, this idea was also maintained by Fuel and  Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik at the 14th International Oil  Congress in Norway. Russia has officially favored accession to  the European Energy Charter. This idea has not been approved  yet because the West is not ready to lift restrictions on  Russian oil in Europe.</p>

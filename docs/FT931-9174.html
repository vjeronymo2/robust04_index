			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Alcatel wins Dollars 400m Chinese contracts ALCATEL, the French telecommunications equipment group, has won contracts worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 282m) in China through its Spanish and Norwegian subsidiaries. The contracts have been signed despite strained Sino-French trade relations following the sale last year of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters to Taiwan. Two months ago China ordered France to close a consulate in Guangzhou province and then banned French companies from tendering for a Dollars 1bn subway contract in the region. Alcatel is the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier and part of the Alcatel-Alsthom industrial group. The contracts involve Alcatel Standard Electrica, its Spanish subsidiary, in two joint ventures with China. One will set up a plant in Chengdu, Sichuan, to produce voice and data transmission equipment. The second, at Wuhan in the Hubei region, will make equipment for telephone exchanges. Alcatel Standard Electrica and Alcatel Telecom Norway, the Norwegian subsidiary, have also won contracts to supply more than 2m lines of digital switching in China during the mid-1990s. The Alcatel group already has substantial interests in China, where it supplies 40 per cent of all digital telephone switching equipment.</p>

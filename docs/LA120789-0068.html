			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: WHEN YOU'RE UNSURE WHAT TO GIVE  </P> <P> It might seem to be an impossible task to buy a gift for a wine lover,  especially if you know little about wine and can't figure out what wine to get  that will be appreciated.  </P> <P> The solution, then, is to avoid buying wine at all and instead go after wine  gifts that are longer lasting and that any wine lover would covet. This  includes wine glasses (wine people never have enough glassware), decanters,  corkscrews and especially books.  </P> <P> Of course, if you know a bit about wine and would like to give wine as a gift,  it is appropriate, especially at this festive time of year when wine is the  favorite liquid gift (merchants say they make about 25% of their annual wine  sales during the period from Thanksgiving through Dec. 31).  </P> <P> When selecting a wine to present as a gift, keep these suggestions in mind:  </P> <P>  -- Try to find something you know well (not just something you've read about),  something you've tasted and can vouch for. Or something that is highly  recommended by a merchant for either value or panache.  </P> <P>  -- Aim for a wine that is not run-of-the-mill stuff that any wine shop will  carry. Such California wine brands as Dunn, Forman, Woltner, Diamond Creek,  Duckhorn, or Spottswoode are prized by collectors and even if a collector has a  case of one of these, an extra bottle is always welcome.  </P> <P>  -- Magnums of red wine, which are not common, are an especially nice gift for  the wine collector with a cellar, and some specialty wine shops carry a line of  magnums. Call a local wine shop to see which magnums are available.  </P> <P>  -- Older wines that are no longer commercially available are good ideas, and a  number of wine shops keep a small selection of older wines. Often, prices  aren't as high as you might think.  </P> <P>  -- Wine lovers usually are lovers of great distilled spirits too, and  occasionally a bottle of a special Cognac, single-malt Scotch, grappa or  Armagnac can be a fast solution. These products are not vintage-dated so you  need no special knowledge to buy them. Wally's in Westwood and the Flask in  Studio City have large selections of grappa and single-malt Scotch (Wally's  boasts more than 50 different grappas).  </P> <P>  -- Vintage Port and Sauternes are great dessert wines that wine lovers  treasure, though they rarely buy enough of them.  </P> <P> The non-wine gifts for the wine lover may be bought in any wine shop, and many  department stores carry a range of vinous gifts. But there are pitfalls, so I  suggest the following as possible gifts that wine lovers would appreciate. The  recommendations here are listed from $5 to $150 in ascending order.  </P> <P> $5 to Keeping an opened bottle of wine fresh is difficult. Once the cork is  pulled, all wine begins to deteriorate through oxidation. To limit the  oxidation, it's best to recork the wine immediately and refrigerate it (thus  slowing down the chemical reaction).  </P> <P> I do not recommend that wine be frozen to keep it fresh, as I have read in some  books and magazines. The act of freezing a wine will actually accelerate the  oxygenation of the wine and cause it to lose too much of its bouquet.  </P> <P> If you can take the remainder of a bottle and place it in a smaller bottle that  has no air between the wine and the cork or cap, that works best. Failing that,  use an inert gas to fill the original wine bottle.  </P> <P> A number of companies put out cans of inert gas, and I have tried many of them.  All work to some degree, but the best one I've tested is Private Preserve,  which is essentially a nitrogen sparge for the bottle. A couple of squirts from  the can and you can safely recork the bottle for weeks. (I tested a half bottle  of Cabernet and left it six months and the wine was still fine when I finally  reopened it.)  </P> <P> Getting the top of the foil off a bottle of wine can be messy, especially if  the wine is an older bottle and the foil is welded to the glass by residue from  the cork.  </P> <P> The best gadget invented to help you get that top part of the foil removed is  called the Hallen Foilcutter, which simply clips the top of the foil in two  seconds.  </P> <P> Getting a bottle of Champagne open is a fearful experience for some because the  cork can easily fly away and damage people or things. Getting a grip on it,  however, is a lot easier when you have something like the one-piece Hallen  Champagne Star, a device that provides grip on the cork so it can be twisted in  the bottle and then eased out.  </P> <P> Another device that also works is called the Champagne Key, made of metal and  hinged to open and then clamp onto the cork. It typically runs a couple of  dollars more than the Star and works just as well, but is especially  recommended for Champagne bottles with stubborn corks that don't twist. (One  model of the Champagne key runs $40. It works better than the lower-priced  version, but the cheaper one works fine at a fraction of the price.)  </P> <P> Spring-loaded Champagne stoppers are great stocking stuffers. These keep the  bobbles in bottles of Champagne that aren't finished.  </P> <P> The best value in books for the wine lover is Hugh Johnson's Pocket  Encyclopedia of Wine 1990 (Simon &amp; Schuster, $9.95). It's updated with  recommendations on the latest available vintages of wine from around the world  and chock full of Johnson's insights into wine and serving it.  </P> <P> $10 to Every wine lover owns a corkscrew or two -- or 10. The best models use a  helix for the screw, not a machined piece of metal that can tear the center out  of the cork. (You can put a straw up the center of the wire helix.)  </P> <P> A decade ago, Herbert Allen invented the best corkscrew I've ever used, called  the Screwpull. It features a Teflon-coated helix and a needle-sharp point.  </P> <P> The company Allen founded, the Texas-based Hallen Co., with annual sales of $7  million in wine gadgetry, has come out with various sophistications of the  original model throughout the years, and Hallen's Pocket Model is my favorite.  Though it's called the Pocket Model, I never take it anywhere.  </P> <P> The reason I prefer it is that it has a finger hole for twirling the cork out  of the bottle. It's simple to use and usually no more than $16, making it just  pennies more than the traditional waiters' corkscrew.  </P> <P> For the dedicated wine lover, knowing the temperature and humidity in the wine  cellar is important, and one of the better values in a combination  thermometer-hygrometer is a small, stick-on unit available from Brookstone for  $12.50 plus tax and shipping. To order, call Brookstone at (603) 924-9511.  </P> <P> Wine lovers always need more decanters, and the simple, inexpensive decanter I  use is an attractive gift. It is the European-style Carafe, a 28-ounce  wide-bottomed decanter that is sold with a wood bung (to keep air out) for  $13.25 by Marjorie Lum Wine Glasses. For a catalogue of Lum's wine glasses and  other wine gifts, drop a note to 112 Pine St., San Anselmo, Calif. 94960, or  call (415) 454-0660; fax (415) 456-9197. Shipping costs average $4.  </P> <P> Sometimes a bottle of wine that few people can get is a surprise gift a wine  lover would like, and such a wine is the 1988 Chaparral Chardonnay made by  Chalone from Sangiacomo grapes and sold by Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park and  Wally's in Westwood and Toluca Lake. The wine, $12, is not available at any  other Southern California location.  </P> <P> Wally's also has the only supply in town of the highly regarded Elijah Craig  Bourbon, $15.75.  </P> <P> $18 to Budding collectors building wine cellars might appreciate the Cellar  Cube, an 18- x 18-inch unfinished pine cube that holds two cases of wine. The  Guild sells it for $35.  </P> <P> Marjorie Lum also carries a larger, more classic hand blown decanter with a  top. The bulbous-bottomed decanter slopes up to a nice slim top standing 15  inches tall. Included is a glass stopper. The 40-ounce decanter is $35.  (Address and telephone are above.)  </P> <P> The Duke of Bourbon and Wally's are also the only two stores to carry  single-cask special lots of the Germain-Robin Special Lot Brandy, made in Ukiah  using traditional Cognac production and blending methods. The stores carry the  product for $39.95.  </P> <P> Also $39.95 is what Steve Wallace of Wally's called "the best Cognac I have  under $100," Domaine Frapin Vieille Grand Fine Champagne Cognac, a single  vineyard Cognac.  </P> <P> A new book on wine with a fascinating look at where wine has been is "A History  of Wine in America: From the Beginnings to Prohibition," by Thomas Pinney,  chairman of the department of English at Pomona College (University of  California Press, $45).  </P> <P> The scholarly work corrects some misconceptions that have been passed down by  public relations people and gives an insight into today's neo-Prohibitionist  movement by looking at those of the past.  </P> <P> $47 to Glassware may be hard to buy (what style, type, color, etc. is  appropriate), but one glass every wine lover should have is the official  tasting glass known as the INAO Glass (for Institute de National d'Appellations  d'Origine), a classic 6 1/2-ounce glass with a small tulip-top and a fine rim.  The Guild offers a 24% lead crystal INAO glass in sets of a dozen for $48. This  is the perfect glass for wine lovers who are occasionally invited to tastings  where they have to bring their own glasses.  </P> <P> In a larger wine glass, more suited for the dinner table, the following two are  offered by Lum: The 13 1/2-ounce, 7 1/2-inch tall Chimney, a perfect  all-purpose white or red wine glass; the Merlion Glass, similar to the popular  Les Impitoyables, but smaller, holding 11 ounces; it stands 6 1/2 inches tall.  A set of six of either glass is $48.25.  </P> <P> Those who like to carry their wine to parties, restaurants or on picnics would  love the Traveler, a zippered kit that holds two bottles of wine, four wine  glasses and corkscrew (included). The Guild offers it for $50.  </P> <P> $75 to One of the greatest experiences I have ever had in grappa is a pear  grappa imported from Italy by Pearson and Hawkins of Santa Barbara. It is  called Grappa di Pera, produced by Jacopo Poli and it is marketed in an  extremely lovely, slender 500-milliliter bottle. At $80 to $85, this isn't  inexpensive, but it is one of the most exquisite dessert drinks I have ever  tasted.  </P> <P> To open bottles with panache, try Hallen's Leverpull ($90), which is about the  fastest and easiest and most foolproof method of opening wine. (And if you have  a dozen bottles to open, it's a must.) It is packaged with the Foilcutter.  </P> <P> The best Champagne? Some would argue Krug, others say Dom Perignon. And many  connoisseurs vote for Salon. The 1982 Salon ($100) is a sublime, richly  flavored wine that shows how a fine Champagne can be both rich and delicate at  the same time. Salon, made only in great vintages from a single vineyard,  offers rich Chardonnay flavors and a depth rarely found in fine Champagne. And  it ages in the bottle beautifully, so if the '79 Salon is available, try it as  well in a side-by-side taste.  </P> <P> $100 to Keeping an opened bottle of wine fresh is difficult. Once the cork is  pulled, all wine begins to deteriorate through oxidation.  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Repossessions are falling but remain high AT ITS MOST extreme, negative equity can lead to repossession. Previously, an option for those falling far behind with their mortgage payments was to sell the house, pay off the loan and rent. But the downturn in the housing market has, for the time being, blocked off this option. The main factor contributing to repossession has been losing a job because of the recession. Relationship breakdowns and financial mismanagement are the other reasons cited by the Council of Mortgage Lenders for home-owners stopping payments and, in the most serious cases, being repossessed. The number of houses taken back by lenders is dropping but remains high. The CML said the figure for the first half of the year was 31,780, an 11 per cent fall on the same period last year when the figure was 35,750. Total repossessions last year were 68,540, down from the 1991 peak of 75,540. Lenders have been following a policy of 'forbearance' by counselling those who fall into arrears and, in the main, refraining from taking possession unless payments dry up completely. Adrian Coles, director-general of the CML, said the situation had been helped also by the reduction in interest rates and the government's decision to pay income support for mortgage interest directly to lenders. Mike Smith, of the Northern Rock, said that repossession had been voluntary in 50 per of his society's cases, with home-owners simply returning their keys. The industry average was 35 per cent, said Coles. The number of households with arrears of 12 months or more increased, however, from 147,040 in the second half of 1992 to 158,000 in the first half of this year. Altogether, just under 350,000 households have arrears of six months or more. Fears that 'forbearance' might cease once the housing market picks up, with lenders repossessing properties to sell in a rising market, are denied vehemently. 'There is a long, hard slog ahead in managing long-term arrears,' said Coles. 'If people have a chance of recovering the situation, lenders won't take possession.'</p>

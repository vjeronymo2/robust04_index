He told a business  breakfast that the budget could be released earlier as the  parties involved thought August was too close to the planning  cycle needed for the following year's budget.    The budget therefore could be presented in July or as early  as June, following the country's first all-race elections in  April.    Due to the country's transition, a budget was not presented,  traditionally in mid-March, for the new fiscal year which starts  at the beginning of April. However, government budgets were  extended by parliament earlier this year.    Mr Keys also revealed Tuesday the head of the finance, and  state expenditure departments in conjunction with the finance  sub-council of the Transitional Executive Council would outline  next week the broad parameters of the first government's budget.</p>

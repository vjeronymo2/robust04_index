			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> 3-POINTER CLINCHES HARBOR WIN OVER BARSTOW, 74-70  </P> <P> It took a three-point basket by Keith Billingslea with 27 seconds remaining to  clinch a Los Angeles Harbor 74-70 basketball victory over pesky Barstow  College.  </P> <P> Harbor improved its Southern California Athletic Conference record to 6-3 and  13-10 overall.  </P> <P> Barstow took a 43-35 halftime lead behind DeChaunce Veasley's 15 points. He  finished with 25.  </P> <P> "(Barstow) really played well in the first half," Harbor Coach Ken Curry said.  "I told our kids at halftime to just go out and play. We just didn't execute  well offensively in the first half. Over the last three games, we really  haven't played very well on the offensive end of the floor. The good thing  about tonight's game is that we won. I guess a win is a win, and I will take it  any way we can get it."  </P> <P> Jerome Hendrix turned in a strong performance for the Seahawks. He scored a  game-high 27 points, including 15 in the first half.  </P> <P> "I really don't get into who is scoring a lot of points for us during the  game," Curry said. "It was a surprise to me that Jerome scored that many  points. The way we played, we needed every one of them tonight."  </P> <P> Barstow (5-18, 3-6) took control of the game early. The Vikings went on a 10-0  run midway through the first half to open a 13-point bulge, 26-13. Hendrix  scored a three-point basket in the closing seconds of the half to move the  Seahawks to within eight.  </P> <P> After four lead changes during the second half, the Vikings moved ahead, 68-63,  on a Veasley jumper with 3:31 remaining.  </P> <P> Billingslea hit a three-pointer from the baseline and Hendrix scored a lay-in  off a steal by Charles Perry to knot the game at 70 with 1:18 to play.  Billingslea finished with 15 points. Perry scored 11 and Ronald Lewis had 10  for Harbor.  </P> <P> El Camino 98, Mt. San Antonio 73 -- El Camino College applied the defense in  the second half to pull away from a slender 40-39 halftime lead and remain in  first place in the South Coast Conference with two games left. The Warriors  improved to 20-6 overall and 5-1 in the SCC.  </P> <P> Mt. Sac kept the game close with three-point shooting before El Camino's  second-half defense forced the pace in the Warriors' favor. Forward David  Keeter led the winners with 23 points and added seven assists and three blocked  shots. Forward Zlatko Josic had 17 points and eight rebounds.  </P></p>

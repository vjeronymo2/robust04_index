			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister  Sergey Shakhray predicted on Tuesday that a new major stand off  between authorities, worse that the one which took place last  October, is in store for Russia in August if urgent measures are  not taken to improve the economic situation.    Last October at least 140 people were killed in Moscow  during  the armed opposition revolt.    "If the problem of mutual indebtedness of enterprises is not  urgently solved the government will not survive. It is possible  that in August head of the government Viktor Chernomyrdin will  have to offer resignation on his own initiative to save the  situation", Shakhray told a press conference.    The resignation, according to Shakhray, will be preceeded in  July by mass protests among workers of defence enterprises.    Attempts to appoint a new prime minister will trigger a  stand  off between the lower chamber and the president and "scenarios  of dissolving the State Duma" will appear. As a result the  other chamber, the Federation Council, will move to opposition  to Boris Yeltsin, he said.    "And finally the last October situation may repeat, but in a  worse variant", Shakhray said and added that "this is the worst  scenario, but it is quite possible if the mentioned measures are  not taken".    Besides the problem of mutual indebtedness, the measures  include the necessity to make all those parties which signed the  civic accord treaty to work for reforms. The president and the  government should act as an arbiter in pursuing the economic and  political interests of Russia. They have to initiate a dialogue  with representatives of the fuel and energy industry, the  military- industrial complex, with agrarians and bankers in  order to solve the problem of indebtedness and to change the  taxation and banking system, Shakhray said.    Among possible successors to Chernomyrdin he sees Moscow  Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets, and  former Security Council Chairman Yuriy Skokov.</p>

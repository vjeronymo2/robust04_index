			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 23, IRNA -- The BBC's launch this week  of an Arabic television news service has brought into question  how much editorial influence has been granted in its pact with  Orbit Communication. Orbit, owned by Prince Khalid 'Abdallah,  is reported to be planning to charge viewers 10,000 dinars for  the decoders needed to receive its 20 entertainment channels and  the BBC news programs that is seen serving only sheiks and rich  business persons.    According to the London GUARDIAN, many Arabs are also  wondering how free the BBC will be, given that its partner is a  distant cousin of King Fahd.    The royal family already dominates the media in Saudi  Arabia,  owns the two leading pan-Arabic dailies, a satellite network  covering the region and the international UPI news agency.  Plans are said to be also underway for a new pan-Arab FM radio  station.    As one of the most rigidly censored areas in the world, the  decision by the BBC is seen as potentially its most  controversial venture in news satellite broadcasting.    BBC World Service Radio, funded by the Foreign Office, is  recognized for its sensitive handling of news on Saudi Arabia,  which is Britain's largest arms market, but executives are  claiming there have been no concessions on its Arabic tv service.    Orbit was said to have been given no editorial influence,  even although Saudi Arabia has been leading many Arab  governments against the march of global Westernized culture.    The London GUARDIAN also identified that Orbit's access to  new cable newtorks is through a "filtering" system, whereby  there is a delay between the time signals are received and then  transmitted to viewers. The Saudi policy has always been to  carefully screen out any material that is objectionable, which  will put an extra onus on BBC transmissions if it is to abide by  its claim of not allowing any tampering of its news service.</p>

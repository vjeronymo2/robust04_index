			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Meeting of Panel/Request for Public Comment </DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fifth, and probably final, meeting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research Panel will be held June 21&hyph;22 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day at the Holiday Inn Bethesda, 8120 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland. The Panel is a group of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend guidelines for Federal funding of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  human embryo resulting from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vitro <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fertilization or other sources. At the June meeting, the Panel will work toward the resolution of outstanding issues and review a draft report of its findings and conclusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> human embryo has many potential scientific and therapeutic benefits. Among the most direct and immediate possible gains are the treatment of infertility and the advancement of preimplantation diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal abnormalities. Other research focusing on the processes of fertilization and implantation could clarify the causes of infertility. Studies of normal and abnormal early embryonic development could enhance understanding of the causes of pregnancy loss, birth defects, and the mechanisms of uncontrolled cell growth that occur in cancer. Other research efforts could be applied to the development of novel contraceptives. In the longer term, research on embryonic stem cells could have therapeutic applications in a broad range of areas, including bone marrow transplantation, repair of damaged tissues, and treatment of degenerative diseases of the nervous and muscular systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH has received a number of applications for support of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  human embryo as well as research involving parthenogenesis (the initiation of development of an ovum without sperm). Before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. The Human Embryo Research Panel was established to assist the NIH in this effort. The Panel's charge is to consider various areas of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  human embryo and provide advice as to those areas it views to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During part of its first and second meeting, the Panel reviewed the wide range of scientific and human health benefits that could result from governmental support of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  human embryo. At the third meeting, Panel deliberations focused on issues related to the moral status of the human embryo and acceptability of areas of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> human embryo research; ethically acceptable sources of human embryos and oocytes, including informed consent requirements, issues raised by compensation of sperm/egg providers, and concerns regarding commercialization; and, appropriate mechanisms/levels of review of research proposals involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> human embryo. The fourth meeting of the Panel was devoted to the consideration of a preliminary draft of proposed guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NIH continues to seek public comment on these and other issues raised by Federal funding of human embryo research and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on these important matters. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller, Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel, <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->  c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each meeting of the Panel has also provided an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to make brief oral presentations to the Panel. To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor at the NIH by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or 301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present statements are limited and will be determined by the order in which requests are received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. To ensure that adequate seating is available for the public, individuals interested in attending the meeting are asked to notify the NIH by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number. General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ruth L.

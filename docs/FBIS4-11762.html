			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian opposition has condemned the  PLO-Israeli agreement on Hebron security and asked the  Palestinian police force, which will be deployed in the  autonomous region, not to thwart attacks aimed at the Israeli  occupation.    The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  has denounced what it called the observers deal in Hebron and  regarding it as an ineffectual deal confined to the presence of  a limited number of European observers with no security powers  and without any deterrent measures against the settlers and  settlements. It also considered this a new concession in the  'Arafat leadership's long line of concessions under the pressure  and blackmail of the United States and Israel.    Those who speak on behalf of the ten Palestinian factions  opposed to the Oslo agreement say that the measures which have  been agreed on in Hebron will not prevent new massacres of  Palestinians. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the  Islamic Jihad Organization, says that yesterday's agreement in  Cairo does not ensure for the Palestinians a minimum level of  security and the international presence is useless because the  international observers will not play the role of policemen. He  said the Islamic Jihad will continue against the Zionists in all  parts of occupied Palestine and asked the Palestinian police  personnel not to hinder his organization's operations against  the Israeli enemy, as he put it.</p>

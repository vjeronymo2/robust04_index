			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response to Comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Offset Sanction Applicability. Regarding offset sanction source and pollutant applicability, in the final rule, EPA has maintained the approaches in the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On source applicability, EPA believes it is important to maximize the air quality benefit of the offset sanction by requiring that sources whose permits are issued after the date the offset sanction applies comply with a 2-to-1 emission offset requirement. Contrary to the comment, the source applicability definition is not a departure from all past EPA practices because historically EPA has not always used the ``complete application'' definition. (The different source applicability definitions EPA has used in the past are discussed in the detailed response to comments document.) Therefore, EPA believes that past practice does not constrain it from determining today that it is important to enhance the effectiveness of the offset sanction by defining source applicability on a permit issuance basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, EPA believes that once the offset sanction applies, it would be a violation of the sanction for a permit to be issued with an emission offset of less than 2-to-1. The plain language of section 179(a) and section 179(b)(2) does not provide for nor contemplate any grace period based on whether a source has submitted a complete application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding pollutant applicability of the offset sanction, EPA believes the proposed applicability is reasonably supported and will have the potential to effectively protect air quality. Section 179(b)(2) generally references the offset requirements of section 173 and does not restrict EPA's ability to base the applicability of the sanction on a pollutant or pollutants (and its/their precursor(s)). Moreover, pollutant-specific application of the offset sanction is consistent with the requirements of section 179. Section 179(b)(2)'s language providing that ``the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be at least 2 to 1'' is general enough such that EPA can determine the most reasonable method to apply the sanction. While section 179(b)(2) references the broader section 173 requirement, EPA believes it is more reasonable, with one caveat, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to apply the offset sanction to the criteria pollutants specifically related to the SIP deficiency in question. Pollutant-specific application of the offset sanction will encourage the State to correct its SIP deficiencies and will provide reductions in emissions of the relevant pollutant in the interim, without unnecessarily punishing stationary sources in cases where the State's program for other pollutants is adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Where the SIP deficiency is general, the offset sanction applies to the criteria pollutant(s) (and its/their precursor(s)) for which the area is required to meet the section 173 NSR requirements. (This pollutant applicability definition for general SIP deficiencies is also discussed in section II.C.5. below.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is maintaining the approach in the proposal that the sanction applies to ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors. The caveat to that general rule has expanded in one minor respect with respect to the ozone precursor NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As provided in the proposed rule, sources will need to achieve the increased offset ratio for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when the finding concerns an ozone requirement unless EPA approves a section 182(f) demonstration that the Act's NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment NSR requirements should not apply. In addition, EPA has added the exception that if the area otherwise is not subject to the section 173 offset requirement for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (e.g., submarginal ozone nonattainment areas), then sources in that area would not be subject to that requirement under the offset sanction (see sections 182(f) and 182(b)(2)). This exception is necessary in light of the specific language of the offset provision, which ties the offset sanction specifically to offsets required under section 173. For PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA has retained the caveat for cases in which EPA has made a section 189(e) (42 U.S.C. 7513a(e)) determination for an area that PM&hyph;10 precursors are not significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

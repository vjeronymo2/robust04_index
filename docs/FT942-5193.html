			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Veterans relive day of destiny: Queen and western leaders on voyage of D-Day remembrance A dazzling commemoration of the allied invasion of France, full of carefully organised pomp and small moments of pathos, got under way yesterday as the royal yacht Britannia carrying the Queen led a flotilla of ships across the Channel from Portsmouth. In Normandy, 40 US veterans defied conventional wisdom on the limitations of old age and repeated their parachute jumps of 50 years ago. In a salute to fallen comrades, they jumped from a vintage DC-3 Dakota aircraft near the town of Sainte Mere-Eglise. One was hurt after his parachute twisted. Another 550 serving US paratroopers followed. To the east 1,000 British, Polish, Canadian and French paras dropped near the Pegasus bridge, the first piece of France to be freed on D-Day. The ceremonies, which come to a climax today on the beaches where the allies landed, began yesterday morning with a religious service on Southsea Common outside Portsmouth. Leaders of the allied nations, bound for France on Britannia and a variety of warships, were given a tumultuous send-off by a flypast of second world war aircraft. The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, who officiated at the service along with Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders, recalled some of the sensations experienced by the biggest invasion force ever assembled. He spoke of 'the smell of self-heating soup that did little for sea-sickness; the fear in the pit of the stomach as the beaches loomed ahead; the devastated orchards of Normandy and the stench of dead cattle; and the individual acts of bravery and brilliance'. But 'those we remember today', said the Archbishop, 'gave their lives not only for the liberation of occupied Europe, but also for the German nation - to free itself of the dark tyranny that was destroying its soul'. At a rain-swept ceremony on Saturday, the head of the German war graves committee, Mr Hans-Otto Weber, held a service at the La Cambe cemetery where 21,250 Germans are buried. German and French bishops yesterday held a joint service in Caen. French president Francois Mitterrand said France was 'happy and proud to welcome the veterans of the allied troops who, 50 years ago, came to mingle their blood with that of her sons'. The flotilla of small boats shadowing Britannia mirrored in miniature the vast invasion fleet mustered on D-Day. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'I cannot remember anything as big or as spectacular as this. I'm very proud.' US president Bill Clinton, one of the youngest of the government leaders aboard the royal yacht, said: 'I never dreamt I would be here, doing this sort of thing.' Earlier, landing craft came ashore near the Southsea Common war memorial to collect the national flags of the allies for transfer to another ship, the HMS Fearless, which took them to Normandy. In mid-Channel, the allied leaders on the Britannia took the salute of some 40 allied ships. Wreaths were laid at sea and a vintage Lancaster bomber dropped two million poppies, symbols of the war dead. One unusual ceremony was a joint memorial mass in the small town of Periers between veterans of the 90th US infantry division and the 6th German parachute division. This German unit gave the battered 90th a truce in which to collect their wounded, prompting some Americans to find the Germans after the war. They have already held several joint memorials together.

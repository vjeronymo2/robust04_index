			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Collor corruption crisis throws reforms off course THE temperature may have cooled a little in Brazil but the future of its first popularly elected president for 30 years still hangs in the balance. Described as 'a victim of his own democratic reforms', the ability of President Fernando Collor to lead the country out of economic crisis is now severely hampered. The wave of allegations against the charismatic 42-year-old president initiated by his younger brother Pedro in May, draws on a cast of family, friends and aides in a real-life saga of tropical powerbrokers and sibling rivalries. Whatever the truth of charges that the country is being run by a gang of thieves, the political crisis in the world's eighth largest economy has been compared to that of 1954 when corruption allegations drove President Getulio Vargas to suicide. Elected on an anti-corruption platform, Mr Collor had earlier sacked several ministers for corruption and his wife had been forced out of a government charity amid allegations of wrongdoing. While 'Collorgate' almost brought down his administration, the evidence against the president rests on the testimony of a driver, a few copies of cheques paid into his secretary's account and a telephone bill showing frequent calls to his office by an allegedly corrupt businessman who was his campaign treasurer. The problem is not confined to the administration. Officials estimate tax evasion at 7 per cent of GDP. Mr Collor's colleagues claim that the real motivation behind Collorgate is resistance to his modernisation programme, particularly the dismantling of cartels and opening the economy to foreign competition. A political outsider, Mr Collor's arrogance in office and initial insistence that he could govern without recourse to traditional porkbarrel politics or appeasing the powerful business community, has left him isolated among the elite even though public opinion may be on his side. Ironically the extensive press freedom under the new democracy has worked against Mr Collor. 'The press is not only investigating but condemning - it's a witch-hunt,' rages one minister. 'Instead of praising him as the first president to allow police investigation into a minister they are using it against him.' While other Latin American leaders have been able to rely on a one-party state, a strong majority or even dictatorship, to push though reform, Mr Collor's party holds only 31 out of 503 Congressional seats. So fragmented is Brazilian politics that there are 18 parties in Congress. While other countries are disbanding communist parties Brazil recently formed its third. Unable to muster political support for crucial fiscal reform, he has been forced to rely on monetary policy as his only weapon against inflation. It was for this reason that, to public approval, Mr Collor sacked his cabinet in April, appointing well-known politicians from the Liberal Front (PFL) whom he had criticised. Within a month claims by his brother that his campaign manager was involved in corruption with the president's blessing and that he was a cocaine addict had plunged the country back into crisis. This worsened last week as new testimony emerged. Today the only stabilising factor is Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Mr Collor's morally upright Economy Minister. Despite his popularity, Mr Moreira's ability to act is shackled by political paralysis. Far from falling, inflation is stuck around 20 per cent a month. Mr Moreira rules out the magic tricks which have characterised recent Brazilian economic management, insisting on the orthodox route of fiscal reform which in Brazil would involve constitutional revision. However, approval by Congressmen for a fiscal reform which cuts at their privileges is unlikely with municipal elections due in October and the corruption inquiries providing them with a welcome diversion, weakening the President's ability to force reform. Mr Collor insists he will not resign. But the opposition has not relented and his future now hangs on whether further concrete evidence surfaces in the congressional inquiry under way in Brasilia. The military has said it would not interfere. If he is forced out, the reform programme is likely to collapse with him. Under the constitution, Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president would take over. He is a strong opponent of reforms such as privatisation.</p>

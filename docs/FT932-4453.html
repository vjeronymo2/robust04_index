			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Observer: Steaming ahead Remember the old Patagonian Express, immortalised by American travel writer and train buff Paul Theroux? In keeping with the spirit of the age, the train's owner, the Province of Chubut, has decided to privatise the ancient puffer train, which links the remote Patagonian towns of El Maiten and Esquel. But the provincial government, while anxious to enliven Patagonia's less than glittering tourist trade, is also short on ideas as to how to approach the venture. Hence it is unabashedly calling all entrepreneurs, tour operators, train spotters and Theroux devotees to come forward with their own ideas. Answers please, c/o Naturatur, 25 de Mayo y Rivadavia, Esquel, Chubut, Argentina. Fax: (010541) 945 2139, no later than midday on July 16.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / A new red flag flies over eastern Europe: Coca-Cola is pouring resources into the former communist countries in a battle for market share As the countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe adjust to life after communism, Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks company, is pushing ahead aggressively with plans to turn them red again. Gdynia, on Poland's Baltic coast, has just been given the treatment. Dozens of Coca-Cola salespeople dressed in the company's scarlet livery swarmed through the city brandishing scarlet promotional material to mark the opening on Sunday of the first of several new Coke bottling plants in the country. The plants are important in Coca-Cola's efforts to come from behind in the battle for eastern Europe's markets, where PepsiCo, its smaller US arch-rival, has long had extensive operations and sells up to three times as many soft drinks. Only in Yugoslavia does Coke out-sell Pepsi. Nor is Pepsi standing still. It is stepping up investments to help its more than 60, mainly state-owned, bottlers modernise and to strengthen distribution, sales and marketing. Ms Susan Hooper, Pepsi's marketing director for eastern Europe, says competition is so intense that a regional 'cola war' is looming. For both companies, the potential looks almost limitless. Per capita consumption of soft drinks in the region is far below western European levels, and western products are a fraction of total sales. 'Clearly, these will be among our fastest-growing markets anywhere,' says Mr Neville Isdell, president of Coke's Northeast Europe/Africa division. 'In percentage terms, growth will be spectacular.' Coke's first big move was in eastern Germany, where it dispatched an advance team soon after the Berlin Wall fell and aims to invest more than Dollars 450m (Pounds 250m). More recently, the company has turned further east, announcing a string of deals and further investments of almost Dollars 1bn in local bottling, distribution and marketing. Pepsi refuses to be impressed by such figures. 'I'll believe them when I see them,' sniffs Ms Hooper. 'Coke sometimes tends to add a couple of zeros to its sums.' Nevertheless, Coke's ambitions are exceeding even its resources, prompting it to search out partners wherever it can find them. Hungary and Czechoslovakia have been entrusted to Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), a 51 per cent-owned Australian affiliate which runs Coke's operations in Austria, while Coke's bottler in Greece is handling Bulgaria and Romania. Coke has also signed several deals in the former Soviet Union. Coke's sales are rising fastest in Hungary, where CCA has two bottling plants. But the biggest short-term target is Poland, where a five-fold increase in production and investments of Dollars 150m are planned over three years. Coca-Cola will split the costs with Ringnes, its Norwegian bottler, which is helping run some operations. In the past, most east European governments tied the company's sales volumes, like Pepsi's, to its willingness to engage in counter-trade, and allocated production to state-owned bottlers who neither knew nor cared much about the business. Unlike Pepsi, Coke has chosen to sever many traditional business links and start again from scratch. But finding suitable sites for new plants in countries where property rights are often hazy and there is no real property market has not been easy. Nor has acquiring existing businesses been exactly trouble-free. In the Czech republic CCA was allowed to buy a state-owned bottler only after agreeing to donate funds to the Prague zoo and to a research institute. What it got was an over-engineered plant with a defective water purification system which needed to be completely re-equipped. Though Coke flies in expatriates to support its fledgling east European businesses, it wants them to become entirely locally managed. All 230 permanent staff at the Gdynia plant are Poles or Polish speakers, and it is run by a former general manager of a local shipping line. Coca-Cola starts with a big advantage - one of the best-known international brands in eastern Europe. So much so that the company - unlike Pepsi, which is still widely viewed as a local product - sees no need yet for television advertising. 'Putting cold bottles on shelves is the best marketing we can do,' says Mr Isdell. 'We don't have to ask ourselves if our product will sell, only how do we get it to the consumer?' That involves more than building modern plants. The biggest challenge is to build up what Coca-Cola calls 'the system' - the highly-developed distribution, marketing and service network which is its most powerful weapon in the battle for retail customers. Trained sales and delivery staff in brightly coloured Coca-Cola trucks are already roving the streets of east European cities, visiting shops and cafes, filling display racks and advising owners on how to promote the company's products. For retailers long accustomed to surly and unreliable state-owned suppliers, the experience is a revelation, says Mr Isdell: 'When our people say they'll be back with more stocks next Friday, shopkeepers are amazed.' More of a problem is finding reliable customers. Coke says that in it first six months in Poland, retail customer turnover reached 60 per cent, though conditions have since begun to stabilise. Initially, Coke is pricing its products at only two thirds the level in west Germany. However, as trade barriers with the EC fall, it expects to raise prices to prevent 'parallel' imports of cheap east European Coke streaming westwards. But right now the flow is all the other way, as Coke continues to pour in resources. Mr Isdell is coy about when the investments will show returns. 'We take a long-term view,' he says. 'None the less, we will have profitable operations in each country within three years of start-up.'</p>

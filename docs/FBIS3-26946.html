Chen Xitong,  secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out in his  speech: The principles for guiding this year's work are to  emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable opportunities, make  breakthroughs in key areas, and make bigger strides for reform  and construction so as to realize the target of becoming fairly  well-off ahead of schedule.    Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipal government, chaired the  report meeting. Making reports at the meeting were responsible  persons of the municipal planning commission, the municipal  scientific and technological commission, the municipal  commercial commission, the municipal commission for foreign  economic relations and trade, the municipal economic  restructuring commission, the organizational department and the  propaganda department under the municipal party committee, and  the municipal agricultural office.    Last year, the municipality created a new situation in  reform  and opening up, comprehensively increased economic targets, and  comprehensively fulfilled or surpassed the 38 planned targets of  nine major categories that were approved at the first session of  the 10th municipal people's congress. In 1993, the GNP reached  85.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent when calculated in  terms of comparable prices. The grain output reached 2.84  billion yuan and the per unit yield of grain reached 690  kilograms, setting a record. The total industrial output value  reached 125.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent. The  profits and taxes realized by the enterprises at or above the  township level reached 15.42 billion yuan, an increase of 15  percent. The total volume of retail sales of commodities  reached 54.92 billion yuan, an increase of 27.8 percent. Local  investment in fixed assets reached 27.1 billion yuan, an  increase of 49.4 percent. A total of 11 million square meters  of houses were built, including 5.5 million square meters of  residential houses. A total of 3,752 new foreign-funded  enterprises of three types were approved and $6.28 billion worth  of foreign capital were used according to agreements,  respectively increasing by 70 percent and 3.3 times. The volume  of export through foreign trade totaled $1.698 billion, an  increase of 10.6 percent. A total of 2.03 million overseas  tourists were received, an increase of 16.1 percent. Foreign  exchange earnings reached $1.24 billion, an increase of 15.9  percent. The local revenues reached 8.41 billion yuan, an  increase of 4.8 percent.    Viewing the general situation, we know that last year, the  national economy of the municipality developed in a sound and  orderly way, the biggest improvement was made in the appearance  of urban areas, new breakthroughs were made in deepening reform,  key strides were made in building markets, the biggest  breakthroughs were made in using foreign capital, and people's  livelihood was noticeably improved.    Li Qiyan said in his summing-up speech: This report meeting  has been successful. All departments, commissions, and offices  have made full preparations, conscientiously studied the summing  up of the 1993 work and the arrangements for the 1994 work, and  worked out new ideas for 1994's work. The report meeting  implements the guidelines of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th Party Central Committee and generally upgrades the  understanding about the policy on linking theory with practice.  Many reports dialectically ponder over problems. All this shows  that the people have new ideas and good skills and are full of  the awareness of emancipating the mind, conducting reform, and  opening to the outside world. Many reform projects of  breakthrough significance, as set forth in the reports, have new  ideas and embody the new measures conforming to the current  international big markets. The way of thinking is clear. We  have great determination and forceful and solid measures to  speed up the capital's modernization. The report meeting makes  a good start in carrying out the municipality's work in 1994 and  helps lay a good foundation for realizing the 1994 fighting  goals. We should strive to make greater achievements.    Chen Xitong started out in his speech by expounding on the  guiding principle for the work of the whole municipality during  this year. He said: The year 1994 is the first year for  comprehensively implementing the decision of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th Party Central Committee on the establishment  of the socialist market economic structure, an important year  for realizing the goal of becoming well-off three years ahead of  schedule, and a year of increased domestic and international  opportunities for us. In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, we have proposed the guiding principles for  the work of the whole municipality during 1994 through  conducting investigation and studies, extensively listening to  opinions, and holding consultation and discussions in all  sectors on emancipating the mind, seizing opportunity, making  major breakthroughs, meeting the goal of becoming well-off ahead  of schedule, and making greater strides in reform and  construction.    Chen Xitong said: Emancipating the mind is an endless  long-term task. Emancipating the mind is aimed at seeking truth  from facts, unceasingly freeing ourselves from the shackle of  idealism and mataphysics, and understanding and transforming the  objective world in line with dialectics. Just as Comrade Jiang  Zemin said: "Emancipating the mind is aimed at making ideology  match reality, and subjectivity match objectivity, in other  words, it means seeking truth from facts." We conducted general  discussions on emancipation of minds for four successive years,  and each discussion brought progress in ideology and played an  active role in promoting all fields of work. What is the  priority of the municipality's emancipation of mind during this  year? Generally speaking, the priority is to further emancipate  the minds in line with the work of accelerating the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure,  expanding the extent of reform, establishing a modern enterprise  system, and firmly seizing the opportunity to accelerate  development in difficult and hot spots that disrupt the progress  of all departments and units. Specifically speaking, priorities  in emancipating minds this year are:    First, we should continue to emancipate the minds according  to the rate of development. The development rate of Beijing  last year was quite rapid at 12 percent. Our problem is that we  cannot seem to make it faster. The development rate of Beijing  is lower than the national average and lower than Shanghai and  Tianjin. A gap exists when compared with the favorable  conditions of the capital. If we give further play to advantages  and tap into potential, it is possible for us to achieve faster  development. This development rate should be realistic and  sound.    Second, we should further emancipate the mind in building  the  socialist market economic structure. In building the socialist  market economic structure, we should pay attention to the law of  value, give play to the basic regulatory role of market  mechanisms, and at the same time, build a sound marcoeconomic  regulation and control system, and never take blind action.  Macroeconomic regulation and control is not a synonym of the  planned economy, therefore, we must not regard it as going back  on the old track. We should comprehensively understand this,  and never be one-sided.    Third, we should further emancipate the mind in running  state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises. State-owned,  large and medium-sized enterprises are the leading forces of the  socialist market economy. We must invigorate them because if we  fail to do it this way, it will be impossible for us to  establish the socialist market economic structure. One-third  of the number of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  are good, average, and running in the red. We should try our  best to invigorate enterprises that have heavy internal burdens  but are needed by the market by pushing them forward with help  and support to operate in order to serve the market economy, and  strive to invigorate them.    Fourth, we broke the old structure and stressed the  importance of daring to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to  take risks in reform and construction, and now central  authorities have formulated a basic pattern for the socialist  market economy and will establish a new structure, so is it  still necessary for us to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to  take risks? We believe that in building a new structure, we  still need to advocate the practice of daring to go ahead, blaze  new trials and take risks. Because the old structure has not  been completely eliminated, shackles and obstacles remain, and  many old things have yet to completely disappear from the stage.  The newly established systems also need to be replenished,  revised, implemented, developed, and improved in practice. We  should make bold explorations and experiments for the new system  by proceeding from realities. We should also continue to  emancipate the mind and dare to give everything a try and go  ahead.    Fifth, we should further overcome blind complacency and a  passive pessimistic view. It is a lopsided view to feel  complacent over a little bit achievements and then refuse to  make progress. It is also a lopsided view to blame others and  shift responsibilities onto external reasons whenever there is a  difficulty and then refuse to exploit one's subjective activity.  Both of these views should be tackled conscientiously.    Sixth, we should overcome the situation in which some units  have been weak in doing one thing but tough in doing another, or  have been tough in words on both but stressed on neither in  deeds. Failing to overcome such a metaphysical situation will  affect the central link of economic construction. We must  persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and  being tough with both hands. This is the only way to ensure the  smooth progress of economic construction.    Seventh, we should overcome the idea of choosing and  promoting cadres according to seniority. In using cadres, we  should persist in the requirements of making cadres more  revolutionary, younger, better educated, and professionally more  competent and making cadres have ability and political  integrity. We should solve the problem concerning the provision  of leading bodies at various levels. We should boldly choose  and promote young cadres. This is a long-term policy, and we  must emancipate our mind in this regard.    Chen Xitong stressed: Only by emancipating the mind can we  blaze new ideas and act boldly. If we are plagued by all sorts  of fears and dare not to do this or that, we will be unable to  make big progress. New ideas, bold actions, and emancipation of  the mind are closely integrated. All units and all departments  should emancipate whatever binds their ideas and actions. By  doing so, they can go all out to do their work without  restrictions, make progress rapidly, and accelerate the pace of  reform and opening up.    When talking about the seizure of opportunity, Chen Xitong  pointed out: Opportunity is a special manifestation at the  present stage, and it does not exist at any stage. Failing to  seize the opportunity, it will be missed. The present situation  at home and abroad is extremely advantageous to our development,  and thus it is a race opportunity. Seizing the opportunity  loosely means failing to seize it. We must firmly seize the  opportunity, cherish it, and make good use of it so that we can  beef up the economy. Just like some comrades said, seizing the  opportunity means having new resources, new financial sources,  and high growth speed. Some comrades have failed to seize the  opportunity because they have caught sight of things belatedly,  understood things slowly, and lacked the sense of  responsibility, the sense of urgency, and the sense of crisis.  Some other comrades have lacked practical experiences and  indulged in empty talks. Still others have aimed too high and  buried themselves in studies all day long, thus missing  opportunities. We should keep firmly in mind what Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said, that is, "the opportunity should be seized and  policy decisions should be made in time," otherwise, "the time  will pass in a flash." Therefore, seizing the opportunity  should be regarded as a principle for our work this year.    Chen Xitong said: By making breakthroughs in key areas, we  mean to make breakthroughs in major contradictions, in central  links, or in key points. Without emphasis, there will be no  policies, and our work cannot be promoted. This year, the  central and key point of the work of the entire municipality  still lies in economic work. We should achieve success in the  work in all fields around the central link of economic  construction. Each field has its own major contradictions.  Only by making breakthroughs in major contradictions first and  solving non-essential contradictions second can we achieve  results in our work. To find out correct points in making  breakthroughs, we are required to conduct investigation and  study and think it over conscientiously. All fronts should sort  out their contradictions, put them in right order, and strive to  solve them in the order of importance. This means making  breakthroughs in key areas. We should solve a central problem  in a period, and solve some major problems throughout a year.  Successfully solving problems, we will make a breakthrough and  make big progress. As all fronts have their own special  contradictions and key areas, we should not use a fixed pattern  to address their problems. When issues of a specific character  are resolved, it will be easy to resolve the issues of a general  character. Achieving a fairly comfortable living standard three  years ahead of time is an issue regarding general character, in  which making mountainous areas prosper, people's housing  problem, and the problems of low-income workers require great  efforts to resolve. We should also pay attention to the work of  social stability and the spiritual civilization. As long as the  key areas are clearly defined and breakthroughs are made in  them, greater progress will be achieved in the work of the  municipality.    Speaking on strengthening party building and improving party  leadership, Chen Xitong said: Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out  that we should "strengthen and improve party building, strive to  raise the party's ruling and leadership levels, and enable our  long-tested Marxist party to play a better role as the  leadership core in the great cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics." To make a greater step in reform and  construction this year, we need to carry out plenty of work, and  we must not slacken efforts in party building. We should step  up efforts to achieve two improvements. First, we should make  unremitting efforts to achieve ideological and theoretical  improvement. The major tasks are to deeply study Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. After reading  through Volume 3, we should conduct intensive reading of special  topics in an effort to understand it more thoroughly. In  studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, the focus is to study and master dialectical  materialism and historical materialism and to study their stand,  viewpoints, and methods. We should use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a  tool to attain Beijing's targets of reform, opening up, and  construction and promote all work. Meanwhile, we should  transform our world outlook and outlook on life and oppose money  worship and ultra- individualism. In particular, leading cadres  should embrace the communist world outlook and outlook on life  and work hard all their life towards their ambitious goal. We  should also coordinate the study of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic theories of  Marxist works, including philosophy, political economics, and  scientific socialism. Only when we thoroughly understand the  basic theories, can we acquire a better understanding of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theories. Ideological and theoretical  improvement should be the criterion in assessing cadres,  especially young cadres. Chen Xitong pointed out that focusing  on establishing the socialist market economy system, we should  study the knowledge on the market economy, the modern enterprise  system, and modern science, technology, and management. He  urged: The study should become a system, should be examined,  supervised, and appraised, and should become a criterion for  selecting and promoting cadres. Propaganda through the media and  through cultural and art works should all be linked to Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and the major melody should be given prominence  so that efforts can be pooled to achieve a fairly comfortable  standard of living together.    Speaking on organizational improvement, Chen Xitong pointed  out: The focus should be on improving leading bodies.  Breakthroughs should be made in organizational work, especially  in the orderly succession of cadres to make leading bodies  younger. We should promote a number of young cadres who uphold  the four cardinal principles, are loyal to the party's cause,  and pay attention to the overall situation. We should also  promote women cadres and cadres of minority nationalities and  make a breakthrough in selecting cadres without party  affiliation or with democratic parties to participate in the  administration of state affairs. We should improve grass-roots  organizations and build party branches well. In particular, we  should be determined to rectify backward party branches and, at  the same time, summarize the experiences of advanced party  branches so as to promote the work of the middle branches of the  party. We should build party organizations of enterprises and  also pay attention to improving the party organizations of the  three types of foreign-funded enterprises, collective  enterprises, and private enterprises. Only when grass-roots  organizations are improved, can the party fully develop its  role. We should achieve success in improving party style and  building a clean government. This is a major task concerning  the life and death of our party. Administrative honesty should  be linked with administrative diligence. Two major experiences  were gained in the improvement of administrative honesty in the  previous stage. First, meet with the masses to directly hear  their opinions and accept their supervision. Second,  administrative honesty is closely linked with administrative  diligence, so be sure to be honest and diligent. We should  always use the enthusiasm gained through improvement of  administrative honesty to do good and real deeds for the people  and start an upsurge before the Spring Festival.    Chen Xitong urged to vigorously promote the setup of  socialist democracy and politics and pointed out the necessity  to reform the political system accordingly while restructuring  the economy. At present, we should achieve work in the  following few aspects: First, we should further improve the  people's congress system; strengthen and perfect the functions  of the municipal, district, and county people's congresses and  their standing committees; upgrade the prestige of the local  organs of state power; bring into better play the functions of  the people's deputies; and work out systems to enable the  deputies to bring their functions into better play after the  congresses. Second, we should further perfect the system of  multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the communist party and consolidate and develop  the united front in the new situation. We should continue to  persist in the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual  supervision, showing utter devotion, and sharing woe and weal";  strengthen and improve the leadership of the party; and bring  into full play various democratic parties and non party  personages' roles in participating in and discussing political  affairs and conducting democratic supervision. We should  strengthen the consultation and discussions with democratic  parties; improve the work of handling the motions put forward by  the democratic parties, including the federations of industry  and commerce; and positively create conditions for democratic  parties to participate in and discuss political affairs and  conduct democratic supervision. The party-member cadres at  various levels should pay attention to the united front work and  strengthen the work toward nationalities, the religious work,  and the work toward Taiwan. Third, the most important  foundation of the united front is the masses of workers and  peasants. The key to ensuring that the masses of the people  play the role as a master is to carry forward democracy, to make  the people have the right to handling their own affairs, to link  responsibility with right and benefits, and actually mobilize  the people's enthusiasm for being the master of the people.  Fourth, we should achieve the setup of the socialist legal  system. Without the legal system, there will be no guarantee  for the sustained, fast, and smooth progress of the national  economy. We should speed up the legislation to promote the  setup of the socialist market economic system, strengthen the  construction of the law enforcement worker contingents, attend  to the education on general knowledge of laws, and really ensure  that there are laws to abide by. Fifth, we should safeguard the  political and social stability of the capital just as we cherish  our eyes. This is of primary importance. Development creates  conditions for stability, and stability provides an environment  for development. One's existence depends on the another.    Chen Xitong stressed the necessity to vigorously advocate  the  tendencies of conducting investigations and study. Last year,  we did this for the whole year and made good achievements. This  year, we should continuously persist in it. This is a  fundamental duty for leading organs. The leading organs of the  municipal party committee and the municipal government,  departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, bureaus,  and all units should work out plans for investigations and  study. It will be possible to form a regular work method if we  persist in it for several years. Through investigations and  study, all units should report back as to what aspects they have  emancipated their minds in, what obstacles they have in grasping  favorable opportunities, what contradictions they should solve,  and what methods they should adopt to solve contradictions. All  these should be regarded as the main contents of the  investigation and study activities as well as the basis for  year-end examinations.    Li Qiyan urged that all departments should relay and  implement the guidelines of the meeting, readjust their own work  plans, divide their planned tasks to lower levels, and ensure  the implementation of the tasks. Before the Spring Festival, we  should further do solid and concrete deeds for the people;  achieve the things that have direct bearings on the personal  interests of the people, such as market supply and the supply of  gas, heat, and electricity; and also resolutely ban the setting  off of firecrackers.    Present at the meeting were some municipal leaders,  including  Zhang Jianmin, Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, Zhang Baifa, and Wang  Baosen.</p>

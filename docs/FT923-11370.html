			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Russians offer deep nuclear arms cuts FURTHER cuts in strategic nuclear missiles are possible beyond those already agreed between the US and Russia, but future negotiations must include the UK, France and China, General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said yesterday. Gen Grachev was speaking at the Royal United Services Institute at the end of a four-day visit to London. He said Russian scientists had estimated that further reductions below the 3,000-3,500 on each side agreed between the US and Russia this year were possible, on condition that the anti-ballistic missile treaty of 1972, which laid down strict guidelines on the deployment of defences against offensive nuclear missiles, was observed. If such cuts were to become a reality, however, Gen Grachev said weapons outside the US and Russia, would have to be considered. 'In our view, subsequent reduction of strategic offensive weapons should be considered as a multilateral process, and should consider the inter-relationship between cuts already made by the US and Russia, and weapons in Great Britain, France and China,' he said. Without the participation of these countries, Gen Grachev suggested, 'further reduction of nuclear weapons will become a destabilising factor not only for Russia, but for the whole world.' Gen Grachev said that Russia, which decided in May to set up its own national armed forces, no longer regarded any state in the world as its enemy. It believed that world peace should be preserved on the basis of a balance of mutual interest, rather than a balance of force, and was 'definitely against war as a means of reaching political and economic agreements.' Russia, however, was still committed to defending its independence and integrity, and would maintain its military strength at a level that ensured deterrence against any potential aggressor. He said that while the cold war was over, the threat of small, local conflicts had increased, especially in eastern Europe. Gen Grachev warned of leaders in other former Soviet republics who were 'playing the nationalist card, sometimes counter to the interests of their people.' Russia has agreed to become a founding member of a consortium to build a pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian sea region to world markets, joining Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and the Sultanate of Oman. Oman will arrange financing for the project, expected to cost between Dollars 700m and Pounds 1.5bn depending on choice of routes, with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia contributing labour, materials, equipment, and rights of way. The pipeline will be an important link between western markets and Kazakhstan, which recently signed a deal with Chevron, the US oil company, to develop the giant Tengiz oilfield.</p>

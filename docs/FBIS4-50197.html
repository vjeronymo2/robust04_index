			<p>BFN     [Text] On the invitation of (Oulette), speaker of the  Aquitaine Regional Assembly in France, the Hubei provincial  economic delegation led by Guan Guangfu held negotiations on  economic and technological issues with approximately 40 persons  in charge of the various departments of the region on the  evening of 8 May. They reached a consensus on six areas,  including economics, trade, science and technology, and talent  exchanges. Both sides held a solemn ceremony late at night on 9  May to commemorate the signing of the letter of intention on  establishing economic and technological cooperation ties.    The Aquitaine region is the world's largest wine and brandy  production base. Not only is the region developed in  agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but it also a  production base for high technology products, such as aircraft,  electronic, and medical equipment. The region attached great  importance to the Hubei economic delegation's current visit and  held a grand welcome banquet in honor of the delegation in the  small hours of the morning.    In a speech expressing his gratitude, Guan Guangfu said: The  relations between Hubei and the Aquitaine region should be like  the region's Garonne River and Hubei's Chang Jiang, both of  which flow endlessly. As one of China's new investment hot  spots, Hubei Province is pursuing the magnificent goal it  charted. It is both a construction site and a vast consumption  market. We can make up for each other's deficiencies by  developing strong points and striving for common development in  many areas.    Chinese Ambassador to France Cai Fangbo, his wife, and Chen  Jinren, chief representative to France of the China Council for  the Promotion of International Trade, attended the negotiations  and signing ceremony.</p>

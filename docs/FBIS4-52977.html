			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean  people want to punish the chief culprits in the Kwangju  bloodbath, they must overthrow the "civilian regime" of the  traitor Kim Yong-sam, too, urges NODONG SINMUN in a commentary  today.    The analyst says:    On the threshold of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju  popular uprising, the federation of the May 18 Kwangju popular  resistance of South Korea came out with the demand for the  punishment of the traitor Chon Tu-hwan and other chief culprits  of the Kwangju massacre.    The Kwangju bloodbath which was unprecedented in barbarity,  atrocity and ferocity, left in the hearts of the people  unquenchable grievances. But the demand of the people for a  probe into the truth of the incident and the punishment of the  chief murderers has not yet been met.    No Tae-u the puppet, the dictator of the "Sixth Republic,"  had "committed" himself to the solution of this problem before  he took office. But, he himself being a mastermind of the  Kwangju massacre, he hushed it up.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam who made "a fair solution of the  Kwangju problem" one of his "commitments" when taking power,  connived at and defended the criminals and bloodily cracked down  on the massive struggle of students and people demanding a probe  into the truth and punishment of the chief murderers by letting  loose hundreds of thousands of police.    Kim Yong-sam the traitor says quite often that he was "a  victim of the military dictatorship." But he is a turncoat and  political prostitute who made a strategic marriage with the  military dictatorial forces and clawed his way to power with  their backing.    The punishment of the chief culprits in the Kwangju massacre  is impossible with the Kim Yong-sam group, the "civilian  fascists" defending the Kwangju murderers, left alone.</p>

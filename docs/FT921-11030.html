			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Tories scorn Scots backing for home rule MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has dismissed the recent upsurge of support for Scottish independence as a temporary 'flicker of interest'. In a speech to Scottish Conservatives at the weekend he said Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament had failed to stand up to detailed scrutiny and, if implemented, would become 'an engine-room for complete separation which the Scottish National party seeks'. He added that the SNP's aim to make Scotland an independent country in the European Community would be 'the worst of all worlds'. Last week an ICM opinion poll indicated that 50 per cent of Scots wanted independence, the highest level ever. Mr Donald Dewar, Mr Lang's Labour shadow, accused the secretary of state of fuelling Scottish nationalism by an 'arrogant and obstinate' stance on home rule. He said: 'If he is genuinely worried about nationalism, he should not be stoking the fire in this way.' Mr Jim Sillars, SNP MP for Glasgow Govan, shrugged off the idea that Scots did not particularly care about independence - in spite of a recent poll in which independence was ranked sixth in importance behind issues such as unemployment and the National Health Service. On TV-am he said the SNP had managed to persuade people that independence was the key to meeting social and economic needs. A System Three opinion poll in Saturday's Glasgow Herald newspaper showed support for Labour at 38 per cent in Scotland, a drop of 9 percentage points on early January. The SNP was up 5 points at 26 per cent. Support for the Conservatives rose 2 points to 23 per cent, 1 point short of their share of the vote in the 1987 general election. Liberal Democrat supporters are split three ways over a hung parliament, according to a poll for BBC Television's Panorama programme tonight. NOP found that of 504 supporters, 29 per cent wanted a post-election deal with the Tories, 29 per cent with Labour and 31 per cent no deal with either. A separate poll, of nearly 1,000 voters, found 56 per cent supporting proportional representation, compared with 34 per cent wishing to keep the existing first-past-the-post system for elections.</p>

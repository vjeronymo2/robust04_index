			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Aida states that, subsequent to verification, it analyzed the year-end warranty cost adjustments discovered at verification, and concluded that only a portion thereof should be allocated to warranty cost. In its case brief, Aida presents a recalculation of the warranty expense factor, and asks that the Department use this revised factor to calculate warranty costs for the final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At verification, the Department discovered that Aida's records indicated an amount for additional warranty costs that Aida had not reported. At that time, Aida claimed that these costs were related to non-subject merchandise, but was unable to satisfactorily document this position. See sales verification report dated October 19, 1993, page 13. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to 19 CFR 353.31(a)(1)(ii), the time limit for submitting factual information in an administrative review is not later than the earlier of the date of publication of the notice of preliminary results of review or 180 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review. As Aida submitted its explanation of the additional unreported warranty expenses and recalculation of the warranty expense factor after the date of publication of the preliminary results, this information was untimely submitted. Therefore, we did not consider this information for these final results. As in the preliminary results of review, we used warranty costs as adjusted for the additional costs discovered at verification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Aida states that the Department erred in adding related-party commissions on U.S. sales to FMV, and offsetting the commissions by deducting home market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of the commissions. Aida believes that the Department should have treated the commissions as internal transfers, which do not require any adjustment to FMV or offsetting adjustment for indirect home market selling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Aida reported commissions to a related party that varied directly with the sale price of an MTP. We verified the commissions paid, and have no reason to believe that these directly related selling expenses were not, in fact, in the nature of commissions. The fact that these commissions were paid to a related party does not change their nature as commissions. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a), we are adjusting FMV for the differences in home market and U.S. commissions. Because there were commissions on both U.S. and home market sales, 19 CFR 353.56(b), which calls for an offset when there are commissions in one market but not the other, does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The  major tasks of this rural work conference held by the provincial  party committee are to further implement the guidelines of the  central rural work conference and the third plenary session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, analyze the agricultural and  rural situation under the socialist market economic conditions,  study and devise plans for strengthening the agricultural  foundation status, deepen rural reform and comprehensively  develop the rural economic work tasks during the last two years  of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and push the rural economy to a  new stage.  <H3>  1. Correctly Analyze the Agricultural and Rural Situation  and Realistically Strengthen the Agricultural Foundation Status </H3>   Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, our province has witnessed tremendous and profound  changes in agriculture and in the rural areas and achieved  historical progress in the rural economy. The total value of  agricultural production has shown an annual average increase of  11.4 percent, agricultural labor productivity has shown an  annual average increase of 14.7 percent, and the average per  capita net income of peasants has shown an annual increase of  8.3 percent and the food and clothing problems in the rural  areas have been basically solved. The eighth plenary session of  the sixth provincial party committee held in 1991  comprehensively summarized the agricultural and rural work  during the 13 years of reform and opening up, raised the  proposal of regarding the goal of becoming well-off as the  banner to guide rural work in line with the characteristics that  the rural economy has entered the stage of commodity production,  and defined the guiding ideology of "readjusting the structure,  raising efficiency, relying on science and education and  invigorating agriculture." After the eighth plenary session of  the sixth provincial party committee, the party committees and  governments at all levels adopted a series of important measures  to strengthen the agricultural foundation status and to  accelerate the development of the rural economy. We should  conscientiously implement the party's various rural principles  and policies; stabilize and improve the family-based  output-related contract responsibility system; establish the  main market operational status of peasants, township enterprises  and all sorts of rural economic organizations; strictly clear up  the burdens of peasants; set ceiling prices for the means of  production for agricultural use; exert efforts to solve the  problem of issuing IOU's for purchases of agricultural products;  protect and mobilize the production enthusiasm of peasants;  formulate and implement the strategic plans of coordinating  grain and livestock production with township enterprises,  foreign trade with industry and agriculture, agriculture with  science and education, and urban areas with rural areas;  flexibly readjust the rural economic structure of production  set-up and comprehensively develop the county economy; gradually  decontrol the prices of grains and agricultural products; strive  to organize agricultural production in line with market  guidance; cultivate and build a market system for agricultural  products; place township enterprises in a strategic position of  the rural economy; promote the shareholding cooperative system;  establish small industrial areas, link the urban areas with the  rural areas; give priority to solving the difficult problems of  funds, items, and personnel and promote a sustained and speedy  increase of township enterprises; uphold the strategy of using  science and education to invigorate agriculture; make overall  plans to combine agriculture with science and education; carry  out comprehensive agricultural development and enable  agriculture to move toward the orientation of high-yield, high  quality, and highly-efficient farming; give great emphasis to  some policies and investments; support rich counties to  accelerate development, and support poor counties to shake off  poverty and become rich; give play to the advantage of border  development; establish farm products export, production, and  processing bases and actively develop export-oriented farming;  expand the degree of changing the operational mechanism of  industrial and commercial enterprises; transform county-run  industrial units into state-owned people-run units or  people-owned and people-run units and enhance the vitality of  county economy; consolidate and improve the rural party  branches, perfect village supporting organizations, conduct  activities on running townships in line with the law; conduct  ideological education focusing on enhancing the sense of  commodity and strengthening the confidence in becoming well-off  and strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the  rural areas and of the party's grass-roots organizations;  strengthen the functions of counties to take overall  responsibility over local economic work; change from simply  grasping agriculture into comprehensively developing all rural  industries and from paying attention to financial revenue into  cultivating financial resources and enable all kinds of economic  sectors and all industries in counties to compete with one  another during development; adopt the work method of using  typical cases to lead the way, giving different guidance  according to the merits of different cases and carrying out the  work in the whole region; and give specific work guidance  according to the characteristics of different economic  ownerships and regional development and raise the overall level  of rural work.    We can say that in the past two years, the province has had  a  clear idea about rural development, effectively organized and  guided agricultural and rural work, made the biggest strides for  rural reform, and made the fastest economic development. In  1993, the province turned out 23.91 billion kilograms of grain,  setting a historical record. The total grain output increased,  the grain structure was improved, the grain quality was  upgraded, and the efficiency from grain output increased. The  diversified economy dominated by animal husbandry was  comprehensively developed. The diversified economic output  value accounted for more than 30 percent of the total  agricultural output value. Town and township enterprises  developed at a rapid speed. In the first 10 months of this  year, the town and township enterprises' output value, profits,  and tax revenues respectively increased by 68.1 percent, 71.3  percent, and 75.2 percent. The town and township enterprises  have become a half of the rural economy. Great headway was made  in export-oriented agriculture. The proportion of farm and  sideline products in the foreign export trade volume was close  to 30 percent. Each of the five major farm products created more  than $10 million foreign exchange from exports. The per capita  net income of the peasants reached about 1,000 yuan. The  increase rate of the per capita net income of the peasants was  higher than the national average level for two consecutive  years. The total output value of the rural society increased by  double digits. The county economy made more contributions to  the province. More than 70 percent of the newly added portions  of the total output value of society were created by the county  economy. Generally speaking, the agricultural and rural  situation continued to develop along with a good orientation.    Although the province has made great headway in agriculture  and rural work and the agricultural and rural work has tended to  develop in a sustained, fast, and healthy manner, many new  conditions and problems emerged in the course of system reform.  We are still confronted with many contradictions that should  urgently be solved in the course of realizing the fairly  well-off target. The main contradictions are as follows: Our  province has relatively abundant natural resources, but the  degree of overall development is not high. Our province is a  key grain production area as well as a large agricultural  province. The output of major farm and sideline products ranks  the province among the first 10 in the whole country. The deep  development and the overall utilization of the farm and sideline  products cannot keep pace with the increase in the total output.  The province is still in the stage of producing raw materials  and preliminarily processing major products. As a result, the  rural economic results are reduced by a big margin. The  commodity rate of the farm and sideline products continue to  increase when the development and setup of markets are  relatively slow. More than 60 percent of the province's farm  and sideline products are marketable. Due to the failure to  develop and set up markets and effectively coordinate production  and management with domestic and foreign markets and affected by  the fact that the supply and demand of ordinary farm and  sideline products are even at home, the phenomena that the  circulation of farm and sideline products is blocked still  prominent exist. Thus, it is difficult to make the rural  economic operation suit the demands for socialized production  and unified markets. Due to the failure to effectively guide  and organize the rural decentralized management, agricultural  production and management are neither keen to the reaction of  markets nor closely related to the market demands. As a result,  it is difficult to have some products become readily marketable,  to make some natural resources gain economic advantages, and to  create large-scale economic results from the rural economy. Due  to the slow development of nonagriculture, a large number of  agricultural laborers have become unemployed. Affected by the  traditional agricultural forms and restricted by production  conditions, we made a late start in developing such  nonagricultural industries as rural circulation trade, labor  service trade, and town and township enterprises. As a result,  increasingly more surplus labor forces due to the decrease in  the per capita are transferred to other jobs at a slow speed.  With a weak sense of the commodity economy, the nonagricultural  industries lack motivation for development. With dual risks,  the agricultural front lacks appropriate support and protection  measures. Due to the insufficient input to agriculture, the  weak infrastructural facilities, the high agricultural social  benefit, and the low comparable effect, we are confronted with  increasingly more risks in resisting natural disasters and  developing markets. The mechanisms for supporting and  protecting agriculture have not yet taken shape. So, the price  difference between industrial and agricultural products become  widened, the per capita income of the peasants increase at a  slow speed, the rural economy is short of reserve strength for  development, and the tasks for improving agricultural production  conditions become heavier. These contradictions and problems  indicate that if we fail to consider agriculture and rural work  from a high level, to emphatically enhance the basic position of  agriculture, and to optimize the structure of rural industries,  it will be impossible for the rural economy to have a sustained  and rapid growth. If we fail to unswervingly orient the rural  economy onto the track of the market economy and to organize  agricultural production and management truly according to the  law of the market economy, it will be impossible for the rural  economy to maintain its protracted vigor. These contradictions  and problems, which in some cases have cropped up or developed  in the course of shifting systems, must be dealt with by relying  on deepening the reform. Those that have been caused by  underdeveloped productive forces require us to fully regard  development as a mandatory principle.    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy.  Improving agriculture to a new level represents a foundation  for fulfilling the second and third strategic targets, and  increasing per peasant income represents a foundation for the  society as a whole to reach the better-off level. The CPC  Central Committee and the State Council have always attached  great importance on agriculture and on problems encountered by  rural areas and peasants. After the rural reform program was  personally led and organized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping -- which  has a historical significance -- he presented a series of  brilliant expositions on rural reform and development and  pointed out that the basic position of agriculture in the  national economy will never be changed; that rural stability can  decide the stability of the country as a whole; and that rural  reform can affect and promote urban reforms. He also pointed  out that agriculture is not only an important economic issue,  but also an important political one; in developing the rural  economy, we should rely first on the policies, second on science  and technology, and third on inputs; and that it is imperative  to enhance the party's leadership over agriculture and the rural  work. In line with the persistent thinking of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, the third-generation central leading collective with  Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has enhanced the agricultural  position; developed the rural economy; and protected peasants'  interests over the past four years by adopting many important  and major measures. Heilongjiang is a large province that is  endowed with agricultural resources and its rural economy and  county economy occupy an important position in the province's  economic pattern. It has more new economic growing points than  other provinces, which represents the part that has large  potential and vigor in affecting the economic development  throughout the province. Only by boosting the rural economy can  we promote the province's economy to achieve faster and better  development. The rural economy is encountering an opportunity  in which its development can be quickened. Along with  implementing the spirit of the central rural work conference and  the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the understanding of units from top to bottom across  the province regarding the enhancement of the basic position of  agriculture will become more clear and definite; their  confidence in successfully conducting agriculture and rural work  will be further enhanced; and agriculture, peasants, and rural  work will be emphasized. The central and provincial authorities  have adopted a series of important measures and every possible  way and means to develop the rural economy and to increase  peasants' income. All of this will further bring into play the  enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, enable agricultural  production to exert more potential, have the province's rural  commodity economy achieve greater development, enable the  economic and industrial structures to become rational, obviously  upgrade the comprehensive productive capability, and have the  province basically possess the material foundation for achieving  sustained and fast development. We must seize the currently  favorable opportunity. In line with the demands of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, we should deeply  understand and implement the important expositions of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping with regard to agriculture and rural work;  overcome the blind optimism on the consecutive bumper harvests;  prevent the trend of neglecting agriculture; and realistically  enhance the agricultural production and the rural work. We  should also do a good job in organizing the rural reform of 1994  and the enforcement of tasks for developing agriculture and  strive to enable the rural economy to be improved to a new level  during the "Eight Five-Year Plan" period and to have the rural  outlook be improved. This requires us to resolutely and  unswervingly implement the principle of regarding agriculture as  a foundation, to unswervingly place agriculture on the first  position of economic work, to continuously hold high the banner  of becoming better-off, to accelerate the establishment of  economic operation mechanism that is suitable to the demands of  the socialist market economy, to quicken the development of  rural productive forces and the county economy, and to enable  rural areas and peasants to become wealthy as soon as possible.  <H3>  2. Deepen the Rural Economic Restructuring and Turn Rural  Economy to the Socialist Market Economy Before Others </H3>   The central rural work conference and the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have already defined  the objectives and general ideas for the rural reform. In line  with the demands of the central authorities, we must accelerate  the pace of rural reform, with focus on stabilizing the rural  management system, cultivating the mainstay of market, improving  market system, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control. At the same time, we must rapidly establish a rural  economic managerial system and operational mechanism that are  suitable for the socialist market economy.    A. We should stabilize and perfect the rural managerial  system, energetically develop the shareholding cooperative  economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of market. The  household-based output-related contract responsibility system  and the dual management system that integrates household  operation with collective operation are the basic policy of the  party in the countryside as well as the basic economic system in  the countryside, and thus they must be carried out protractedly.  The originally defined land contract relations in various  localities should be stabilized and extended for another 30  years without changes. The period of contracts of a development  nature, such as reclaiming barren land, building forest land,  preventing the land from becoming sandy, and improving the  fertility of soil, should be extended for another 50 years.  Within the contracted period, we should carry out the method of  "increasing persons but not land and reducing persons but not  land." In conducting the appropriate-scale management of land,  we should establish a land turnover mechanism compatible with  the demands of market economy on the prerequisite of developing  non-agricultural industries accordingly and promoting reasonable  flow of rural labor forces. This requires us to consolidate  ownership, stabilize contract right, enliven the right to use,  and allow peasants to transfer on a paid basis, to lease, and to  mortgage the land use right and to buy shares in order to enable  peasants to independently solve the contradictions between  different persons in line with the changes in management  conditions and in accordance with the law of market and in order  to raise the distribution efficiency of land resources. The  non-agricultural industries develop more rapidly than others.  The localities, that have conditions in various fields, may  carry out the appropriate-scale management in line with the  wills of peasants by proceeding from reality, but should not  force all the peasants to join the management. We should strive  to enhance the economic strength of the village-level  collectives and strengthen the overall planning and service  functions of the village-level collectives. The shareholding  cooperative system is a new invented system to adapt peasants to  market mechanism and to accelerate the development of rural  economy, and is another major reform in the rural management  system. This year, the development trend of the shareholding  cooperative system in the province's rural areas has been very  good. We must utilize this good trend to spread this system by  regarding it as a major measure to accelerate the reform and  development of the rural areas. At present, we should mainly  spread this system among town and township enterprises. The  newly initiated town and township enterprises should all adopt,  in principle, this system. At the same time, we should use this  system to renovate existing town and township enterprises to  change the confusion in property right and the lack of funds.  We should use about two years of time to change more than half  of village collective enterprises to shareholding cooperative  enterprises. We should also extend the shareholding cooperative  system to the spheres of the serial development of the cropping  industry, the circulation of agricultural and sideline products,  and the rural collectivized service. All kinds of economic  organizations, institutions of higher learning, scientific  research institutes, and peasants should be allowed to buy  shares with funds, equipment, plant houses, technology, land,  and labor forces. In spreading the shareholding cooperative  system, we must give guidances based on respective cases. The  areas which have not yet introduced the shareholding cooperative  system should try the system first and then popularize it as  quickly as possible. The areas which are experimenting with  this system should primarily reduce the restrictions on policies  and allow peasants to carry it out freely. The areas which have  achieved relatively great progress in carrying out the system  should be guided in a timely manner to deepen towards the  orientation of standardization and systemization with the  purpose of gradually making their distribution of shares  reasonable, their organizational structure perfect, their  management system perfect, and their profit distribution  appropriate.    B. We should accelerate the establishment of socialized  service system and gradually realize all-process socialized  service to production, operation, distribution, and consumption.  Since the household-based contract system was instituted,  socialized service networks composed of rural collective  economic organizations, agriculture-related departments, and  various intermediate organizations have been improved step by  step and have made great contributions to rural economic  development. However, the service functions and service scope  of these service organizations still fall far short of the  demand for developing rural productive forces. The service  entities run by peasants are not well organized, and  village-level service are universally uncoordinated. The  quality of service provided by county and township agricultural  departments has weakened, the service of agriculture-related  departments is at a low level, and the degree of socialization  of the entire service system is not high. To solve the  above-mentioned problems and make independent operations more  compatible with the unified market, we should regard  establishment of the socialized service system as an industry to  develop. Agriculture, science and technology, commerce, grain,  supply and marketing, finance, and material departments should  adhere to the purpose of serving agriculture and peasants,  actively explore the fields of service, strengthen their service  functions, coordinate their services, and establish a sound  service network by combining the supplies of funds and means of  production, the dissemination of technology, and technical  training before production, the technical and operational  guidance during production, and the processing, storage,  transportation, and marketing after production. We should give  play to the role of rural production and managerial experts,  encourage and support them to operate or establish service  organizations or service entities, and gradually turn the  service organizations run by peasants into specialized  associations performing the functions of self-service and  self-protection. We should improve community service  organizations, provide particular assistance for the townships  and villages with weak collective economy to establish service  organizations, and guide them to gradually enhance their service  strength and improve their service level by starting with  technical service and expanding their collective economy. We  should step up efforts to improve county and township  agriculture stations (centers), update their technology and  equipment in a planned manner, strive to increase the wages of  agricultural scientific and technical personnel, provide  grass-roots agriculture-related units with necessary means of  service, enable their technical personnel to have ease of mind  in their service work, and continuously improve their service  quality. After this, we should establish a provincewide  socialized service pattern with sound organizations and  functions.    C. We should lift control on and protect the prices of farm  products and cultivate and establish the market system more  rapidly in order to provide favorable conditions for developing  the rural commodity economy. The key to cultivating and  building rural markets is to let the prices of farm products  take shape chiefly through the market. To establish a new  mechanism for the prices of farm products, enliven rural  circulation, and increase peasants' income, the province,  beginning next year, will keep the amount of grain to be  purchased under contract unchanged and purchase all the  contracted amount of grain at market price. When the market is  lower than the state-fixed protection price, we will purchase at  the protection price. We will continue the method of paying  extra money for peasants to cover the difference between the  government prices and the market prices of chemical fertilizers  and diesel oil supplied to peasants according to their  purchasing contracts and supply them with chemical fertilizers,  diesel oil, and deposits linked to the contracted purchase in a  timely manner. We should do a good job in the coordination and  preparations for the reform of the grain purchasing and  marketing system, regard it the priority of next year's work to  improve the grain markets and the marketing contingents,  establish the grain risk fund system as soon as possible, and  improve the grain reserve system. The prices of all farm and  sideline products will be lifted in the future, business  channels will be liberalized, and all obstacles will be removed  so as to provide equal opportunities and environment to various  business organizations and peasants. Establishment of the  market system is the basis of the market economy. We should  develop, cultivate, and build markets more rapidly. With  wholesale markets as the center and rural fairs as the  supplement, We should establish as soon as possible a framework  of the market system under which the markets for commodities and  the markets for essential elements of production are developed  in a coordinated manner, rural areas are linked with urban  areas, and markets are rationally distributed, have sound  organizations and complete functions, exercise standard  management, and are highly efficient and unimpeded. The  provincial authorities should give priority to building the  agricultural product wholesale markets and the futures markets  to serve the whole country; all cities and towns should give  priority to building agricultural product special wholesale  markets with local superiority; and all townships and towns  should give priority to building country trade fairs. We should  actively cultivate the markets of essential production factors,  such as the markets of banking, property right, technology,  information, and labor forces. In cultivating and building  markets, we must manage things in line with market law, give  full consideration to conditions for the flow of commodities and  personnel and for collection and distribution of commodities,  extensively conduct activities to invite business, and persist  in making scientific plans and seeking gradual development. We  should strengthen the building of infrastructure facilities,  including telecommunications, road and warehouses, develop  banking, insurance, notary, commercial, catering, and service  industries and give priority to improving the conditions of  special wholesale markets which have attained an initial scale.  We should improve the laws and regulations for market  transactions, business activities and market competition,  establish arbitration organs to settle disputes in transaction  and in honoring of contracts, set norms to keep the market  business within proper bounds, and protect fair transactions and  legal competitions. Meanwhile, we should be determined to  cultivate and develop a batch of contingents to sell farm  products and major products of township enterprises, give  priority to supporting major commodity circulation units,  develop intermediary organs, continue to give play to the role  of state and cooperative commercial units as the main  circulation channels, do a good job in linking production with  the market, and invigorate commodity circulation in the rural  areas.    D. We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation  and control of the rural economy and promote a sound rural  economic development. It is impossible for the market mechanism  to spontaneously strengthen the agricultural foundation status.  In the process of establishing the socialist market economic  system, we must strive to strengthen and improve the  government's macroeconomic regulation and control over  agriculture. Governments at all levels should stand on the high  plane of taking overall responsibility, act in line with their  functions of "guidance, support, protection and macro regulation  and control," follow the law of value, apply the economic  levers, and give correct and effective control over rural  economic performance. We should grasp the trend of agricultural  development and market changes, make rational plans and readjust  the distribution of rural productive forces and promote an  coordinated development in various trades and regions and  between the economic and social sectors. We should regard such  major affairs as the readjustment of the proportion of  industrial and agricultural investments, the agricultural  investment structure, major agricultural capital construction  projects, the price parities between industrial and agricultural  products, the readjustment of rural production set-up, and the  development of industry to support agriculture that affect the  overall situation as the priorities of regulation and control  and adopt more economic and legal means to manage agricultural  production. We should strengthen rural economic legislation,  gradually improve regulations and laws on supporting  agricultural development, protecting agriculture and  safeguarding the interests of peasants, deeply carry out the  work on running villages and townships in line with law, and  raise the degree of standardization of rural economic  performance and the level of legality. We should strengthen the  building of rural market information system, develop information  research and consulting organs of various ownerships in a  planned manner, do a good job in market forecast for  agricultural products and information dissemination and induce  peasants to develop agricultural production in line with market  changes. Continued efforts should be made to promote  comprehensive reform pilot work in counties and urge pilot  counties to further emancipate the minds, expand the reform  strength, take the lead in establishing market economic  operational mechanism and set examples in county reform for the  whole province.  <H3>  3. Hold Aloft the Banner of Becoming Well-Off, Accelerate  the Development of County Economy and Strive To Build a  Prosperous and Civilized New Countryside </H3>   In a final analysis, the issues of agriculture, the rural  areas and peasants are the issues of development. Realizing the  goal of becoming well-off is a common desire and new pursuit of  the broad masses of peasants after they have enough food and  clothing as well as the fundamental motivation for accelerating  the development of agriculture and the rural economy. The core  of development is to unceasingly increase the income of  peasants. This is a major change in the idea of rural  development. Party committees and governments at all levels  should consider accelerating the development of rural productive  forces and county economy and unceasingly increasing the income  of peasants as the fundamental starting and resting points of  rural work.    A. We should vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality,  high-efficient, and export-oriented agriculture in line with the  demands of domestic and foreign markets to increase the rural  economic results. Over the past years, particularly this year,  under the guidance of markets, all localities have positively  developed and produced various good-quality farm and sideline  products that are suitable to the consumption demands and have  made noticeable achievements in increasing production and  economic results. Facts fully showed that the development of  high-yield, good-quality, high-efficient, and export-oriented  agriculture is an essential demand of the tendency for suiting  the market demands and the changes of the foodstuff structure,  ensuring a stable increase in the output of basic farm products,  and comprehensively improving the agricultural production level  as well as an accurate choice to optimize the internal  agricultural structure and increase the rural economic results.  So, we are required to shift the focus of agricultural  production from the increase in quantities to the improvement of  quality and to increase agriculture's economic results through  readjustment of the agricultural structure. On the basis of  stabilizing development and optimizing grain production, we  should vigorously develop readily marketable cash crops and  forage crops and ceaselessly increase the benefits from grain  production and the overall utilization rate of natural  resources. We should persist in the target of building animal  husbandry into a pillar industry of the rural economy; focus on  developing the breeding of milk cow, meat cattle, lean hogs, and  poultry; promote the coordination of agriculture and animal  husbandry to increase the output value through transformation;  and strive to make our province become a large grain and  livestock production province. We should fully use mountain,  water, forest, grass, and mineral resources and bring into play  the advantages of suburban areas, the areas along both sides of  roads, and gardens to develop the cash crops and breeding  industries that have big markets, to develop new production  spheres, and to expand new revenue sources. Our province has  the advantages of opening its border areas to the outside world.  This is a favorable condition for developing the  export-oriented agriculture. According to the international  market demands, we should set up, in a well-planned manner, a  group of export farm product production and processing bases;  expand the production of readily marketable products;  ceaselessly improve the quality and standing of commodities;  strive to increase the proportion of export farm products; and  increase the market competitiveness.    B. We should persistently pay equal attention to development  and improvement, vigorously develop town and township  enterprises, and accelerate the pace of industrializing the  countryside. Our province has rich natural resources, registers  a faster increase in the total output of farm products, and has  favorable conditions for developing town and township  enterprises. However, the farm product processing and  utilization rate is rather low. This indicates that the town  and township enterprises have great potential for development.  Although our province has speeded up the development of town  and township enterprises, their results are not high, only a  small number of town and township enterprises are engaged in  industrial production, their product standing is low, and their  market competitiveness is weak. The strains on capital,  projects, and skilled persons still restrict the development of  town and township enterprises. We must unswervingly regard the  development of town and township enterprises as a strategic  priority of the economic work; persist in the principle of  paying equal attention to development and improvement;  vigorously carry out the "leap-over project;" strive to ensure  that the town and township enterprises realize more than 70  billion yuan of output value by the end of 1995; and improve, at  the same pace, output value, results, and enterprise quality.  To this end, we must persistently coordinate the setup of  high-tech and export-oriented town and township enterprises with  large markets with that of town and township enterprises with  fewer investment and faster economic results so as to support  the development of town and township enterprises. We should  strengthen the construction of projects for town and township  enterprises; cultivate a group of specialized ranks engaged in  the development of projects; and develop high-tech processing  projects with high market demands, fewer investment, and faster  efficiency so as to provide timely service for town and township  enterprises. All localities should be geared to the needs of  markets, continue to bring into play the advantages of natural  resources, and try every possible means to build a group of  projects with fewer investment and faster economic results.  Being based on this, the province, prefectures, cities, and  counties should concentrate necessary funds and technological  forces to establish and develop a group of large-scale town and  township enterprises with high starting points and to strengthen  the lineup of key town and township enterprises. We should  develop small industrial zones of town and township enterprises  and increase their economic results. In township enterprise  investment, we should particularly ensure the construction of  small industrial zones, and concentrate fairly high starting  points for new township enterprises there. In small industrial  zones with favorable conditions, we should establish township  enterprise groups that have advantages in their scale, in a  timely manner. We should also greatly increase the proportion  of town and township industries. We should develop both  resources, new products, and industries and facilitate the  scientific and technological advance of township enterprises.  We should formulate and implement the brand-name strategy for  developing township enterprises, accelerate the development of  new products and the improvement of key products, actively bring  in and disseminate applicable advanced technology, and enable  township enterprises to develop a series of products. Meanwhile,  we should establish the personnel markets in service of township  enterprises, resolve township enterprises' shortage of personnel  by training some operation experts, bringing in some backbone  technical personnel, and selecting some managerial personnel,  and strive to improve the technological quality of township  enterprises and increase the competitive edges of their  products. We should raise funds on our own through various  channels and bring in funds from outside to increase the money  investment in township enterprises. The 2-billion-yuan  investment in township enterprises we arranged for next year  should be in place, the major part of the accumulation of rural  collective economy should be used in developing township  enterprises, and townships, villages, enterprises, and peasants  should be mobilized continuously to raise funds by themselves to  develop the processing industry. Finance departments at all  levels should earmark a certain amount of funds to pay the  interest of the loans for township enterprises. All finance  organizations should adopt every means possible to lend money to  township enterprises and, at the same time, take advantage of  geographical position and blood relation to conscientiously  implement the "township enterprise demonstration project in  eastern and western parts," extensively develop joint operation  and cooperation with developed localities, and bring in more  funds for townships, villages, and township enterprises. We  should further improve the operating mechanism of township  enterprises and enhance township enterprises' ability for market  competition. We should reform the internal managerial system,  strengthen the status of township enterprise directors and  managers as representatives of legal persons, and change the  situation in which township enterprises are attached to  governments and there are too many administrative interventions.  Focusing on increasing the market shares of the products of  township enterprises, we should also launch in-depth activities  to improve product quality and increase the marketing rate of  products and the profit-tax rate of output value, and strengthen  the production and management of the enterprises. We should  conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for  attaining the targets of supporting township enterprises and  launch extensive activities to link urban and rural areas.  Departments directly under the province should define and  implement their supporting measures as soon as possible  according to the targets and work assigned them. In line with  the principles of mutual benefit, mutual supplementation with  each other's advantages, and common development, universities,  large research institutes, and large plants should focus their  coordination and cooperation activities on arming small  industrial zones so as to support the sustained and rapid  development of township enterprises.    C. We should implement regional distribution and specialized  production, establish the production and operation systems  whereby trade, industry, and agriculture are integrated and  production, processing, marketing a coordinated process, and  improve the industrialization of the rural economy. Selecting  and establishing the leading industries and highly competitive  products with regional comparable advantage is the premise of  participation in domestic and foreign market competition; and  organizing specialized and large-scale production according to  the demand for socialized production is the basis to win the  regional comparable advantage. Geared to the domestic and world  markets, we should adopt every means to develop, cultivate, and  expand our advantageous industries and products, improve the  level of rural industries, and extend the industrial chains.  Judging from the situation of the province, we should exert  great efforts to develop the intensive processing of such staple  grain crops as corns and soybeans, such major economic crops as  flax and beets, such animal by-products as milk, meat, and  feathers, and such natural resources as forests and mineral  reserves. In this way, we can develop a series of finely  processed foods, feed, flax cloth, dairy products, sugar,  tobacco, leather, furniture, soft drinks, medicines, and  building materials to increase the value of farm products. In  line with their advantages in natural resources, products, and  technology, all cities, prefectures, and counties should work  out good plans for developing their local economy so that  respective guiding industries and superior products dominate,  should organize and guide peasants to do business centering on  guiding industries and key products, should advocate the  practice of "one village engaging in one product and one  township engaging in one trade," and should develop specialized  production and scale management. To increase industrialization  of the rural economy, we must focus on establishing a production  and management system characterized by a close combination of  cropping, breeding, and processing of production, supply, and  marketing, of internal and foreign trade, and of agriculture,  industry, and commerce. We should also accelerate the  development of organizations that integrate industry and  agriculture with foreign trade. Working to form a framework in  three years and perfecting mechanism in five years, the province  should emphatically grasp the work concerning the organizations  which produce, process, and market product series with grain,  flex, dairy products, and beets as their raw materials.  Meanwhile, all cities and prefectures should emphatically  cultivate trade-industry-agriculture integrations embracing  local industrial and product advantages. All counties and  townships should give full play to the role of corporations,  associations, and able persons to help improve the management  efficiency of existing integrated organizations. In building  and developing trade-industry-agriculture organizations, we must  break with the limits of administrative division and integrate  raw materials production belts and processing bases with  commodity distributing centers in order to commonly develop  production-processing-marketing integrations. Meanwhile, we  must emphatically cultivate and strengthen leading enterprises;  accelerate the development of new products and markets,  technological transformation, and the change in the operating  mechanism of these enterprises; and enable these enterprises to  play an even greater role in bringing along a number of  specialized villages and specialized households and in running a  number of production bases. In addition, we must pay attention  to the profit linking of trade-industry-agriculture integrations  and develop the economic groups that share risks and profits and  that are closely connected, in line with the principle of  improving efficiency. State farms are an important component  part of the rural economy and are provided with relatively good  conditions for developing rural industries and large-scale  production. We should continue to deepen the restructuring of  state farms and reinforce the position of production and  management organizations as the mainstay of markets. We should  exploit overall advantages to appropriately promote large-scale  management around the development of guiding industrial series.  Centering on improving economic efficiency, we should develop  diversified management and fine and deep processing, initiate  secondary and tertiary industries, make great efforts to  increase accumulation, and continuously improve the living  standards of staff and workers. We should also continue to  organize the "state farm-county joint building" activities and  exploit the demonstration role of state farms.    D. We should further integrate agriculture with science and  education and make great efforts to increase the technology  content of agricultural products and to improve the scientific,  technological, and cultural quality of peasants. A decisive  factor for the sustained increase in total output of the  province's agricultural products, for the constant improvement  in the quality of agricultural products, and for the rapid  development of the province's rural economy lies in the  successful implementation of the strategy of invigorating  agriculture with science and education for many years running.  Next year, we must implement in an even better manner the  measure of invigorating agriculture through science and  education and must further orient the development of rural areas  to the orbit of depending on scientific and technological  progress and improving the quality of laborers.    With the improvement in the quality of agricultural products  and in economic efficiency of agriculture as the center, and  with the development of fine products and the popularization of  practical technology as the emphasis, we should seize the  opportunity provided by the readjustment of the agricultural  product mix and rural economic structure to further enhance the  level of integrating agriculture with science and education,  expand from the integrations within our own regions to the  integrations with other regions, and expand integration in the  agricultural sphere to the non-agricultural sphere. We should  expand the integrations from single-item technologies to  comprehensive technologies. We should further expand the scale  of agriculture-science-education integrations. The integrations  should be made universal gradually in the province's rural areas  while paying attention to the work of some counties and  townships where the integrations are being experimented with.  We should further improve the quality of  agriculture-science-education integration. Agricultural  departments should continue to organize the implementation of  the "bumper harvest plan," expand the coverage of areas applying  advanced practical technologies, and define in a timely manner,  the joint-research projects that may promote the progress of  agriculture. In line with the demands of agricultural  development, scientific research departments should organize  forces to strengthen the selection and cultivation of new breeds  of animals and plants of good quality, high output, and high  resistance to diseases. We should strengthen research in  stay-fresh, storage, package, and transport techniques for  agricultural products and foodstuffs; strengthen implementation  of the "spark" plan; vigorously develop brand-name,  fine-quality, special, and new products; and successfully run  new agricultural high-tech park zones and practical technology  demonstration zones. Educational departments should increase  the number of labor and technology courses among rural middle  schools in line with the process of popularizing advanced  agricultural techniques, conduct adult education with a focus on  improving the technological expertise of peasants, and train all  kinds of specialized talents for developing the rural economy.    E. Efforts should be made to increase inputs in agriculture,  to enhance the construction of agricultural infrastructures, and  to reinforce the reserve strength of agricultural development.  We should be determined to readjust the distributing pattern of  national income and truly to enforce special policies for  agriculture. The increased scale of financial spending budget  for agriculture in 1994 should surpass that of the total  financial spending budget by over two percentage points. Funds  raised by localities for supporting agriculture should show a 10  percent increase each year and loans released for agriculture  should show a 20 percent increase. Various loans and funds for  supporting agriculture must be assuredly released in a timely  manner and in line with the fixed volume. In order to meet the  reform in the investment systems, it is imperative to expand the  investment channels for agriculture while doing a good job in  conducting reform among the rural financial organs; and to  encourage peasants and rural collectively-owned enterprises to  increase their accumulations through labor work and their funds  for investments. It is also imperative to encourage peasants  and these collectively-owned enterprises to broaden their fund  resources by increasing the charges of non-agricultural land and  to enliven their rural funds by successfully operating rural  credit cooperatives and establishing cooperative foundations.  Efforts should be made to enhance the management over  agricultural funds, to upgrade the efficiency of fund  utilization, and to prevent fund outflow and illegal diversion.  By upholding the farmland capital construction with the focal  points of improving soil, taming rivers, and planting trees, we  should concentrate our efforts on building a large number of  large and backbone projects of preventing flood; draining  flooded fields; conducting irrigation; generating power; storing  water; and diverting river water while accomplishing the repair,  rebuilding, and improvement of the existing water conservancy  facilities. Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace in  consolidating the serious soil erosion in some areas; to regard  as a focal point the tree planting aimed at greening the waste  mountains; to accelerate the pace of fostering forests alongside  water areas, used as a shelter for agricultural production, and  aimed at maintaining the water resources; and to pay attention  to developing the follow-up resources of forestry. A good job  should be continuously done in carrying out comprehensively  agricultural development on the Sanjiang and Songnen plains,  accelerating the improvement of medium-and-low-yield farmland  and of grassland, continuously fostering soil fertility,  protecting farmland, and improving the agricultural ecological  environment. When formulating their economic and social  development plans, various localities should give preferential  consideration to the construction of rural infrastructures and  do a good job in carrying out an overall design. They should  also integrate the improvement of agricultural productive  conditions with the agricultural development, the project  construction with the ecological construction, farm machines and  agricultural technologies with land utilization and maintenance,  and the improvement of peasants' living conditions and the  ecological environment with the construction of new rural  villages so as to improve the province's construction of rural  infrastructures to a new level.    F. Efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of  small towns, to further enforce the integration between urban  and rural areas, and to promote the harmonious development  between the urban and rural economy. Small towns are major  carriers of secondary and tertiary industries and represent a  fundamental way to realize the urbanization of rural areas.  Party committees and governments at all levels should regard  the construction of small towns as a strategic measure of  developing the rural economy and the county economy and put the  construction on their major work schedule. They should strive  to enable the province's construction of small towns to achieve  greater development by the end of this century and foster or  establish a large number of star towns that possess their own  characteristics, have obvious strong points, are exerting large  influence, and are stronger in playing a role of bringing along  others. Efforts should be made to further improve the plan for  small town construction, to make rational arrangements, to make  breakthroughs in key areas, to enforce the plan step by step, to  give priority to building up the county seats in the recent  period, and to emphatically develop organic towns along border  areas as well as railways and highways. We should uphold the  principle of developing industries to build up towns and to make  them prosperous and integrate the construction of small towns  with the development of processing and tertiary industries. We  should also enforce preferential policies in this regard and  direct the rural cooperative economic organizations to open an  enterprise in urban areas and the secondary and tertiary  industrial enterprises in rural areas to jointly move in small  towns. Efforts should be made to encourage peasants to join in  industrial work in urban areas, to open a business such as food  services, and to engage in the undertakings of transportation  and construction so as to reinforce the cohesion and influence  of small towns. In order to promote the construction of small  towns and the development of secondary and tertiary industries,  county seats may adequately broaden their scale as long as they  have achieved faster development in the economy and basically  possessed the conditions in various fields. We should  emancipate our minds and actively conduct the pilot work of  reform among the systems of urban resident registers. Peasants  who are running industrial plants or business firms in urban  areas as well as who have bought a house there, had a relatively  stable job, and paid a certain volume of urban construction  fees, may be allowed to become urban residents and their family  registers may be put into ordinary management.    G. We should step up efforts to promote the reform of  county-run industrial enterprises by turning them into ones  owned by the state but managed by the people or ones owned and  managed by the people and greatly develop individual and private  economies to cultivate and expand the county-level financial  resources. The reform of the financial and tax systems to be  promoted by the state next year will create some new conditions  in the county-level finance. An important link to conform to  the new conditions is to cultivate and open up new financial  resources. County-run state-owned industrial enterprises  constitute an important factor affecting county-level finance.  To make county-run industrial enterprises successful, the  provincial party committee, in August this year, held a forum on  the reform of state-owned small industrial enterprises, deciding  to combine the property right reform of the county-run  industrial enterprises with their technical transformation to  remold their systems and organizations. However, the work has  proceeded in an uneven manner. Effective measures should be  adopted to promote it more greatly. Judging from long-term  development, domestic and foreign funds and technology should be  used to renovate the enterprises who possess advantages in their  products and whose economic efficiency is fairly good. The  cooperative shareholding system should be applied to those whose  products are still marketable but have no good prospects, and  they should be leased or sold out to have their property right  transferred and organization innovated. Those whose assets  cannot cover their debts and who hold no promise of ending their  deficits should close, suspend their production, and even go  bankrupt so as to cast away their burdens. All cities and  prefectures should attach great importance to this work and  devote some time to giving specific guidance to promote this  work in the counties and cities under their jurisdiction. All  counties and cities should step up classification of their  industrial enterprises and define realistic reform methods and  adopt feasible measures to accelerate their reform. We should  strive to complete the transformation of the systems and  mechanisms in more than one-third of the county-run industrial  enterprises in the province within next year. Practice in the  county-level economic development showed that individual and  private economies should be developed bravely because they are  the new growing points of the rural economy and another  important source of county-level revenues. We should further  liberalize the scope of their business and allow individual  household industrial production or business and owners of  private enterprises to engage in all the production and business  other than those prohibited by the state in explicit orders. We  should further liberalize the methods of business and allow  individual and private enterprises to contract, lease, merge,  and purchase state-owned and collective small enterprises.    H. We should attend to the two civilizations simultaneously  and be competent in both so as to promote their coordinated  development. While promoting the rural material civilization, we  should conscientiously strengthen the spiritual civilization to  make rural areas develop along the direction of affluence and  civility. We should strengthen rural ideological and political  work, intensify the education on the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continue the  education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism to guide  the vast number of peasants to foster a spiritual pillar of the  new era. We should launch extensive activities to build  civilized villages and civilized households and guide peasants  to establish a good practice characterized by plain living and  hard work, thrift in running homes, respect for the old and love  for the young, support for the poor, and help to those with  difficulties. When summarizing the work to achieve a fairly  comfortable standard of living in this winter and next spring  and when implementing the "agriculture law," we should emphasize  the education on the market economy and legal system and guide  peasants to enhance the sense as the mainstay, the sense of  competition, and the sense of self-protection. We should  actively develop rural education and further improve the  conditions for running schools. We should increase the number  of students enrolled in and following through the nine-year  compulsory education, reduce illiteracy, and prevent new  illiteracy. Colleges and secondary specialized schools should  enroll more students from rural areas and increase the students  trained for certain organizations and those to be assigned to  certain organizations. We should do a good job in improving  rural cultural facilities and the contingent of literary and art  workers to enrich the rural cultural life. We should succeed in  the rural medical reform focusing on improving rural cooperative  medical service, develop rural public health, and  conscientiously resolve peasants' difficulties in receiving  medical service. We should strictly enforce the family planning  policies, coordinate the family planning work with the  development of the rural economy and the improvement of the  social guaranteeing system dominated by the old-age pension  system, and control the natural rural population growth rate.  We should further strengthen the overall management of social  order; carry out the leadership responsibility system and the  system that the activities of making assessment through  comparison and awarding the advanced must not be held when the  family planning targets are not attained; mobilize the masses to  improve social order; deal strict blows to the gangs of  hooligans and thefts and the criminals who engage themselves in  train marauding and waylaying that run amuck at home villages  and towns; strengthen the management of social order among the  rural markets, entertainment centers, railway stations, and  wharves; and create a stable social environment for developing  the rural economy.  <H3>  4. Strengthen and Improve the Party's Leadership Over the  Rural Work and Ensure the Smooth Progress of the Rural Reform  And Construction </H3>   The key to strengthening agriculture's role as the  foundation  of the national economy and accelerating the pace of rural  reform and development is to strengthen and improve the party's  leadership. Particularly, in the course of setting up the  socialist market economic system, the party committees and  governments at various levels must pay attention to the issues  relating to agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants;  realistically control the overall rural work situation; and gain  the initiative in rural reform and development.    First, the party committees at various levels should  strengthen organizational leadership over agriculture and rural  work and upgrade the ability in controlling the overall rural  market economic situation. The fundamental way for  strengthening and improving the party's leadership over the  rural work is to deeply understand and accurately apply Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and deeply understand and accurately implement  the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee and the central rural work conference.  According to the arrangements of the provincial party  committee, the party committees at various levels should regard  the study of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and the documents of the two sessions of the central  authorities as a prominent political task and a prerequisite for  improving the leadership level, and conscientiously and  carefully organize party members and cadres to engage in the  study. We should coordinate the ideological reality and the  rural work reality with the rural reform and development tasks;  grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from facts; grasp the main line that development is an  established principle; and solve the problems that the people  are not inspired with enthusiasm, fail to widen the way of  thinking, stick to old conventions, and are satisfied at small  wealth; enhance the firmness of implementing the basic line of  the party; and upgrade the awareness of grasping agriculture and  the rural work. The enhancement of the party's leadership over  agriculture and the rural work should be reflected by the strong  rural leadership system. The prefectural and county party  committees should focus their work on agriculture and the rural  work and assign principal leaders to take charge of the rural  reform and development tasks. As far as the central cities that  take charge of guiding the work of counties are concerned, their  party committees should strengthen the leadership over  agriculture and the rural work and study ways for solving the  problems relating to agriculture, rural areas, and the peasants  in a timely manner. The party committees at or above the county  level should further assign deputy secretaries in charge of  agricultural work and also assign vice mayors and deputy county  heads in charge of industrial work. We should continue to carry  out the system where counties and townships elect and assign  deputy heads to take charge of town and township enterprises and  the scientific and technological work. The agricultural  committees are the overall departments in charge of agriculture  and the rural work under the party committees and the  governments at the same levels, and should bring their functions  for coordination, management, service, and guidance into full  play. The improvement of the party's leadership over the rural  work should be reflected by the formation of the leadership form  that is suitable to the requirements of the market economy. We  should treat agriculture and rural work from the angle of the  market economy, organize rural reform and agricultural  production with the guidance of the market economy, always  attach importance to developing the role of the market in  allocating resources, lose no time in adjusting the rural  production structure and product mix according to market  changes, and organize and guide peasants to develop commodity  production in broader fields. We should persist in the methods  of using typical examples as guides, giving different guidance  according to different conditions, and promote work regionwide.  Following the 10 strong counties and 100 strong towns and  townships, we should cultivate and foster a number of  comparatively well-off counties, townships, and villages to  serve as examples for rural areas to achieve a fairly  comfortable standard of living more rapidly. We should further  strengthen work guidance to mountainous and semi-mountainous  areas, plain areas, border areas, and suburban counties and lead  all types of counties to carry forward their local advantages  and develop the county economy with their own characteristics.  We should continue to support prosperous counties to accelerate  development, help impoverished counties shake off poverty and  achieve affluence, implement the preferential policies provided  by the provincial party committee and government, strengthen the  supporting, helping, and promoting work, and carry out the  measures for rewarding attainment of targets to lead these  counties to accelerate development.    Second, we should improve rural grass-roots organizations  and  exert great efforts to train groups of persons capable of  leading rural areas to prosperity. Rural grass-roots  organizations are the organizational foundation for the party to  exercise effective leadership over rural work. Aiming at  developing rural productive forces and increasing peasants'  income, we should put more efforts into improvement of  village-level organizations with village party branches as the  core while improving party committee leading bodies at all  levels. In line with the principle of emphasizing political  integrity and abilities, we should adjust, replenish, and  improve party branch leading bodies in a timely manner and  attach importance to optimizing their overall structure. Good  party branch secretaries should be selected from local  outstanding party members, from the cadres transferred from  counties or townships, or from town and township reserve cadres.  We should rectify incompetent party branches with slackened  morale a group at a time and strictly carry out the regular  activities of the party organization to improve their combat  effectiveness and unity. We should regard the training of  groups of persons capable of leading rural areas to prosperity  as a long-term and strategic task of improving rural grass-roots  organizations and conscientiously carry it out. All cities,  prefectures, and counties should draw up work plans for this  task and exert more efforts to implement it. We should promote  town and township major responsible persons by attaching  importance to their performance; optimize the structure of rural  grass-roots cadres by selecting the people with higher political  quality; expand the contingents of town and township  entrepreneurs by training them and developing the rational  mobility of trained personnel; and give play to the  demonstration role of large specialized households through  policy support. In three to four years, we should strive to  turn most township and village party and government responsible  persons into experts in organizing and leading the rural market  economy and most responsible persons of township enterprises  into modern entrepreneurs meeting the need of the market  economy. Every village should have several large specialized  households and demonstration households who can play a larger  promoting role. While improving party branches, we should also  improve villagers' committees, militia organizations, women's  federations, and the Communist Youth League and develop their  due role. As rural grass-roots cadres shoulder heavy and  difficult work and are often the focus of contradictions, party  committee and governments should make great efforts to  understand, respect, show concern for, cherish, support, and  protect them while conducting regular education and management  to help them improve work styles and maintain close ties with  peasants. Party and government departments at all levels should  further enhance the sense of service, regard it as an important  principle to serve, improve, and invigorate grass-roots  organizations, make sure that grass-roots cadres direct  production and perform work in an independent and responsible  manner, reduce the work burdens on grass-roots cadres, and help  them solve the specific problems in their work and life so that  they can have ease of mind in and dedicate themselves to  organizing and leading peasants to work diligently and achieve  affluence.    Third, we should ensure the implementation of the party's  policies toward the rural areas and fully mobilize the peasants'  enthusiasm for production. All prefectures, cities, counties,  and departments concerned should resolutely, conscientiously,  and solidly implement the numerous party Central Committee and  the State Council's current policy measures for agricultural and  rural economic development; and strive to make noticeable  achievements within a short period of time. We should  positively work out serviceable measures for promoting the  implementation of policies, proceed from reality, and creatively  implement the decisions of the central authorities and the  instructions of higher levels. At the time of strengthening the  mechanism for restricting the implementation of policies, we  should strengthen organizational restrictions and strictly  follow the working procedure of working out policies, organizing  forces to implement policies, and giving examinations and  instructions so as to institutionalize the implementation of  policies. We should also strengthen the supervision by the  masses; have the broad masses of the people understand, be  familiar with, and grasp policies and gradually handle affairs  according to policies; fulfill our duties according to laws; and  resist the activities in violation of policies. Particularly,  we should implement the policies on supporting the poverty-hit  counties, coordinate the work of having the poverty-stricken  areas free themselves from poverty and subsidies with the  realization of the target of being fairly well-off, increase the  input to the support of the poor, promote the support-the-poor  work on a large scale, and promote even economic development  among various regions.    Fourth, we should mobilize the forces of all fronts to  support agriculture and rural work and unite with one another to  develop agriculture and make the peasants rich. Organizing and  mobilizing all social forces to pay attention to, support, and  develop agriculture should be regarded as a key link of  strengthening and improving the party's leadership over rural  work. The departments under the party committees and the  governments should strengthen the investigations and study on  agriculture and the rural work; achieve information feedback,  supervision, and examination; be advisers on guiding  agricultural production and the rural work to the party  committees and governments; organize personnel affairs  departments to prominently grasp the construction of the  county-level leading bodies, the rural grass-roots  organizations, and the cadres contingents and the exchange of  skilled persons; and cultivate increasingly more persons to help  the rural areas seek wealth. The propaganda and cultural  departments should strengthen the propaganda on agriculture, the  rural areas, and the peasants, arouse public opinion on  protecting and supporting agriculture, and also make efforts to  enrich the cultural life of the rural areas. The law and  discipline enforcement organs should strictly investigate and  handle the cases of harming, cheating, and apportioning expenses  from the peasants; and protect the legal rights and benefits of  the rural economic organizations and the peasants. The overall  economic departments should organize large and medium-sized  enterprises to positively introduce technologies, products, and  skilled persons to the rural areas and to conduct cooperation  with town and township enterprises. According to the state  industrial policies, the economic lever departments should  positively support the localities to develop the industries with  their advantages and develop the private and individual sectors  of the economy. The internal and external trade departments  should calculate and report market information, organize the  circulation of the rural areas, and help counties and cities  build export commodity production and processing bases in a  timely manner according to the changes of the domestic and  foreign markets. Financial organizations should promote the  flow of capital in the rural areas, grant more loans to  agriculture, and help the rural areas optimize the industrial  structure according to the principle of efficiency and in line  with the credit policies. The Communist Youth League  organizations, the militia organizations, and the women's  federations should deeply launch various activities of promoting  rural reform and development and bring into play the broad  masses of rural young people, militiamen, and women's role as  shock brigades, main forces, and half the sky. Only when the  party and government leaders at various levels pay attention to  agriculture and the whole society supports agriculture, will a  brand-new situation in rural economic and social development  emerge and the peasants' degree of wealth be greatly upgraded.</p>

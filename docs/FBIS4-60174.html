			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha,  President Hafiz al-Asad and King Husayn held a comprehensive  evaluation of the developments in the peace process and the  obstacles Israel has placed in the way of a just and  comprehensive solution to the crisis in the region. The two  Arab leaders agreed to continue bilateral consultations and  coordination on positions.    If we recall the recent past, we see that Jordan was  subjected to intense pressure to sign a separate agreement with  Israel. Jordan refused such an agreement and emphasized the  continuation of its coordination with the brothers, especially  Syria.    Jordanian officials revealed that Israel wants to sign a  peace agreement with Jordan without withdrawing from the  occupied Jordanian territories in return.    Likewise, sisterly Lebanon was subjected to similar  pressure.  Israel escalated its aggressions against southern villages,  towns, and cities to the extent of displacing tens of thousands  of Lebanese citizens and threatening an all-out sweep.    As usual, Israel used the pretext of national resistance,  but  the main reason was Lebanon's refusal to sign a separate  agreement and its insistence on the implementation of Security  Council Resolution 425, which requires Israel to unconditionally  withdraw its forces from all of south Lebanon.    The same is true with Syria. After more than two and a half  years of the Washington talks, several shuttle tours by the U.S.  secretary of state, the summit meeting between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton, and several statements by Israeli officials  on their intentions to advance the peace process on the  Syrian-Israeli track, it became clear that the Tel Aviv rulers  reject full withdrawal from the Golan and the return to the 4  June 1967 borders. At the same time, these rulers demand the  normalization of relations.    When we compare Israel's behavior on the three Arab  tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese--we find one thing:  the Tel Aviv rulers have not abandoned their expansionist  demands in the Arab territories, and they are far from the  substance of the U.S. initiative, the principles of the Madrid  conference, and the UN resolutions, which call for exchanging  land for peace and withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders.    Israel succeeded in singling out the Palestinian side and  drawing it into the position Israel had planned. Israel kept  its ugly occupation and its sway over the capabilities of the  Palestinian people, but it failed to penetrate any of the three  Arab tracks--the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese. Syria,  Jordan, and Lebanon clearly announced that separate agreements  are unequivocally rejected, and that peace depends on Israel's  full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories.    It is important that Arab coordination continues to reach  the  highest levels because Israel is searching for even a tiny crack  in order to propagate its suspicious and distorted solutions,  especially since the Gaza-Jericho agreement is facing more  difficulties everyday, and is daily confronting new obstacles,  the latest of which is Israel's demand that the Palestinian  police chase and arrest the men of the intifadah in order to  hand them over. This simply means employing the Palestinian  police to protect the occupation forces in accordance with this  ill-auguring agreement.    A quick look at the situation in the occupied territories  after the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its implementation is  enough to clearly show that just peace and occupation cannot  coexist and that the realization of peace is dependent on the  elimination of occupation. Hence, Syria firmly adheres to the  demand of Israel's full withdrawal from every inch of the  occupied Golan, and coordinates its position with those of its  Arab brothers so that the Israeli withdrawal will be from all  occupied territories, and subsequently, peace will be just,  comprehensive, and real.</p>

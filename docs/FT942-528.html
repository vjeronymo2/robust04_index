			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Portugal urged to open markets Portugal must introduce competition into sheltered areas of its economy to ensure inflation moves down towards average European Union levels, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. It urged an overhaul of the regulatory framework and more vigorous privatisation initiatives to improve the competitiveness of public electricity, water, transport and telecommunications as well as housing and insurance. Portugal would emerge from recession this year with economic growth of 1.2 per cent, rising to 2.3 per cent next year. Higher exports and consumption supported by lower interest rates would fuel growth. The OECD report coincided with the swearing-in of a new governor of the Bank of Portugal, Mr Antoio de Sousa. Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the government and the central bank were both firmly committed to maintaining exchange-rate stability.</p>

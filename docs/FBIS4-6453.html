			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday charged  that "inaccurate reports" from the French news agency Agence  France Presse (AFP) on the fighting in Cambodia were a "danger"  to Thailand.    He also warned Thai media which subscribe to the agency to  be  careful about publishing AFP reports from Phnom Penh, saying  they might contain "inaccurate" information.    Speaking after attending a meeting of the National Security  Council (NSC), Chuan said he had checked with the Thai military  and the Cambodian government in Phnom Penh about the fighting  around Pailin.    The information he received reconfirmed Thailand's  neutrality  on the conflict, Chuan said, adding that Thailand wants to see  peace in Cambodia and did not want to involve itself in the  country's affairs.    He said Cambodia's accusations of Thai support of the Khmer  Rouge were not true.    Chuan said the National Security Council has cautioned the  Thai media about publishing reports by AFP from Phnom Penh. He  said the French news agency has been repeatedly warned that its  reports often contained "inaccurate" information which could  pose a "danger" to Thailand.    Thai media sometimes publish information from AFP without  crediting the source and include it in news reports as if it  were fact, thus hurting the country, he said.    Phnom Penh leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of  abetting the Khmer Rouge forces in their military offensives  against the Cambodian government.    Prime Minister Chuan said the National Security Council is  considering measures to be taken, as Thailand has never  retaliated against accusations by Phnom Penh regarding its  losses in the fighting. He said the Thai Foreign Ministry is  gathering information and will report to the United Nations.    Meanwhile, NSC Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has warned Phnom  Penh that Thailand's patience is running out on the Cambodian  allegations. He said Phnom Penh should communicate with the  Thai government directly and not use other people to pass on  messages.    He said he was surprised that Cambodia did not use the Thai  Embassy in Phnom Penh to communicate with the Thai government.    "We can communicate through the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh  as  we are both sovereign states. I am very surprised that the  Cambodian government has never contacted the Thai government  through that channel, but always used other people's mouths in  sending messages. I can't believe it, because the government of  a sovereign state should speak directly to us," said Charan.    He said Thailand had always been very patient about events  along the Thai-Cambodian border despite the fact that local  people and schools were badly affected by the fighting.</p>

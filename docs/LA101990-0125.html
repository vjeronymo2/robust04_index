			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY HOUSING PLAN IS UPHELD BY COURT  </P> <P> A Superior Court commissioner has decided that the revised version of the  city's housing plan is valid, disappointing an environmental group that had  attacked the plan as vague and unrealistic.  </P> <P> In a four-page decision, Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer wrote that Seal Beach's  plan "may or may not be the best possible housing element, with the best  possible plans for the implementation of desired goals."  </P> <P> But, he continued, "a decision about what is the 'best' way for Seal Beach to  achieve these goals is uniquely political, to be resolved in the local elective  and legislative processes."  </P> <P> Lee Whittenberg, Seal Beach's director of development services, said he was  happy to learn of Bauer's ruling. "It was nice, after all the work, to see it  was done properly," he said.  </P> <P> The Wetlands Restoration Society sued Seal Beach over its housing plan earlier  this year.  </P> <P> Jonathon Lehrer-Graiwer, the group's lawyer, argued that the housing plan's  objectives for new low-cost housing and rental assistance are unrealistic and  unattainable.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was part of the society's strategy for blocking a controversial,  329-home project on the Hellman Ranch property.  </P> <P> The most recent version of the housing element was approved by the City Council  after Bauer ordered the city to update it.  </P> <P> Bauer had thrown out the council's previous approval of Mola Development  Corp.'s plans for Hellman Ranch because the plan was invalid when the permits  were issued.  </P> <P> Mola appealed that decision, but a new council has since rejected the project.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Oderman, an attorney for Mola, said Bauer's ruling last week will help  support the company's appeal, for which no court date has yet been set.  </P> <P> "Mola spent 4 1/2 years processing its project before the city of Seal Beach,  and at the time it got approved, there wasn't any ruling invalidating the  housing element," Oderman said. "Since that defect has been fixed, this ruling  will support that."  </P> <P> Galen Ambrose, president of the Wetlands Restoration Society, said he does not  see Bauer's ruling as a setback because the original opinion overturning the  project's approval still stands and the new council and housing committee are  receptive to the society's goals.

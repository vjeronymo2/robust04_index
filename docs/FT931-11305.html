			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / BP arm in energy deal with Ford BP ENERGY, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, has won a contract to manage the energy requirements of Ford's Halewood plant on Merseyside - the largest ever UK contract energy project. The move could save the plant more than Pounds 1m a year on its Pounds 11m fuel bill for 210MW of energy - equivalent to the heating requirements of a small town. As well as obtaining the cheapest deal, BP Energy will make any changes in the plant's energy systems, such as the construction of a combined heat and power plant, if they provide cost savings. BP Energy's responsibilities at Halewood include steam production for making gear boxes, high-pressure hot water for air conditioning, compressed air for manufacturing, electricity and water distribution systems and all heating and ventilating at the plant. Mr Nick Coleman, managing director of BP Energy, said: 'Out-sourcing energy operations is now an option which more major industrial companies are seriously considering.' The contract energy management business is in its infancy but with most UK utilities now privatised more companies are turning to specialist managers. BP Energy is targeting all industrial, commercial and public-sector sites with energy demand greater than 2MW - a market where energy costs exceed Pounds 9bn.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIXON'S HELEN GAHAGAN DOUGLAS ATTACK CALLED DIRTY TRICKS FORERUNNER  </P> <P> I read (Joseph N. Bell's) column regularly. I too am a Democrat in this County  of Orange. You have hit on some themes that I have responded to in my mind but  never took action to write.  </P> <P> However the Feb. 1 column on the Nixon questions which I copied and mailed to  my daughter still lingers in my unanswered letter file.  </P> <P> "His life passed before me in Technicolor bursts. . . ."  </P> <P> I could have written that! Richard Nixon, the politician, came into my home by  way of a mailer designed to defeat my candidate Helen Gahagan Douglas. It was  the forerunner of all the "dirty tricks" I came to recognize as Nixon's  trademark. The mailer came the day before Election Day and would you believe?  It was printed on pink paper -- dirty, Commie Pinkos -- the McCarthy touch. I  rejected that man that day and only despaired further each time he gained  another political victory.  </P> <P> I am dismayed by the apathy of young people (and some older folks) because they  don't bother to vote. But when a man of this stripe is hailed as a great leader  I can understand why they are turned off.  </P> <P> The mailer made such an impression on my voting habits that I now look at each  one -- not at the message -- but at the small print in the corner that tells me  who paid for the mailing. In many local elections I have voted not for or  against the issue or the candidate -- but against the mailer itself.  </P> <P> Jean Sullivan,  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

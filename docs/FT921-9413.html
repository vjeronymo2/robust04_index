			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Appointments: Manufacturer for small chair After just three weeks in the family catering and bakery business Richard Brucciani decided he had had enough and went off to run a small offshoot importing the paper hats worn by staff in fast-food outlets. Twenty one years later Pal International has grown to turnover of Pounds 9m and a workforce of 180 making hygiene products for the catering, industrial and healthcare markets. Pal's success and sterling work in the CBI's East Midland region have propelled Brucciani, aged 46, into the post of chairman of the CBI's Smaller Firms Council. This is an important job because it helps establish the CBI's credentials as a representative of small business - though many outsiders find it hard to believe that the organisation's big company members, who pay most of its bills, do not still call the shots. Brucciani, whose grand-father came to England in the 1860s, says he did not leave the family firm because of a disagreement but because he realised retailing was not for him. He quickly moved Pal into manufacturing and has fac-tories in Malta, Paris and Burnley as well as his headquarters in Oadby, Leicestershire. Pal has come through the recession well, meeting its 20 per cent annual profit growth target; this is because 45 per cent of sales are overseas and because food processing hygiene is an expanding market, Brucciani says. He believes the British do themselves down when they say they are not good at manufacturing; they are actually quite good but don't encourage their best people to go into it. A keen amateur pilot and 'unskilled' but enthusiastic violin player, Brucciani has two years in which to put his message across.</p>

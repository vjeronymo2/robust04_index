According to the source, the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], government ruling party  since 1929, hired Sanchez Vega in Tijuana to assist in "crowd  control" the same day Colosio was shot. Sanchez Vega was one of  many men hired by the party to work as assistants in Colosio's  campaign event in Tijuana, a city on the border with the United  States. This hiring is done everywhere the party candidates hold  events as part of their campaigns.    The source said also that Sanchez Garcia [name as received]  does not work directly with nor is related to General Domiro  Garcia Reyes, who had been charged by the presidential staff  with Colosio's protection. The source said the PRI candidate's  assassination was not the result of a plot, as determined by the  investigations thus far. The attorney general is still studying  the episode and the available videotapes of the murder.    Today, the Mexican newspaper EL UNIVERSAL said Colosio could  have been the victim of a plot by some of his security members.  The paper points to Sanchez Vega as one of the murderers'  accomplices because in several videotapes available Sanchez Vega  is seen clearing a path for the murderer. The investigations  point to Mario Aburto Martinez as Colosio's confessed murderer  and so far do not support the participation of other people in  the assassination.</p>

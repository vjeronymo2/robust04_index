			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today denounces a statement by  South Korea that the north-south joint declaration on  denuclearization has become invalid.    South Korea's Deputy Premier and Minister of National  Unification Yi Hong-ku said on may 23 that the declaration on  denuclearization "has become invalid in actuality."    A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification  of the Fatherland said that "the arbitrary abrogation of the  joint declaration vital to the nation is a very grave challenge  which endangers peace in the country and the security of the  nation."    "They (the South Korean Government) will have to bear full  responsibility for all the consequences arising from their  nullification of the declaration," the KCNA NEWS AGENCY quoted  the spokesman as saying.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) announced on Thursday  [24 February] a wide-ranging business-promotion program focusing  on eight business sectors expected to expand vigorously in the  coming years. The program, which will help promote information  processing, telecommunications, housing-related and other up and  coming industrial sectors, is designed to create jobs through  deregulations and government support to help offset personnel  cuts resulting from restructuring measures in the private  sector, MITI officials said.    MITI plans to promote such business fields as housing, solar  power development, multimedia-related data processing, recycling  of industrial waste, medical and social welfare and new-wave  distribution systems like discount stores.    The ministry also aims to enhance sports and leisure-related  industries and development of new materials, MITI officials said.    As a common task for the eight fields, the ministry plans to  review requirements for companies to be registered on the  over-the-counter market to help upstarts raise funds more easily.    The ministry also plans to provide assistance to improve the  infrastructure for research and development activities for such  companies.    Among specific measures under the program, the government  will purchase unused land with public funds for housing  developments.    The ministry also calls for introducing computers and other  information-processing equipment into education programs and for  better protection of copyrights for multi-media software.    The ministry estimates that the measures envisaged in the  program would help boost the domestic housing-related market to  33 trillion yen in the year 2000 from 28 trillion yen in 1992,  and the telecommunications market to 61-70 trillion yen from 23  trillion yen, MITI officials said.</p>

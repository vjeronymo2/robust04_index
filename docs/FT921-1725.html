			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Election fears add selling pressure THE government gilt-edged securities market continued to perform weakly, as investors took fright from opinion polls indicating a poor showing for the Conservative party. At the same time, a general shift in purchasing patterns for bonds away from European issues and into Japanese and US instruments helped to push down gilt prices. But in thin trading there were indications of modest buying support for gilts, relative to other European bonds, as the recent rise in yields made the instruments appear cheap to some investors. Over the week, prices for gilts fell by up to  1/2 point, following a drop of 1 1/2 points the week before. There was a consequent moderate rise in yields. The selling pressure was triggered mainly by nervousness about the April 9 election. Many gilt practitioners fear that a government formed by the opposition Labour party, or a hung parliament, would lead to a large drop in bond prices. Gilt prices were not helped by a general move by international investors to switch money out of European bonds, with US Treasury issues being the main beneficiary. Japanese bonds also experienced extra demand. Much of this development followed jitters about the level of wage settlements and inflationary pressures in Germany, which could mean no early reduction in German interest rates by the Bundesbank. A continuation of the German central bank's tight monetary policy would prolong the period of high borrowing rates in other European countries, including Britain and France. Such countries have to keep their short-term rates tied to those in Germany due to the linkage of the European exchange rate mechanism. The prospect of high rates in Britain and France until well into the second half of 1992 effectively diminishes the appeal to investors of government bonds issued by these nations' governments. During the week, the short-dated UK Treasury 10 per cent gilt maturing in 1994 dropped by just under  1/4 point, closing on Friday at about 99 23/32 . Its yield was pushed up from 10.04 to 10.12 per cent (expressed in semi-annual terms). Longer dated securities performed worse, resulting from investors moving their attention away from these bonds to the shorter end of the yield curve. This was in search for what, after the sharp rise in short-maturing gilt yields the previous week, appeared like bargain bonds in the stretch of the curve below the 10-year mark. The 9 per cent Treasury bond due in 2002 lost a little over  1/2 point, closing at 64 7/16 for a yield of 9.83 per cent. As a result of these changes 10-year gilt yields have gained about 50 basis points (half a percentage point) in yield in the past month, underlining their reduced attraction. Over the same period, German 10-year bonds have also seen their yields pushed up, but by only about 15 basis points, while French bonds of the equivalent maturity have seen a yield gain of roughly 25 basis points. This means that investors are demanding a yield premium of slightly more than 200 basis points for 10-year gilts against the comparable German bonds. Just three weeks ago, the yield difference between the two classes of bonds was only 150 basis points, indicating that since then investors have become a lot more wary about holding UK bonds. The nervousness shown by many investors about gilts was in spite of economic data last week indicating no let up in the 18-month UK recession. In normal times, this would increase the attraction to investors of fixed-interest securities. This is on the basis that the chances of large rises in prices at either the wholesale or the retail level in Britain over the next year or so are extremely weak. However, the imminence of the election - plus the doubts about the next move on interest rates by the Bundesbank - mean such calculations count for little. According to Mr Sanjay Joshi, a bond specialist at Daiwa Securities, the Japanese finance house, the German central bank might be so vexed about the dangers of spiralling inflation that its next move might be to push rates up. As well as sending shock waves around European countries, which need to pull rates down to revive their flagging economies, that could accelerate the drift by investors out of the European bond markets and in particular reduce gilt prices.</p>

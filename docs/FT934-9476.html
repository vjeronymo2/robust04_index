			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Capital flow to developing countries breaks record A REVIVAL of private capital boosted net capital flows to developing countries to a record Dollars 165.5bn in 1992, 23 per cent higher than in 1991, according to the latest Financial Market Trends survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The 51 per cent growth in private capital was dominated by the expansion of international bank lending (Dollars 38bn), foreign direct investment (Dollars 29bn) and bond financing (Dollars 13.4bn). Official development finance from other countries has been in decline, due to a sharp fall-off in aid from some donors (principally Arab countries and the former Soviet union). Most of the increase in capital flow was concentrated on more advanced countries, while poorer and smaller countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, still rely on development finance. Total external debt for developing countries in 1992 reached Dollars 1,534bn, up around 3 per cent. The level of borrowing is increasing across all financial markets, according to the survey. The OECD notes a 14 per cent rise to Dollars 526bn in borrowing facilities in the international financial markets for the year to October. As well as record bond issuance, there has also been a revival of syndicated lending.</p>

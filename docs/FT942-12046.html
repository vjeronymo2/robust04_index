			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / N Sea platform 'blasts' probed Engineers last night flew to the Piper Bravo platform 120 miles north-east of Aberdeen in the North Sea's Claymore field to investigate reports of minor explosions. No one on board the platform was injured, although 98 non-essential personnel were evacuated by helicopter as a precaution. Elf Enterprise Caledonia, operator of the platform which is the successor to ill-fated Piper Alpha, said that there was no explosion in the sense of a fire or blast but the engineers would be investigating unconfirmed reports of 'noises within the pipework related to the flare system' which burns off excess gas. 'Production from the Piper field and its satellite field was immediately shut down,' Elf said.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed leads massive intervention THE FEDERAL RESERVE led a massive round of central bank intervention to prop up the dollar yesterday, but first indications were that the operation had not been as successful as the one held on July 20, writes James Blitz. The Fed intervened in the market at around 1.15 pm London time, buying the US currency as the dollar/D-Mark rate fell to around DM1.4610. In its third intervention in the foreign exchange market in three weeks, it bought dollars at DM1.4715 and later at DM1.4770. Fifteen central banks joined the Fed in the operation, in three concerted waves of intervention. The intervention, which lasted over three hours, was more extensive than the one held on July 20, and more than Dollars 500m was spent by all the central banks. However, in late US trading, the dollar was still hovering at around DM1.4675 after peaking at DM1.4791. The Fed and the European central banks would have wanted to keep the dollar above a floor of around DM1.4700 for several reasons. The US authorities might have been concerned yesterday that the new Treasury refunding issue of Dollars 15bn of 3 year notes went ahead smoothly yesterday, with investors confident that the dollar has the long-term potential to rise. European central banks are concerned that a weak dollar/D-Mark rate will exacerbate tensions in the European Monetary system. And the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will want to show that they can control the dollar/D-Mark rate, avoiding a free-fall that would damage already brittle stockmarkets. But dealers said that yesterday's operation was hampered by bad timing. The central banks did not surprise the market as completely as they did on July 20. Dealers had already anticipated that the Fed could intervene at around DM1.4600, and most dealers' books were already square. Fundamental factors also make it difficult for the dollar to break out of its current ranges. There is still a fear that the huge 6.75 per cent differential between US and German interest rates will widen further, and comments yesterday from a senior US official that US interest rates could go even lower worsened sentiment. The immediate outlook for the dollar depends on today's Bundesbank intervention in the German money markets. Yesterday, German call money was virtually unchanged at 9.70-75 per cent, narrowly below the Lombard rate. If the Bundesbank adds liquidity to the market, reducing the rate for call money, the dollar could rally on easier monetary conditions in Germany. If the Bundesbank keeps conditions tight, the market will anticipate further intervention to stop the dollar going into free-fall.</p>

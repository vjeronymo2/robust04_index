			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Rail privatisation proposals THE Ulster Unionist party last night signalled that the government would have to work hard to secure its MPs' help in shepherding rail privatisation proposals through the Commons, David Owen writes. Mr William Ross, the party's chief whip, said it had 'quite a number of concerns' about the bill, although it was too early to say how the nine UUP MPs would vote. He said the party was concerned about the possible consequences if British Rail were prevented from bidding against the private sector for franchises to operate passenger services. If BR were not allowed to bid, it might open the door for 'some outsider', he said. Ministers are considering how to respond to the threat of a backbench rebellion when the bill returns to the Commons within the next four weeks over a Lords amendment proposing BR be allowed to bid. Moderate nationalists are now uneasy that the Unionists may be rewarded with changes such as a cross-party Westminster select committee on Northern Ireland. Mr John Major's speech at this month's Conservative party conference did nothing to dispel these fears, with its strong emphasis on the government's commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As it was four years ago, Hungary will again have a  parliament with six parties, and it will include the same  parties as in 1990. However, their positions of power will be  considerably different.    According to the unofficial final results of the first round  in the parliamentary elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party is  in first place with 32.4 percent of the votes; the Alliance of  Free Democrats is second with 19.4 percent; the Hungarian  Democratic Forum is in third place with 12 percent of the votes,  followed by the Independent Smallholders Party with 8.5 percent.  The Federation of Young Democrats ended up in fifth place with  7.4 percent. The Christian Democratic People's Party obtained  (?7.3) percent of the votes.    The other nine parties fielding national lists did not  achieve the 5 percent necessary to enter parliament.</p>

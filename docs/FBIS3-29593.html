He said the copy of the MOU is a  government document classified as a secret as it involves  national security. As such, it could not be made public. He  said this in an interview with BERNAMA in Singapore today.  Datuk Sri Najib was asked to comment on a report that the  Malaysian parliamentary panel headed by opposition leader Lim  Kit Siang was seeking a copy of the bilateral defense agreement  following British media allegations of an arms-for-aid deal  involving the Pergau Dam.    Datuk Sri Najib said the issue was touched on when he met  the British parliamentary undersecretary of state for defense,  (Lord Clampton) who called on him at his hotel suite. He said  they agreed that there was no linkage between the Pergau Dam  project deal and the MOU. Datuk Sri Najib and (Lord Clampton)  are in Singapore to attend the Asian Aerospace 1994 Air Show.  Datuk Sri Najib said the DAP [Democratic Action Party] was  making the arms deal an issue just as it would have on any other  matter.</p>

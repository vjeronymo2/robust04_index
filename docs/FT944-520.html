			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Labour to tackle student tax rift The Labour party yesterday announced that it was to investigate ways of charging students for their tuition by linking student loans to income tax or national insurance. The decision reopens an old wound for the party. Last year senior Labour politicians led by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, blocked publication of a discussion paper that suggested students might be asked to pay towards the cost of their courses after they had graduated. Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour's higher education spokesman at the time, was subsequently sacked. University funding difficulties have intensified since then and criticisms of the government's existing student loans programme have made the issue difficult to avoid. Loans, administered by the Student Loan Company, an Education Department quango, are repayable in fixed instalments over five years, starting in the April after graduation. Repayments start once the graduate's income has reached 85 per cent of the national average. Processing the loans has proved difficult - 35,000 applications for this academic year were still outstanding at the beginning of the Christmas holiday. The National Audit Office is investigating the company's expenses. In spite of these difficulties, grants were cut by 10 per cent this year, and further cuts are scheduled for the next two years. Loans will be increased to make good the shortfall. Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher-education spokesman, yesterday claimed that this system deterred young people from entering university. 'We don't want to see any system of finance which acts as a deterrent. If students are to contribute, it should not be on a punitive basis and should not be on the basis of the present unfair system.' He added that graduates had to meet inflexible repayments at the time 'when their lifetime earnings are at their lowest and when their family budgets are at their tightest'. Linking student loans to income tax or national insurance would tie the level of repayments more closely to ability to pay, and would allow those in low-paying jobs to take longer to repay the loan. It would also be much cheaper to collect. Such a system was broadly endorsed last year by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents all universities. Plans linking loans to the tax system have been introduced in Australia and New Zealand in the last five years with no significant effect on student numbers. Political controversy still surrounds two issues. First, Labour must decide whether universities should be allowed to vary the fees they charge. These so-called 'top-up' fees would allow the more prestigious universities to charge more, thus leading to claims from lecturers' unions that they would create a 'two-tier education system'. Second, Labour faces a decision on whether to introduce a full-blooded 'graduate tax', with graduates paying a higher rate of income tax throughout their careers, rather than stopping once they had paid off their loan. Final proposals will be presented to the party's annual conference next year.</p>

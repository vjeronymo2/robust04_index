[Simonenko] I am holding in my hand a copy of the protocol  issued by a joint sitting of the trade union and the council of  the collective of Kursk AES [nuclear electric power station].  There is only one issue on the agenda -- the financial and  economic state of emergency at Kursk AES. The power station has  failed to receive over 85 billion rubles for electricity already  supplied to customers.    Because of the shortage of money it has become impossible to  ensure the normal technological process and safety procedures.  The collective of the AES has not been receiving its wages  since December 1993, and the staff of the directorate for the  construction of Kursk AES has had no money since November 1993.  The situation is seen as being on the verge of a social  explosion.    The collective of the AES has demanded that money collected  by the Russian Federation Government from customers should be  remitted and the wages for December, January, and February be  paid. If these demands are not fulfilled it has been decided  that the collective of the AES will be called upon to stage a  hunger strike, and the elections to the oblast duma should be  boycotted. However, the main thing here is that the workforce  is prepared to cut the output of the AES generating sets to a  level which only satisfies the needs of the town of Kurchatov,  where the staff and the builders of the AES live. They are also  prepared to eventually disconnect the electricity supply line.  The inhabitants of Kursk are very worried with the state of  affairs at the AES, since the distance from the power station to  the oblast center is only around 30 kms.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Smiths Industries When even a company's management argues that its largest market will not turn up before the middle of the decade, things must be tough. The depressing part of Smiths' analysis of the aerospace sector is that it is probably right. Civil aircraft deliveries will continue to fall into 1994. The 150-seat aircraft sector will probably be the worst affected, which is bad news for Smiths, given its dependence on the Boeing 737. There is also the risk that Boeing may redesign the aircraft with higher technology cockpits, forcing Smiths to bid for the work again. Military prospects hardly look much brighter. In the circumstances, Smiths' expansion into medical systems looks timely, even with concerns about healthcare spending. While the company has generally bought wisely, there are limits to expansion. The recent acquisition of Infotech and Vent Axia cost Pounds 122m but involved a goodwill write-off of Pounds 102m. That helped cut shareholders' funds from Pounds 330m to Pounds 248m in six months. Future targets in high-tech medicine would probably also be highly priced with low fixed assets. Now all the cash has been spent, Smiths must choose between debt funded bids which would quickly erode the balance sheet's strength and paper purchases which would dilute earnings. The company argues that the City exists to help it overcome such accounting niceties. Even so, there must be limited headroom for a company which will struggle in 1995 to generate the same level of earnings it produced in 1988, however well it is managed.</p>

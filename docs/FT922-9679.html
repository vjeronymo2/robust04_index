			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Waigel tightens screw to cut German budget deficit MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday called for new limits on unemployment benefits and cancellation of all subsidies next year for the Federal Labour Office, in a drive to reduce the state budget deficit. His call, condemned as 'antisocial' by the country's trade union federation, came as German public sector unions responded to the approach of pay talks today with the biggest show of force in their nine-day strike. Some 330,000 workers were brought out on strike, and Frankfurt airport, continental Europe's busiest, was closed for the day. Mr Waigel's drastic proposal, which would cut next year's state spending by DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in comparison with the current year, was the only substantial saving put forward by the finance minister in a gloomy review of planned spending for the next four years. Instead he insisted that any new projects  - including reform of the railways, old age care, and new family and housing allowances  - must be self-financing in the coming years. He said a promised reform of corporate taxation must be neutral in its effect on the budget, and that all public spending would be kept to a maximum 3 per cent growth rate until 1996. He failed to answer fears that the costs of subsidising and rebuilding east Germany would lead to a steadily rising budget deficit, but simply insisted that the present medium-term financial strategy must be maintained. That calls for a cut in the budget deficit from around DM45bn this year to just DM25bn in 1995. His presentation to the parliamentary groups of the ruling coalition parties suggested there will be little if any new cash in the public sector pay offer expected to be put on the table in talks with the unions today. The limit of 3 per cent growth on spending for the public sector  - and 2.5 per cent for the central government  - is only half the expected nominal growth rate over the next four years. The Federal Labour Office is responsible for all unemployment benefits in Germany, as well as training and job-creation schemes which have been critical to the maintenance of income levels in the collapsed east German economy. This year's federal subsidy amounted to DM5bn, Mr Waigel said. Unofficial estimates suggested that up to DM6bn would be needed in 1993, without substantial savings. Mr Waigel rejected suggestions, from Germany's economic institutes and from his Cabinet colleague, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, that he was underestimating the real strains on his budget. At the same time he called for 'iron savings' to reduce the budget deficit, admitting the pressures from the 'national and international financial markets for our contribution to a fall in interest rates'.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GROUP TO SALUTE O.C. BUSINESSES FOR CULTURAL ROLE;  </P> <P> ARTS SUPPORT: DESIGNED NEITHER TO RAISE, DISTRIBUTE NOR DONATE FUNDS, THE  COMMITTEE ACTS AS A CLEARINGHOUSE THAT PROMOTES 'PARTNERSHIPS' WITH ARTS  GROUPS.  </P> <P> It's that time of year again.  </P> <P> On Sunday, many of the area's top business leaders will once again don  three-piece suits and cocktail attire to attend the Orange County Business  Committee for the Arts' annual awards ceremony.  </P> <P> The ceremony recognizing "outstanding" arts support by local businesses  routinely makes society, arts and business news. It is practically synonymous  with the committee itself. It will be followed, as is tradition, by an  elaborate supper at the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Ask almost anyone who knows about the 9-year-old nonprofit organization for a  definition, and the person will usually talk of the awards fete, at which  corporations are recognized for volunteering hours and hours of technical aid  or donating large amounts of money.  </P> <P> The annual ceremony and dinner, underwritten by several corporations, is also a  fund-raiser. Last year, it contributed about $38,000 to the committee's  $131,816 expense budget, said committee executive director Betty R. Moss, who  is expecting 320 for Sunday's ceremony and $175-per-plate repast of crab,  shrimp and lobster salad, roast duck and white-chocolate ice cream.  </P> <P> But besides the high-profile affair, just what does the Orange County Business  Committee for the Arts do?  </P> <P> A satisfactory answer appears to elude many members of the local arts  community.  </P> <P> "I'm not really certain of the intent of the business committee," John H.  Rhynerson, chairman of the Master Chorale of Orange County, said recently.  </P> <P> While the chorale won an Arts Award at the committee's 1985 ceremony, he said,  "I haven't been in contact (with the committee) in the last couple of years,  other than getting invited to their banquets."  </P> <P> Moss, the committee's founding executive director, certainly can explain its  guiding mission: "Our whole purpose is to encourage businesses to support the  arts" with service or cash contributions, she said recently.  </P> <P> Designed neither to raise, distribute nor donate funds, the committee acts more  as a clearinghouse. "The heart of what we do, more than anything else is, is to  form partnerships between arts organizations and our members," Moss said.  </P> <P> One of 12 branches of the national Business Committee for the Arts Inc., the  committee forms these partnerships by matching up its members -- 120  corporations whose annual dues range from $250 to $5,000, depending on their  size -- with nonprofit arts groups seeking funds, board members, pro bono  accounting or legal expertise and a range of other needs.  </P> <P> "Arts organizations are in touch with me all the time," Moss said. "They will  call and say, 'We need someone on our board,' or 'We just had some city funds  taken away, can you help?' Then I call (committee) members and see if they can  indeed help."  </P> <P> Conversely, sometimes corporate members who want to become involved with a  specific art form call up asking for a referral. Moss, whose staff consists of  herself and a secretary, keeps a file of most of 200 county arts groups for  this and other purposes.  </P> <P> The committee recently had a hand in helping the St. Joseph Ballet Company,  which provides dance instruction for disadvantaged, inner-city youths, move  from an overcrowded church basement into bigger, better quarters in Santa Ana's  Fiesta Marketplace.  </P> <P> Moss arranged breakfast for herself, her friend, Daniel Guggenheim, and the St.  Joseph founder and artistic director, Beth Burns. The result: a $55,000 grant  from the New York-based Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation used to  complete St. Joseph's shiny new facility.  </P> <P> "It was Betty's intimate knowledge of our mission and our program over the  years that I think first interested (Daniel Guggenheim) in finding out more  about our program and seeing what a wonderful match it is with the Guggenheim  Foundation," Burns said.  </P> <P> When Gov. George Deukmejian went looking for a county resident to name to the  California Arts Council, it was the committee that initially suggested Harvey  Stearn, one of its members, Moss said, and encouraged 5th District Orange  County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and other local leaders to write letters  recommending him.  </P> <P> Moss sent Stearn's name to Sacramento, said an assistant to Stearn, who was  then president of Mission Viejo Co.'s California division. He won the  appointment in 1984 and was subsequently council chairman.  </P> <P> "Many times (financial) contributions are made, and we are behind the scenes in  that," Moss added. "The arts organization may not even know we are there."  </P> <P> Founded in 1981 by Fluor Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David S.  Tappan Jr., Moss and other leading area businessmen, the committee has also  helped place business executives on the boards of several arts groups. It is  working to add James Martin, vice president of Security Pacific National Bank,  to the board of directors of Stop-Gap theater troupe in Santa Ana, for  instance, Moss said.  </P> <P> "Betty has come out to see what Stop-Gap is doing, she's attended our events so  she could become an advocate for our programs," said Don Laffoon, Stop-Gap's  executive director.  </P> <P> Despite the increasing importance of minority representation on arts boards --  the California Arts Council greatly reduced a grant to South Coast Repertory in  part because it has too few minority board members -- Moss said the committee  does nothing to help arts groups increase the number of minorities on their  boards.  </P> <P> Board makeup should be decided by each organization and is not something the  committee should "in any way influence," Moss said.  </P> <P> Not every local group has been helped by the business committee.  </P> <P> "They have contacted us on a couple of occasions, but nothing ever really  worked out," said Judith Peterson, director of Fullerton's Muckenthaler  Cultural Center.  </P> <P> The committee also ceased sponsoring seminars that, for example, brought  together arts and business professionals. That is something better left to an  arts service agency, such as a countywide council being developed, Moss said.  </P> <P> The committee, however, has contributed significantly to vigorous local  corporate support of the arts -- exemplified by the $73-million Orange County  Performing Arts Center, funded entirely by private sources, individuals and  corporations -- said Judith A. Jedlicka, president of the committee's New  York-based national headquarters.  </P> <P> Developer C. J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons -- whose managing partner, Henry T.  Segerstrom, is a committee member and past chairman -- has been honored several  times at its annual awards ceremony for, among other things, millions of  dollars in cash and five acres of land that he and his family have given to the  Center.  </P> <P> In the last seven years, the committee has recognized firms small and large for  arts support, among them the Fluor Corp., the Irvine Co. and the Mission Viejo  Co.  </P> <P> An Arts Award, acknowledging arts organizations' "achievement in developing  partnerships with businesses," is also given each year. The award has  "sporadically" been accompanied by a grant of $500 to $1,500 -- whenever a  member corporation can be found to donate the cash, Moss said.  </P> <P> Some believe that the award -- even without money attached -- is an important  gesture.  </P> <P> "The recognition factor for us was much greater than the cash award," said  Catherine M. Michaels, director of the Children's Museum at La Habra, which won  $1,500 in 1988. "That alone helps us get into corporations to apply for other  grants."  </P> <P> Moss, however, said the chief focus of the evening's celebration is on  businesses, not arts groups, and that some business committee branches give no  such awards at all. (This contributed to the local committee's decision to give  one award annually, instead of two after its first two years.)  </P> <P> "I am always happy to get whatever a business would like to give" for an Arts  Award grant, Moss said.  </P> <P> She added that the local affiliate's 36-member board has discussed eliminating  the award altogether, a suggestion she opposes.  </P> <P> "I would hope we would keep the Arts Award in there, even though (the event) is  not an arts-award program. It is primarily to honor businesses. These fellows  need to be recognized."  </P> <P> "When we started the business committee eight years ago, (corporate) giving in  the community was not at the level it is today," added Moss, 58, who was host  for a nighttime TV talk show in Chicago before moving to the county in 1957.  She volunteered with various organizations until she began to work for the  committee in 1981.  </P> <P> "It's a great job," she said. "It's a wonderful opportunity to make a  difference in a community that, compared to cities like San Francisco or  Boston, is in its infancy stage in the arts, a community that is laying the  foundation for future generations."  </P> <P> PAST BUSINESS COMMITTEE AWARD WINNERS  </P> <P> Past Arts Award winners of the Orange County Business Committee for the Arts:  </P> <P> 1982: South Coast Repertory and Stop-Gap Theatre.

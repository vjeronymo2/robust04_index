			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Judge has no date for BCCI report LORD JUSTICE BINGHAM, who is to succeed Lord Donaldson as Master of the Rolls, said yesterday he did not know when his completed report into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International would be published and whether it would be published in full, Robert Rice writes. 'The question of publication is entirely for others and I have no input now,' he said. 'But certainly there is material in the appendices which I would expect to be unpublish-able.' He said it would have been impossible to conduct the inquiry in public because a great deal of the material could not have been disclosed without prejudicing possible criminal proceedings. Sir Thomas, who favours a number of reforms, said that provided there were safeguards to ensure the quality of advocacy, he was in favour of wider rights of audience for solicitors in the higher courts. He would like the European Convention on Human Rights to be incorporated into domestic law.</p>

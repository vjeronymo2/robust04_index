			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Russia's nuclear power is  an a difficult situation. On the one hand, the concept of the  development of nuclear power envisaging the putting into  operation on 24 new power plants by the year 2010 is taking  shape. Some of these power generating sets will replace the  reactors that exceeded the prescribed service life. On the  other hand, energy consumers are in no hurry to pay for  electricity to Russian nuclear power stations, so there are no  funds to pay salaries to operators on time and to purchase the  neccesary equipment and fuel.    The shock that affected the population and even, in some  measure, nuclear power specialists after the Chernobyl accident  seems to be wearing off, and the crisis of nuclear energy is  passing. Even the Cossaks on the Don who used to support  environmentalists now see the need for the use of nuclear power  in the region. Cossaks asked the Russian Ministry of Nuclear  Power to support their initiative for setting up a public  information centre on nuclear power in Rostov-on-Don.    People in various areas begin to realise that there is no  alternative to the use of nuclear power in present economic  conditions.    Former union republics began to admit dependence on Russian  nuclear power. The Armenian nuclear power plant inactive for  over four years will soon resume operation. Its fifth reactor  will go into operation by next winter. The republic's  population will be supplied with light and heating. Gagik  Markosyan, chief engineer of the Armenian station, told  ITAR-TASS that ties with Russian nuclear power specialists have  nether been severed. Surveys of equipment and work to instal  technical novelties is done with Russia's assitance.    Many research institutes and design offices are engaged in  creating safer reactors. The new generation of water-moderated  water-cooled power reactors is being designed by the regional  design office "hydropress" (Podolsk, the Moscow region). The  reactors will be used at the nuclear power stations in the Cola  peninsula, the Far East, the Leningrad region. Foreign  countries, for instance, China and Iran show interest in this  reactor, Valentin Fedorov, general designer, director of  "Hydropress", told ITAR-TASS. Agreements are beign drafted with  some foreign countries.    Meanwhile, difficulties are expirienced by nine Russian  nuclear power stations at which 29 power generating states now  operate. Energy consumers have debts running into hundreds of  billions of roubles. The Novovoronezhskiy nuclear power plant  is about to stop. There is no money to pay salaries to the  staff. The preventive repair of the fifth reactor that was  planned for January has not yet began. There is no money to pay  for the ordered spares. The Leningrad, Kursk and Smolensk  nuclear power stations have fuel reserves to last them about a  fortnight. Experts now cast about for a way out that would be  more effective than seeking new credits.</p>

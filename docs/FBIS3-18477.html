			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Esko Aho's first comments on the  results of the EU negotiations have been extremely cautious.  The clear political negotiation result was turned in Aho's  mouth into the negotiation basis for an EU agreement. Arto  Nieminen reports:    [Nieminen] After Prime Minister Aho's domestic comments it  was very difficult to believe that Finland and Sweden had  achieved negotiation results on the same day. While Sweden  raised glasses to the negotiation result, actually a victory,  the agreement had changed between Brussels and Helsinki into  nothing more than the basis for talks on an agreement. In other  words, according to Aho, Finland now has a result that provides  the basis for achieving a result, whatever that means. This is  what Aho had to say during the night:    [Begin Aho recording] This settlement will not go to a  referendum. I listened to a piece of news that said that if the  referendum accepts this, then the matter is clear. This is not  an agreement to join the EU. This is a political solution that  enables the conclusion of an agreement to join the EU. Much  work is still to be done on this that must be brought to a  conclusion. In addition, I would like to stress here that quite  a few of these matters were left dependent on our national  actions and I am sure it is in the interest and to the advantage  of all that the content of these national solutions will soon be  clear. [end recording]    [Nieminen] According to Aho, at first it must be clarified  what the agreement actually contains in detail. Negotiations  will be started on the domestic subsidy measures which the EU  agreement requires. Thus, further negotiations are to be held  at least in Finland. Aho thought that about a week would be  spent on studying the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

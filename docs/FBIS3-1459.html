			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Lusaka, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin  Beye, has decided to leave behind the controversial point of the  division of ministerial portfolios between the government and  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  and to move on to the last point on the agenda, concerning the  conclusion of the electoral process. However, this alternative  proposed by the representative of the UN secretary general in  Angola does not seem likely to save the talks from collapse,  even though a plenary meeting might occur today. Pedro Manuel,  our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports:    [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. The  negotiating sides may meet again today to discuss the document  drawn up by the mediators and observers concerning the  conclusion of the electoral process. Yesterday, the mediators  decided to move on to the issue of the conclusion of the  electoral process. Given that no understanding has been reached  on it so far, the issue of the country's governance will be  taken up again at a later stage. The mediators delivered their  document on the conclusion of the electoral process to the two  sides yesterday. The negotiators proceeded to analyze that  document and may present their responses today.    However, there is talk that UNITA disagrees with UN Special  Representative Blondin Beye's idea to drop the matter of  governance for the time being and move on to the conclusion of  the electoral process. It is said that UNITA is not ready to  discuss that issue at this stage. In the interim, let us wait  and see what the likely official response will be.    Within the context of discussions on the conclusion of the  electoral process, the negotiators are supposed to put down on  paper all the steps they would like taken concerning the second  round of the presidential elections.

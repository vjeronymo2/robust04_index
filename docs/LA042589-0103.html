			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN MEETING TO FOCUS ON REFORMS, AILING ECONOMY  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee will meet today  for what could prove to be a major review of its political and economic course  amid mounting difficulties.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, is expected to  open the meeting with a speech appraising the country's severe economic  problems and the resulting loss of confidence in the ability of his reform  program, known as perestroika, to raise living standards.  </P> <P> Although Gorbachev is receiving sharply conflicting advice in the wide-open  debate in the Soviet press between the party's conservative and progressive  wings on what action to take, virtually all commentators are agreed that he  must take decisive, bold steps now to preserve popular confidence and save the  reforms.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is confronted, on one hand, by rising anger over the shortages of  food and consumer goods of all sorts and by the insistence of many liberal  economists, sociologists and political scientists that this problem receive  priority attention, whatever the cost, to underwrite the whole reform program.  </P> <P> But he is cautioned, on the other hand, by conservatives opposed to a headlong  plunge into market economics, who see in further liberalization a loss of the  party's control of Soviet society and who fear that a multi-party system is the  logical outcome of further political reforms.  </P> <P> However far apart on solutions, the debate has focused attention on a growing  concern that the country is not being governed, that its components are being  managed with varying degrees of competency but without a unifying strategy.  Gorbachev is even implicitly criticized for generally seeking the middle  course, and he is being told this time that he must be bold.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who himself has spoken out in the debate several times recently, may  feel compelled against the background of last month's parliamentary elections  -- in which scores of senior party officials were defeated by young reformers,  also party members but not apparatchiks -- to reassert his leadership and to  restate his vision of the country's future.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov provided no details of the  agenda in announcing the Central Committee session, except to say that a  further meeting on ethnic issues is still planned for this summer.  </P> <P> Soviet political observers said they think that the most likely agenda for this  meeting are the election results, the political and economic background to them  and a series of decisions to move the country toward fundamental reform and, at  the same time, to recover some of the lost enthusiasm for perestroika.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's opening speech is likely to be followed by one day and possibly two  of political debate, all behind closed doors, and then the adoption of a series  of decisions or perhaps simply a communique.  </P> <P> Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology and a member of the ruling  Politburo, set the tone for the meeting as he reviewed the country's problems  in a policy speech last week.  </P> <P> Despite four years of reforms, he said, "until now no tangible results in  meeting the everyday needs of the people have been achieved."  </P> <P> Without going into details, Medvedev suggested that the leadership will seek  approval for a series of major economic reforms. These would include a  redefinition of what constitutes property and ownership rights -- a fundamental  change for Soviet socialism to allow private enterprise -- and the "vigorous  use" of market forces within what will remain a planned economy.  </P> <P> While most political observers believe that these policy questions will be the  focus of the meeting, it could also become a forum for high-stakes Kremlin  politics in another showdown between party liberals and conservatives.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN ACCUSED OF FRAUD, THEFT IN SECURITIES SCAM  </P> <P> A Costa Mesa man has been arrested and charged with bilking investors by  selling worthless securities in a Pennsylvania oil and gas company, Newport  Beach police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> David E. Arnold, 38, was arraigned Monday in Harbor Municipal Court in Newport  Beach and charged with 25 counts of grand theft, telemarketing fraud,  securities fraud and the sale of unregistered securities.  </P> <P> Arnold is accused of running a so-called boiler room operation known as the St.  James Financial Group from a small office in Newport Beach, police said. The  firm is alleged to have used telephone solicitors to sell an investment known  as the PennGas Insured Drilling Program, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> Gonis said Arnold was arrested Friday at his Costa Mesa home. He is being held  in Orange County Jail with bail set at $25,000, a court clerk said.  </P> <P> Arnold could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Thirteen investors allegedly lost a total of $238,000 while St. James Financial  was in operation in 1987 and 1988, Gonis said.  </P> <P> The majority of the investments were for $14,000, said Police Detective Doug  Parmentier, who investigated the case. He said investors were told that they  were buying interests in oil and gas wells in a proven field and that their  investment was insured for repayment.  </P> <P> Investors allegedly were told by St. James that the wells were insured by its  general partner in Texas, which was doing the actual drilling, Parmentier said.  He refused to name the Texas partner, which he said is the subject of a federal  investigation.  </P> <P> Parmentier said one St. James customer told him that he decided to invest  because of potential tax writeoffs and because the program seemed to be of  minimal risk.  </P> <P> Some of the investors received occasional checks for $100 to reassure them of  their investment, Parmentier said.  </P> <P> In late 1987, Newport Beach police began receiving phone calls from worried  investors who said they couldn't reach St. James Financial, Parmentier said.  The company closed in the spring of 1988, he said, and police began an  investigation in June, 1988.  </P> <P> The company, which was incorporated in the U.S. Virgin Islands, had been open  for business for less than two years, Parmentier said. He said he does not know  why it closed.  </P> <P> Testifying in hearings before Congress last week, law enforcement officials  called Southern California, especially Orange County, the "boiler room fraud  capital" of the United States.  </P></p>

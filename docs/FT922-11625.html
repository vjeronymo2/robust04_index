			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Barclays Bank credit rating cut by IBCA BARCLAYS Bank, the last UK bank to have retained a Triple-A credit rating, was yesterday downgraded to AA-plus by IBCA, the UK-based agency. Last month, Moody's, the US-based credit rating agency, placed Barclays' AAA debt rating under review for possible downgrade. The other leading US agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, downgraded Barclays to AA-plus a year ago. IBCA attributed the downgrade to the rapid rise in loan loss provisions over the past three years. 'Despite incipient signs of recovery in the UK's economy, it is expected that provisions will remain at high levels in the current year,' IBCA noted. In 1991, Barclays made provisions of Pounds 1.75bn to cover the risk of losses on loans. Only NatWest suffered a bigger bad debt charge. However, Barclays' bad debt provisions were smaller than all the other banks as a proportion of its UK portfolio of loans. In addition, Barclays has been less successful than other UK banks at reducing its cost base. For example, Barclays' staff received a pay rise of around 8 per cent in 1991, higher than at other UK banks, IBCA said. On the positive side, IBCA described Barclays' liquidity as excellent, and its capital position as satisfactory. Moody's said it was assessing the bank's 'competitive environment and its domestic and international strategies'. Only five banks - Deutsche Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation, Morgan Guaranty and Rabobank - are still rated AAA by all three agencies; SBC's rating is also under review for possible downgrade by Moody's. The short-term debt rating of GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company, has been placed under review by Moody's for possible downgrade. The debt is currently rated Prime-2. In addition, the BAa1 rating of guaranteed notes and floating rate notes issued by GPA subsidiaries GPA Investment and GPA Delaware is also under review. Moody's review will focus on the company's financing needs for aircraft purchase and structural issues affecting air travel and cargo transport.</p>

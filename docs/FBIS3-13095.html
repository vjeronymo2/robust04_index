As Palestinians, aware of our pains and the paths of our  hopes, we, who are continuing to bleed, hope to transform the  Hebron horror into action, provided we do so in calmness and  with the firm heart of the warrior engulfed by burning fire,  exactly as we ourselves are engulfed.    We are aware that the Hebron massacre is one of the bricks  with which Israel was built; a foundation made of massacres such  as Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, the holy al-Aqsa Mosque, and others.  As Palestinians, we are aware of the monster residing in the  Israeli mind. Therefore, we must -- more than anyone else --  make the Hebron Massacre the last massacre. We must hold a  sharp sword to cut off the head of this Israeli monster. This  can be realized by adhering to two interconnected conditions:  the first is national unity; and second, unity of aims. Let us  now ask what we exactly want in terms of dues from the Israeli  enemy and the international legitimacy following the Hebron  massacre.    For its part, the PLO, and in a proper international  climate,  presented its terms and said: Negotiations are suspended until  an international response to our just demand for protecting our  people is forthcoming and until Israel submits to our people's  right to live securely without any harm and without the evils of  the Israeli occupation. This can be realized by placing the  fate of the settlements at the head of the agenda of  negotiations.    Therefore, the PLO's aim is clear and aboveboard. It is an  aim that is commensurate with the peace option and at the same  time does not deviate from the slogans of the Palestinian  national struggle but rather gives it a realistic and practical  push forward as reflected by this all-out international support.    Now what do the forces of rejection in Damascus want? What  do they want after the Hebron massacre? In short what is their  aim? They are vowing three times [reference to Muslim decision  to divorce a wife] to divorce the peace option. They adhere to  the slogans of the Palestinian national struggle. They are  solidifying like fossils inside these slogans, which reflects  the current collapse and disintegration. In short, while they  cannot stand the peace option, they have no alternative. They  have been like this since they spread themselves out and assumed  the garb of the opposition. Does this mean that there is a  crack in the Palestinian national unity, that is, conflicting  aims and disintegration?    If we stick to the idea of room for tranquility, which we  established at the beginning of this talk, we find that no one  Palestinian will be able to outrun his Palestinian brother in  his righteous indignation against the Hebron massacre. The  feelings are the same although they take various forms.  However, what is more important is the Palestinian stand on the  causes and not only the results of the Hebron massacre. The  Palestinian people have never abandoned their unity under the  PLO banner in their rejection of Israel's unlawful existence and  settlements on the land of the Palestinian state, an existence  which is the primary cause of the Hebron massacre.    In principle, we are united under the PLO banner in  rejecting  the Israeli settlers' existence. This was our stand before the  Hebron massacre and will remain our stand until the removal of  the settlements which constitute the big obstacle on the path of  negotiations and peace. They are the time bombs which threaten  to explode in a very dangerous manner.    Palestinian national unity and the unity of aims cannot be  undermined as the Israeli enemy hopes. In the blood, amid the  fire, and in the heart of the storm and its dust, our unified  and united people clearly see and are fully aware of how to deal  with big events. The Hebron massacre, grave as it is, and with  the challenges that it imposes on us, gives us more than just a  vista of hope. This is the characteristic of the martyrs blood.  This blood gives light. It does not extinguish our fire and  does not disintegrate. Let the short-sighted ones understand  and desist.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Iraq, UN at odds on oil IRAQ and the United Nations have failed to reach agreement on a limited resumption of Iraqi oil exports during three days of talks in Vienna. But the head of the Iraqi delegation said they had come close to agreement on some points that were in dispute, Eric Frey reports from Vienna 'Both sides would have hoped to achieve greater progress or complete agreement, but we will have to meet a few more times to iron out all differences,' said Mr Abdul Amir el Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the UN, after the talks were suspended at the weekend. Members of the delegation will return to Baghdad for further instructions so that the talks can be resumed in about four weeks, he added.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Rising imports bring Japan's surplus down Japan's politically contentious current account surplus shrank by an annual 6.7 per cent in May, proof it is on a downward trend, according to the Finance Ministry. Yesterday's figure will be seized on by the new three-party coalition as a sign that efforts to make the Japanese market more open to imports are starting to bearing fruit, when it meets an anxious US at the Group of Seven summit in Naples at the end of this week. Tokyo will have little other evidence to offer the summit that it is stimulating its domestic economy. It plans to present an already-published deregulation package and commit itself to cutting income tax, without giving a figure, senior officials said yesterday. The surplus, a measure of trade in goods and services, reached Dollars 8.72bn last month, after having grown by an annual 22 per cent to Dollars 13.98bn in April. A revival in previously weak Japanese demand for imports, up 14.7 per cent in May, was one factor, though a seasonal rise in exports inflated the surplus in the previous month. A 279-point package of deregulation measures is due to be adopted by the cabinet today, said Mr Kozo Igarashi, the socialist chief cabinet secretary. This deregulation plan was proposed by the previous government last week, but delayed by another round in Japan's recent series of power struggles, in which the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party joined forces to seize power. The package aims to increase competition and reduce business costs in housing, telecommunications, imports and distribution. While more concrete than the two previous deregulation packages of the past year, it has been criticised for excluding measures - such as easier entry to the telecommunications service market - which foreign business lobbies had been seeking. Japan's new minister of international trade and industry, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto of the LDP, aims to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, at the G7 summit to discuss the US-Japan trade dispute, said a government official.</p>

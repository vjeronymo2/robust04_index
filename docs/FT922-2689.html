			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BT Yesterday's disposal of Mitel in Canada closes a painful episode for BT. The 51 per cent Mitel stake had long symbolised the misconceived strategy behind BT's post-privatisation expansion into equipment manufacturing. As a reminder of how much it paid, the sale will be marked by a Pounds 120m exceptional goodwill write-off in BT's present quarter's figures, although that will not reflect the investment's carrying cost since 1986, nor the wasted management time. But investors in BT doubtless have more immediate issues in mind, notably how the company will cope with the tightening grip of its regulator.</p>

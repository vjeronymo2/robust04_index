			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kimberly-Clark revises plans to float pulp side Kimberly-Clark, the Dallas-based maker of Kleenex tissues, is abruptly revising its plans to float its North American pulp and newsprint operations. The company said the sharp rise in pulp prices, unaccompanied by a price increase for its finished products, made it in shareholders' best interests to retain a majority stake for the time being. Kimberly-Clark recently filed a preliminary prospectus in Canada for the 100 per cent flotation of a new company combining its pulp mill in Ontario and its pulp and newsprint mill in Alaska. Yesterday it said it would float only a third of the company, the earliest date being the first quarter of 1995. Analysts had speculated that the flotation could raise up to Dollars 950m. Kimberly-Clark is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Salomon. Kimberly-Clark had previously said it wanted to concentrate on its consumer products business. It also needs cash to fund its expansion outside the US, where its operations are still relatively small. Its bigger rival in the tissue market, Scott Paper, said on Monday it would sell its pulp operations as part of its own programme to focus on consumer products. Last week Kimberly Clark's shares dropped almost 9 per cent in response to third-quarter figures showing it was being hit hard by the cost of its European expansion.</p>

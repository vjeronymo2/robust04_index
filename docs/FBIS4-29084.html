			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor  Agreement that is due to be reviewed at the end of July, a  senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] said on 13 June, "The Japanese Government will  not seek to repeal the agreement." His comment made clear that  the Japanese Government plans to keep the agreement in effect  without review until the end of July 1996. Japan and the United  States are set to hold regular talks on the agreement for two  days beginning 15 June in Tokyo.    The agreement, which was concluded between Japan and the  United States in August 1991, is effective for five years. The  agreement carries a provision that requires the two countries to  "review whether to repeal it or not" at the end of July 1994.  The agreement sets a 20 percent share of foreign-made  semiconductors in the Japanese chip market as the target of  effort. Japan has deeply repented concluding the agreement with  the United States, claiming that the target of effort has been  exploited by the United States as a numerical target.    For that reason, Japan has long thought of insisting on an  early repeal of the agreement, but there is a strong view within  MITI that, with the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  just resumed, "Japan cannot argue with the United States over  another sticky trade issue."    Though the Japanese Government has decided to keep the  agreement in effect, the same senior MITI official made it clear  that the Japanese Government will seek to repeal the agreement  at the end of July 1996 when it expires, saying, "The agreement  will not be extended after the end of July 1996."</p>

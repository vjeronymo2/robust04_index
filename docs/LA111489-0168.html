			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'POETS' MODEL HASN'T SEEN FILM  </P> <P> Samuel F. Pickering, the inspiration for the offbeat prep schoolteacher played  by Robin Williams in "Dead Poets Society," still has not seen the popular  movie.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, I didn't know who Robin Williams was," said Pickering,  48, a professor of English literature at the University of Connecticut. "I  finally saw him on TV the other day. He's a nut."  </P> <P> Pickering, a Nashville native interviewed by phone from his home in Storrs,  Conn., said he does not mind the celebrity the film has brought.  </P> <P> "A woman walked up to me in the supermarket the other day and told me I was  such an inspiration that she was giving up the insurance business to go back to  being a schoolteacher," he said.  </P></p>

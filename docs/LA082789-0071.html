			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> HUMPHREY RETURNS AGAIN  </P> <P> A healthy Humphrey the whale is back in the San Francisco Bay Area but is  showing no signs of returning to the Sacramento River, where he spent 25 days  in 1985 while the world watched and countless efforts were made to send him  back to sea. For each of the four years since then Humphrey, identified by  unique markings on his dorsal fin and fluke, has returned to the waters off San  Francisco. This year he was spotted by biologists swimming near the Farallon  Islands. Not so lucky are two ailing beaked whales, nicknamed Nicholas and  Alexander, which are being treated at Marine World/Africa USA in Vallejo.  Veterinarian Laurie Gage said the condition of the young whales was somewhat  better than when they were found on Ocean Beach, but they are not eating and  their chances for survival are not good.  </P></p>

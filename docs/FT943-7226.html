			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Random House forms multimedia alliance Random House, the largest US book publisher, has formed a multimedia alliance with Knowledge Adventure, a California-based software company that produces multimedia programs for children. Random House will make a 'significant investment' in Knowledge Adventure. Terms were not disclosed, but the investment is expected to enable Knowledge Adventure to expand development of new titles. Random House will distribute Knowledge Adventure's titles through book stores. The agreement is the latest example of broadening collaboration among publishers and software developers to create multimedia versions of books and other published works. Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, acquired Software Toolworks, a US software company, earlier this year. Random House and Knowledge Adventure said they planned to jointly create, produce and market multimedia titles, beginning with the Random House Kid's Encyclopaedia which will be introduced in November. The encyclopaedia will feature interactive simulations and activities, narrated text and movie clips.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / American Express offers reward scheme for cardholders AMERICAN EXPRESS opened a new front in the battle for British credit and charge card customers yesterday by launching a rewards programme for its card-holders. The scheme, which will offer members points towards air travel or hotel accommodation, was announced in the same week that Vauxhall, a General Motors subsidiary, became the first UK manufacturer to launch a mass market, general purposes credit card. American Express said yesterday that work on its 'membership miles' scheme had begun more than a year ago, and that the programme was not a response to Vauxhall's card. It said the timing of the launch had been determined by the end of its negotiations with its six partners in the programme. The programme has run in the US since June 1991, and was launched in France during the summer. Membership of the programme is free for the first year, but the second year fee in the UK will be Pounds 20. Under the scheme, a return trip from London to Paris would, for example, require the card to be used for Pounds 10,000 worth of purchases. Schemes which reward customers' use of a credit or charge card by awarding points have generally proved successful in raising the number of transactions. American Express has 1m cardholders in the UK. Some 280,000 are the frequent travellers at whom this scheme is aimed. The press advertising campaign will run this weekend, and again from November 1 when the scheme becomes available. American Express has allocated Pounds 20m over the next three years for the scheme's marketing and administration. Its partners in the programme are Virgin Freeway, Frequence Plus Air France, Continental OnePass, Forte Crest Club, SAS EuroBonus and Qualiflyer, run by Swissair and Austrian Airlines.

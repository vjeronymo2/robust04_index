			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Cabinet ordered to emergency meeting on pits: Number of backbench critics nears the 11 needed to defeat government MR JOHN MAJOR last night summoned an emergency cabinet meeting for this morning over plans to close 31 coal mines amid signs that the government would be defeated in the Commons this week over the proposals. The decision to call the cabinet meeting followed a series of crisis meetings during the day by party managers and raised the possibility that the prime minister may be prepared to concede a delay or changes to the plans. However, ministers had earlier insisted that there was no alternative to the plans as set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last week. Mr Heseltine will make a statement to the Commons after this morning's cabinet meeting. The backbench revolt by Tory MPs against the proposed closures, which would cost more than 30,000 coal miners' jobs, grew rapidly over the weekend with the number of Tories promising to vote against the government in Wednesday's coal debate fast approaching the number required to wipe out its majority. With other Tories warning privately that they would defy whips by voting against or abstaining, a humiliating defeat last night looked likely unless Mr Heseltine's statement offered substantial modifications. Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, said that if the government lost, Mr Heseltine's position as trade and industry secretary would be untenable. As the government faced its most perilous week since Mr Major became prime minister nearly two years ago, officials and ministers were working on a package believed to include at least training and other measures for coal mining communities. Downing Street last night refused to comment on speculation that the closure plan might be postponed pending an inquiry, saying only that the economic case for closure remained clear. The prime minister will face strongly worded criticism when he lunches today with the executive of the backbench Conservative MPs 1922 committee - criticism of his handling of the economy and the Maastricht treaty as well as the pit closures. One 1922 executive member said: 'I'm still loyal to John Major. I hope he survives. But he won't if he continues in this way.' The government's claim that keeping open the 31 pits due for closure would cost tax-payers Pounds 100m a month came under fire from British Coal officials. The figure is based on the calculation that at current production levels 2m tonnes a month would be unsold next year, at a production cost of Pounds 50 a tonne. British Coal officials say the production cost is lower and that the coal could in fact be sold on the world market, at a loss that would be far less than Pounds 100m. Adding to the air of crisis, a protest march by miners to Westminster has been organised for Wednesday while the Trades Union Congress plans a large London rally on Sunday. In Cheltenham Spa yesterday, 3,000 miners' supporters marched through the town to protest against pit closures. Last night, following a call by Mr Roy Lynk, leader of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, for a two-minute nationwide blackout at 9pm, the National Grid Company said there was a small fall in demand equivalent to 2m light bulbs. The Coalfield Communities Campaign will today try to stop the pit closures by asking for a judicial review of the 'failure' of the Office of Electricity Regulation to ensure electricity is produced from the cheapest fuel - which it says is coal. Leaders of unions representing nuclear power workers are also expected to back the miners. Mr Heseltine's statement will include help for redundant miners, and others whose jobs are threatened by the closures, via the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils. He may also give mining areas special status to encourage economic regeneration. But it was unclear last night how much extra money he would win from the Treasury in addition to the Pounds 1bn, mainly for redundancy payments, he announced last week. Mr Heseltine has angered at least one cabinet minister - Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary - for failing to ensure his colleagues were properly briefed before the announcement of closures last Tuesday. But yesterday he said that colleagues had been informed. Mrs Shephard was in Wales chairing a meeting of European Community ministers as the cabinet committee met to agree the closures and was not briefed on the details until hours later. She will today meet chairmen of 14 English Tecs, covering mining areas hit by the closures to discuss the extra help. Speaking on BBC Television yesterday, Mr Heseltine said that there had been no alternative to the decision to close 31 of British Coal's 50 pits. Mr Heseltine said he took full responsibility for the difficulties the government faced over coal mining. But he said that once MPs heard his statement, a defeat would be averted. 'I think backbenchers will see that the government is taking very considerable notice of what people are saying and has presented a range of proposals which meet the enormity of the difficulties we face.' Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, joined in a public defence of the closure decision by ministers, saying that Mr Major had demonstrated the 'leadership' demanded by his critics in taking a harsh but necessary decision.

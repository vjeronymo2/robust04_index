			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Sickert nude is sold for Pounds 155,000 'The Beribboned Washstand', one of the first major nude studies by Walter Sickert, sold for Pounds 155,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. Painted in 1904 in Venice it shows a pensive model in a cheap bedroom and sold at the top of its estimate. It came from a collection of 16 works by Sickert, and all but two found buyers, while 'La Bonne Fille' almost doubled its estimate at Pounds 106,500. 'Dockside Cafe, Marseilles', painted by Edward Burra in 1929, and depicting sailors in a bar, made Pounds 111,500, while 'The Striped Blouse' by Henry la Thangue sold at the bottom of its estimate for Pounds 84,000. The auction of 20th-century British art totalled Pounds 1.84m and was 32 per cent unsold. There were signs that confidence is slowly returning to this sector of the art market. For example, 'The Green Gate' by Paul Nash found no takers when Sotheby's offered it at auction last year with a Pounds 20,000 reserve. Yesterday it sold for Pounds 31,050.</p>

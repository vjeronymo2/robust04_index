			<p>BFN     [Text] At a press conference in the Sejm, Jozef Oleksy  [Sejm speaker] and Marek Borowski [deputy leader of the  Democratic Left Alliance] have announced that Dariusz Rosati  remains the only coalition candidate for the posts of deputy  prime minister and finance minister.    They also said that the media had distorted yesterday's  statement by Leszek Miller [labor and social policy minister],  reporting that there was already a new candidate. They  explained that Leszek Miller had only said that the coalition  could put forward another candidate if there was a need for it.</p>

He will  meet with his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, and other  Cuban leaders.    Qatar, a desert peninsula of 11,000 square km, borders on  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Persian Gulf.  Doha, the capital, groups almost half of the almost 400,000  Qataris who live on the exports of petroleum and its byproducts.    Before the discovery of oil deposits in the 1940's, the  basic  activities were fishing and pearl cultivation.    Qatar was under the rule of the British and the Ottoman  Empire until its independence in 1971. The following year,  Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani assumed power. He nationalized the  oil in 1977 and has kept the 1970 provisional constitution which  does not allow political parties or elections.    Despite its different system, this Arab absolute monarchy  has  had good diplomatic relations with Cuba since their  establishment in December 1989.</p>

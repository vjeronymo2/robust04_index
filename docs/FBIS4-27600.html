			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Press pocket" column: "Drunken Lawmakers"] </F>   [Text] The National Assembly Legislation-Judiciary  Committee's hearing for investigation into the Sangmudae  financial scandal Tuesday ended in a fuss caused by drunken  lawmakers.    A dozen ruling and opposition party lawmakers attended a  dinner hosted by Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui at a Japanese  restaurant in Yoido during an intermission of the hearing  Tuesday evening. The committee summoned the minister to hear  testimony on the prosecution probe into the slush fund case on  that day.    Among the lawmakers attending the dinner were committee  chairman Hyon Kyong-tae, Reps. Ham Sok-chae, Chong Sang-chon,  Kim Hyo-yong, Pak Hon-ki and Chong Chang-hyon of the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party and Reps. Kang Chol-son, Chong Ki-ho  and Na Pyong-son of the opposition Democratic Party.    At the dinner, lawmakers drank so much whisky that some of  them were intoxicated all through the hearing which lasted till  2 a.m. yesterday. Just after the dinner, Rep. Chong Ki-ho,  quite drunk, went home to Chongju, Chungchong-pukto.    In the hearing which resumed at 10 p.m., 30 minutes behind  schedule due to the party, Rep. Chong Sang-chon, whose face was  glowing pink due to the influence of alcohol, interrupted  questions of Rep. Chong Tae-chol of the DP, assailing him for  improper use of legal terms.    The DLP lawmaker lashed out at Chong, who headed the DP's  Sangmudae investigation team, for "billing a justice minister of  a nation as a liar." The opposition lawmaker argued that  Minister Kim was lying on the prosecution's tracing of checks  issued by the Sangmudae contractor and the allegation that the  money was funneled to the ruling camp during the 1992  presidential election campaign.    Amid noisy protest from opposition lawmakers, chairman Hyon  called the session into recess hastily. The hearing resumed  after Hyon and Rep. Kang Sin-ok of the ruling DLP made apologies.    In the resumed hearing, Rep. Na of the DP, still  intoxicated,  made harangues whose topics ranged from a personal history of  the disgraced Buddhist Chogye Order chief So Ui-hyon and a  background story on the Buddha statue at Taegu's Tonghwa Temple.  So had reportedly played a role of a political broker during  past regimes.    As he rambled on, Na's fellow lawmakers stopped him and Rep.  Kim Hyo-yong of the DLP, apparently disgusted, bolted from his  seat and stalked out of the committee room.    Rep. Kang Su-rim of the DP later confessed that he could  barely endure the air of the hearing room filled with smells of  alcohol. "I advised my fellow lawmakers not to attend the dinner  hosted by Minister Kim, but in vain," he added.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TSB sells EuroDollar to management for Pounds 192m TSB Group yesterday announced that it was selling EuroDollar, the car rental company, to its management for Pounds 192m. The sale is the latest of several disposals by TSB of businesses outside its retail banking core. In July, it sold Swan National Leasing, its vehicle contract hire business, to the leasing arm of Midland Bank for Pounds 182.5m. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive of TSB, said the decision to sell stemmed from the belief that EuroDollar would be 'somewhat isolated within the group structure' following the sale of Swan National Leasing and Swan National's motor group. TSB is to receive sale proceeds of Pounds 59.9m, comprising cash of Pounds 22m in respect of EuroDollar's net assets and Pounds 37.9m in respect of inter-company debt. In addition, the purchase will repay existing debts of Pounds 58.1m. On March 31 1993, EuroDollar's net assets were Pounds 20.4m. EuroDollar, which has 10 per cent of the UK market, has 12,000 vehicles and 106 branches. It also owns the EuroDollar network in 27 countries, operating over 40,000 vehicles. It is the largest provider of rental cars to the corporate sector in the UK. EuroDollar was set up in 1973 by UDT, a credit financing business, which was bought by TSB in 1981. In its last half year to March 31 1993, EuroDollar incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.9m, as the result of a deterioration in trading conditions in foreign subsidiaries in Italy and France. Of the company's equity 40 per cent will be shared by 11 of EuroDollar's senior managers. The other equity investors are Prudential Venture Managers, Charterhouse Development Capital, Electra Private Equity Partners and Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, which together invested Pounds 60m. Mr Freddie Aldous, chairman of EuroDollar, said it was 'almost certain' that the company would be looking for a flotation within a few years. Prudential Venture Managers said it was 'an excellent time' for management buyouts as the UK economy emerged from recession. See Lex</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Bankers to discuss debt rescheduling BANKERS representing Russia's commercial bank creditors, who are owed more than Dollars 27.5bn (Pounds 17.8bn) by Moscow, including arrears in interest payments of more than Dollars 3bn, hope to fix a date soon to negotiate a long-term rescheduling agreement. Talks are planned in the wings of next week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings between representatives of the so-called London Club of creditors and the Russian government. Both sides have talked about the possibility of arranging at least a five-year grace period for repayments, with a possible extension to 10 years, to replace the current repeated agreements on 90-day roll-over periods, banking sources say. The latest roll-over expires at the end of September. Dealers in the London market are optimistic that Russia will keep its commitment, made at a meeting with the creditors in Frankfurt at the end of July, to repay Dollars 500m in outstanding interest payments to the London Club over the next three months. However, there are signs that the banks are becoming angry with Moscow's failure to provide more money to service its outstanding debts, estimated at more than Dollars 80bn, split among commercial banks, official creditors, industrial suppliers, and outstanding bonds. In a sharp attack this week at a conference in Berlin, Mr Georg Krupp, the Deutsche Bank director responsible for operations in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, said it was 'completely incomprehensible' that Russia could not even find the necessary foreign exchange to make the appropriate repayments on guaranteed export credits. He cited Russian figures estimating the total foreign exchange resources of the country at some Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.9bn), or half its outstanding foreign debt. The figures include Dollars 6bn in hard currency reserves at the central bank, Dollars 10bn held by Russian banks outside the country, Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn circulating within the Russian economy, and as much as Dollars 20bn held illegally by Russian companies in the west. Mr Krupp, whose bank chairs the London Club of creditors, said western creditors could not be expected to pour their money into a bottomless pit. It was quite right for Hermes, the German export credit insurance agency, to suspend cover on exports to Russia, given a current exposure of DM207bn (Pounds 82.8bn). Russia's failure to make interest payments on commercial debt, other than on its public bonds, has led to a rapid accumulation of arrears. According to Russian estimates, still being evaluated by the western creditors, the debt to commercial banks now totals more than Dollars 27.5bn, including the latest arrears in interest payments, which come to some Dollars 1.5bn in 1993 alone. The outstanding debt to government creditors, including guaranteed export credits, totals some Dollars 37bn, while supplier credits and bonds total nearly Dollars 12bn. Including new credits and recent arrears, the total is put at some Dollars 80bn. The debt calculations include money owed before January 1 1991, when Russia in effect began to default on repayments, and arrears accumulated since. Most of the commercial bank debt, or around Dollars 24bn of the Dollars 27.5bn, was owed before 1991, but much of the official debt has been accumulated since: some Dollars 14bn predates 1991, and Dollars 18.8bn since the cut-off date. Interest arrears owing to official creditors up to the end of 1992 totalled more than Dollars 2bn, according to Russian figures.</p>

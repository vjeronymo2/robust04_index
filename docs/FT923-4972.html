			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian company joins leaders in methanol market A CANADIAN company indirectly controlled by Metallgesellschaft of Germany has quietly become a leader in the world methanol market. Methanol demand is expected to grow deeply this decade, especially in north America, since it is a base material for cleaner transport fuels. Methanex, based in Calgary and controlled through the German multinational's US arm, last year bought a new methanol plant in British Columbia from Ocelot Industries. Now, in agreements totalling USDollars 222m, it will become one of the world's top four methanol producers in partnership with Germany's Hoechst and American Cyanamid, with 1.4m tonnes production capacity and the marketing of another 1.6 tonnes. All Metallgesellschaft's worldwide methanol business will come under Methanex in Calgary. The main market will be the US because of the Clean Air Act's rising standards. Methanol is made from natural gas and is a key component of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether). MTBE, when added to petrol, reduces carbon monoxide emissions. Methanex will contribute USDollars 70m to restart an idle Hoechst methanol plant in Texas in return for a 49 per cent ownership stake. Production of 600,000 tonnes yearly will be shared by the partners. Also Methanex puts up USDollars 97m to convert a Cyanamid ammonia plant at New Orleans to methanol, for a 70 per cent ownership stake.</p>

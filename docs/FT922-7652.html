			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Russia ends controls on oil and gas prices RUSSIA yesterday liberalised internal oil and gas prices as part of a long-promised market reform which will hit faltering state-owned enterprises and outlying republics hardest. The government will continue controlling prices for oil and gas sold to Russian enterprises - but at six times higher than the present artificially low Rbs350 a tonne. The system, expected to be put in place over the next fortnight, will be enforced by fining suppliers who exceed new ceilings for energy prices. The resolution, signed by President Boris Yeltsin, also says former Soviet republics which do not have special arrangements for oil sales in bilateral agreements with Russia will have to pay prices based on 'world levels'. Dismantling state controls on energy prices is a key component of the radical economic reform programme which Moscow has agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Yesterday's measures aim to stabilise energy prices but they will inflict unpredictable hardships on inefficient enterprises, and will throw into disarray the economies of other republics which do not have their own energy supplies, or which, in the case of the Baltics, have no special deal with Russia. The new ceiling for oil prices charged to Russian enterprises will be between Rbs1,800 (after which suppliers will be taxed up 90 per cent) and Rbs2,200 (after which increases are a punishable offence). But these are still considerably below the world market price.</p>

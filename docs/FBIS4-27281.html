			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange  reserves rose 2.34 billion dollars in May from April to hit a  record for the third month in a row, the Finance Ministry said  Wednesday [1 June].    The rise to a month-end balance of 106.91 billion dollars  indicates continued yen-selling intervention by the Bank of  Japan to stem the Japanese currency's rise against the U.S.  dollar.    The May rise was the seventh consecutive monthly increase,  the ministry said.    Foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies,  gold  and International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights.    A ministry official, as usual, declined comment on the  reasons for the change in the foreign exchange reserve balance  in releasing the figures.    Market players watch fluctuations for evidence of  intervention by the central bank, which dealers said continued  during May.    The official declined to cite any factors besides such  interventions that would have affected the foreign reserve  balance during the month.    The dollar started the month of Tokyo trading at 101.80 yen  on May 2 and hit its monthly low that day at 101.48 yen, the  official said.    The dollar was approaching its postwar record lows that day,  which preceded three days of Japanese national holidays. During  the holidays, the U.S. Federal Reserve led a concerted  intervention with some 16 other central banks to prop up the  dollar.    Dealers cited repeated dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan  during the month in addition to the fed intervention, which was  confirmed by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.    The ministry official said the dollar peaked for the month  on  May 16 at 105.15 yen, for a range of 3.67 yen for the month, and  ended May trading at 104.38 yen Tuesday.    According to the most recent comparable figures available,  Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves  with a total at the end of March of 101.7 billion yen, he said.    Germany and Taiwan each had 84.8 billion dollars, but  Taiwan's most recent figures are from January. No. 4 was the  United States at 78.7 billion dollars, followed by Spain at 42.5  billion dollars, the official said.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gardini to buy drinks group MR Raul Gardini, the Italian industrialist, is buying the Italian food and drinks group Nuova GIA in a transaction worth about Dollars 300m, agencies report from Milan. A spokesman said Mr Gardini was making the purchase through Garma, in which he holds 84 per cent, and Mr Giulio Malgara, the former European chief of The Quaker Oats Co, the remainder. The GIA group controls the Levissima mineral water brand as well as coffee, biscuit and soft drink products. Its businesses generate an annual turnover of about L330bn. GIA, which was closely held by the Berger family with minority stakes owned by the Sopaf investment bank of Jody Vender and the Luti group, owns 67.5 per cent of Crippa e Berger, which manufactures and distributes Caffe Hag, a decaffeinated coffee, and the Levissima mineral water group. The acquisition will lift the Gruppo Gardini's annual revenue in the foods and drinks sector to L2,330bn (Dollars 2.06bn). Of this amount, the international Barry cacao products line accounts for L700bn and France's Vital-Sogeviandes meat products account for L1,300bn. ***** ITALMOBILIARE, the key holding of businessman Mr Giampiero Pesenti, said consolidated net profit in 1991 fell 7.8 per cent to L115.3bn from L125.1bn in the previous 12 months, AP-DJ reports from Milan. It operates in real estate and financial services, and controls leading cement group Italcementi. Consolidated shareholders equity rose 16 per cent to L1,724bn from L1,484bn, Italmobiliare said in a statement following its board of directors meeting. The diversified holding said parent company net profit for the year was L44.77bn, little changed from L44.82bn a year earlier. ***** FONDIARIA, which controls insurer La Fondiaria, said a broad review of its operations would be completed by next September, Reuter reports from Florence. The group said that its insurance activities were going through a consolidation phase and Fondiaria will continue to examine the sale of non-strategic assets. A 10-member panel is conducting the review of its business activities. Italian press reports say that Fondiaria's controlling shareholders, Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Camillo De Benedetti were at odds over Fondiaria's expansion strategy.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Skylight office block Skylight: an office block with an atrium of a quarter of an acre (above) is to be built next to Marylebone Station in London, Vanessa Houlder writes. Westminster City Council has given approval to Lynton, the property arm of BAA, for a 350,000 sq ft building. Once a tenant is found it will replace Melbury House, a 1950s structure, and two British Rail buildings.</p>

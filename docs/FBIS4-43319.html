			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Presents Tax-Employment </F> Package"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- A major package of tax  reforms and measures aimed at boosting employment was given the  green light in a lengthy cabinet meeting, Wednesday [8 June].  The government "aims to avoid economic recovery without more  employment," explained Premier Silvio Berlusconi as ministers  emerged to present the measures approved today.    "For the first time in at least a decade," he told  journalists, "we have set ourselves goals which can be reached  without adding to the state deficit; for the first time fiscal  policy is not aimed at hiking revenue but at development; for  the first time measures are tailored for all sectors of the  economy, and not only for large-scale industry and for  employees, but also for small and medium industry and  self-employed workers."    The premier outlined a three-stage attack, with economyic  and  employment-boosting initiatives in the first 100 days of the new  administration to exploit recovery which is already on its way,  then the 1995 finance bill, followed by a sweeping  reorganisation of Italy's byzantine tax system.    Berlusconi promised no new taxes or higher tax brackets in  the finance bill, and said that the third stage would include  major steps toward "fiscal federalism," or decentralisation of  the tax system. He also pledged a shift from direct to indirect  taxes, "gradually shifting the onus of levies onto luxury and  non-essential goods and services."    Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti was given the job of  providing a point-by-point explanation of the measures in the  six-paragraph law decree approved by the cabinet today. A law  decree goes into effect immediately, but must receive approval  from both houses of parliament within 90 days, after which it  becomes null and void, or has to be reapproved by the cabinet  and presented to parliament once again.    According to a note from the Finance Ministry, the measures  approved today will generate 450,000 new jobs by the end of 1996.    Presenting what he described as a decree with "a human  face,"  Tremonti explained that young people under 32 years of age,  unemployed people, the handicapped and those laid off from their  jobs under government-sponsored schemes will be given tax  incentives for setting up their own companies: in the first year  of activity all forms of taxes and levies would be waived and  replaced by a two million lire (1,250 dollar) all-inclusive  payment, rising to three million lire for the second year and  four million lire for the third.    Private companies, those in the catering field and  self-employed professionals for the next three years will be  allowed tax "credits" equal to 25 percent of the income paid to  employees hired over and above the number employed at the time  when the decree goes into force. Companies reinvesting more  than the average ploughed back for development over the past  five years will enjoy tax breaks of 50 percent of this extra sum  in 1994 and 1995.    Stock market investors can now opt for a one-off  all-inclusive tax on dividends of 12.5 percent, or else continue  to add dividend earnings to other revenue which must be declared  in yearly tax returns. Under the current system, all dividends  have ten percent withdrawn at source, and are then declared on  tax forms where the source payment can be deducted from the  total amount of taxes owed.    In what Tremonti said was an effort to encourage greater  transparency amongst companies, smaller firms are being prompted  to seek stock market quotation in a measure offering a 16 point  reduction of company taxes for the next three years.    The law decree approved today, Tremonti added, also does  away  with a number of levies described as "useless" by Premier  Berlusconi. These include such taxes as the one on each  refrigeration unit owned by catering sector companies, which  bring a negligible amount into state coffers and provide  bureaucratic nightmares for those who have to pay them.    Tremonti told journalists that the new law decree also  marked  a breakthrough in the way legislation is drawn up, with great  care being taken to make the measures comprehensible to the  uninitiated. The decree states explicitly that any contradictory  norms on the law books are superseded. Ministers were at pains  to stress that the new measures would have no negative effects  on revenue and the public sector borrowing requirement.    Discussed but not approved in today's cabinet meeting, which  ended slightly after 2100 (1900 GMT) this evening, was a decree  introducing changes to enhance flexibility in Italy's labour  market. The decree will be "approved in the next few days," said  Tremonti. The cabinet is scheduled to meet next Tuesday [14  June].    This legislation will include measures to increase part-time  work, encourage professional training, and introduce lower-paid  contracts for employees taken on for training purposes.  Approval of these initiatives, said Premier Berlusconi, has  been suspended until after a meeting requested by unions.    Mooted initiatives to boost car sales, including a  suspension  of road tax for owners of new vehicles, which have received much  coverage in the press recently, did not even come up for  discussion in today's meeting, one cabinet member said.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: OK, SO HE'S NOT A WIZARD IN MATH DEPT.  </P> <P> You can still refer to John Wooden as the Wizard of Westwood, but his candidacy  for the Wizard of Terre Haute recently suffered a minor blemish.  </P> <P> In the Aug. 15 issue of the NCAA News, James M. Van Valkenburg, NCAA director  of statistics, reported that researcher Gary K. Johnson went over game-by-game  records of Wooden's two years at Indiana State, 1947-48. Johnson learned that  although NCAA coaching cards filed by UCLA in the 1950s showed Wooden's Indiana  State records as 18-7 and 29-7, his actual marks were 17-8 and 27-7.  </P> <P> So Wooden, who won 10 NCAA titles in 27 years at UCLA, has a career record of  664-162 (not 667-161) for a percentage of .804.  </P> <P> Add coaching records: Johnson's research put a dent in the won-lost record of  another college basketball coaching legend, Forrest (Phog) Allen.  </P> <P> Johnson found errors in Allen's previously reported records and length of  service at Baker University, where he began coaching in 1905, and at Central  Missouri State. There was no change in Allen's 590-219 mark in 39 years at  Kansas or an earlier stint at Haskell Indian Institute.  </P> <P> Allen's career record was 746-264 (.739), over 48 seasons, not 770-233 (.768)  over 46.  </P> <P> Last add coaching records: The downward revision dropped Allen from second  place on the all-time victory list to fourth, behind Adolph Rupp with 875,  Henry Iba with 767 and Ed Diddle with 759.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do basketball coaches Dean Smith of North Carolina, Ralph  Miller of Oregon State and Rupp of Kentucky have in common?  </P> <P> Too-deep coverage: Last spring, representatives of Playgirl magazine went to  Tucson to find subjects for a photo feature titled "Men of Arizona."  </P> <P> Arizona defensive back McCann Utu appeared nude in Playgirl's August issue and  has been ruled ineligible by the NCAA.  </P> <P> Said Utu: "The NCAA says I can't receive any money. But I'm a walk-on.  (Arizona) is not paying me any money to go to school here. I needed the money.  Plus the exposure, too."  </P> <P> Arizona Athletic Director Bob Bockrath said that Utu was unaware of the NCAA  rule that prohibits players from capitalizing on their athletic ability.  </P> <P> Utu, who still practices with the team, has filed an appeal, but it might be  academic. On the Wildcats' depth chart, he's listed as a sixth-string  cornerback.  </P> <P> What's all the fuss?: Friday night, Seattle Mariner outfielder Ken Griffey Sr.  became the first father to play on the same major league team with his son,  then punctuated the event by throwing out Bo Jackson as he tried to stretch a  single into a double.  </P> <P> Asked whether he was surprised by his father's throw, Ken Griffey Jr.  deadpanned: "No. It runs in the family."  </P> <P> Add Griffeys: A family controversy arose after their debut as teammates.  </P> <P> Senior, hitting second, singled in the first inning. Junior, hitting third,  followed with a single.  </P> <P> Said Junior: "We had a bet on who gets the first hit. But I had a chance to tie  him, and I did. . . . It doesn't matter. Either way, he's still taking me out  to dinner."  </P> <P> Said Senior: "No, I had the first hit. He said the first hit, and who had the  first hit?"  </P> <P> Trivia answer: All three played for Phog Allen at Kansas.  </P> <P> Quotebook: NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, when asked where he thinks the  Raiders will play this season: "In a stadium someplace."

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS PUT WINNING STREAK ON LINE AGAINST RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> The men's basketball team at Cal State Dominguez Hills, ranked 17th in the  nation in Division II, puts its six-game winning streak on the line tonight at  top-rated UC Riverside in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at 8:05.  </P> <P> Riverside (19-2) has not lost in 15 games but narrowly escaped, 59-58, in its  meeting at Dominguez Hills (15-6) when a 17-foot jump shot by the Toros'  Anthony Blackmon with nine seconds left rolled off the rim. The Highlanders and  Toros have virtually locked up postseason tournament berths in the CCAA.  Riverside (8-0) leads the conference, followed by Dominguez Hills (7-1). Four  teams are tied for third with 4-4 records.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills tuned up for tonight's game with a surprisingly easy 62-50  victory Tuesday at Chapman. The Toros did not score a basket in the first five  minutes but then outpaced the Panthers, 17-1, in the next eight minutes to take  control. Dominguez Hills held a 17-point halftime advantage.  </P> <P> The Toros, fifth in the nation in fewest points allowed, have held seven of  their last eight opponents under 60 points. Defense has been crucial because  the team has suffered through two weeks of poor shooting. The Toros have not  made 50% of their field goal attempts during that period. Riverside is  averaging 90 points a game.  </P> <P> Tonight's game pits two CCAA most valuable player candidates. Riverside guard  Maurice Pullum, a 6-2 senior, is averaging 18.6 points and four rebounds and is  one of the conference's best three-point shooters. Blackmon, a 6-7 senior  center, leads the CCAA in scoring (19.5) and rebounding (9.9) and is ranked  second in blocked shots and sixth in steals.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills plays host to last-place Cal Poly Pomona (0-8, 6-14) Saturday  night.  </P> <P> In the women's game tonight, Dominguez Hills (1-6, 6-13) will try to duplicate  its only CCAA win of the year in a 5:45 game at Riverside (1-6, 6-15).

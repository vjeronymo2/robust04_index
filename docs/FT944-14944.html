			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Airline shares up as AMR beats forecast Shares in US airlines jumped sharply yesterday after AMR, American Airlines' parent and the first US airline to report its quarterly results this season, produced profits well in excess of analysts' expectations. Net earnings after preferred stock dividends shot up to Dollars 188m from Dollars 102m in the quarter to September, and fully-diluted earnings per share rose to Dollars 2.27 from Dollars 1.34. Analysts had been predicting earnings per share of Dollars 1.75 to Dollars 2.00. It was the airline's best result in five years. Later, Mr Michael Durham, AMR's chief financial officer, warned analysts that a restructuring charge could reduce net profits to around break-even in the fourth quarter, but AMR's shares still closed Dollars 1 7/8 up at Dollars 53 7/8 . UAL rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 90 1/8 and Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/8 . Although some of AMR's other activities improved their performance, most of the profits growth came from the passenger airline operation. Revenues were down because an increase in passenger numbers was outweighed by a decrease in the average fare paid, but profits grew because American Airlines cut capacity by 5 per cent, so increasing load factors. American Airlines has been cutting costs by dropping unprofitable routes, reducing its fleet and shedding jobs. In the latest quarter, group operating expenses fell 2.2 per cent to Dollars 3.74bn, partly because jet fuel costs were 3.2 per cent lower. AMR said employee costs continued to rise. One drawback to the profits improvement is that it will make it harder for AMR to persuade its labour unions of the need to accept higher productivity and pay cuts. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, warned that low-cost carriers now accounted for almost 40 per cent of the company's domestic routes, and the figure was rapidly growing. Mr Crandall said: 'In light of our earnings, some may ask if the company still needs to change. The answer is that it clearly does.' In the last few weeks American Airlines has announced plans for cuts in jobs at its headquarters and the contracting-out of jobs among airport ground staff. The fourth-quarter restructuring charge is believed to relate to these cuts.</p>

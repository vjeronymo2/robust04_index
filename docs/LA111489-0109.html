			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Sotheby's May Televise Auction Action: Meanwhile, in London, Sotheby's auction  house is considering televising its sales live to the United States, which  would give armchair connoisseurs a chance to bid on a yacht, an Old Master or a  thoroughbred horse without leaving home. Sotheby's said Monday that if the  response from its top clients is strong, it will begin televising London sales  to subscribers in the United States via cable and satellite next year.  Sotheby's will invite 2,000 top clients to subscribe to the service at a cost  of about $195 a month. If the idea takes off, transmission of live sales in New  York and Hong Kong will follow. Subscribers would receive three pieces of  equipment -- a windowsill satellite dish to receive Sotheby's signal, a  receiver to unscramble it and a touchpad to make bids. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

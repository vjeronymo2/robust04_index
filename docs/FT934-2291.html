			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Czech voucher sell-off improves Public interest in the Czech Republic's second wave of mass voucher privatisation has surpassed official expectations, with more than 6m Czechs out of a total population of 10.3m having registered for voucher books by the December 8 deadline, according to preliminary government figures. After a slow start, which encouraged the government to extend the original deadline by one week, investor interest picked up sharply. Mr Ivan Kocarnik, finance minister, said a strong advertising campaign on television and radio helped to boost interest. Analysts say the high take-up level for voucher books should ensure the privatisation programme's success. Shares in some 770 companies, with an estimated book value of CzK145bn (Pounds 3.4bn), will be sold in the current wave. The Czech government considers voucher privatisation the most effective and quickest way to reform the Czech economy and to transfer state assets into private hands, with restructuring being left to the new owners of privatised companies. For individual Czech investors, voucher privatisation offers a sure gain at little cost. A voucher book costs CzK1,000, on top of which there is a small registration fee, but on average they can hope to gain CzK20,000-CzK30,000 in return for their investment once the vouchers have been exchanged into shares.</p>

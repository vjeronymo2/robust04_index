			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Poorest Britons see income drop THE REAL income of the poorest 10 per cent of Britons fell after housing costs by 14 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91, government figures showed yesterday. Publication of the figures in the Department of Social Security's Households Below Average Income statistics provides further proof of a growing disparity in incomes since the Tories came to power. Incomes of the population as a whole rose by about 35 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1990-91. The share of total income of the poorer half of the population dropped over the same period. In 1979 the poorer 50 per cent accounted for 32 per cent of total income after housing costs. By 1990-91 this had declined to 25 per cent. The poorest 10 per cent saw their 1979 share of total income - 4 per cent after housing costs - almost halve to 2.1 per cent by the early 1990s. There have been considerable changes since 1979 in the types of people who make up the poorest 10 per cent. There are fewer pensioners but the proportion of unemployed families has grown from about 15 per cent of the bottom 10 per cent in 1979 to 28 per cent now. People living in institutions, bed-and-breakfast accommodation or living rough are not included in the group. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the figures showed that there had been 'real and substantial' increases for every family type and economic group. He added: 'The figures do not show the poor are getting poorer.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, replied: 'It is a shaming story compounded by the department's claim that the figures do not show the poor are getting poorer.'</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Kohl aide sees prospects of trade talks deal OPPORTUNITIES for a compromise still exist within the deadlocked trade liberalisation negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a close political adviser to Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday. Mr Volker Ruhe, the secretary-general of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said the Uruguay Round deal must be based on agreement of the European Community to limit its agricultural exports. At the same time the US must agree not to move in on European markets with substitute products. Speaking on his return from a high-level trip to Washington, during which he had talks with a range of senior US administration officials, Mr Ruhe said that it was vital for Germany that an agreement should be reached in April. 'If we don't, there is the danger of a strong resurgence of protectionism in the US,' he said. 'That would hurt us all." The significance of his trip is that it comes just two weeks before Mr Kohl is himself due in Washington for talks with President George Bush, just one month before the April 19 deadline set for the Gatt negotiations. Mr Ruhe suggested that Germany's position, as the largest trading nation in the EC, and a net agricultural importer, was actually closest to that of the US, followed closely by the UK. He admitted that France, as a major agricultural exporter, faced a very difficult challenge in the Gatt round. "France is obviously in a very difficult situation,' he said. 'Many people would like to push France into the limelight. That does not help. We must come to a common position. It would not help us in Germany to go it alone." His insistence that the US must agree not to boost its own agricultural exports to fill the gap left by EC voluntary reductions is clearly intended as an effort to lower the French resistance.

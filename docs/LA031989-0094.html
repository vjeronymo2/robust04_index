			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Spring break rituals in Palm Springs began under sunny skies and 80-degree  desert temperatures, but the first influx of party-seeking students seemed to  be aware of the watchful eye of the police, officers said. Police made 54  arrests between Friday night and early Saturday, mostly for public drunkenness  and disturbing the peace, and issued 411 citations, Lt. Lee Weigel said. Last  year after the first day of spring break, police had arrested 60 young people.  About 50,000 to 100,000 visitors, mostly high school and college students, are  expected to converge on the city by the end of the week. As usual, nearly every  hotel and motel room was booked.  </P></p>

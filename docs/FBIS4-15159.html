			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian </F> Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by unidentified  reporter; recorded by V. Zhilin: "It Is Impossible To Cooperate  With Today's Authorities. What They Are Doing Is Not for the  Good of the People"]    [Text] Last week Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian  Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (USPP), made a brief  visit to Donetsk. He met with members of the oblast association  of leaders of enterprises and organizations. This visit from  the ex-prime minister of Ukraine was no accident: On 14 April  there will be a special congress of the USPP at which the  critical condition of our Republic's economy and industry will  be discussed.    On that same day Leonid Kuchma met with journalists and  answered their questions.    In particular, the AKTSENT correspondent asked Kuchma the  following questions:    [AKTSENT] The present elections have shown that it is  practically impossible to win without a powerful political  organization. Will the present congress of industrialists and  entrepreneurs not be the congress where a new political party is  born?    [Kuchma] I agree with you that without a strong party it is  impossible to expect anything significant in the future. When I  visited the Baltic countries, Estonia, and Lithuania, I was  convinced of this once again because Brazauskas himself came to  power precisely because his party had a majority in parliament.  This is also why they could form their own government. In that  kind of situation, it is possible to speak of something serious  regarding questions of reforming the economy. But if there is  no support in parliament, all your good intentions will remain  on paper. I agree that we should think seriously about a party,  but we are not ready for this yet. We do not plan to discuss  this question at the congress.    [AKTSENT] How do you evaluate the current makeup of the  parliament today?    [Kuchma] The tendencies of the new parliament are not very  promising so far. It is quite probable that, on the one hand,  the parliament will be too far to the right and, on the other,  too far to the left. Of course, you know my viewpoint--people  should not be included in the new parliament according to their  political convictions, they should not be representatives of any  particular party, but they should be people who can  professionally work not so much in politics as in the economy,  which today is on its last legs and is not working.    [AKTSENT] Leonid Danilovich, you know that in Donetsk and  Lugansk Oblasts a referendum was held on a number of questions  with which you are familiar. If you had voted in the Donbass  how would you have responded to them?    [Kuchma] My position on these issues is known. I have always  been open and was one of the initiators of the alliance with  both Russia and the CIS states, and I stand on that. I am not  recanting even now. Regarding the Russian language, my position  is this: I think there should be one state language, Ukrainian,  but there should be two official languages--Russian and  Ukrainian. What is an official state language? It is the  language of diplomacy and laws. Everything else is in official  languages, taking into account local conditions and  peculiarities. I also support the land-federative structure. I  am a proponent of having obligations and responsibility  regarding many issues shifted to the regions...    [AKTSENT] Does Ukraine need an industry that lives for  itself  and works for itself?    [Kuchma] I have said and will say that we do not need that  kind of industry, but we are not to blame for this, since we  received fragments from the overall system of the former Soviet  Union. It is impossible to restructure it in a single day.  Structural rearrangement of industry takes time and money. At  the same time we cannot simply close down the enterprises and  throw the people out in the street...    [AKTSENT] And if the enterprises are not making it?    [Kuchma] Declare them bankrupt. I have expressed my opinion  about this position many times in parliament. An analysis of  the enterprises must be conducted in each branch. Enterprises  that are operating at a loss or are unprofitable must be closed  or reprofiled. Today the following situation has been created  at many plants and mines in our country--here it is better to  pay them the average wage than to pay to have them operate some  how and produce products for which there is no demand. Today I  have already given you the example of the Donbass. Here the  coal industry was headed toward closure, dying out. It was  planned to operate at a loss since immense coal deposits had  been discovered in the Kuzbass where they use the open-pit  method. But now coal is your future. But it takes investments  to construct a modern new mine. Again I emphasize that we will  not survive alone, the more so in our enclosed space.    [AKTSENT] Do you have a program you are planning to bring to  the new parliament as a people's deputy of the new convocation?    [Kuchma] It is practically impossible to cooperate with our  present executive branch because it does what it does not for  the good of the people but for the opposite. I have already  spoken about its program previously...    [AKTSENT] Still what would you suggest as immediate steps to  emerge from the crisis?    [Kuchma] I think that today we must solve the problems that  lie on the surface. Namely, we must finally determine which  enterprises Ukraine needs and which it does not. This has to be  done in order to understand who is who. Second, of course, we  cannot change the situation without working capital. How can we  solve this problem? Already, that is a different question.  Third, is currency regulation. It too must be solved  immediately since now the fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets  to the dollar makes it so that all our products are exported at  a loss. And, undoubtedly, we must consider a number  of other questions as well, including taxation.    [AKTSENT] When speaking in parliament, you have frequently  repeated the question: Where is Ukraine going? So where is  Ukraine going today?    [Kuchma] Do you mean to ask what we are now building? I do  not think there is either pure socialism or pure capitalism in  the world today. Still capital has taken various of our  achievements from the former Soviet Union and successfully  applied them at home. Including a planned economy -- precisely  planned.    [AKTSENT] There has now been talk about the inexpediency of  holding presidential elections. What is your opinion?    [Kuchma] There is a law here and the law must be obeyed.  Therefore, the presidential elections must take place. Here I  fully share the opinion of Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. There are  no grounds for not holding them.    [AKTSENT] Ukraine also has an acute problem of nonpayments.  Is there a program for this?    [Kuchma] There is only one way out -- offsetting through  bills of exchange and determining which enterprises are  bankrupt, with all the consequences that ensue from this.    [AKTSENT] How do you envisage the mechanism for the  formation  of the budget?    [Kuchma] It must be formed from below, that is, begin with  the regions so that they are interested in the distribution of  productive forces. Now we have everything the other way around  -- the main thing is not who works and how, but that everything  is divided up per capita. This approach is absolutely  incorrect. Here I think we must have a single principle for  all: He who works better must also live better.    [AKTSENT] Radio Liberty broadcast a report to the effect  that  there were various violations in the electoral precincts of your  district, where you ran as a candidate people's deputy and won a  victory. What do you have to say?    [Kuchma] I never put out a single additional leaflet or  uttered a single offensive word against my opponents. At the  same time my opponents brought in mountains of various kinds of  paper "garbage" and distributed it throughout the district. It  would have been better for them to give notebooks and textbooks  to the school children than to get involved in something like  that.</p>

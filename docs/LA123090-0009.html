			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> FLAUBERT'S PARROT by Julian Barnes (Vintage: $8.95). In this extraordinary work  of literary legerdemain, Julian Barnes combines a novel with a rumination on  the life and work of the 19th-Century novelist Gustave Flaubert.  </P> <P> A quest to determine authenticity of two rival museums that claim to display  the stuffed parrot Flaubert used as a model for Loulou in the story "A Simple  Heart" takes amateur scholar Geoffrey Braithwaite down curious paths of  historical research and self-examination. The story of Braithwaite's dreary  life and failed marriage emerge from his discussions of Flaubert's work,  especially "Madame Bovary," much the way the story of Charles Kinbote and John  Shade does from the notes in Nabokov's "Pale Fire." "Flaubert's Parrot"  suggests the prose equivalent of a Cubist portrait, with the artist examining a  single facet of his subject from a constantly shifting point of view and  creating a startlingly realistic image from a seemingly unrelated details.  Fascinating. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

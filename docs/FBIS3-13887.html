Both leaders simply urged the PLO to resume  peace talks without making any reference to the security needs  of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.    What brought the peace process to a halt was the simple fact  that the two million unarmed and unprotected Palestinian  civilians in the territories are prey to the whims of Israeli  terrorists. The statement of the Israeli border guard commander  in front of the Israeli Commission of Inquiry that soldiers have  clear orders not to open fire at Jewish settlers even if the  latter were in the act of shooting at unarmed Palestinian  civilians underscores the danger facing the Palestinian  population and Israel's reluctance to deal with it.    This revelation did not come as a surprise to the  Palestinians, who knew it existed long before the border guard  commander announced it publicly. They have had enough  experience with settlers opening fire at them without the  soldiers or government doing anything about it.    The Israeli government's reluctance to deal with settlers  shooting at Palestinians, as well as the light sentences given  to Israelis for killing Palestinians without reason, is what  encourages Israeli terrorists to continue with their murderous  acts. They know that in the end they will be treated like  heroes among their people and may even become members of the  Israeli parliament or even ministers in the government. They do  not have to worry about the consequences of their acts on their  families, property and compatriots like Palestinians do.    If it was a Palestinian who killed an Israeli, then his home  would be demolished and his family dislodged; his village and  maybe the whole town would be placed under curfew for days and  weeks and harassed on a daily basis by the army and settlers;  several hundred Palestinians would be rounded up and sent either  to prison or exiled; and the person who committed the act would  get a life sentence plus many more years for every death or  injury he brought about.    Israeli justice is far from being just. It assumes the  Israeli idea of right or wrong. For this reason Palestinians  demand international intervention, and rightly so, for their  sake and for the sake of the peace process on the whole.</p>

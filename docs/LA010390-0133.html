			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIRST LADY GETS RADIATION TO HELP EYES  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush, plagued by double vision and watery, bloodshot eyes  from a thyroid condition, underwent new radiation treatment today at Walter  Reed Army Medical Center.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after the First  Lady returned from the hospital "she looks fine and said she feels fine."  </P> <P> Anna Perez, the First Lady's press secretary, announced that doctors  recommended the new treatment to relieve "persistent eye symptoms" from Graves'  disease, a thyroid disorder.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush went to the Washington area hospital at 6:30 a.m. today for the start  of a 10-day daily out-patient radiation therapy, which will be applied for 10  minutes in each treatment, Perez said.  </P> <P> The First Lady has been suffering for a year from Graves' disease, first  noticed around the time of her husband's inauguration.  </P> <P> So far she has undergone two separate treatments, which have failed to heal her  ailment. Several months ago she was given a radioactive treatment designed to  destroy her thyroid gland. Afterward, daily doses of prednisone, a steroid,  were administered to compensate for the thyroid.  </P> <P> Perez said the new therapy will be applied to her orbits, the bony canals  behind the eyes containing swollen muscles. "This swelling," Perez added, "has  caused the double vision, tearing and discomfort, which Mrs. Bush is  experiencing."  </P> <P> She said the radiation treatment is expected to relieve the swelling. Mrs. Bush  also is expected to be gradually taken off prednisone, which causes side  effects such as water retention.  </P> <P> Immediately following the destruction of the thyroid gland Mrs. Bush underwent  a dramatic weight loss. Later, after taking prednisone, she began to look puffy  and gained weight, and the symptoms persisted.  </P> <P> Perez said Mrs. Bush, who has a heavy January schedule, will carry out her  normal schedule.  </P></p>

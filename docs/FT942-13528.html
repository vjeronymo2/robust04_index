			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / OECD to discuss policy against bribery The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development is meeting this week in Paris amid hopes of agreeing a joint policy to combat bribery and corruption around the world. The grouping of 24 industrialised nations has been working for years on a code of practice on corruption, but the issue has been given a new urgency by the US, which in the last year has stepped up its efforts to secure a tough OECD policy. Although all countries outlaw bribery of their own officials, the US's foreign corrupt practices act is the only legislation in the OECD that criminalises the payment of a bribe to the official of another country. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, has complained that US companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts every year because they are unable to match their opponents' bribes to foreign officials. Officials believe they are now within reach of a compromise between countries which, like the US, want a strong commitment from all members to clamp down on bribery, and others which want to retain more flexibility. The issue is due to be discussed today at an OECD meeting on investment, and could be followed up by a final decision on Friday. 'The chances are better than even, but by no means a lead pipe cinch,' said one official familiar with the discussions. The OECD secretariat has tried to draft a declaration that bridges the gap between, on the one hand, declaring that countries will take the steps necessary to combat bribery  - and listing those steps  - and, on the other had, saying that countries will take, as appropriate, the steps they may deem necessary. Among the steps that have been proposed are measures to ensure that bribes paid by companies are not treated as tax-deductible business expenses; to deny government contracts to companies which engage in bribery; and to make the payment of a bribe overseas a criminal offence. Criminalisation, however, raises complex questions about the extraterritorial reach of national laws. The countries which are pushing for a tougher stance on bribery hope that the OECD policy can be accompanied by clear statements from member countries of the concrete steps they plan to take to fulfil their commitments. Besides the competitiveness question pressed by the US, aid officials around the world believe an assault on bribery is essential to improving governance in the developing world.</p>

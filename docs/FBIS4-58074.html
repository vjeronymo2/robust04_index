			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 1 (AFP)--Yemen President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih ordered Sunday [1 May] the release of southern troops who  surrendered to northern forces after bitter fighting north of  Sanaa last week, in which dozens were killed.    Meanwhile officials in the capital accused southern forces  of  massing troops along the former border which divided North and  South Yemen before unification in May 1990.    The official news agency SABA' said Salih, the rival of Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, ordered that southern  troops who surrendered after clashes Wednesday and Thursday in  the 'Imran region, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa,  would be free to return to their units.    The ferocious tank battles left nearly 200 dead and dozens  of  others wounded, according to journalists.    But the Defence Ministry in Sanaa said 79 people were killed  and 119 wounded, while an unknown number of others had fled or  disappeared.    Salih said he had ordered the state to pay for 11 seriously  wounded southern troops to be flown abroad for hospital  treatment, SABA' reported. Three had already left Sanaa for  Jordan Saturday.    Northern military officials said several hundred troops of  the southern third armoured brigade at 'Imran had joined the  northern forces.    A Defence Ministry spokesman in Sanaa said 85 tanks were  destroyed in the fighting, which caused more than 500 million  dollars' worth of damage.    Salih pledged that the buildings hit in 'Imran would be  rebuilt.    The armies of north and south, each totalling about 30,000,  have never merged since unification.    Military officials in the capital said there were "large  concentrations of southern troops along the former border"  Sunday, and accused al-Bid's supporters of "wanting to push the  country into a bloody civil war."    The officials also said southern jets were buzzing northern  units based in the Abyan region, east of the southern port city  of Aden.    Fighting erupted in Abyan in February and the officials said  "secessionist" elements in al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP)  were planning fresh attacks on the northern al-Amaliqa brigade  based there.    Yemen's political crisis erupted in August, when al-Bid  refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major economic  and military reforms and citing security fears.  yemen</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP COACHES, LINEMAN AND BACK HONORED  </P> <P> Fairfax Co-Coaches Ron Price and Earl Smith, their quarterback, Rahim Muhammad,  and Westchester lineman Wes Smith won the top Westside honors at the annual  Times high school football awards breakfast.  </P> <P> Price and Earl Smith were named the area's Coaches of the Year, Muhammad Back  of the Year and Wes Smith Lineman of the Year.  </P> <P> Carson quarterback John Walsh received the fourth annual Glenn Davis Award,  given to the top high school football player in Southern California.  </P> <P> Walsh passed for a Los Angeles City and state single-season record of 4,206  yards and 48 touchdowns. He led Carson to the City 4-A Division championship.  </P> <P> The invitational event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times Fund, brought  together top award winners from 12 Times circulation areas: Westside, Central,  Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino counties), Orange County, San  Gabriel Valley, Southeast, South Coast, Glendale, South Bay, San Fernando  Valley, San Diego County and Ventura County.  </P> <P> Fairfax (11-1) had nine consecutive regular-season victories without a loss and  was the top-seeded team in the Los Angeles City 3-A playoffs. The Lions won two  playoff games and were upset in the semifinals by eventual 3-A champion Los  Angeles Polytechnic, 35-28.  </P> <P> Price and Earl Smith were co-coaches for eight years at Crenshaw, where their  teams had a 47-32 record and won two league championships. In 1982, the Cougars  lost to Carson, 34-27, in the 4-A City final. In 1984, Price and Smith's last  season at Crenshaw, the Cougars upset Banning, 26-21, in the semifinals, ending  the Pilots' streak of nine consecutive appearances in the 4-A title game.  </P> <P> Their three-year record at Fairfax is 21-10. This year's Lions were not  expected to be dominant because the team lacked depth. Smith and Price had nine  two-way players on a 29-man roster.  </P> <P> Muhammad, who also was a top defensive back, was the force that drove the  Lions. Price called him "this year's version of Venice's Louis Jones," the  quarterback who was named The Times' 1989 Westside Back of the Year. "There is  nothing on the field that (Muhammad) can't do," Price added.  </P> <P> The Fairfax quarterback was the Coastal Conference and Metro League Player of  the Year. As a runner through 11 games, he had 106 carries for 842 yards and 11  touchdowns. As a passer during that same span, he completed 78 of 134 passes  (58.2%) for 1,146 yards and 11 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Wes Smith, a two-way lineman and special teams player, and his Westchester  teammate, running back Charles Grissam, were chosen Western League Players of  the Year. Smith was his team's leading tackler with 31 solos and 84 assists and  also topped the Comets with 13 1/2 sacks.  </P> <P> He had a 3.5 grade-point average and was awarded a letterman's jacket as the  Westchester football team's highest academic achiever.  </P> <P> Besides Muhammad and Grissam, The Times' All-Westside first team on offense  includes wide receivers Darren Smith and David Saraf, both of Beverly Hills;  tight end De-Milo Bynum of Fairfax and linemen Manny Nieto of St. Monica, Brin  Morimoto of Venice, Chris Ziegler of Santa Monica and Avetis Avetisyan of  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Also chosen at quarterback was Ziv Gottlieb of Beverly Hills, and the other  running back besides Grissam is Mario Mattison of Fairfax. The kicker is Culver  City punter Rick Heineman, who also played tight end and linebacker.  </P> <P> The first-team defense besides Wes Smith includes linemen Eric Gronemeyer of  Brentwood, Mark Hochberg of Culver City and Eduardo Payan of Fairfax.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638): </F> "Quicken the Pace of Optimizing the Iron and Steel Industrial  Structure"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a recent national  metallurgical work conference, Metallurgical Industry Minister  Liu Qi devoted a substantial portion of his work report to  admonishing people in the iron and steel industry not to miss  the current, favorable opportunity to quicken the pace of  optimizing the iron and steel industrial structure.    Liu Qi's admonition contains this message: China should not  be merely content with its status as an iron and steel power but  should redouble its efforts to narrow the gap with advanced  world levels in iron and steel production, and become a strong  iron and steel power. This message is justified by the fact that  China's backward iron and steel production structure has caused  a substantial gap between its iron and steel industry, and that  of the world in terms of quality, variety, consumption, cost,  and labor productivity. Statistics show that only 25 percent of  technology and equipment used by China's iron and steel industry  is relatively advanced, and 30 to 40 varieties of its steel  products cannot satisfy demand. The energy consumption levels  of key iron and steel enterprises are 40 percent more than  advanced international levels. Only 83 percent of steel is  turned into finished products, 10 percent less than in Japan.  In terms of continuous casting ratios, China is the fourth  lowest among the world's 17 countries which produce 10 million  tonnes of steel each. And its real labor productivity is far  below advanced international levels.    Over the past few years, the poor structure of the iron and  steel industry was masked by quantitative shortages because of  the substantial imbalance between supply and demand in our  country's iron and steel products. Rapid growth in steel output  has now effectively relieved the pressure of demand, thus  facilitating efforts by the iron and steel industry to optimize  its technological and economic structure. Some metallurgists in  China pointed out: China's iron and steel industry has entered a  transition period in which it is shifting from emphasizing  "tonnage growth" to "optimizing its structure." If China wants  to become a steel power capable of producing more than 100  million tonnes of steel, it cannot merely increase tonnage on  the basis of its current structure but should seek increases on  the basis of an optimized structure.    Because the iron and steel industry is an important raw and  semifinished materials sector, its structural optimization is by  no means its own internal affair; this is a demand stemming from  national economic restructuring regarding the development of the  iron and steel industry. For a long time to come, our country  will need large quantities of various high-quality steel  products if it wants to greatly expand the railway,  transportation, energy, communications, automobile, and  electronic sectors. For this reason, Metallurgy Industry  Minister Liu Qi urged the iron and steel industry to perform the  following tasks to optimize its structure: Speeding up the  development of continuous casting technology to promote the  optimization of steel smelting and steel rolling technology;  focusing on upgrading the technical levels of a number of old  enterprises and special steel enterprises; devoting major  efforts to applying various new techniques and technologies; and  going all out to develop domestic mines.    Liu Qi also pointed out emphatically: In optimizing the iron  and steel industrial structure, we must change our concepts  instead of merely increasing output and expanding the production  scale to improve efficiency. The key to improving efficiency  lies in increasing the technological contents of all production  stages, in optimizing technological lines, and in manufacturing  competitive products. We should take structural optimization as  a major task which determines the iron and steel industry's  long-term success or failure.    Iron and steel industry people in foreign countries now  recognize that quantity and scale are no longer the sole  hallmark of a country's iron and steel industrial strength. To  emerge as a strong iron and steel power in the world, China's  iron and steel industry must devote great efforts to optimizing  its structure, and change its status as an iron and steel power  with high output in favor of a strong iron and steel power with  high productive capacity and productivity.</p>

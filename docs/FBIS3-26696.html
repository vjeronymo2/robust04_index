			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455) and Deng Ying </F> (6772 4481)]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's nuclear safety  supervision and control system has begun to take shape,  according to a responsible person of the National Nuclear Safety  Administration [NNSA].    The responsible person said: Since the seventies, when China  began to develop its nuclear power industry, it has followed a  principle of "safety first and quality first." In 1984, the  NNSA was formed. As a result, the construction and development  of the nuclear power industry began to have a legal basis. The  state has promulgated three administrative regulations -- the  "Regulations Governing the Safety Supervision and Control of  Civilian Nuclear Facilities," the "Regulations Governing the  Control of Nuclear Materials," and the "Regulations Governing  the Emergency Control of Nuclear Accidents in Nuclear Power  Plants" -- 12 departmental rules and regulations, including  nuclear safety provisions and implementation rules, as well as  59 nuclear safety guiding principles. Some nuclear safety laws  and regulations and technical documents are now being  formulated. In accordance with the nuclear safety standards  established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, these  regulations, rules, and guiding principles stipulate in detail  the safety standards and quality-guarantee requirements for the  construction and operation of civilian nuclear facilities.    The responsible person continued: China has adopted a safety  licensing system for civilian nuclear facilities. As far as  nuclear safety controls are concerned, we have followed the  principle that "the law should be enacted first so that there is  something to be observed, and that once implemented, the law  should be enforced to the letter." To promote scientific  standards in its work, the NNSA has established a nuclear safety  committee consisting of 32 noted experts from various technical  fields. The committee provides consultation services concerning  the safety examination and evaluation, supervision, and control  of civilian nuclear facilities. In addition, a nuclear safety  center was established in Beijing to undertake the task of  providing technical information for nuclear safety controls.  The center is engaged in the technical evaluation, testing,  monitoring, and data analysis of nuclear safety. A total of  three supervisory stations have been set up in Shanghai,  Guangdong, and Chengdu, with each being responsible for the  supervision of nuclear safety in east China, south China, and  the western region, respectively. In terms of providing  technical means to guarantee nuclear safety, China has already  established a training center equipped with a simulated nuclear  power plant and has developed a batch of advanced software for  analyzing and evaluating nuclear safety, with some of these  having been used in the safety appraisals of nuclear power  plants. Meanwhile, a system for responding to and evaluating  nuclear accidents has also been established.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / ERM effect on pay deals seen as slight UK MEMBERSHIP of the European exchange rate mechanism has had little effect so far on pay determination, according to Britain's two biggest pay research bodies. A survey of 185 organisations by Industrial Relations Services (IRS) found that 83 per cent 'had not assessed the implications of ERM membership either for their level of pay settlement or for their pay determination process as a whole'. Even companies which had assessed the implications found it difficult to say what they were. Incomes Data Services (IDS), the rival pay analysis body, also concludes in its latest report: 'The idea that the discipline of the ERM produces lower pay settlements remains an unproven hypothesis for the present.' IRS, however, holds out the possibility that a 'transformation of pay-setting behaviour could have been taking place' thanks to the combination of recession and ERM membership. Distinguishing between the two effects is still impossible, it adds. The IRS survey found that most employers are planning to settle near the projected inflation rate of about 4 per cent in the six months to August this year. It also found that only 8 per cent of employers are suffering from skill shortages. But in spite of the recession most organisations are continuing to pay the 'market rate' for most jobs. Both IRS and IDS see a reduction in the number of pay freezes compared with last year. IDS's estimate of average pay settlements is somewhat higher than that of IRS, in spite of being about half the level of a year ago. IDS says most settlements are bunched between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent, while the average rise for private-sector managers is 5.3 per cent. It adds: 'The fact that most deals match the increase in the cost of living suggests that bargaining is still centrally about motivating staff and protecting living standards.' IDS found pay freezes are only a small proportion of all settlements and there are significant sectors where there have been no earnings standstills. These include cars, food, drink and tobacco, chemicals, public services, energy supply, building societies, insurance and oil. Companies which froze the pay of employees early last year have not done so again this year. Pay cuts have been extremely rare. IDS report 613 and IDS Top Pay Unit Review 133.

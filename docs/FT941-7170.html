			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper price boosted - Market Report The three months COPPER price ran up to Dollars 1,900 a tonne level by the end of after hours trading at the London Metal Exchange, a Dollars 20 gain from Wednesday, helped by aluminium's strength and solid support below Dollars 1,880 a tonne earlier in the session. At the London bullion market GOLD closed at 35 cents down at Dollars 378.10 a troy ounce after the New York market had weathered a test by bank selling. PLATINUM was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 389.50 an ounce, down Dollars 2.50 on the day and Dollars 9.50 on the week so far, as perception of the need to cover against possible South African mine disruptions in the lead-up to the April elections subsided.

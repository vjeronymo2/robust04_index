			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / How to Spend It: Bright ideas for lighting - How to transform your home with subtle shades I HAVE seen some hideous light fittings in other people's houses and I have installed (or more accurately hammered in) some pretty terrible fixtures in my own home. In fact, three inherited 1970s style tracked spotlights are aimed at my head as I write - so ghastly is the sight that I am paralysed into inaction. Very few people get lighting right. Many simply do not bother and use the pendants granny left them, while others fill their ceilings and walls with the latest fiddly systems from pretentious designers with hairdresser names. There is a way out of the darkness, but finding it is difficult. This is because the business of lighting is, it seems, three parts technical, five parts fashion and two parts nonsense. Making mistakes is not only terrifically easy but terrifyingly expensive. If you, like me, have shadows where you want light and glare where you need a soft, reassuring glow, read on. There are three routes to effective illumination - all involve thinking, bother and money. The difference between the options is in the price and the degree of nuisance. Option one: hire a lighting consultant. These are people who know their footcandles from their lux (metric and imperial measures of illumination) and will wash a wall with light rather than graze it (in-talk for a dappled effect). This option is only for those prepared to spend quite a lot of money to get the job done well. Consultants will ask about needs, make suggestions and then produce a plan. Architects can do the job, but the cost will probably be the same, so it is worth going for the specialists. The consultants will also organise the electricians, find the right fittings and oversee the job. It is inevitable that the room or house will have to be cleared. Beefy men with cold chisels, power screwdrivers and portable radios tuned to Kiss FM will move in and create dusty mayhem. They will hack channels in the walls, lift floorboards and rip up ceilings to hide wires and bulky fittings. This is not a job for the faint-hearted, but in the end the chances are strong (but not guaranteed) that you will have a room which is both functional and comfortable. It is probably best to coincide this brutal activity with re-wiring or timing it to precede the next decoration. Option two: become your own consultant. This and the final option involve quite a lot of learning. It is the stage I am in now and I wish I was rich enough to hire a consultant. The first step is to buy a book that gives the basics and is written for the DIY enthusiast rather than architects or professional interior designers. Most books on interiors, such as the Conran series, have chapters on lighting. But the best - although far from brilliant - choice is the The Lighting Book by Deyan Sudjic (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 14.99). This is a book where the text was, it seems, written around a bunch of stock pictures. But Sudjic has some good hints and provides the basic theory of lighting in an approachable format. In spite of its inadequacies, the book will help prevent elementary blunders and save its cover price many times over. You, like me, will learn about the different qualities of light sources  - traditional tungsten versus tungsten-halogen and fluorescent (warm, intermediate and cool). The quantities of light needed, the distribution, effects, and fittings are described. And there are plenty of pictures to see how others have achieved well-lit bliss. The book also lists consultants and suppliers. With some learning, and lots of enthusiasm, it is possible to plan your own lighting scheme. Start with pencil and paper (draw on a squared sheet to scale, if possible) and not in the shop. Buying the equipment and fittings is the last part of the task. Collect catalogues from lighting shops and use the information provided to work out how many fittings you need to get the desired effect. This is sometimes difficult for the uninitiated, so experiment as much as possible with an extension cord and temporary fittings. After many weekends wasted on bodging DIY jobs, I have learnt to hire professionals who do the job well and in half the time. This is especially necessary with the safety that electricity demands. Once you have drawn up the plan, talk it through with a qualified electrician who will be able to help on the technicalities and should be able to buy most of the fittings at trade prices. This is particularly true if you decide to use recessed fittings and low-voltage systems. The supplier catalogues will show the sort of space needed in, say, the ceiling void, but an experienced electrician will be able to make an instant judgment on the practicalities. It is always wise to build in as much flexibility as possible. Option three: fiddle with what you have. Given that most lighting has not been planned at all, it is possible to make huge improvements with a little thought and a few changes to the fittings. This is probably the best course if you rent and are not allowed to hack into the fabric of the building to hide wires and recess fittings. Dramatic differences can be achieved simply by reducing the role of the central pendant, changing shades, installing dimmers (remember that some new light sources, such as low-energy bulbs, cannot be dimmed), plugging in more table lamps, bouncing light off ceilings and shifting existing lights by lengthening the flex. The least you can do is reduce eyestrain and make your home more welcoming.</p>

We believe that this is a realistic figure for several reasons. First, there are many physicians who are specialists, and who will use only a small portion of the coding manuals during their normal course of business. We anticipate that these physicians and their office staffs will quickly identify those parts of the coding books that apply to their practice. Additionally, many offices have developed reference lists pertaining to the codes frequently used in their particular practices. Once this list has been developed, very little physician involvement is required for the coding process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of time necessary for the physician to work with his or her clerical staff in the selection of the correct diagnosis code(s) was not factored into the estimate of 1 minute. That estimate reflected the use of the code book or reference list and the documentation process, whether manual or key entry. We anticipate that the diagnosis code(s) will become as familiar to the office staffs as the recording of the narrative diagnostic language, and that completion of the billing form will proceed as smoothly as it did prior to the implementation of this diagnostic coding requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Patient Information and Confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Psychiatric Association (APA) stated that there may be instances when the diagnosis information provided to the patient (particularly in non-assigned claims) could have an adverse impact on the patient and course of treatment. The APA suggests that HCFA have an exceptions process that allows the physician to determine whether diagnosis information should be directly provided to the patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree, and note that there is already an established procedure for such situations. The physician should file the form HCFA&hyph;1500 on behalf of the beneficiary as required by section 1848(g)(4) of the Act. The form should include the appropriate diagnostic codes and should be forwarded to the Medicare carrier. If a physician determines that diagnostic information should not be released directly to a patient, the physician may furnish bills to the patient without diagnostic information. In addition to psychiatric diagnoses, physicians also may choose to use this procedure for terminal illnesses or other conditions of a sensitive nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The APA expressed a concern that HCFA should have a mechanism in place to assure that diagnostic information is kept confidential and not released to third parties except when permitted by law. It recommended that the regulations be amended to include privacy protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We share the APA's concerns about the confidentiality of patient information. To assure that the beneficiary is protected, when we release medical data, the data do not include any patient-specific identifiers. Patient-specific medical data in the custody of HCFA and its intermediaries and carriers are fully protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Utilization Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A pharmaceutical company is concerned that utilization review of physician services and future drug utilization review may be less effective because of the limitation of four diagnostic codes on the bill or request for payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utilization review of physician services will be enhanced by the diagnostic coding requirement since the information can be categorized by code and made available for immediate use. At this time, we have no plans to implement a drug utilization review program using the diagnostic coding information on the form HCFA&hyph;1500. We will consider the effect of the four diagnostic code limitations if we propose a drug utilization review program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned the possibility of the physician diagnostic coding requirement eventually becoming a tool to standardize physician practice patterns nationwide without physician input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

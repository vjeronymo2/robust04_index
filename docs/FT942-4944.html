			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Heavy losses for Italian bank Banco di Sicilia, the leading financial institution on the island, has reported 1993 losses of L849bn (Dollars 502m), one the of the biggest annual losses recorded by an Italian regional bank, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The bank is 14 per cent owned by the Treasury and the remainder is held by a foundation controlled by the Sicilian regional government. The losses, which compare with a break-even in 1992, are in line with estimates made by a Bank of Italy inspection last year. The latter led to the resignation of several senior executives and an investigation by Palermo magistrates. Finalisation of the 1993 accounts should pave the way for a L949bn capital increase funded by the Treasury and the Sicilian regional government. In addition to the losses, the bank has accumulated doubtful loans of L4,200bn, equivalent to 7 per cent of the those in the Italian banking system.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: KLM The Dutch carrier's annual results come as a stark reminder of the sickly state of the international airline industry. Despite useful progress in trimming costs and winning market share, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines dived into a Fl 562m loss. As British Airways' latest traffic figures confirm, passengers retain an annoying preference for the cheaper seats at the back of the cabin, wrecking airlines' profitability. With 350 per cent gearing and sharply declining aircraft yields, KLM is under considerable financial pressure. This must only add to the impetus to consummate its proposed integration with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The rationalisation of corporate overheads and airport facilities would quickly release working capital. Fleet harmonisation and the disposal of holdings in other associated airlines would yield longer-term financial benefits. KLM may do especially well out of a merger if, as seems probable, its Amsterdam hub provided the combined airline's operational centre. Yet the complexities remain awesome. With six national governments, four corporate managements, and several sensitive trade unions involved, the discussions may well drag through the summer. Any hitches would further undermine KLM's faltering share price. But they would come as a welcome relief to Air France as it begins to roll down the privatisation runway.</p>

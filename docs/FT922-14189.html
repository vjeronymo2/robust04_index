			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Farewell balanced books If Labour wins, the eye of memory will fly back to 1964. The last time the trade unions' political arm turned the country around after 13 years of Conservative administration many of us expected miracles. There was optimism in the air. This is no 1964. Mr Neil Kinnock is an uncertain quantity, Mr John Major an uninspiring one. Both are children of modest origins. In 1964, the then Mr Harold Wilson sold himself as the representative of modernity, progress and science. Lord Home, who very nearly beat him, appeared to be the personification of old-fashioned Conservatism: aristocratic, innumerate, stuffy, out of touch. He made an ass of himself when he used matchsticks in an effort to demonstrate how the economy worked. Subsequent history suggests that the electoral mechanism, as is its habit, made suckers of the electorate. The success of the Wilson confidence trick showed how imperfect the judgment of the floating voter can be. For the country may have done better under Lord Home. It certainly lost its way under Labour. The seeds of the excesses of the late 1970s were sown during the lax governance of the 1960s. This time, the disillusionment of erstwhile Conservatives may put Labour in. There appears to be a greater degree of disenchantment with the government than there is mistrust of the opposition. It is an inglorious moment in our political history. There is no gladness in the heart. This is not to say that Mr Kinnock is misleading the public. It would be better if he were. For what is particularly depressing about the prospect of a Labour government is what the Labour leader says about his party's programme - namely that it will expel the concept of the competitive market from the management of the public services. I hope he is not telling the truth. If he is, the government that he may form on Friday could destroy the most valuable gift Mrs Margaret Thatcher bequeathed to the economy: a sense of how to manage money. England is a nation that has produced a few brilliant mathematicians and a great many arithmetical dunces. It took the International Monetary Fund to convince the Callaghan government that there is a relationship between cash inflow and cash outflow, and it took Mrs Thatcher to teach this important lesson to the country. Before the then Mr Callaghan and cash limits, public expenditure was calculated in 'real terms', or, as we used to call it, funny money. Before Mrs Thatcher, there was no direct connection in many peoples' minds between 'the government's' money and their own. This innocent belief in the generosity of the Bank of Fairyland was not confined to the national accounts. It was an article of faith in the finance departments of nationalised industries, local authorities and public bodies of all kinds. During the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher shattered that childish illusion. I fear that the sad experience of the 1990s may be of a Britain struggling to sink back into the accounting regimes of fairyland. The rot has already started: last autumn's pre-election public spending settlement under Mr John Major would not have been countenanced by his predecessor. It has been worsened by a campaign in which promises to spend have been thinly disguised by phrases such as 'as resources allow', or 'what the country can afford', reflecting the letter, if not the spirit, of Mrs Thatcher's teachings. Do not mistake my meaning. The constraints imposed by membership of the exchange rate mechanism are a given. The route-lines of budgetary convergence within the European Community are set. These may prevent the governments of the 1990s from running amok. I am also aware of Labour's earnest intention to control public expenditure at the macro level: Mr Kinnock is determined to demonstrate that his renovated Labour party will not repeat the mistakes of the 1970s. What concerns me is the potential for waste at the micro level. If Labour gets in, compulsory competitive tendering will be abolished, except as a 'last resort'. The NHS reforms, which should encourage the cutting of unnecessary costs, will be reversed. This is not replacing care with capitalism, as one small tale shows. On a radio phone-in yesterday, an ambulance driver had Mr Kinnock nonplussed. He spoke of a potential ambulance services trust. It would sell its skills as an in-house training unit and plough the money back. The Labour leader recovered after a while and said that would be ok as an extra, but not if the service depended on it. In its talk of 'underfunding' of the social services, Labour never shows awareness of the value of such little bursts of beneficial enterprise. It does not value competition. It has only recently become acquainted with markets. It talks often of spending, rarely of reducing expenditure. It has learned a great deal about public accounting since 1964, but on the evidence of this campaign not quite enough. Not yet.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Feltrim action to start this week The next chapter in the long-running Lloyd's of London legal saga opens this week when more than 1,600 members of the insurance market start a fresh High Court battle to win compensation for 1980s losses. The Feltrim Names' Association hopes to repeat the success of the Gooda Walker action group earlier this month. It won millions of pounds of damages for losses by Names involved in 'spiral' insurance - by which underwriters agreed to cover others for excessive losses from catastrophes. The Feltrim association is claiming a total of Pounds 600m in three legal cases. The first, originally scheduled to start today but now not expected to get under way until tomorrow, covers losses dating from between 1987 and 1989. The case is the latest in a series of legal actions mounted by Lloyd's Names which may stretch into the next century. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether Names have a case for challenging Lloyd's legal right to reclaim money spent on their behalf out of its central fund, which protects insurance policies for Lloyd's clients. A victory for the Writs Response Group would hamper Lloyd's attempts to claim an estimated Pounds 1.3bn outstanding from lossmaking Names. Even if the Names do not win outright the possibility of a further appeal to the Lords and then the European Court could delay settlement of the amounts outstanding for several years. Also expected soon is a decision by the defendants in the Gooda Walker case on whether to appeal. The Feltrim case centres on allegations that the professional Lloyd's agencies involved in the catastrophe 'spiral' were negligent. Names on Feltrim syndicates were badly hit by a succession of disasters including the 1988 Piper Alpha oil platform accident. The weight of legal action facing Lloyd's professional agencies has increased the pressure for an out-of-court settlement. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names' Association, said the Gooda Walker judgment opened a 'window of opportunity' for such a deal - at least for the 'spiral' cases. He said many of the Names' action groups regarded a new settlement as the most sensible route for Lloyd's, but added that 'if one thinks one is being successful, the price goes up'.</p>

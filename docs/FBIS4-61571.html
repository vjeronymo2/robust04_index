			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksey Ivlev, including </F> recorded comments by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at  news conference]    [Text] [Ivlev] If the Russian-Estonian talks are dragged  out then the 2,500 Russian servicemen presently stationed on the  territory of that Baltic state will remain there as long as  necessary, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated at a  news conference today. He warned the Estonian side:    [Grachev] If this situation changes, then it will not take  long to reinforce this group in order to guard and defend  Russian military sites securely.    [Ivlev] The Estonian authorities' policies toward the  Russian-speaking population was called apartheid by Pavel  Grachev.    [Grachev] They are dividing them into black and white, brown  and red, green and blue. What is this? So what if by  nationality he is Russian? He was born and grew up there, or he  has lived there for 30 or 40 years. That is his land as well  when it comes down to it. It is not permissible for anyone to  throw him out his own country.    [Ivlev] Pavel Grachev also touched on the issue of Russia's  attitude to the Partnership for Peace program that, in his  opinion, is not entirely suitable for our country.    [Grachev] You know, we came to the conclusion why should we  not, Russia, put forward our own partnership concept. What, are  we worse than the others when it comes down to it?    [Ivlev] A group of Russian scholars are to prepare proposals  on this by 15 May that will then be examined by a Russian  Security Council session. If they are approved then they will  be announced by Pavel Grachev on 24 May at NATO's headquarters  in Brussels.    Aleksey Ivlev, Vladimir Abdeyev, NTV, from the Russian  Defense Ministry.</p>

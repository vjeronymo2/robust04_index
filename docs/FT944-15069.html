			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Vickers confirms workforce cut Tank builder Vickers is to cut 235 jobs at its twin plants in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne and 65 jobs are to go from Newcastle-based International Research and Development, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, it was confirmed yesterday. The Vickers Defence Systems redundancies, for which the company is seeking volunteers, affect managerial, supervisory and support staff. The plants' 513 manufacturing workers are not affected. The cuts are being made in spite of Vickers' success in winning a Pounds 1.1bn order in July from the government for 259 Challenger 2 tanks. Defence systems chief executive Mr John Crowther said the present order book secured the business for five years but the company had to restructure to respond effectively to 'future market opportunities'. The redundancies are to be split equally between the Leeds and Newcastle plants. The company said both would retain the capability to manufacture complete tanks. A spokesman said the company, which currently employs 1,640 people, was reducing the levels of management. The loss of the 65 white-collar IRD jobs, confirmed by Rolls-Royce yesterday, is a further blow for Tyneside, which has been hit by a wave of redundancies this year. IRD carries out research and development in materials testing, ceramics and other fields. It currently employs 156 people. The job cuts, affecting scientists, engineers and technicians, are the result of a fundamental review of IRD following a serious fire at its premises in March. Until now, half of IRD's work has been for Rolls-Royce companies and half for outside clients, including Nuclear Electric, the Ministry of Defence and National Power. The company is to be relocated to the nearby Parsons Power Generation Systems site in Newcastle. Mr David Clelland, Labour MP for Tyne Bridge, whose constituency includes Vickers' Newcastle plant, described the tank maker's job losses as very disappointing, especially in view of the workforce's 'tremendous fight' for the Challenger 2 contract.</p>

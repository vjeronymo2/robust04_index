			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Acrostic competition Shakespearian sonnets and Spenserian stanzas, free verse, carols, cantatas and choruses, poems in French and in Italian were all inspired by our John Major acrostic competition. There were literary ruminations on the state of both the nation and the England cricket team - and, less predictably, on the nature of John and Norma's love life. Runner-up was Bernard McGinley of London with an extract from his lively literary epic The Blokiad. There were two winners. William Hopkin, aged 8, gave us haiku which began: John Major, On his nose Has spectacles Not freckles. A book token, rather than a bottle of champagne, goes to William - if only he would send us his address, which he omitted to include on his entry. The alliterative acrostic of joint winner RE Hurst of Yorkshire was as much fun to recite as it is to read: Juggling, jinking, jollying, jetting Owling, scowling, opting-outing Hushing, halting, hamming, hailing, Never nothing, nothing nailing . . . A magnum of champagne is on its way.</p>

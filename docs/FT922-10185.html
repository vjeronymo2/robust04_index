			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Gilts stage a glittering performance: Why UK government securities have returned to favour with investors The issue of a further Pounds 1bn of gilt edged tap stocks yesterday, only a few trading hours after a successful auction of Pounds 2 1/2 bn of 25-years stocks, completes a spectacular fortnight in this often unexciting market. Less than three weeks ago commentators were moaning that British economic policy might be hobbled by the near-impossible task of funding some Pounds 28bn of government borrowing in the next year. But in the weeks since the April 9 the funding job is a quarter done, 20 year yields have fallen by nearly a full point and the Bank of England has become confident enough to hint last night that short-term rates could fall, too. The immediate cause of this surge is obvious: dealers were not expecting an outright Conservative election victory, and the whole market is celebrating. But there is much more to it than that. Though it is the equity market which has reached new peaks, while gilts have merely returned to a strong trend which was momentarily shaken by election panic, it is the fixed interest market which has attracted the big net flows of new investment funds. Any analyst who had even a month ago forecast a gilts boom at a time when government borrowing was seen as slipping out of control would have been told to take a holiday. The international flight into sterling since the election also stands traditional wisdom on its head, and these are only partly responses to the election result. Foreign bond investors had run down their sterling holdings to historically low levels ahead of polling day, which largely explains the strength of the benchmark ten-year bond - this is the maturity which foreign funds prefer. City traders report stronger overseas buying than they can ever remember, and from all quarters, with especially strong Japanese and German demand. This does not explain, though, why British institutions snapped up the new Pounds 2 1/2 bn 25-year stock - too long-dated for Continental tastes, thus demonstrating a commitment which shows long-term confidence in bonds. There are two principal and seemingly durable changes in market psychology at work. Foreign ratings of Britain in the international stability league have risen not by a step but by a floor or two. This is partly because Mr Major's standing has risen abroad as well as at home; but he should not let this undermine his usual modesty. It is much more a measure of deepening political and economic worry in all the other major markets: mainly political in France and the US, both political and economic in Germany, and both, in Japan (and Italy). At the same time, fashion has been changing among British fund managers, reflected in the steady fall in ten-year yields which set in long before the elections here, or the troubles abroad. The view that bonds are attractive because inflation is largely conquered, but that strong recovery is still some way off, has become known as the Norwich Union view. It is still controversial, and vocally opposed by some equity houses; but more and more funds are beginning to restore some of the gilt weighting they used to carry before the inflationary disasters of the 1970s. Some institutions have bought gilts rather as half-believers go to church. They do not believe the full Norwich gospel but they feel it is as well to take out some insurance. And remember the running yield. There are two obstinate survivors of the recent conventional wisdom which prevent a full return to that of thirty years ago. The first, which could limit the rise in gilts, is the belief that real men don't buy bonds. They may rise, certainly; but anything which is good for bonds is so good for equities that gilts are for milksops. However, British institutional weightings in fixed interest securities are so low by world standards that there is plenty of room even for macho fund managers to move back a bit. The more threatening survivor is the belief that however bad things may look in Germany, the Bundesbank will get it right in the long run; while however good they look in Britain, the government of the day will mess it up. (It sometimes looks as if those who operate British monetary policy share this pessimistic creed - though happily not this weekend.) As long as this view lingers, it will be impossible for British short rates to fall below German rates without undermining the pound; and since Germany's problems look real and formidable, this is sad news for the depressed UK economy. The Bank of England now seems at least willing to test the market for ever-narrower sterling-D-Mark interest differentials. But the professional view in the money markets is that it will still take months, and possibly years, for foreign holders to accept the idea that if they want to hold a sound, stable currency like sterling rather than the risk-prone mark, they must be ready to lose some income.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Under the Dual Class System, each share in a Portfolio, regardless of class, will represent an interest in the Portfolio and will have identical voting rights, powers, qualifications, terms and conditions, and, in proportion to each Share's net asset value, liquidation rights and preferences. Each class will differ in that: (a) Each class will have a different class designation; (b) only the Service Shares will bear the expenses applicable to an Administrative Services Plan or Rule 12b&hyph;1 plan; (c) each class would bear certain other expenses that are directly attributable only to that class (``Class Expenses''), as set forth in condition 1; (d) classes will vote separately with respect to matters relating to the Fund's Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; and (e) the exchange privileges could vary among the classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The classes of shares of the Portfolios will differ with respect to exchange privileges among the Portfolios and the portfolios of certain other investment companies advised by the Adviser. All exchanges of shares will be effected in accordance with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Portfolio expenses (such as advisory fees) will be allocated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to each class on the basis of the relative net asset values of the respective classes. Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan payments, Administrative Plan payments, and Class Expenses which are attributable to a particular class of shares will be allocated to that particular class. As a result, the net income and net asset value per share of a class may be different than the new income and net asset value per share of another class of shares in the same Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) exempting them from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares representing interests in the same investment portfolio might be deemed: (1) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act in violation of section 18(f)(1); or (2) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement would permit the Trust to facilitate the distribution of its securities and enhance the scope and depth of its shareholder services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and the voting rights relating to the Administrative Services Plan or Rule 12b-1 Plan in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares of each Portfolio of the Trust will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Portfolio of the Trust, and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of the Trust will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate Administrative Services Plan payments, Rule 12b-1 Plan payments, and Class Expenses which will be limited to (i) transfer agent fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to the current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class; and (vii) trustees fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Portfolio's Rule 12b-1 Plan and Administrative Services Plan; (c) exchange features; and (d) class designation differences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of two classes of shares (the ``Dual Class System''). The minutes of the respective meetings of the trustees regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Dual Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination that the Dual Class System is in the best interests of both the Trust and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trust, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the two classes of shares. The trustees, including a majority of the non-interested trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited as adviser and Aquila Distributors, Inc. as distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the adviser and the distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Portfolio to meet class expenses shall provide to the trustees of the Trust, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: DTI is accused of favouring Revenue  -Investor Protection A SENIOR Tory backbencher last night used the case of a collapsed Wiltshire investment company to launch a strongly worded attack on the Department of Trade and Industry. Sir Charles Morrison, the MP for Devizes, who will stand down at the forthcoming election, said the DTI had failed to grasp the meaning of investor protection in the case of Selective Investment Brokers and urged the government to consider compensating investors. The Chippenham-based investment group went into liquidation in July 1988 owing investors Pounds 1.3m. Earlier this year Mr Anthony Wheeler, the sole director, was sentenced to four years in prison for fraudulent trading. The essence of Sir Charles' argument was that the DTI had been warned of irregularities well in advance of the liquidation but failed to act. He suggested this was because any action to wind up the company would have resulted in the Inland Revenue being reduced to the status of an unsecured creditor. The case showed what he termed an obvious degree of complicity on the DTI's part in an unhealthy and unauthorised relationship with the Inland Revenue. This had enabled the Inland Revenue to be 'preferred directly' at the expense of new investors in the company. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said he stood by a report from the parliamentary ombudsman which exonerated the DTI from any maladministration in the case.</p>

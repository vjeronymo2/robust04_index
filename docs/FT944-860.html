			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Now virtually executive Dennis Ohryn has moved from virtual manager (monthly transatlantic flights to attend board meetings) to the real world with his appointment as executive deputy chairman of Virtuality Group, one of a handful of UK-based companies making waves in the esoteric field of virtual reality. He has been a non-executive director of the company since 1993. It should not prove much of a a culture shock for the distinguished US computer professional. Now in his mid-50s, Ohryn has spent 30 years in international sales and marketing in the computer business. His career has included spells at Prime Computer and more recently at Sun Microsystems, market leader in workstations, where he was responsible for developing worldwide sales. Virtuality, on the other hand, is a tiny company, newly floated but with some prestigious contracts in the VR market including one with IBM. Ohryn is clearly someone with an eye for a likely winner. In his new role, he will help Virtuality develop its business in the US and Japanese markets while developing existing relationships with IBM and other product companies including Atari and Sega. Jon Waldern, Virtuality founder and chief executive, says the company is now doing more than half its business in the US and may open a California office. Ohryn's knowledge of the US high-tech scene will be invaluable, he says. Ray Ticer, 48, who has worked for Apple Computer since 1984, most recently as a consultant, but before that as financial controller in Latin America, has been appointed finance director. The current fd Mark Bernstein is resigning but will remain an adviser.</p>

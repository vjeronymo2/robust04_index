			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Krueger: Funding Earned Mostly by Microelectronics </F> Systems"]    [Text] BONN (dpa). It is now the opinion in Bonn  that the European JESSI Program, which has been plagued by birth  pangs, is finally on the right road to reinforcing the  participating European industries against Japanese and American  competition. In an interim report on the support program through  1996, the German Minister of Research, Paul Krueger, emphasized  that Germany's strengths lie in specialized areas of  microelectronics.    Chips alone do not create profits, but rather the systems in  which they are used, Krueger argues. Owing to a good mixture of  both large and medium-sized companies, Germany enjoys a high  potential in system engineering. The concurrent development of  systems and the chips used in them provides opportunities for  Germany industry.    Among the particular strengths of German industry, Krueger  named high-frequency analog technology, sensor development, and  applications-specific memory chips. The Federal Republic is weak  where solutions are sought in the market solely with available  processors and applications programs.    Besides Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Great  Britain, and the European Research Cooperative Venture Eureka  now participate in JESSI (the Joint European Submicron Silicon  Initiative). Funding to the amount of DM900 million, of which  half will be provided by industry and half by the various  governments and Brussels, will be available to the 140  participating enterprises in 1994.    The Ministry of German Research will provide DM 104 million.  The total volume of the world market for microelectronic  components in the year 2000 is estimated to be at about DM250  billion. In 1980, it was about DM24 billion.    Krueger considers the anti-blocking system (ABS), mobile  telephony, and digital radio transmission as examples of  successful applications of microelectronic developments.  Siemens's decision to establish a new microchip development and  production capability in Dresden signals a new initiative for  Germany and Europe.    The new 64-Mbit chip, which is being developed jointly with  America's IBM, will be produced in Dresden. This superchip,  which can store 6,000 DIN-A4 pages of text in an 11 x 18-mm  area, is one of the original priority goals of the JESSI Program.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Batten down for a bear to beware - The end of a 19-year bull market / In the Pink There is a widespread view, particularly among analysts in the US, that global equity markets have entered a bear market phase. Obviously, that conclusion is a consequence of the sell-off in markets that began early this year. Certainly, 1994 was a bear market year, although that hindsight observation is not particularly useful unless it provides insights as to what the future might hold. In this respect, it would be appropriate to consider the historical behaviour and functions of bear markets. A cursory glance at the price movements of the FT-30 share index since January 1975 would suggest that the 1994 sell-off in the UK equity market is no different from any of the other market declines seen over the duration of this 19-year-long bull market. In fact, it can be seen readily that the fall in share prices since the peak of the FT-SE index of 3,539.2, reached on February 3 this year, has been far less severe than a number of the market slides that have punctuated the long bull market. The most important observation is that the fall in share prices that began on February 3 1994 is distinctly different, in two major respects, from any of the market falls that took place since January 1975. The first is the duration of the sell-off. A bull market is characterised by rising peaks and troughs over the price cycle. Since February 1994, there has been a pattern of descending peaks and troughs for a longer period than that of any interruption experienced by the bull market since it began. Second, both institutional and private investors have, for most of the past 19 years, been more afraid of missing the next upswing than of exposure to a severe decline. In recent months, investors have been more scared of exposure to a serious decline than missing the next upswing. All financial markets have a tendency to over-shoot historic valuation levels. The function of a bear market is to correct the excesses in the over-shoot occurring during the bull market, restoring values ultimately to an historic equilibrium. The number of index points and the time it takes to restore proximity to a valuation equilibrium - plus an under-valuation 'over-shoot' - determines the duration and amplitude of any subsequent bear market. The duration normally is related to the duration of the bull market, the excesses of which it is acting to correct. Likewise, the amplitude usually is related to the amount of ground covered during the the previous bull market which led to excessive over-valuations. Historically, bear markets tend to correct one to two thirds of the gains made during the previous bull market. When a bull market becomes a 'bubble market' - as happened to the Japanese and Hong Kong equity markets, plus several newly-emerging markets - a bear market reduction of around 80 to 90 per cent of the peak values achieved by these markets has become the historical norm. Over the past 19 years, investors have had one of the longest and strongest bull markets in stock exchange history. Empirical evidence suggests it would not be unreasonable to expect the bear market that began in February 1994 to be one of the longest and deepest ever experienced. (The longest and deepest known in the UK so far was that between May l972 and January 1976 which slashed more than 73 per cent from the value of the FT-30). During the course of the bear market, investors will be tempted to look to foreign markets - where bear market conditions may not appear to prevail - for better investment opportunities. But I believe this could be fruitless. Bear markets in the US, UK, Germany, Italy, France and other countries are likely to trace a pattern of commonality that is more pronounced than usual due to the Dollars 12,000bn derivatives market, where we find the tail wagging the dog of the cash market. Several studies have noted that even though derivatives themselves may not be a source of systemic risk, it is likely that they have increased the integration of global markets, acting to transmit a shock that occurs in one area to other markets and institutions. Those who subscribe to my analysis will no doubt be in a quandary as to where they should invest. The most logical choice for inveterate equity investors during a bear market are the counter-cyclical groups. During previous bear markets, the counter-cyclical groups have been the entertainment industry, foods, wines, spirits, tobaccos and Australian mining shares. During the 1972-1975 bear markets, the counter-cyclical group was the gold mining sector. During this bear market, I believe it will be the biotechnology industry. For those who are not inveterate equity investors, bond markets look extremely tempting. It might come as a surprise, but they are not linked inextricably to equity markets. The biggest bull run in bond markets was in the US during the 1930s' depression. Yields in the UK have been over 8 per cent. At 8 per cent compound interest, the investor doubles his money every nine years and is exposed to virtually no risk if the plan is to purchase at, or below, par and hold government bonds to maturity. In the real world of investment, very few investors double their money every nine years with any consistency. Investment profits are a lot like sex: a lot of people think there is an awful lot of it going around and somebody, somewhere, is getting a share that they should be getting. The truth is that there isn't that much going around and nobody is really getting much of a share at all.

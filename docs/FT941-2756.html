			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (25): The electoral wheel turns full circle  -Anthony Robinson analyses the extraordinary turnaround in the thinking of former communists 'Poland's fate for so long was to be in the slipstream of history, lagging behind developments elsewhere. But the 'round-table' talks of 1989, which led to the first post-communist government in eastern Europe, and the economic reforms introduced by Leszek Balcerowicz (finance minister) in 1990 put Poland in the vanguard of history. We have to build on these achievements and move forward.' The words of Alexander Kwasniewski, the former communist turned social democrat who is now the driving force behind the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), Poland's largest political party, reflect an extraordinary turnaround in Polish politics. Five years ago Mr Kwasniewski was one of the communist party's top negotiators, seeking to entrench communist power through a compromise with Lech Walesa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Adam Michnik, Bronislaw Geremek and other Solidarity movement leaders. The outcome of these round-table talks was a deal which ended the communists' post-war monopoly of power, but limited non-communist parties to only 35 per cent of seats in the lower house of the Polish parliament, the Sejm. Both sides failed to foresee that given the first chance in more than half a century to vent their spleen, voters would give Solidarity an overwhelming moral victory by sweeping its candidates into each of the allotted 35 per cent of Sejm seats and all the 100 freely-elected senate seats. As a result, by autumn 1989, Poland had the first non-communist government in the former Soviet bloc. On January 1, 1990, Leszek Balcerowicz, the new government's ascetic finance minister, devalued the zloty and made it internally convertible. He also swept away a raft of communist-style consumer and producer subsidies and launched Poland on a brave and unprecedented experiment in liberal, free market economics. Those reforms opened up entirely new perspectives for the development of Polish society and the Polish economy. But Solidarity proved inept at selling its achievements or in softening the impact of reforms on the unemployed and on millions of workers for whom the market economy translated into harder work, lower wages, social insecurity, a fast growing gap between rich and poor and rising crime. At last September's general elections the electoral wheel came full circle. Voters swept the former communists of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) into first place with 171 seats in the 460-seat Sejm, followed by the Peasants Party (PSL) with 131 seats. The Democratic Union (UD), the mainstream Solidarity party, limped in third with 74 seats followed by the intellectual left-wing Solidarity-linked Union of Labour (UP). The votes of over 30 per cent of the electorate were neutralised by new electoral rules which introduced a 5 per cent minimum threshold for entry into the new parliament. A raft of right-wing and church-linked Christian parties failed to jump this hurdle. Only the right-wing nationalist Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) with 21 seats and President Walesa's so-called non-party reform movement (BBWR) with 16 seats, scraped into the new Sejm. Significantly, in his first important post-election speech Mr Kwasniewski, leader of the main social democratic faction of the SLD, publicly apologised to Poles for the misdeeds of the 45-year, post-war communist regime. He openly acknowledged the achievements of the Solidarity-based governments as gains for Polish society as a whole. To sceptics, Mr Kwasniewski's magnanimity in victory was the mark of a cynical apparatchik. To others it looked like the gesture of a smart and far-sighted politician laying the groundwork for a future alliance with the intellectual and moral leaders of Solidarity. Such a 'historic compromise' is not yet on the political horizon, although both the SLD and the PSL toyed with such a hypothesis before reluctantly concluding that the post-electoral political arithmetic left little alternative but to form an SLD-PSL coalition government. Numerically the government, which is presided over by the peasant party leader, 34-year-old Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, is strongly based. It controls over two-thirds of the seats in parliament and has the power to draft a new constitution. In theory, it could last out a full parliamentary term, unlike all previous post-communist governments which fell after a few months in power. Legislation now passes the once fractious parliament virtually on the nod, a big change from the endless debates followed by cliff-hanging votes which characterised previous parliaments. But the two partners make an odd couple. The government looks like a miserable marriage of convenience, with little love or mutual respect between its two very different political components. The thinly disguised internal tensions burst into the open in January when the prime minister summarily dismissed Mr Stefan Kowalec, the deputy-finance minister. He was held responsible for the embarrassing 'success' of the flotation of Bank Slaski, whose shares soared up to 13 times their issue price at their debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The 'scandal' deepened when it emerged that few, aside from lucky bank employees, had been able to register their shares in time to actually sell them at the initial high price. Unconfirmed rumours swept town of a 'swindlers' list' of politicians and others who had been able to buy and dispose of shares at favourable rates. With hindsight the shares were sold too cheaply and listed prematurely. But that did not seem the case during the long and difficult months when the privatisation authorities were desperately seeking a foreign bank to buy a minority share and were unsure of the public's appetite for bank shares. Mr Kowalec, a technocrat brought in by Mr Balcerowicz back in 1989, was slated to become the fall man for the mistake. But the expectation was that he would be sacked by Mr Marek Borowski, the SLD finance minister, not the prime minister. The affair rapidly became a power struggle between the prime minister and Mr Kwasniewski who holds no ministerial post but is widely perceived as the real power behind the throne. The culmination came when Mr Borowski sought both to re-affirm his control over the appointment of his deputy and concentrate economic decision-making generally in his hands. He offered to resign if his demands were not met. Mr Pawlak, whose main aim was to underline that he was de facto as well as de jure head of the government, called his bluff and Mr Borowski resigned. The shock move badly wrong-footed Mr Kwasniewski who hitherto had treated Mr Pawlak as a political lightweight. It also cast new light on the role played by Mr Michal Strak, the deceptively relaxed and jovial head of the cabinet office who is the main strategist behind the PSL. 'After the elections there was a widespread perception that Poland had a one-party government again. That was wrong. But now people talk of irreconcilable differences between the government partners and that's not true either,' says Mr Strak. 'There is no alternative to this coalition and that creates a framework for the government to carry on,' he adds. Mr Strak is adamant that the prime minister, who is popular among his farming and small-town constituents but looked down upon as an inarticulate bumpkin by political salon Warsaw, will continue to use his premiership to lead the government. Mr Pawlak's own priority is to ensure that government policies favourably impact on his party's rural constituents. 'It is better to provide farmers with Dollars 50 of cheap credit than throw them off the land and have to find Dollars 500 for unemployment pay,' he says. 'With 15 per cent of Poles already unemployed we have to encourage those who are working and maintaining their families,' he adds. For a government with such a clear parliamentary majority its peasant party component has curiously unambitious long-term plans. 'Previous governments were reformist governments. We don't consider ourselves as reformers. Our task is to deal with problems as they arise and above all to make the machinery of government more efficient,' says Mr Strak. The idea of modest government is attractive to many after the turmoil of the last five years, particularly if a period of calm permits the further development of civil society, a stronger role for local governments and the sort of prosperity which allows the development of a stable middle class. But there are several clouds on the horizon, including the shift back to authoritarian nationalism in Russia, a looming parliamentary conflict over the proposed Concordat with the Vatican and the presidential elections scheduled for 1995. The latter is already casting a shadow over contemporary politics as President Lech Walesa manoeuvres for support after coming to the conclusion that his main potential rival is none other than Mr Kwasniewski himself.</p>

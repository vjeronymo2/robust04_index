			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Waffling President Clinton </F> Believes That Animal Rights Must Assume Precedence Over Human  Rights"]    [Text] Nowadays, the waffling President Clinton seems  careful to provide additional proof of his lack of balance, his  lack of discrimination, and his lack of cognitive potential.  For only yesterday, he threatened to impose economic sanctions  on the PRC, which is currently enjoying most favored nation  status. The reason is not the PRC's rejection of U.S.  conditions, foremost among which is accepting the U.S. concept  of human rights. We would like to say it again that Clinton's  threats against the PRC were prompted neither by human rights  issues, nor by the PRC position that the new Korean crisis  created by the United States should be resolved peacefully.    What then could be the reason? This time, Clinton seeks to  reaffirm that he has departed from the realm of common sense and  entered the realm of the irrational. He has threatened the PRC,  saying that it will be subjected to economic sanctions if does  not halt its extermination of a certain species of tigers. Just  imagine the waffling president, heir of criminal George Bush,  seeking to impose economic sanctions on the PRC just to preserve  Chinese tigers that are threatened with extinction.    The waffling President Clinton has become too blind to see  his own lack of common sense and good reasoning. Nonetheless,  when the survival of Chinese tigers is at stake, he too becomes  vulnerable. He becomes willing to launch an economic war against  China. By contrast, he is unwilling to halt the massacres he  helped unleash in Iraq, Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  former Soviet republics, and elsewhere, in which scores and  hundreds of people are killed every day. The reason is that the  United States seeks to colonize the world after it has caused  catastrophes, tragedies, genocides, and the rape of hundreds of  thousands of women.    Have you ever heard of such nonsense? We have seen a  semblance of waffling President Clinton's kind-heartedness on  the face of his envoy Rolf Ekeus when he wept as skillfully as  an actor, and then wiped his tears so he could proceed with his  work, which is justifying the cold-blooded and heartless  genocide targeting Iraqis.    Has humanity ever stooped so low? Have we ever seen a  hypocrite, a liar, and a double-faced man as waffling President  Clinton, who is defending animal rights while butchering and  torturing thousands of people every day?</p>
